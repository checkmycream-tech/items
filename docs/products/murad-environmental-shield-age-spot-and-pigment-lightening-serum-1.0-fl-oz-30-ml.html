            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>but this one....was quite amazing...</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Works amazing for spot and Sun damage.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing on age spots on my face.</li>
            <li>The spots on my forehead have almost disappeared and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice glow</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve never used that word in conjunction with my own face.)</li>
            <li>I am now spot treating each sun spot as my skin tone is a nice even tone now, but my sun spots are still there, albeit a lighter color.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had spontaneous compliments on my complexion too.</li>
            <li>i have a really nice skin, never had any problems.  </li>
            <li>There are many good products in the market.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face and decollete area had become so sun damaged from years of loving the beach.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely</li>
            <li>Honestly I put it in a drawer and forgot about it until about 3 weeks ago when I noticed my spots were getting darker</li>
            <li>However, honestly, I would not recommend it, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>It also lasts a significant amount of time!!</li>
            <li>It also lasts a significant amount of time!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very impressed and recommend this highly.  </li>
            <li>Also the smell is very very strong...</li>
            <li>It is important to apply a good moisturer with sunscreen when you go out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a week so far, and I am highly impressed.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, it makes my skin soft and almost flawless.  </li>
            <li>which has been the best for me so far.</li>
            <li>This by far has worked the best.  </li>
            <li>I am almost sixty and have tried many age spot removal creams; this one works by far the best...</li>
            <li>Works great, Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>not bad, it doesn&#x27;t smell good...</li>
            <li>Got this in the mail so quickly!!</li>
            <li>It made my age/brown spot very light.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to finish up the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t order more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely satisfied that I went with this product.</li>
            <li>This product worked better than all of them.</li>
            <li>Will have to give it more time.</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;spots are fading, but I am looking forward to getting even better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many I have tried and they do not work, A couple of them is Garnier skin&lt;</li>
            <li>I am considering purchasing more from Murad in order to have consistency in my product use.</li>
            <li>a couple of days before I noticed how much better my skin felt.</li>
            <li>I am not as pleased with the Shield Age Spot product.  </li>
            <li>The Murad website stated that this product was guaranteed and with the price I thought I would be more satisfied</li>
            <li>I have the larger bottle and LOVE it; this is for travel only; awesome, awesome product!  </li>
            <li>I have used another brand that was cheaper that did a much better job.</li>
            <li>I liked this since this wasn&#x27;t sticky but just fit on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any results and have been using it for more than 3 weeks</li>
            <li>the more I use it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 years now and am really happy to be able to get it so much cheaper on line.</li>
            <li>I have never had any issues and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>- - I looked all over the Internet and this was the most discounted price for the product.  </li>
            <li>My face look 100% better than it did three weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>face look so much better.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to use this product - love the Murad line.</li>
            <li>I love washing my face now because I SEE and FEEL a difference.  </li>
            <li>Also I made sure to put on suncreen every day too like they suggested.    </li>
            <li>With continued use I&#x27;m sure it will disappear.</li>
            <li>it is still one of mine/mom favorite products.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Rapid Age Spot serum in the hopes of removing a couple of prominent spots from my hand and face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t go for 4%.  </li>
            <li>Even if spots don&#x27;t lighten much more, I&#x27;m way better off than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love that I can get it from Amazon in 2 days</li>
            <li>2 for better moisturization.  </li>
            <li>not so sure about this product as it tends to create a sticky film that rubs off if I apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>have been using it for more than two weeks now.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>Initially concerned about the hydroquinone presence but was very impressed with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every night love it</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product.</li>
            <li>I expect it to fade the spots more.</li>
            <li>Hoping it fades more.</li>
            <li>I use it at at night all over my face, neck, and declate, but make sure to use a sph in the morning always.</li>
            <li>Used with a facial cleansing scrubber is best.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it here.</li>
            <li>I think it has prevented more and has lightened the ones I have quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I love the murad product line and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>This product was okay.  </li>
            <li>also made my scores better on the sun damage and uv damage.  </li>
            <li>but after I finish the bottle, I can review better.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and it actually works.</li>
            <li>i have used this product for almost 5 months now and I love it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it and since it&#x27;s not tested on animals, I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love murad products (resurgence is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used for looking younger)</li>
            <li>Yet, I still deal with so many skin problems.</li>
            <li>top it all</li>
            <li>This was a first time order and it seems to be working fairly well.</li>
            <li>worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I have read incredible reviews on this product for months and finally decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the fast change in the age spots!</li>
            <li>So far this product has work great.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and smells ok - just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I began to wonder why some people are blessed with great skin that is natural and they STILL wear makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of sticky, but it&#x27;s worth the $$</li>
            <li>And it will last you a good amount of time!</li>
            <li>Hands don&#x27;t do that great of a job, contrary to what many commercial advertise.</li>
            <li>I did try it on my neck and chest, but it was too strong.  </li>
            <li>Pretty amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers theee best prices for Murad products even though I believe it is still high.</li>
            <li>I am just now seeing the first undesirable effects of \\&quot;having the best tan on the block\\&quot; back in the day and wanted to find something that had proven results.</li>
            <li>Love it, got here quick and it works work.</li>
            <li>It took possibly 3 bottles to start to see the results , my skin is much more even toned, beautiful, I will continue using it as my complexion has improved very much .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li>I am too cheap to use it</li>
            <li>but from this experience, I&#x27;m going to continue with just the cheekbones and enjoy the change.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, 3rd purchase.</li>
            <li>quite light mind</li>
            <li>I have a sprinkle of light freckles across my nose and cheeks</li>
            <li>This is a great product that noticeably eliminates spots and visible signs of aging after just several uses.</li>
            <li>Its soft, bright, the age spots are disappearing - gone,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing &amp; really balances out the pigment in your skin.</li>
            <li>Fabulous, you just have stick with</li>
            <li>I use this product for my hands and it did work my brown spot got light it</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is very effective, you can see the lightening affect after several days.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin a bit dry so make sure to use in conjunction with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Ever day it&#x27;s closer to the Original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products, and this one is so good, they may as well just disappear from the market!</li>
            <li>This Product is the first one that work well for me, and I have used many product on my face.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this out to get rid of brownish discoloration on my face.</li>
            <li>I Originally started using it when i was given a sample at Sephora</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many products and I can honestly say this is the only product I have found that has truly worked on my skin.</li>
            <li>I found that it is a combination of the product and the instrument used to clean your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m such a happy camper right now.  </li>
            <li>purchased my first bottle from a department store and was so happy to find it on Amazon for such a&lt;br /&gt;great price.</li>
            <li>But after the price was so much, I decided to try just my cheekbones, where I have the most problems with spots.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of marks from old breakouts nicely.</li>
            <li>Estée Lauder makes a good concealer, double wear.  </li>
            <li>I have overall good skin but have acne scars/ sunspots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Really, the difference is astonishing.</li>
            <li>but I prayed they were true.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this product doesn&#x27;t get a full 5-star review.  </li>
            <li>I was really expecting better results than this by now.</li>
            <li>So as far as Murad, liked, loved it, but I&#x27;m always on to try the next thing</li>
            <li>The smell is also pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>I will use only because lighter age spots are better, but wish it lightened them more.</li>
            <li>I  saw  quick results.  </li>
            <li>It also prevents pimples  from  becoming  dark  on  my fair African-American complexion.</li>
            <li>I have never used this type of hydroquinone based product and so far I have had good results, but it is very gradual for me.</li>
            <li>However, i do not believe it is worthy to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>If you are pregnant or breast feeding, you should Not use this.  </li>
            <li>Not a product to use occasionally ,must use daily for best results.</li>
            <li>The product came as described and was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have pigmentation from being pregnant and for years have tried everything.</li>
            <li>So on a scale of one to ten, ten being THE Best</li>
            <li>If you are debating between other products and Murad, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t find a better product for a better deal!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to stay out of the sun or use a high SPF over it during the day.</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of other &amp;#34;dark spot&amp;#34; lighteners and this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>Great for dark spots.</li>
            <li>Even if the spots aren&#x27;t completely gone by that time, I will be very pleased that they have lightened so much.</li>
            <li>I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to beauty products, especially if they cost more than 7 or 8 bucks!</li>
            <li>This product delivered fast results!!</li>
            <li>You MUST use SPF (30 or higher) with this product!</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised!</li>
            <li>It smells so funny!  </li>
            <li>Ointment is preferable to cream and is more easily  localized to where you want it to go rather than being spread over a larger area.  </li>
            <li>I need less makeup now and its looks better on my skin!!</li>
            <li>Also, this product worked on my fine lines so as an added value I look younger :).</li>
            <li>I feel that when you find a great product that solved a particular problem you&#x27;ve dealed with for a long time..it deserved to be told so it can help others..</li>
            <li>Out of all the facial spot removers I have tried this shows  the most promise and quickly!</li>
            <li>I just have to make sure to use a wash cloth with warm water when i wash my face and that removes all the dead cells released by the product leaving my skin tone and texture pretty even!</li>
            <li>rather than it being smooth and absorbing into my skin it just sits on my skin and clumps up.  </li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Either way it was worth the money just for the improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and tone.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li>A rare exemple of honesty.</li>
            <li>It worth not your money.</li>
            <li>I followed directions exactly for the full bottle and did not experience any lightening of age spots or skin.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Works great at first on dark age spots that are closer to the surface.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair and sensitive skin with frequent skin problems.</li>
            <li>I saw mild results after a couple weeks but it is very very gradual.      </li>
            <li>Right now I am trying something else.</li>
            <li>I have used this product more than a week and although my dark spots are not gone, I can tell that they are getting better.  </li>
            <li>If you are debating between other products and Murad, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t find a better product for a better deal!&#x27;t going to change your life or your skin completely.</li>
            <li>Superior dark spot lighting product.  </li>
            <li>I must admit, it really works...and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this works for me fine.  </li>
            <li>Granted, it could be because it&#x27;s 2 years old, but it&#x27;s sat in a dark drawer in the original packaging and it doesn&#x27;t say anything about an expiration date, so I&#x27;m thinking the stuff just isn&#x27;t that good.  </li>
            <li>My wife found out about this product and just used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product probably for about 2 months now, but I would say that I saw results after the first week.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>so evidently I am having an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>First, it took almost two weeks for the package to arrive.     </li>
            <li>I tried to use concealer, but it just looked just looked even more obvious to me!</li>
            <li>However, after the many cautions concerning extended timeframe to see results, I was truly amazed after only 1 or 2 applications.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it promises...never ordered a product from trying a sample...</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m still waiting for the one or two larger spots to lighten, I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used any Murad products before, but I will definitely buy more now.</li>
            <li>The IPL was only 50 more dollars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products (also tried the derma rollers &amp;#34;needling&amp;#34;)  to get rid of the spots and finally opted for a &amp;#34;medium TCA peel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>okay have not seen a big differents</li>
            <li>IT REALLY  WORKS!  </li>
            <li>I even look pretty without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and starting to get those lovely age/hormone spots.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 5 months now and have been using it consistently every night.</li>
            <li>I made sure to put it on at night only and not in the daytime as they said not to.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for age and sun spots!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first thing that has worked.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for many months (2 times daily) and did not notice any changes.</li>
            <li>The product is clear like a serium and light on the face.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews</li>
            <li>I recommend the product to someone who is willing to be patient and  not to expect to get results over night.  </li>
            <li>I love Murad and I only purchase my products from Mass Beauty!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get that reaction with continuous use, just after the first couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointing!</li>
            <li>Use this often and it is the best thing I have found but it is expensive.  </li>
            <li>I have been an avid sunscreen user since my problems came up</li>
            <li>I periodically go back and do find my scores have been getting better.  </li>
            <li>For this much money (and I paid $50) it should kick @ss!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with a few tan spots on one cheek.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about the products I buy for my skin - always looking for new ones and reading up on what&#x27;s the new healthy trend for them.</li>
            <li>Not only worked on my dark spots that now are way much better, but also my face has this unique glow and the tone is more even.</li>
            <li>This is the only lightening product that I have used that really works, use daily for a month and see significant results, Love it!</li>
            <li>amazing product to remove the dark spots , I had been using this products for almost 2 weeks and my dark spots are very light now!</li>
            <li>Apparently it works great for some people according to the reviews, but I am 60 years old and some age spots or sun damage began to appear on my face within the last 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Depending on how much you put on and use; initially I put it on generously on my cheeks and it helps even skin tone and sun spots to be a more uniform and lighter color.  </li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned African American, who has been using the product for two to three weeks.  </li>
            <li>As an adult pregnant with my first child I got the &amp;#34;pregnancy mask&amp;#34; that faded after I gave birth.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you are in it for the long haul if you purchase.  </li>
            <li>I actually first bought just a Murad sample kit from Sephora, not wanting to spend too much money if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This product has also greatly diminished a dark spot that I had on my upper cheek.</li>
            <li>However, the product isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; absorbs quickly so you can apply moisturizer directly after.</li>
            <li>- I can certainly see a change in my pigment.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this product because I&#x27;m sure it works better on newer age spots and dark marks.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it to see ultimate results quickly!</li>
            <li>Not only does it lighten brown spots rapidly, but it also leaves my skin very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I expected more reduction.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>though much slower that I had anticipated or hoped.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for under my eyes, but I found it really dries that area out.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do that, even though my cheekbones are very close to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I focus the treatment on the sunspot, but I also have been using it on my whole face to improve the eveness of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my face.</li>
            <li>Heard and read so much about it</li>
            <li>I really like Murad products but this pigment lightening serum</li>
            <li>it works very well.  </li>
            <li>this productark spots are much lighter.</li>
            <li>It is a real result against a promise.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say they faded &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34; but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>fast  </li>
            <li>Have to say this is very well priced</li>
            <li>The product smells like alcohol and very sticky.</li>
            <li>This faded them really well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps some people it will be fast and some</li>
            <li>But for me, it does work very gradually.</li>
            <li>I used this religiously for three months and saw no difference, even though my spots are relatively light.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this stuff really dries my skin out.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything except make your eyes water (even when not close to your eyes)...</li>
            <li>Very noticeable improvement in just a matter of a week to 10 days.  </li>
            <li>It works for my skin, and I have very troublesome olive Mediterranean skin that is prone to hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff works for real.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in her face</li>
            <li>My dermatologist told me that it was just really one of the hardest things to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noticeable and makeup doesn&#x27;t cover it.  </li>
            <li>white/fair skinned, 34, have lived in CO my whole life and have gotten LOTS of sun and burns.  </li>
            <li>I used the whole Murad environmental defense line - every product they have.  </li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t see much fading of my age spots.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so I purchased the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s faded out most of my sun spots and has helped a red scar fade almost completely.  </li>
            <li>I began considering age spot removal when sun spots (kinder phrase than \\&quot;age spots\\&quot;) were growing more visible on my upper cheeks as I enter my early 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on skin, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I have also been using exfoliants and my favorite so far is St. Ives the standard scrub.</li>
            <li>Within days I could see my old acne marks leaving right before my eyes.</li>
            <li>That is more than I have attained by using other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many other products including the Clinique that is advertised everywhere, and nothing has made a difference.  </li>
            <li>I did not use this in conjunction with the other Murad vitamin C product that they recommended; I will start using that this month in conjunction with this product in hopes of getting even better results.    </li>
            <li>I wanted it to work, but like so many other products, it did not.</li>
            <li>And it most definitely makes you more sensitive to sun, do not leave the house without sunblock or a hat, even if it&#x27;s just a few a minutes.</li>
            <li>Most  of  my  dark spots  are  gone</li>
            <li>This product does not take away post acne marks, maybe it will work better for someone with dark spots instead.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product definitely worked for me, but is very gradual, but I am somewhat concerned about the side-effects I hear about hydroquinone, so I plan to stop using after another month or so just to be safe.</li>
            <li>So did the Clinique even better dark spot corrector when used in conjunction with their repair ware laser focus UV damage correcting serum.  </li>
            <li>I do like the texture of the serum, and the age spots may have faded slightly, but they are still noticeable even after being more than halfway through the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The spot is half gone and to the point where foundation mostly covers it.  </li>
            <li>One of my main staples in my skin care regime.  </li>
            <li>most of the spots on my face have completely faded and the really dark ones are significantly lighter and smaller.</li>
            <li>My dark spots are definately lighter and my skin tone overall looks more even and fresh.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would buy this product again and would highly recommend it for those wanting to fade age spots.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, I felt very self conscious.</li>
            <li>and I am not forced into an auto ship program through Murad&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference so far</li>
            <li>, I would rate this a two based on my first 3 weeks, and my affection for Murad in general.  </li>
            <li>I do not spend a lot of $ on skincare normally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try this out for a few more months and see what happens- still optimistic.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s made a difference for the three age spots I have on my right cheek.</li>
            <li>Get with a Murad dealer such as Massage Envy and let someone pick the right product for you.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still using both and ordering a new bottle of Murad today.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good reviews, but I think if I put this all over my face it would dry me out and make me raw.</li>
            <li>the product is serious and effective.</li>
            <li>I just bought a full bottle, THEN did my research (I do things backward sometimes) and learned the main ingredient in this Murad product is a substance that is BANNED in other countries, called hydroquinone.</li>
            <li>but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>About 5 days after starting to use Murad my skin had visibly improved SO much!</li>
            <li>It looked smoother, and WOW, radiant!</li>
            <li>just recently i noticed that my eyes sting after i apply the serum, at first i thought its because it was applied too closely to my eyes, then i started just using it on my cheeks, not on my nose that is close to my eye, it still stings.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d hit gold with this since Murad&#x27;s other products work so wonderfully but unfortunately</li>
            <li>This is the first product I used that I actually got results!  </li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;m 50, white, medium tone skin, some freckles.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I tried the MURAD AGE SPOT AND PIGMENT LIGHTENING GEL for a full three months (entire bottle), following the directions each night...</li>
            <li>This was kind of expensive item for me to purchase and the first time for me to try serums to help with blemishes.</li>
            <li>My dark spots are significantly lighter in just a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Honestly,  I think there was a slight reduction,  but definitely not much</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would help because I love Murad, but it has only slightly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only stuff I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve ever seen results with, especially that quickly and dramatically&lt;</li>
            <li>Fully intended to purchase the full size but was diverted by another product on Amazon that apparently worked particularly well with my skin coloring (dark olive)&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I used it again as directed and again noticed a huge difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>cheek spots are clearly lighter and continuing to fade.  </li>
            <li>and my complection is completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I started using it mid-July, it is now end of Sept, and spots have considerably faded.  </li>
            <li>I never considered my skin sensitive</li>
            <li>The manufacturer uses three months as the guideline for stopping use of the product, but nearly all the reviews I read (on Sephora) indicated that an improvement was noticed faster than that.</li>
            <li>Within days, I saw results, and its almost faded to my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>I would not waste the money.</li>
            <li>So far it is doing what I would like, but has a way to go.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely sold on murad now.</li>
            <li>since they&#x27;re not all that noticeable to begin with i thought this serum will completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li>By doing this I&#x27;ve noticed an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li>I did lighten age spots but did not take them completely away.</li>
            <li>and I believe it is old or damaged..</li>
            <li>So far, the sun damage spots are getting lighter and lighter.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li>They do lighten up your spots but don&#x27;t expect them to disappear completely.  </li>
            <li>But so far, no discernible results.</li>
            <li>Go to a board certified dermatologist and get the brown spots removed professionally.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make them completely fade.</li>
            <li>Just waiting on the this to continue use to see if it will disappear completely.</li>
            <li>I developed chloasma after having my kids and some faded</li>
            <li>Too early for that.</li>
            <li>absolutely nothing, zero, nil , nada happened, not even a tiny tingle.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a considerable difference</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use sunblock, but I don&#x27;t go outside much.  </li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t going to change your life or your skin completely.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money .</li>
            <li>So far, no age spots to speak of.  </li>
            <li>It is sort of scary that it works this good, as I wonder what the chemicals are that can create this change.</li>
            <li>Really good product but much on the internet about it being dangerous to use.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used other Murad products before and they&#x27;re pretty decent.</li>
            <li>This wonderful product quickly did away with the dark circles under my eyes, as well as a birthmark I&#x27;ve always found annoying.  </li>
            <li>i found a full size one for half the price.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it for long, but really like it so far</li>
            <li>I found that I had quick results fading the dark spots to barely being noticeable!</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to work any better than the other things I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>The only draw back is that the smell  of the treatment is not very nice, but it dissipates quickly once absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it with a high SPF sunscreen to avoid discoloration from coming back from getting sun.</li>
            <li>my blood will revert back to normal.  </li>
            <li>above, it did suggest that it be used with a second product, and perhaps that would make a difference, but I am not going to waste any more money myself trying to find out.</li>
            <li>Once I got pregnant, I got a lot of little clusters all around my checks and forehead.</li>
            <li>After seeing my mom being down for the longest time because of the brown spots, I did some research and came across this powerful gel.</li>
            <li>Not bad after using a product for less than two weeks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Really works at noticeably fading age spots and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It, lots of red pigmentations , covered my whole face especially on my cheek bones.  </li>
            <li>but ultimately it did not work fast enough for me</li>
            <li>Since November 2010, I&#x27;ve been using Murad&#x27;s Post acne gel, which is pretty much the same as this product (give or take a little ingredients here and</li>
            <li>The next morning when I saw my face, wow!  </li>
            <li>Yes, more expensive than some, but this is the first one of this type that actually delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; Dark brown patches began to fade to pink very quickly.</li>
            <li>The age spots did not go away right away, but three weeks after, they are certainly less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I used this for a while​ before I knew there were other products available, it didn&#x27;t work as I expected and with shelling out sixty dollars ever so often</li>
            <li>I have a couple of age spots on my face that are not very dark</li>
            <li>First of all, I have dark spots all over face for years of sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I am surprised this actually works.</li>
            <li>it has almost completely removed  facial age spots that I have been working on for years!  </li>
            <li>Third day using this and Nothing so far.</li>
            <li>I had a sunspot on my upper eyelid that is now completely gone and</li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old Caucasian woman with moderate age spots on my face and hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and it has reduced some red areas on my face, but they are far from gone.  </li>
            <li>I have used it faithfully and it has definitely helped, but has never eliminated the spots completely.  </li>
            <li>I am confident that within a few months the dark spots that my acne cause will be gone.</li>
            <li>Disappointing after reading many positive reviews and purchased on the quality of the Murad name.</li>
            <li>I think this was a complete waste of money and certainly cannot recommend it</li>
            <li>I have certainly seen an improvement and lightening of the dark age spots I have on my face.</li>
            <li>Have been using this serum on and off for a few months and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>This serum on the other hand, was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>I developed what looked like nose freckles due to Sun exposure and it had taken them away almost completely.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it states, diminishes uneven skin tone</li>
            <li>and I saw results in the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>i used the product two or three times a day for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>With my second child, it unfortunately did not fade and I was left with what looked like my freckles just kind of exploded and joined together on my face.  </li>
            <li>It literally started working and lightening my spots within the first few days.  </li>
            <li>I used it only my both arms, little does change but it has to be consistently.  </li>
            <li>However, this product significantly faded them and with a little make-up made them a lot less apparent.</li>
            <li>I tried a few products that were supposed to fade sun spots, but the Murad product was the first that actually worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Now I use it all year round and combined with sunscreen, I no longer have the large brown patches on the sides of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It is a little noticeable, but I think people would have to be really paying attention to see it.</li>
            <li>Did lighten spot on my face a little bit but not as much as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>No more hiding from the cameras!!! :)</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for dark acne blemishes that I&#x27;ve had since high school.</li>

            <li> This is an awesome product, even if you change nothing else in your routine.</li>
            <li> I splurged and bought this and the eye cream (also awesome)</li>

            <li> :)  Hope this helps someone!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> but this one....was quite amazing...</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Works amazing for spot and Sun damage.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing on age spots on my face.</li>
            <li> The spots on my forehead have almost disappeared and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice glow</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve never used that word in conjunction with my own face.)</li>
            <li> I am now spot treating each sun spot as my skin tone is a nice even tone now, but my sun spots are still there, albeit a lighter color.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had spontaneous compliments on my complexion too.</li>
            <li> i have a really nice skin, never had any problems.  </li>
            <li> There are many good products in the market.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face and decollete area had become so sun damaged from years of loving the beach.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely</li>
            <li> Honestly I put it in a drawer and forgot about it until about 3 weeks ago when I noticed my spots were getting darker</li>
            <li> However, honestly, I would not recommend it, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts a significant amount of time!!</li>
            <li> It also lasts a significant amount of time!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very impressed and recommend this highly.  </li>
            <li> Also the smell is very very strong...</li>
            <li> It is important to apply a good moisturer with sunscreen when you go out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a week so far, and I am highly impressed.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, it makes my skin soft and almost flawless.  </li>
            <li> which has been the best for me so far.</li>
            <li> This by far has worked the best.  </li>
            <li> I am almost sixty and have tried many age spot removal creams; this one works by far the best...</li>
            <li> Works great, Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> not bad, it doesn&#x27;t smell good...</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail so quickly!!</li>
            <li> It made my age/brown spot very light.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to finish up the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely satisfied that I went with this product.</li>
            <li> This product worked better than all of them.</li>
            <li> Will have to give it more time.</li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;spots are fading, but I am looking forward to getting even better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many I have tried and they do not work, A couple of them is Garnier skin&lt;</li>
            <li> I am considering purchasing more from Murad in order to have consistency in my product use.</li>
            <li> a couple of days before I noticed how much better my skin felt.</li>
            <li> I am not as pleased with the Shield Age Spot product.  </li>
            <li> The Murad website stated that this product was guaranteed and with the price I thought I would be more satisfied</li>
            <li> I have the larger bottle and LOVE it; this is for travel only; awesome, awesome product!  </li>
            <li> I have used another brand that was cheaper that did a much better job.</li>
            <li> I liked this since this wasn&#x27;t sticky but just fit on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results and have been using it for more than 3 weeks</li>
            <li> the more I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 years now and am really happy to be able to get it so much cheaper on line.</li>
            <li> I have never had any issues and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> - - I looked all over the Internet and this was the most discounted price for the product.  </li>
            <li> My face look 100% better than it did three weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> face look so much better.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use this product - love the Murad line.</li>
            <li> I love washing my face now because I SEE and FEEL a difference.  </li>
            <li> Also I made sure to put on suncreen every day too like they suggested.    </li>
            <li> With continued use I&#x27;m sure it will disappear.</li>
            <li> it is still one of mine/mom favorite products.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Rapid Age Spot serum in the hopes of removing a couple of prominent spots from my hand and face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t go for 4%.  </li>
            <li> Even if spots don&#x27;t lighten much more, I&#x27;m way better off than before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love that I can get it from Amazon in 2 days</li>
            <li> 2 for better moisturization.  </li>
            <li> not so sure about this product as it tends to create a sticky film that rubs off if I apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> have been using it for more than two weeks now.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> Initially concerned about the hydroquinone presence but was very impressed with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every night love it</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product.</li>
            <li> I expect it to fade the spots more.</li>
            <li> Hoping it fades more.</li>
            <li> I use it at at night all over my face, neck, and declate, but make sure to use a sph in the morning always.</li>
            <li> Used with a facial cleansing scrubber is best.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it here.</li>
            <li> I think it has prevented more and has lightened the ones I have quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I love the murad product line and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> This product was okay.  </li>
            <li> also made my scores better on the sun damage and uv damage.  </li>
            <li> but after I finish the bottle, I can review better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it actually works.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for almost 5 months now and I love it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it and since it&#x27;s not tested on animals, I love the product.</li>
            <li> I love murad products (resurgence is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used for looking younger)</li>
            <li> Yet, I still deal with so many skin problems.</li>
            <li> top it all</li>
            <li> This was a first time order and it seems to be working fairly well.</li>
            <li> worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I have read incredible reviews on this product for months and finally decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the fast change in the age spots!</li>
            <li> So far this product has work great.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and smells ok - just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I began to wonder why some people are blessed with great skin that is natural and they STILL wear makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of sticky, but it&#x27;s worth the $$</li>
            <li> And it will last you a good amount of time!</li>
            <li> Hands don&#x27;t do that great of a job, contrary to what many commercial advertise.</li>
            <li> I did try it on my neck and chest, but it was too strong.  </li>
            <li> Pretty amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers theee best prices for Murad products even though I believe it is still high.</li>
            <li> I am just now seeing the first undesirable effects of \\&quot;having the best tan on the block\\&quot; back in the day and wanted to find something that had proven results.</li>
            <li> Love it, got here quick and it works work.</li>
            <li> It took possibly 3 bottles to start to see the results , my skin is much more even toned, beautiful, I will continue using it as my complexion has improved very much .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li> I am too cheap to use it</li>
            <li> but from this experience, I&#x27;m going to continue with just the cheekbones and enjoy the change.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, 3rd purchase.</li>
            <li> quite light mind</li>
            <li> I have a sprinkle of light freckles across my nose and cheeks</li>
            <li> This is a great product that noticeably eliminates spots and visible signs of aging after just several uses.</li>
            <li> Its soft, bright, the age spots are disappearing - gone,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing &amp; really balances out the pigment in your skin.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, you just have stick with</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hands and it did work my brown spot got light it</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is very effective, you can see the lightening affect after several days.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin a bit dry so make sure to use in conjunction with a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Ever day it&#x27;s closer to the Original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, and this one is so good, they may as well just disappear from the market!</li>
            <li> This Product is the first one that work well for me, and I have used many product on my face.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this out to get rid of brownish discoloration on my face.</li>
            <li> I Originally started using it when i was given a sample at Sephora</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many products and I can honestly say this is the only product I have found that has truly worked on my skin.</li>
            <li> I found that it is a combination of the product and the instrument used to clean your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a happy camper right now.  </li>
            <li> purchased my first bottle from a department store and was so happy to find it on Amazon for such a&lt;br /&gt;great price.</li>
            <li> But after the price was so much, I decided to try just my cheekbones, where I have the most problems with spots.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of marks from old breakouts nicely.</li>
            <li> Estée Lauder makes a good concealer, double wear.  </li>
            <li> I have overall good skin but have acne scars/ sunspots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Really, the difference is astonishing.</li>
            <li> but I prayed they were true.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product doesn&#x27;t get a full 5-star review.  </li>
            <li> I was really expecting better results than this by now.</li>
            <li> So as far as Murad, liked, loved it, but I&#x27;m always on to try the next thing</li>
            <li> The smell is also pretty strong.  </li>
            <li> I will use only because lighter age spots are better, but wish it lightened them more.</li>
            <li> I  saw  quick results.  </li>
            <li> It also prevents pimples  from  becoming  dark  on  my fair African-American complexion.</li>
            <li> I have never used this type of hydroquinone based product and so far I have had good results, but it is very gradual for me.</li>
            <li> However, i do not believe it is worthy to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> If you are pregnant or breast feeding, you should Not use this.  </li>
            <li> Not a product to use occasionally ,must use daily for best results.</li>
            <li> The product came as described and was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have pigmentation from being pregnant and for years have tried everything.</li>
            <li> So on a scale of one to ten, ten being THE Best</li>
            <li> If you are debating between other products and Murad, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t find a better product for a better deal!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to stay out of the sun or use a high SPF over it during the day.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other &amp;#34;dark spot&amp;#34; lighteners and this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> Great for dark spots.</li>
            <li> Even if the spots aren&#x27;t completely gone by that time, I will be very pleased that they have lightened so much.</li>
            <li> I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to beauty products, especially if they cost more than 7 or 8 bucks!</li>
            <li> This product delivered fast results!!</li>
            <li> You MUST use SPF (30 or higher) with this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> It smells so funny!  </li>
            <li> Ointment is preferable to cream and is more easily  localized to where you want it to go rather than being spread over a larger area.  </li>
            <li> I need less makeup now and its looks better on my skin!!</li>
            <li> Also, this product worked on my fine lines so as an added value I look younger :).</li>
            <li> I feel that when you find a great product that solved a particular problem you&#x27;ve dealed with for a long time..it deserved to be told so it can help others..</li>
            <li> Out of all the facial spot removers I have tried this shows  the most promise and quickly!</li>
            <li> I just have to make sure to use a wash cloth with warm water when i wash my face and that removes all the dead cells released by the product leaving my skin tone and texture pretty even!</li>
            <li> rather than it being smooth and absorbing into my skin it just sits on my skin and clumps up.  </li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Either way it was worth the money just for the improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and tone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li> A rare exemple of honesty.</li>
            <li> It worth not your money.</li>
            <li> I followed directions exactly for the full bottle and did not experience any lightening of age spots or skin.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works great at first on dark age spots that are closer to the surface.</li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair and sensitive skin with frequent skin problems.</li>
            <li> I saw mild results after a couple weeks but it is very very gradual.      </li>
            <li> Right now I am trying something else.</li>
            <li> I have used this product more than a week and although my dark spots are not gone, I can tell that they are getting better.  </li>
            <li> If you are debating between other products and Murad, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t find a better product for a better deal!&#x27;t going to change your life or your skin completely.</li>
            <li> Superior dark spot lighting product.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, it really works...and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this works for me fine.  </li>
            <li> Granted, it could be because it&#x27;s 2 years old, but it&#x27;s sat in a dark drawer in the original packaging and it doesn&#x27;t say anything about an expiration date, so I&#x27;m thinking the stuff just isn&#x27;t that good.  </li>
            <li> My wife found out about this product and just used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product probably for about 2 months now, but I would say that I saw results after the first week.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> so evidently I am having an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> First, it took almost two weeks for the package to arrive.     </li>
            <li> I tried to use concealer, but it just looked just looked even more obvious to me!</li>
            <li> However, after the many cautions concerning extended timeframe to see results, I was truly amazed after only 1 or 2 applications.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it promises...never ordered a product from trying a sample...</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m still waiting for the one or two larger spots to lighten, I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used any Murad products before, but I will definitely buy more now.</li>
            <li> The IPL was only 50 more dollars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products (also tried the derma rollers &amp;#34;needling&amp;#34;)  to get rid of the spots and finally opted for a &amp;#34;medium TCA peel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> okay have not seen a big differents</li>
            <li> IT REALLY  WORKS!  </li>
            <li> I even look pretty without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and starting to get those lovely age/hormone spots.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5 months now and have been using it consistently every night.</li>
            <li> I made sure to put it on at night only and not in the daytime as they said not to.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for age and sun spots!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first thing that has worked.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for many months (2 times daily) and did not notice any changes.</li>
            <li> The product is clear like a serium and light on the face.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews</li>
            <li> I recommend the product to someone who is willing to be patient and  not to expect to get results over night.  </li>
            <li> I love Murad and I only purchase my products from Mass Beauty!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get that reaction with continuous use, just after the first couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointing!</li>
            <li> Use this often and it is the best thing I have found but it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have been an avid sunscreen user since my problems came up</li>
            <li> I periodically go back and do find my scores have been getting better.  </li>
            <li> For this much money (and I paid $50) it should kick @ss!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with a few tan spots on one cheek.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about the products I buy for my skin - always looking for new ones and reading up on what&#x27;s the new healthy trend for them.</li>
            <li> Not only worked on my dark spots that now are way much better, but also my face has this unique glow and the tone is more even.</li>
            <li> This is the only lightening product that I have used that really works, use daily for a month and see significant results, Love it!</li>
            <li> amazing product to remove the dark spots , I had been using this products for almost 2 weeks and my dark spots are very light now!</li>
            <li> Apparently it works great for some people according to the reviews, but I am 60 years old and some age spots or sun damage began to appear on my face within the last 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how much you put on and use; initially I put it on generously on my cheeks and it helps even skin tone and sun spots to be a more uniform and lighter color.  </li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned African American, who has been using the product for two to three weeks.  </li>
            <li> As an adult pregnant with my first child I got the &amp;#34;pregnancy mask&amp;#34; that faded after I gave birth.  </li>
            <li> Be sure you are in it for the long haul if you purchase.  </li>
            <li> I actually first bought just a Murad sample kit from Sephora, not wanting to spend too much money if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product has also greatly diminished a dark spot that I had on my upper cheek.</li>
            <li> However, the product isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; absorbs quickly so you can apply moisturizer directly after.</li>
            <li> - I can certainly see a change in my pigment.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product because I&#x27;m sure it works better on newer age spots and dark marks.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it to see ultimate results quickly!</li>
            <li> Not only does it lighten brown spots rapidly, but it also leaves my skin very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I expected more reduction.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> though much slower that I had anticipated or hoped.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for under my eyes, but I found it really dries that area out.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do that, even though my cheekbones are very close to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I focus the treatment on the sunspot, but I also have been using it on my whole face to improve the eveness of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my face.</li>
            <li> Heard and read so much about it</li>
            <li> I really like Murad products but this pigment lightening serum</li>
            <li> it works very well.  </li>
            <li> this productark spots are much lighter.</li>
            <li> It is a real result against a promise.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say they faded &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34; but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> fast  </li>
            <li> Have to say this is very well priced</li>
            <li> The product smells like alcohol and very sticky.</li>
            <li> This faded them really well.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps some people it will be fast and some</li>
            <li> But for me, it does work very gradually.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously for three months and saw no difference, even though my spots are relatively light.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this stuff really dries my skin out.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything except make your eyes water (even when not close to your eyes)...</li>
            <li> Very noticeable improvement in just a matter of a week to 10 days.  </li>
            <li> It works for my skin, and I have very troublesome olive Mediterranean skin that is prone to hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff works for real.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in her face</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me that it was just really one of the hardest things to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noticeable and makeup doesn&#x27;t cover it.  </li>
            <li> white/fair skinned, 34, have lived in CO my whole life and have gotten LOTS of sun and burns.  </li>
            <li> I used the whole Murad environmental defense line - every product they have.  </li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t see much fading of my age spots.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so I purchased the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s faded out most of my sun spots and has helped a red scar fade almost completely.  </li>
            <li> I began considering age spot removal when sun spots (kinder phrase than \\&quot;age spots\\&quot;) were growing more visible on my upper cheeks as I enter my early 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on skin, and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> I have also been using exfoliants and my favorite so far is St. Ives the standard scrub.</li>
            <li> Within days I could see my old acne marks leaving right before my eyes.</li>
            <li> That is more than I have attained by using other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many other products including the Clinique that is advertised everywhere, and nothing has made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I did not use this in conjunction with the other Murad vitamin C product that they recommended; I will start using that this month in conjunction with this product in hopes of getting even better results.    </li>
            <li> I wanted it to work, but like so many other products, it did not.</li>
            <li> And it most definitely makes you more sensitive to sun, do not leave the house without sunblock or a hat, even if it&#x27;s just a few a minutes.</li>
            <li> Most  of  my  dark spots  are  gone</li>
            <li> This product does not take away post acne marks, maybe it will work better for someone with dark spots instead.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product definitely worked for me, but is very gradual, but I am somewhat concerned about the side-effects I hear about hydroquinone, so I plan to stop using after another month or so just to be safe.</li>
            <li> So did the Clinique even better dark spot corrector when used in conjunction with their repair ware laser focus UV damage correcting serum.  </li>
            <li> I do like the texture of the serum, and the age spots may have faded slightly, but they are still noticeable even after being more than halfway through the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The spot is half gone and to the point where foundation mostly covers it.  </li>
            <li> One of my main staples in my skin care regime.  </li>
            <li> most of the spots on my face have completely faded and the really dark ones are significantly lighter and smaller.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are definately lighter and my skin tone overall looks more even and fresh.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> would buy this product again and would highly recommend it for those wanting to fade age spots.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , I felt very self conscious.</li>
            <li> and I am not forced into an auto ship program through Murad&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference so far</li>
            <li> , I would rate this a two based on my first 3 weeks, and my affection for Murad in general.  </li>
            <li> I do not spend a lot of $ on skincare normally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try this out for a few more months and see what happens- still optimistic.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s made a difference for the three age spots I have on my right cheek.</li>
            <li> Get with a Murad dealer such as Massage Envy and let someone pick the right product for you.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still using both and ordering a new bottle of Murad today.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good reviews, but I think if I put this all over my face it would dry me out and make me raw.</li>
            <li> the product is serious and effective.</li>
            <li> I just bought a full bottle, THEN did my research (I do things backward sometimes) and learned the main ingredient in this Murad product is a substance that is BANNED in other countries, called hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> but I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> About 5 days after starting to use Murad my skin had visibly improved SO much!</li>
            <li> It looked smoother, and WOW, radiant!</li>
            <li> just recently i noticed that my eyes sting after i apply the serum, at first i thought its because it was applied too closely to my eyes, then i started just using it on my cheeks, not on my nose that is close to my eye, it still stings.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d hit gold with this since Murad&#x27;s other products work so wonderfully but unfortunately</li>
            <li> This is the first product I used that I actually got results!  </li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;m 50, white, medium tone skin, some freckles.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I tried the MURAD AGE SPOT AND PIGMENT LIGHTENING GEL for a full three months (entire bottle), following the directions each night...</li>
            <li> This was kind of expensive item for me to purchase and the first time for me to try serums to help with blemishes.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are significantly lighter in just a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Honestly,  I think there was a slight reduction,  but definitely not much</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would help because I love Murad, but it has only slightly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only stuff I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve ever seen results with, especially that quickly and dramatically&lt;</li>
            <li> Fully intended to purchase the full size but was diverted by another product on Amazon that apparently worked particularly well with my skin coloring (dark olive)&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I used it again as directed and again noticed a huge difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> cheek spots are clearly lighter and continuing to fade.  </li>
            <li> and my complection is completely clear.  </li>
            <li> I started using it mid-July, it is now end of Sept, and spots have considerably faded.  </li>
            <li> I never considered my skin sensitive</li>
            <li> The manufacturer uses three months as the guideline for stopping use of the product, but nearly all the reviews I read (on Sephora) indicated that an improvement was noticed faster than that.</li>
            <li> Within days, I saw results, and its almost faded to my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> I would not waste the money.</li>
            <li> So far it is doing what I would like, but has a way to go.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely sold on murad now.</li>
            <li> since they&#x27;re not all that noticeable to begin with i thought this serum will completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li> By doing this I&#x27;ve noticed an unexpected bonus.</li>
            <li> I did lighten age spots but did not take them completely away.</li>
            <li> and I believe it is old or damaged..</li>
            <li> So far, the sun damage spots are getting lighter and lighter.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li> They do lighten up your spots but don&#x27;t expect them to disappear completely.  </li>
            <li> But so far, no discernible results.</li>
            <li> Go to a board certified dermatologist and get the brown spots removed professionally.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make them completely fade.</li>
            <li> Just waiting on the this to continue use to see if it will disappear completely.</li>
            <li> I developed chloasma after having my kids and some faded</li>
            <li> Too early for that.</li>
            <li> absolutely nothing, zero, nil , nada happened, not even a tiny tingle.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a considerable difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use sunblock, but I don&#x27;t go outside much.  </li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t going to change your life or your skin completely.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money .</li>
            <li> So far, no age spots to speak of.  </li>
            <li> It is sort of scary that it works this good, as I wonder what the chemicals are that can create this change.</li>
            <li> Really good product but much on the internet about it being dangerous to use.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used other Murad products before and they&#x27;re pretty decent.</li>
            <li> This wonderful product quickly did away with the dark circles under my eyes, as well as a birthmark I&#x27;ve always found annoying.  </li>
            <li> i found a full size one for half the price.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it for long, but really like it so far</li>
            <li> I found that I had quick results fading the dark spots to barely being noticeable!</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to work any better than the other things I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back is that the smell  of the treatment is not very nice, but it dissipates quickly once absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it with a high SPF sunscreen to avoid discoloration from coming back from getting sun.</li>
            <li> my blood will revert back to normal.  </li>
            <li> above, it did suggest that it be used with a second product, and perhaps that would make a difference, but I am not going to waste any more money myself trying to find out.</li>
            <li> Once I got pregnant, I got a lot of little clusters all around my checks and forehead.</li>
            <li> After seeing my mom being down for the longest time because of the brown spots, I did some research and came across this powerful gel.</li>
            <li> Not bad after using a product for less than two weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Really works at noticeably fading age spots and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It, lots of red pigmentations , covered my whole face especially on my cheek bones.  </li>
            <li> but ultimately it did not work fast enough for me</li>
            <li> Since November 2010, I&#x27;ve been using Murad&#x27;s Post acne gel, which is pretty much the same as this product (give or take a little ingredients here and</li>
            <li> The next morning when I saw my face, wow!  </li>
            <li> Yes, more expensive than some, but this is the first one of this type that actually delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; Dark brown patches began to fade to pink very quickly.</li>
            <li> The age spots did not go away right away, but three weeks after, they are certainly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I used this for a while​ before I knew there were other products available, it didn&#x27;t work as I expected and with shelling out sixty dollars ever so often</li>
            <li> I have a couple of age spots on my face that are not very dark</li>
            <li> First of all, I have dark spots all over face for years of sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I am surprised this actually works.</li>
            <li> it has almost completely removed  facial age spots that I have been working on for years!  </li>
            <li> Third day using this and Nothing so far.</li>
            <li> I had a sunspot on my upper eyelid that is now completely gone and</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old Caucasian woman with moderate age spots on my face and hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and it has reduced some red areas on my face, but they are far from gone.  </li>
            <li> I have used it faithfully and it has definitely helped, but has never eliminated the spots completely.  </li>
            <li> I am confident that within a few months the dark spots that my acne cause will be gone.</li>
            <li> Disappointing after reading many positive reviews and purchased on the quality of the Murad name.</li>
            <li> I think this was a complete waste of money and certainly cannot recommend it</li>
            <li> I have certainly seen an improvement and lightening of the dark age spots I have on my face.</li>
            <li> Have been using this serum on and off for a few months and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> This serum on the other hand, was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I developed what looked like nose freckles due to Sun exposure and it had taken them away almost completely.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it states, diminishes uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> and I saw results in the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> i used the product two or three times a day for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> With my second child, it unfortunately did not fade and I was left with what looked like my freckles just kind of exploded and joined together on my face.  </li>
            <li> It literally started working and lightening my spots within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> I used it only my both arms, little does change but it has to be consistently.  </li>
            <li> However, this product significantly faded them and with a little make-up made them a lot less apparent.</li>
            <li> I tried a few products that were supposed to fade sun spots, but the Murad product was the first that actually worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it all year round and combined with sunscreen, I no longer have the large brown patches on the sides of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It is a little noticeable, but I think people would have to be really paying attention to see it.</li>
            <li> Did lighten spot on my face a little bit but not as much as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> No more hiding from the cameras!!! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for dark acne blemishes that I&#x27;ve had since high school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been slowly working on these spots, but I was surprised to see how much it&#x27;s improved the overall color of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old black male with a medium complexion, I had dark spots from pimples and they really started to bother me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as fast acting as other reviews I&#x27;ve seen, but will finish the rest of the bottle which will take me a couple months to empty.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products to clear up my skin such as Neutrogena beta-formula lotion that supposedly lightens skin or evens the tone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for even a little improvement.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks small but you don&#x27;t need much each application.  </li>
            <li> I can really see a difference within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using for as long as I have product left.</li>
            <li> I can see a slight difference ,had a spot near my eyebrow that has faded.</li>
            <li> Using everyday for last 3 weeks but no pigment lightening so far.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s possible that if I patiently finished the whole bottle, I could see results and maybe it just works really slow.  </li>
            <li> This product also had a secondary positive effect by enhancing skin smoothness, and reducing pore size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other products that simply did NOT work (that had the same promises).  </li>
            <li> At times when it seemed to stop fading marks, I began to use every other day, then back to daily</li>
            <li> They are slow but the spots have certainly faded.    </li>
            <li> will say that when I first start using this stuff each time after a few days or weeks of a break from it, my skin will start to feel a little bubbly.</li>
            <li> As for my mother, her skin is lighter and the spots have faded a lot, but not completely.</li>
            <li> I emailed my friend after a day or two and asked her how long it would take to see results.</li>
            <li> I will be a life long user.</li>
            <li> I saved lots of money buying from this vendor and not direct from Murad.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and am trying to lighten/remove my sunspots, uneven tone, and old acne scars.      </li>
            <li> please be extra careful i would not want another person to go through what i am going through.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this miracle stuff in a bottle as long as Murad makes it.</li>
            <li> they are still there, but it took me a long time to get them, so maybe a while&lt;</li>
            <li> The discoloration tends to fade after a long time, but I wanted something faster.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I can notice some minor difference.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, but very worth it.</li>
            <li> The product does last a long time and I will continue to use what little I have left, but will not purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> So I am now applying this to a few dark spots on my arms which have bugged me for years and make me look older than I have to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice an overall improvement on my complextion, I am using this with the trial kit which includes other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I tried Obagi&#x27;s skin lightening products with 4% hydroquinone and after a few days my face was red and on fire with white bumps.  </li>
            <li> i have never had a negative reaction to anything topical in my life, my skin is not at all sensitive and nothing broke me out,but this serum stings my skin, i have not broke out but it hurts.</li>
            <li> There is one tiny brown spot on my face where I applied this daily, even a few times a day some days, for 2 months</li>
            <li> I feel like this reaction is the stuff actually working, and it only lasts a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the last few years I&#x27;ve noticed age spots starting to appear on the side of my face.  </li>
            <li> I  applied  it every single day for 2 months and did not see any difference .</li>
            <li> So far, going on 4 weeks, I see very little lightening of age spots on my arms.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves the product and actually put some on a dark spot on my face and it went away over about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Perhaps is is the second product that makes a difference in the outcome, but using this product alone did nothing to fade my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only using it on my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> My dark color spots had change to red at 1st and</li>
            <li> Totally was not worth it for me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after noticing some dark skin discoloration on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I have a few &amp;#34;stubborn&amp;#34; brown spots on my forehead mainly so I used this for a few months</li>
            <li> Only have to use a little and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> lower half only).  </li>
            <li> My sun spots are only slightly lighter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically like to try products like this especially ordering online without testing it beforehand.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a very long way, so one bottle should last quite sometime even if I use it twice a day, which I try to remember to do, but sometimes forget.</li>
            <li> You can buy hydroquinone 2% cream made by other companies all day long at Walmart for around $5.00.  </li>
            <li> My complexion is much brighter, it doesn&#x27;t look as tired and the dark spots that have started showing up in recent years have faded!</li>
            <li> Too bad, since I had high hopes after seeing other success stories.</li>
            <li> The reason I use the product is to lighten dark areas around my chin due to facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> No other over the counter product has worked, including high end, expensive cosmetic brands.</li>
            <li> But since I have tried this product on a whim (even though I have tried a lot of other products only to be let down...)</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit each day.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs well, improves my skin tone, and you only need a little amount to cover all your face area.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> to say that the &#x27;Porcelaina&#x27;  is also working very well so far and contains other &#x27;skin lightening&#x27; ingredients, slightly less expensive.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> but please be careful using products with this ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I spent years tanning and, at 39, am paying for it in the form of age spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The result: ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE.</li>
            <li> Total price was about $300 (Waste of money, time, energy, and effort).</li>
            <li> At this point I feel it&#x27;s a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Murad for a few weeks in the morning and in the evening.  </li>
            <li> and when i tried this as a same, it literally started lightening them up within a few days and</li>
            <li> I have a few friends who  had spots removed by laser, and that is the only thing I have seen that  works.</li>
            <li> I used this product every day as directed for 4 weeks with absolutely no noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle product that works gradually without irritating or drying the skin</li>
            <li> its not immediate results; but if u stick to ur facial routine everyday, it does work.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to anyone who has trouble with marks</li>
            <li> I spent $65 on this product and used it for three months with no results at all.  </li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t achieved the result I expected</li>
            <li> Forgetful will missed sorely.  </li>
            <li> I use St. Ives now to exfoliate and the pink grapefruit scrub.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use it for the next few weeks to see if spots get even lighter.</li>
            <li> This product is a total and complete rip-off.  </li>
            <li> So, now I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Some days I look and think it helped and other days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start using it on some other age spots and see if I can find a use for this.</li>
            <li> , there was no peeling or burn, like I got with Retinol and some other products..  </li>
            <li> Been trying other whiting solutions didn&#x27;t see a difference on my skin .</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical at first but am so thankful I bought this .Buy</li>
            <li> I will continue to  try other products for age spots if I can find some that aren&#x27;t too unreasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of trying other Murad products.  </li>
            <li> And it only takes a small amount for each application.  </li>
            <li> I have hard sun spots that I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive Shiseido product to cheap Ambi...</li>
            <li> I feel a little tingling but it is instructed that on the product.. need to be careful with the sun..need to use a sun block.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on some reviews that I found while searching for something to work on my dark spots.</li>
            <li> and I see a noticable difference in the dark spots on my face, but not completley gone.  </li>
            <li> (we&#x27;re caucasian; I&#x27;m in my late twenties and my mother is in her mid fifties)</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend to help lighten some dark areas on my face.</li>
            <li> I am still waiting to see if it will fade dark spots.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a sephora consultant to help redness and dark spots.</li>
            <li> and I can already see the dark spots breaking up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a caucasian woman in my forties and have combination skin with dark spots across the cheeks that are probably a result of years of sun damage.</li>
            <li> have had no success myself with using the Murad lightener and can&#x27;t recommend it to those with middle-age pigmented skin.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my hands sue to sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I fail to use this product everyday as I just get in a hurry and forget or don&#x27;t take the time.  </li>
            <li> cover  dark  spots.  </li>
            <li> my dark spots are never changed.</li>
            <li> skin isn&#x27;t as irritated with use anymore- dark spots 80% faded.  </li>
            <li> I added a fifth star because I thought after the Rx and Olay did nothing that I was stuck with the dark spots forever.  </li>
            <li> (similar to vodka) I have a combination skin with oily T-zone and this serum improved my skin tone when used with Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Renewal Complex.</li>
            <li> started noticing my dark marks getting lighter after about a week.</li>
            <li> my dark spot about the size of a dime is 90% lighter.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are almost unnoticeable by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can say that it truly fades dark spots.</li>
            <li> Therefore I am going to use this for at least a total of three months.</li>
            <li> but I have one dark spot just under my eye.</li>
            <li> (post acne dark spots/freckles)</li>
            <li> I still must use cosmetics to cover the dark areas but my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> - not worth the price  </li>
            <li> This product removes the dark spots ...</li>
            <li> Came with broken seal on box, four corners on box looked old and peeling, pump did not work.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my hands, as they have really bad dark spots all over.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Black woman with medium-deep brown skin with dark spots on my cheeks from hyper-pigmentation and acne.  </li>
            <li> this product wasnt what i expected not really sure if you have to use with other murad products</li>
            <li> My review is less about the item itself than about how I received it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove serious skin damage from the sun, but it definitely evens out your skin tone.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month in half , my spots look lighter</li>
            <li> I need a lot less concealer to make the spots disappear.  </li>
            <li> I used the age spot serum as directed and seriously noticed a BIG difference in a week or two.</li>
            <li> half the bottle is gone and I haven&#x27;t not seen the slightest difference in my age spots.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin in two weeks or less.</li>
            <li> The biggest result I have seen is an even tone and less noticeable scars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 1/3 less when purchased online versus at a salon or department store that carries Murad products.</li>
            <li> The product could have been altered, or even worse be a gel that contains no active products.</li>
            <li> They started out pale brown and have gotten darker until they&#x27;re now as dark as a dark freckle.  </li>
            <li> A little research and shopping time on Amazon, I chose Murad.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure if this is due to this product or if it is from something I ate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too soon to know if it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> I think it could be a little lower priced.</li>
            <li> I have some age spots which just showed up in the past year and discoloration due to pimples.</li>
            <li> He gave me some Tretinoin cream for a little bit of acne that I was having and basically told me that was all he could do.  </li>
            <li> After 4 months use - very little if any difference in dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month on a few brown/age spots.</li>
            <li> Second, the bottle is contained in a box, and the safety seal on the box was broken.</li>
            <li> They told me that this problem will resolved itself after a few months.</li>
            <li> (Yes, I&#x27;m impatient.)</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I used it everyday I would see the results they promise.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found a way to try the serum for a few days before purchase (i.e., a sample)</li>
            <li> It is waste of money.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product everyday for about 3 weeks have not seen any results in lightening my sunspots.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is harsh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to discontinue use in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> IMO if you don&#x27;t have any results in a few weeks, discontinue use and try something else.  </li>
            <li> Now the spots seem like they are melting away and the uneven skin tone is all but gone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with all these lightening products.  </li>
            <li> I had a few freckles on my face growing up</li>
            <li> Saw results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell any visible difference after using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It lightened the area, but did not erase the spots even after a month of everyday usage.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed after seeing glowing advertisements in every woman&#x27;s magazine I&#x27;ve opened in the past year or more!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks now,only where I need it,and I can see a noticeable difference.my spots are much LESS noticeable now!</li>
            <li> You can imagine my delight when I found it on Amazon for quite a bit less!</li>
            <li> Living in Miami, the sun is an unavoidable issue, and being pale skinned</li>
            <li> It worked faster than any other lightening gel/cream I have tried in the past!  </li>
            <li> Well, this is not true!  </li>
            <li> for my acne prone skin, it broke me out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it lightened any of my sun induced freckles.</li>
            <li> I had two small sun spots and they have faded away.</li>
            <li> not sure if I see my spots disappearing yet.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t bother writing reviews on products I&#x27;ve used but this one I will make an exception.  </li>
            <li> Also,  I didn&#x27;t notice a problem around my eyes which usually plagues me:  eye cream or moisturizer that migrates into my eyes when I sleep and ends up stinging them.  </li>
            <li> but it was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, have not seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is truly working but seems like it is.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this just takes time .</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin is a bit of a train wreck - dry, bad pigment, cracky sometimes, too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let negative reviews get you down!!</li>
            <li> My opinion is hard to give at this time.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use hardly any products on my face.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take all the dark pigment away but it TRULY HELPS!!!</li>
            <li> I know that this is the responsibility of the shipper, not MURAD, but it was disappointing, especially because of the product&#x27;s cost.     </li>
            <li> I used to only use it once summer ended to diminish the affects of the summer sun and the &#x27;dirty&#x27; looks of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> (Duh)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an uphill battle as I&#x27;ll never catch up with the trends, but hey, at least I try.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of products and at least this one did&lt;br</li>
            <li> People have complained about the smell</li>
            <li> I am 63 and realize you can&#x27;t reverse age, but for the price I had hoped for at least some change.</li>
            <li> I have had the lightening serum for a month now and have seen slow progress.</li>
            <li> I went to Whole Foods and they had a Visia complexion analysis there that showed me my scores compared to other women my age and in sun spots and IV damage, my scores were BAD!!  </li>
            <li> I mean NO results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> All of my acne scars from the past 6 months or so went away!</li>
            <li> however, if you decide to try this product, please test on a very small section of your face and neck, until you see if it works.  </li>
            <li> I am very anxious to see what happens when I get out in the sun this summer</li>
            <li> Now people, not doctors, told me maybe it is bad blood and if &amp; when I have the next baby</li>
            <li> I am medium toned ,AA female and had a bad scar from a burn on my face for 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> Def faded my scars and pigmentation but, alas, I had to discontinue use per my sensitive skin :(</li>
            <li> However, I was so sick of dealing with all of my skin problems that I decided to try it after doing extensive research.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is so expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first time using Murad Environmental Shield Age Spot, I discovered a horrible stench that the post acne gel didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I regret buying it but will use it till I get the post acne gel which I will go back to. :(</li>
            <li> I order from Amazon a LOT, and rarely write bad reviews, but I was disappointed with this experience.</li>
            <li> If it works, it is a very slow process.</li>
            <li> I was noticing (and becoming very insecure) about the dreadful &#x27;mustache tan.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;ve never experienced irritation of any sort.</li>
            <li> I had my son and it seem to gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s and noticed my skin just looked tired until I used this.</li>
            <li> then i decreased to once or twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed I spent money on this:-/</li>
            <li> So, no positive benefits and instead break outs on my cheeks, chin and neck :(  </li>
            <li> so my family unfortunately thought it was unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> Little bit pricey... :(</li>
            <li> I have a few sunspots on my face that I absolutely hate and this has helped to make them fade.</li>
            <li> I use this every night without fail.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one did not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did nothing for my age spots.  </li>
            <li> Useless, from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> Well, I was skeptical for the price.</li>
            <li> not what it is cut out to be  expensive</li>
            <li> Even worse, my skin has broken out horribly around areas where I apply the serum!  </li>
            <li> This was terribly disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Plus this is very expensive to boot</li>
            <li> Not as bad as with the 4%</li>
            <li> the product has a bad smell to it when I apply it to my face and also clumps up when applying it,</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne scarring all over my face</li>
            <li> I tried this product and gave me a really bad rash.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work and you end up frustrated and disappointed.  </li>
            <li> this for any skin discoloration , you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I am a guy, but this was worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very doubtful that I could use this but had a spot that bothered me and wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> I used it one day and broke out in horrible acne.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this for several years now and I&#x27;ve seen a number of brown spots disappear from my face.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it states, diminishes uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> I expected more reduction.  Honestly,  I think there was a slight reduction,  but definitely not much</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> My wife found out about this product and just used it for the first time.  She&#x27;s was delighted and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on some reviews that I found while searching for something to work on my dark spots. First of all, I have dark spots all over face for years of sun exposure. I&#x27;ve tried everything, from the cheapest to the most expensive product, microdermabrasion, etc., without any luck. I opted to use concealer to cover them, but I decided to give my spots one last try with this product. Result: AMAZING! Not only worked on my dark spots that now are way much better, but also my face has this unique glow and the tone is more even. Also, this product worked on my fine lines so as an added value I look younger :). I&#x27;m now confortable about running errands without wearing makeup at all! I&#x27;ve been using this product probably for about 2 months now, but I would say that I saw results after the first week. Bottom line: TOTALLY recommended!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin within days of using this product. Have been using it now for 3 weeks and I see a noticable difference in the dark spots on my face, but not completley gone.  This product has done a great job at evening out my skin tone and I notice an overall healthier appearance.  Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now.  It works very well.  I have fair skin and it&#x27;s faded out most of my sun spots and has helped a red scar fade almost completely.  It makes your skin a bit dry so make sure to use in conjunction with a good moisturizer.  [[ASIN:B000GDC4IM Murad Environmental Shield Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Gel, 2: Treat/Repair, 1.0 fl oz (30 ml)]]</li>
            <li> My opinion is hard to give at this time. I have had the product for weeks now. I had been using it daily but I have very sensitive skin and it made me itchy. So, now I use it every other day. Some days I look and think it helped and other days I am not sure if it lightened any of my sun induced freckles.</li>
            <li> After using it daily for almost a month, I think I see some result, my brown spot seems lighten up a bit.  Don&#x27;t like the smell though.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders for my mother and I. I had two small sun spots and they have faded away. This product has also stopped my occasional breakouts. As for my mother, her skin is lighter and the spots have faded a lot, but not completely. We have been using it for about 4-5 months. (we&#x27;re caucasian; I&#x27;m in my late twenties and my mother is in her mid fifties)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month on a few brown/age spots. I do notice some lightening so I will keep using it! It worked faster than any other lightening gel/cream I have tried in the past!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Tried this product using religiously for 2 months...no noticeable change in any spots.  Be sure you are in it for the long haul if you purchase.  I give up</li>
            <li> I began considering age spot removal when sun spots (kinder phrase than \\&quot;age spots\\&quot;) were growing more visible on my upper cheeks as I enter my early 40&#x27;s.  A little research and shopping time on Amazon, I chose Murad.  I started a twice-daily routine of Noxema and Murad.  After months, I was in the middle of my second bottle before noticing results.  They are slow but the spots have certainly faded.    Soon after acquiring my third bottle from Amazon, I ran across a Shiseido cream.  Though more expensive, results are seen in a couple weeks.  I still use Murad for spot areas on my skin, though Shiseido has won me over.    In summary, Murad&#x27;s effectiveness depends on individual skin type.  I can say it did work on me, though much slower that I had anticipated or hoped.  I can say I&#x27;ve never experienced irritation of any sort.</li>
            <li> I started using it mid-July, it is now end of Sept, and spots have considerably faded.  Just make sure to stay out of the sun or use a high SPF over it during the day. No other over the counter product has worked, including high end, expensive cosmetic brands. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend to help lighten some dark areas on my face. I have been using it for almost a month now and I can already tell some improvements. Great seller! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I got zero results. Maybe it&#x27;s because I am a guy, but this was worthless. I mean NO results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 months and it did not work!! every time I applied it on I feel a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> 3 years ago I tried Obagi&#x27;s skin lightening products with 4% hydroquinone and after a few days my face was red and on fire with white bumps.  Last week I tried Murad&#x27;s product which is 2% and on day 6 my face is now red and puffy (lower half only).  Not as bad as with the 4% but please be careful using products with this ingredient.  I never considered my skin sensitive so evidently I am having an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Started working in a matter of two days .. Love it</li>
            <li> My review is less about the item itself than about how I received it. I order from Amazon a LOT, and rarely write bad reviews, but I was disappointed with this experience. First, it took almost two weeks for the package to arrive.     Second, the bottle is contained in a box, and the safety seal on the box was broken. The product could have been altered, or even worse be a gel that contains no active products. I know that this is the responsibility of the shipper, not MURAD, but it was disappointing, especially because of the product&#x27;s cost.     Finally, I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for almost a month, and have seen no difference whatsoever in the shade of my sun pigmentation. The manufacturer uses three months as the guideline for stopping use of the product, but nearly all the reviews I read (on Sephora) indicated that an improvement was noticed faster than that. I&#x27;m going to finish up the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely satisfied that I went with this product. Living in Miami, the sun is an unavoidable issue, and being pale skinned I was noticing (and becoming very insecure) about the dreadful &#x27;mustache tan.&#x27; I tried to use concealer, but it just looked just looked even more obvious to me! After extensive research and shelled out the bucks for this one. Within days, I saw results, and its almost faded to my natural skin tone. I just apply at night before bed. I see the results, so I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am surprised this actually works. I have tried several products from Garnier to Strivectin to Clinique. This product worked better than all of them.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers theee best prices for Murad products even though I believe it is still high. However, after the many cautions concerning extended timeframe to see results, I was truly amazed after only 1 or 2 applications. I am just now seeing the first undesirable effects of \\&quot;having the best tan on the block\\&quot; back in the day and wanted to find something that had proven results. This product also had a secondary positive effect by enhancing skin smoothness, and reducing pore size. Get alot of compliments on my skin and give alot of credit to this product.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle religiously according to directions before making a judgement on this serum. I still have the spots I was trying to lighten. No change occurred whatsoever. I would not waste the money.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2 weeks now.  Gives a nice glow not sure if I see my spots disappearing yet.  Will have to give it more time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Really works at noticeably fading age spots and it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea so I can&#x27;t use hardly any products on my face.  I was very doubtful that I could use this but had a spot that bothered me and wanted to try it.  It has not flared my rosacea at all, but I do however only use it on that spot, and not all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again and would highly recommend it for those wanting to fade age spots.</li>
            <li> I bought this for under my eyes, but I found it really dries that area out. I&#x27;m going to start using it on some other age spots and see if I can find a use for this. I&#x27;ve heard good reviews, but I think if I put this all over my face it would dry me out and make me raw.</li>
            <li> amazing product to remove the dark spots , I had been using this products for almost 2 weeks and my dark spots are very light now!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t bother writing reviews on products I&#x27;ve used but this one I will make an exception.  I feel that when you find a great product that solved a particular problem you&#x27;ve dealed with for a long time..it deserved to be told so it can help others..both saving money and time.&lt;br /&gt;After the birth of my daughter three years ago, I had what doctors called \\&quot;pregnancy mask\\&quot;.  It, lots of red pigmentations , covered my whole face especially on my cheek bones.  They told me that this problem will resolved itself after a few months. I waited and waited but it didn&#x27;t go away.  Now people, not doctors, told me maybe it is bad blood and if &amp; when I have the next baby my blood will revert back to normal.  Well, this is not true!  I had my son and it seem to gotten worse.  After given the theory for 3 months I decided to get some products to help with the condition.  But no luck, my pigmentations was still there.&lt;br /&gt;One day, about 2 weeks ago, I went into a beauty supply store and got recommended this Murad product, costed $60.  I was hesitant because it was so expensive but thinking better than have this \\&quot;masked\\&quot; face.  I went home and tried it out that same night.  The next morning when I saw my face, wow!  it worked!  After 1 week of using it..my pigmentation improved about 50%. Now at two weeks, it had improved about 75%.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was only me noticing this change, but, we had a family gathering also a week ago and everyone stared at me &amp; commented how cleared my face looked.  I&#x27;m such a happy camper right now.  No more hiding from the cameras!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P&gt;S  Good points to know:  The bottle looks small but you don&#x27;t need much each application.  It is important to apply a good moisturer with sunscreen when you go out in the sun.  Because, without it..you may see pigmentations again.  Also, next time I will order it through Amazon because it offered at $44, shipping about $3..total I would have saved $13!!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my hands, as they have really bad dark spots all over.  I&#x27;m 45 and have years of sun damage.  But after the price was so much, I decided to try just my cheekbones, where I have the most problems with spots.  I am too cheap to use it all over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I saw results after two nights (!!!).  It is sort of scary that it works this good, as I wonder what the chemicals are that can create this change. I also wonder if it&#x27;s just a surface change or is actually helping in the lower layers of skin (???). As in, is this just in effect dying the spots temporarily?  I guess I won&#x27;t know that yet, but from this experience, I&#x27;m going to continue with just the cheekbones and enjoy the change.  I did NOT use the moisturizer they recommend, I prefer Origins products, specifically Night-a-Mins and the Ginseng Day cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there was no peeling or burn, like I got with Retinol and some other products..  Also,  I didn&#x27;t notice a problem around my eyes which usually plagues me:  eye cream or moisturizer that migrates into my eyes when I sleep and ends up stinging them.  This didn&#x27;t do that, even though my cheekbones are very close to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the results continue, I may splurge and use it on my hands.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Nothing is 100%; but, I did see great improvements from this product. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for even a little improvement.</li>
            <li> This is very effective, you can see the lightening affect after several days.  I did try it on my neck and chest, but it was too strong.  And it most definitely makes you more sensitive to sun, do not leave the house without sunblock or a hat, even if it&#x27;s just a few a minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried a few products that were supposed to fade sun spots, but the Murad product was the first that actually worked for me.  And the price was great.</li>
            <li> I love it! great product</li>
            <li> Great stuff, 3rd purchase.</li>
            <li> Great on Skin with brown spots</li>
            <li> Recommended by friends. This does seem to work if you are diligent. Too bad it is so expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> So far it is doing what I would like, but has a way to go. I have found out that I am allergic to adhesive tape, and that made the problem. The&lt;br /&gt;spots are fading, but I am looking forward to getting even better. May the God of All bless you who reads this.</li>
            <li> Only had it for a month but I notice a big difference. I&#x27;m using it for melasma (brown spots) on my cheekbones. They have lightened dramatically. My husband even noticed how they are fading. I hope they disappear.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was hesitant as most of these type of products do not work! However, this product does, almost overnight. I have a few sunspots on my face that I absolutely hate and this has helped to make them fade. Its not a miracle worker but it is definitely worth the money. And it will last you a good amount of time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various skin lighteners out there. Even by prescription. The ones prescribed made my skin peel, burn and turn red until I had to stop using them. This product did not irritate my skin at all and I saw results in the first few weeks. I have sun spots (darkened patches of skin) from birth control. Even after I went off, the spots did not go away. Once I got pregnant, I got a lot of little clusters all around my checks and forehead. I don&#x27;t think any product will fully rid of every mark on my skin. However, this product significantly faded them and with a little make-up made them a lot less apparent. Overall my skin just looks fresher and brighter. The best product I have found over the counter.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product and actually put some on a dark spot on my face and it went away over about two weeks. This is a good product and its a good price according to my wife.</li>
            <li> Good results but after one month or more!!.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, even if you change nothing else in your routine. Tightens pores and evens out skin discolorations fast.&lt;br /&gt;f. Montana</li>
            <li> I think this product works great for age spots on hands</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks and have noticed a huge difference. My dark spots are definately lighter and my skin tone overall looks more even and fresh. I&#x27;m in my 40s and noticed my skin just looked tired until I used this. I do not spend a lot of $ on skincare normally. I splurged and bought this and the eye cream (also awesome) and I&#x27;m completely sold on murad now. I&#x27;m going to send some to my mom too.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it promises...never ordered a product from trying a sample...but this one....was quite amazing...even my darkest areas,did lighten</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many I have tried and they do not work, A couple of them is Garnier skin&lt;br /&gt;renew Rejouvance, Roc.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do.  High-quality Murad product.   Ointment is preferable to cream and is more easily  localized to where you want it to go rather than being spread over a larger area.  I definitely reccommend this Murad product above all similar products.</li>
            <li> I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to beauty products, especially if they cost more than 7 or 8 bucks! A friend of mine told me that she used Murad to lighten the pigment over her upper lip that is caused by her birth control. I spent years tanning and, at 39, am paying for it in the form of age spots and wrinkles. She said she thought this might work for me. I bought it, reluctantly, and started using it as directed. I emailed my friend after a day or two and asked her how long it would take to see results. (Yes, I&#x27;m impatient.) About 5 days after starting to use Murad my skin had visibly improved SO much! It looked smoother, and WOW, radiant! (I&#x27;ve never used that word in conjunction with my own face.) My boyfriend noticed the difference, too. While I&#x27;m still waiting for the one or two larger spots to lighten, I am extremely pleased with this product. I am considering purchasing more from Murad in order to have consistency in my product use. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, and I have NEVER written a review on anything, ever! Try it!</li>
            <li> I use it daily with Rx for Brown skin to control blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a week so far, and I am highly impressed. My sun spots have lightened and it also drys pimples causing them to flake. I&#x27;ve notice an overall improvement on my complextion, I am using this with the trial kit which includes other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair Skin&lt;br /&gt;30 -35</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for around 2.5 months and it is making a noticeable difference in fading the freckles on my face. It also helps even my skin tone. Using it twice a day layered under my Clinique moisturizer. The only draw back is that the smell  of the treatment is not very nice, but it dissipates quickly once absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have Melasma on my face and arms, started using this serum and it has faded my age spots on my face a great deal ( have not used it on my arms yet)  on my second bottle, will order again. I also use sunblock.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for about three months now. no visible lightening of my freckles. Those freckles are quite light mind you. since they&#x27;re not all that noticeable to begin with i thought this serum will completely get rid of it. nope. never happened. just recently i noticed that my eyes sting after i apply the serum, at first i thought its because it was applied too closely to my eyes, then i started just using it on my cheeks, not on my nose that is close to my eye, it still stings. i have never had a negative reaction to anything topical in my life, my skin is not at all sensitive and nothing broke me out,but this serum stings my skin, i have not broke out but it hurts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now. I ordered it to lighten a sunspot on my cheek. I forget to use it occasionally, but even still I can already see a difference. I focus the treatment on the sunspot, but I also have been using it on my whole face to improve the eveness of my skin tone. By doing this I&#x27;ve noticed an unexpected bonus. My skin feels amazing. It&#x27;s incredibly soft and smooth. My only worry is that it will fade my freckles. I have a sprinkle of light freckles across my nose and cheeks and I like them. So hopefully I can fade the sunspot and keep the freckles. Either way it was worth the money just for the improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and tone. I only used it a couple of days before I noticed how much better my skin felt. And there&#x27;s no irritation at all. I can use it under my 30 spf moisturizer or alone. Sometimes after I treat the sunspot, I&#x27;ll mix it with the moisturizer for the rest of my face. And a little goes a very long way, so one bottle should last quite sometime even if I use it twice a day, which I try to remember to do, but sometimes forget. I just cannot overstate how great my skin feels after using this product. I&#x27;d never used any Murad products before, but I will definitely buy more now.</li>
            <li> I am not as pleased with the Shield Age Spot product.  I have age spots.  I have been using this product on a daily bases and I have not seen any of the age spots disappear.  The Murad website stated that this product was guaranteed and with the price I thought I would be more satisfied</li>
            <li> Great price. Didn&#x27;t see much of a change in my face.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years from Ulta. You can imagine my delight when I found it on Amazon for quite a bit less! I have freckles and over the years between sun damage and age, they have begun to run together. I used to only use it once summer ended to diminish the affects of the summer sun and the &#x27;dirty&#x27; looks of my cheeks. Now I use it all year round and combined with sunscreen, I no longer have the large brown patches on the sides of my cheeks. This product has also greatly diminished a dark spot that I had on my upper cheek. Over the years I have tried many products and I can honestly say this is the only product I have found that has truly worked on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have the larger bottle and LOVE it; this is for travel only; awesome, awesome product!  Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone over 40.</li>
            <li> Love it, got here quick and it works work. My melasma is started to look way lighter.</li>
            <li> I am an African American with Amber colored skin. I ordered this product for dark acne blemishes that I&#x27;ve had since high school. Im 26 now. I have had the lightening serum for a month now and have seen slow progress. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as fast acting as other reviews I&#x27;ve seen, but will finish the rest of the bottle which will take me a couple months to empty. I will update then. Overall, I would recommend this product because I&#x27;m sure it works better on newer age spots and dark marks.</li>
            <li> So far, going on 4 weeks, I see very little lightening of age spots on my arms.  Iwas using it once a day but am now trying twice.</li>
            <li> I have used this product more than a week and although my dark spots are not gone, I can tell that they are getting better.  That is more than I have attained by using other products.</li>
            <li> I have read incredible reviews on this product for months and finally decided to buy it. I am amazed! Within days I could see my old acne marks leaving right before my eyes. I&#x27;ve only used for 2 weeks and almost feel like I don&#x27;t need to continue using because I&#x27;ve noticed such a difference already.</li>
            <li> I have used another brand that was cheaper that did a much better job.</li>
            <li> I am still waiting to see the results. Using everyday for last 3 weeks but no pigment lightening so far. Update later if see any improvement. Heard and read so much about it so thought let me try?</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all.  I never broke out in any products but I did with this one.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> If I could give this a zero, I would. It didn&#x27;t do anything!!!! Wish I could get my money back. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Guess it does not for some. I got an IPL photo facial and done. Brown spots gone.  The IPL was only 50 more dollars.  Wish I could get a refund.</li>
            <li> I liked this since this wasn&#x27;t sticky but just fit on my skin. But I got some pimples in a week from using this product. Im not sure if this is due to this product or if it is from something I ate. I need to see.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d hit gold with this since Murad&#x27;s other products work so wonderfully but unfortunately for my acne prone skin, it broke me out pretty bad. Def faded my scars and pigmentation but, alas, I had to discontinue use per my sensitive skin :(</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit each day.  I use it in the morning and at night before bed.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about two weeks, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference.  I&#x27;m a Black woman with medium-deep brown skin with dark spots on my cheeks from hyper-pigmentation and acne.  Seems to be evening them out very nicely.  I&#x27;m definitely impressed with it.  It doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on skin, and smells nice.  I layer it underneath my SPF moisturizer so that I can still get solid results with sun protection.</li>
            <li> This was a first time order and it seems to be working fairly well. Some spots seem to be lightening.</li>
            <li> This product is a total and complete rip-off.  I looked it up and read the ingredients.  It is nothing but hydroquinone 2% cream.  You can buy hydroquinone 2% cream made by other companies all day long at Walmart for around $5.00.  I actually bought a 2 oz. jar of the 2% cream at my local Walmart store in the section with products for African Americans for $5.00. I used it daily for 3 months on two age spots on my face and it didn&#x27;t work. They seemed to fade for awhile and then came back.  And I wear sunscreen on my face all the time. I saw Murad advertised, I believe on TV, and looked up their website and it&#x27;s nothing but hydroquinone 2% and for $60.00 on their website!  You can get hydroquinone 4% cream but I was told by a pharmacist that it requires a prescription and he said it costs about $50.00. I did see some 4% cream offered on Amazon though for about $35.00. Anyway, shame on you, Dr. Murad!</li>
            <li> I am almost sixty and have tried many age spot removal creams; this one works by far the best... it has almost completely removed  facial age spots that I have been working on for years!  As a bonus, it makes my skin soft and almost flawless.  I has a woman, who found out my age, ask me what I use on my face!  It is a bit expensive, but very worth it.</li>
            <li> I am still waiting to see if it will fade dark spots.  I have not seen any results and have been using it for more than 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I like my face  the more I use it. Ever day it&#x27;s closer to the Original.</li>
            <li> Used this product for 4 months. I did lighten age spots but did not take them completely away. You still notice them without make-up. I will use only because lighter age spots are better, but wish it lightened them more.</li>
            <li> Another product that seems to be all hype. Maybe I should keep waiting. Waiting. And waiting. For it to maybe work!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 years now and am really happy to be able to get it so much cheaper on line. I have never had any issues and am pleased with the results. It doesn&#x27;t remove serious skin damage from the sun, but it definitely evens out your skin tone. Delivery from Amazon is always reliable and the price can&#x27;t be beat. Even with coupons in retails stores.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of age spots on my face that are not very dark so I was hoping this would get rid of them in a hurry.  I do like the texture of the serum, and the age spots may have faded slightly, but they are still noticeable even after being more than halfway through the bottle.  I really like Murad products but this pigment lightening serum did not work as I hoped it would.  The smell is also pretty strong.  Will probably not reorder.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I believe it is old or damaged..the product has a bad smell to it when I apply it to my face and also clumps up when applying it, rather than it being smooth and absorbing into my skin it just sits on my skin and clumps up.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it for long, but really like it so far</li>
            <li> I used this for a while​ before I knew there were other products available, it didn&#x27;t work as I expected and with shelling out sixty dollars ever so often and I wasn&#x27;t seeing any result after almost five months.Just doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> this product wasnt what i expected not really sure if you have to use with other murad products but it was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife.  Started using it.  Takes time to see the effect</li>
            <li> Superior dark spot lighting product.  Have been really happy with all murad products I have tried.  Also got a good price</li>
            <li> Since I started using Rapid Age Spot Serum it works very well.  The spots are gradually fading.  I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail so quickly!! I&#x27;ve used Murad acne products before and it helped my face until my skin got used to it and quit working. This product was recommended by a sephora consultant to help redness and dark spots. Third day using this and Nothing so far. (Duh) I use a facial massage roller to penetrate deeper into my skin. I would use this at night only. I feel good about this product and will update two weeks from now.</li>
            <li> I bought his book on cellulite, which was basically just a promotion for his products. I bought the spot-reducer for my face, cream for my thighs, and vitamins for two months. The result: ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE. Total price was about $300 (Waste of money, time, energy, and effort). Should have gone to a laser clinic for an hour!</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth its weight in gold.  I actually had someone at work ask me what I&#x27;d been doing to my skin.  Made my day.  I will be a life long user.</li>
            <li> Over 3 month period, I have seen noticable improvement. Dh this productark spots are much lighter. I am satisfied with&lt;br /&gt;this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since a month now. I don&#x27;t find any difference. The sun spots are as it is on my face. At this point I feel it&#x27;s a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month...no results yet.  But I guess it takes a while to see results.  I will continue for another month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too soon to know if it&#x27;s working.  After 2 weeks, I don&#x27;t see any change.  I think it could be a little lower priced.</li>
            <li> It is a real result against a promise. .In fact the product is serious and effective. A rare exemple of honesty.</li>
            <li> I have seen substantial improvement. I use this every night without fail.  I am confident that within a few months the dark spots that my acne cause will be gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in addition to my PMD kit and I can already see the dark spots breaking up. Warning - I read that the chemical in this shows up in your bloodstream after 2 months of use, so you should discontinue use after two months, and wait two months before continuing.</li>
            <li> There is one tiny brown spot on my face where I applied this daily, even a few times a day some days, for 2 months and it did absolutely nothing, Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks, just always pricey. Gets rid of marks from old breakouts nicely. Lightens freckles too. Works great on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Been trying other whiting solutions didn&#x27;t see a difference on my skin . Been using it for a month in half , my spots look lighter I can see a difference . Love it</li>
            <li> I have a few &amp;#34;stubborn&amp;#34; brown spots on my forehead mainly so I used this for a few months and I&#x27;d say they faded &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34; but not as much as I&#x27;d hoped. I&#x27;ve tried many products (also tried the derma rollers &amp;#34;needling&amp;#34;)  to get rid of the spots and finally opted for a &amp;#34;medium TCA peel&amp;#34; which has been the best for me so far.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I used that I actually got results!  My dark spots are significantly lighter in just a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried the MURAD AGE SPOT AND PIGMENT LIGHTENING GEL for a full three months (entire bottle), following the directions each night...although I did NOT add the ESSENTIAL C NIGHT MOISTURIZER as it suggests on the packaging. Perhaps is is the second product that makes a difference in the outcome, but using this product alone did nothing to fade my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a caucasian woman in my forties and have combination skin with dark spots across the cheeks that are probably a result of years of sun damage. I faithfully wear sunscreen and have for years now, so the process seemed to have stopped. I wanted to reverse the discoloration that I was left with and hoped that a targeted \\&quot;age spot and pigment lightening gel\\&quot; would be just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no success myself with using the Murad lightener and can&#x27;t recommend it to those with middle-age pigmented skin. I did not see any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As above, it did suggest that it be used with a second product, and perhaps that would make a difference, but I am not going to waste any more money myself trying to find out. Too bad, since I had high hopes after seeing other success stories.</li>
            <li> okay have not seen a big differents</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my hands sue to sun damage.  I found that I had quick results fading the dark spots to barely being noticeable!</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, have not seen any results yet. Been using for almost 4 weeks on a sun spot.</li>
            <li> It worth not your money. It did absolutely nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li> It took possibly 3 bottles to start to see the results , my skin is much more even toned, beautiful, I will continue using it as my complexion has improved very much .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to have patient using this product , plus I use sunscreen on my face to prevent further discolorations .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to admit that I fail to use this product everyday as I just get in a hurry and forget or don&#x27;t take the time.  Maybe if I used it everyday I would see the results they promise.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY  WORKS!  this is the only over the  counter  fade serum  that has  ever  worked &amp;  fast  that I&#x27;ve  ever  tried.  I  saw  quick results.  So happy with  the  way  my  skin  looks  now. Most  of  my  dark spots  are  gone &amp; I  don&#x27;t  have to  wear a  bunch  of  foundation  to  cover  dark  spots.  The serum  is lightweight &amp;  not  oily! It also prevents pimples  from  becoming  dark  on  my fair African-American complexion.</li>
            <li> It works. But you have to keep using it because the spots come back. And you have to avoid the sun as well. But it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s made a difference for the three age spots I have on my right cheek.</li>
            <li> this works well for me ! I see the spots I have  wanted to disappear ,finally  fading away  thank you !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Murad for a few weeks in the morning and in the evening.  So far, the sun damage spots are getting lighter and lighter.  I&#x27;ve purchased many other products including the Clinique that is advertised everywhere, and nothing has made a difference.  I purchased products that were twice the price of Murad with no results.  This by far has worked the best.  Pretty amazing product.</li>
            <li> i do not write reviews (ever) but felt compelled to do a review for this product. I am medium toned ,AA female and had a bad scar from a burn on my face for 15 yrs. It is virtually gone in 3 wks b/c of this product.I was so skeptical at first but am so thankful I bought this .Buy this for any skin discoloration , you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this works for me fine.  It does fade scars, and lighten some discolorations.  However, does not do a lot for freckles....</li>
            <li> Have to say this is very well priced - - I looked all over the Internet and this was the most discounted price for the product.  However, it just doesn&#x27;t work!  I&#x27;ve followed the directions to the letter and after several weeks there has been no change to my pigmentation.  Even worse, my skin has broken out horribly around areas where I apply the serum!  So, no positive benefits and instead break outs on my cheeks, chin and neck :(  Wish I had found a way to try the serum for a few days before purchase (i.e., a sample) so I would have determined it was ineffective for me.</li>
            <li> This product does not take away post acne marks, maybe it will work better for someone with dark spots instead.  I&#x27;ll try whatever I can to get those post-acne marks to go away.</li>
            <li> This product does work!  I have used it for three weeks now and my age spots are almost gone.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My face look 100% better than it did three weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on the products and plan to stick with it for a year.&lt;br /&gt;My face look so much better.  I even look pretty without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Now that in it self is a reason to try it.</li>
            <li> This wonderful product quickly did away with the dark circles under my eyes, as well as a birthmark I&#x27;ve always found annoying.  Only a tiny bit is needed, and it&#x27;s colorless, so it doesn&#x27;t show, as some products do.  I&#x27;ve tried other products, and this one is so good, they may as well just disappear from the market!</li>
            <li> It is waste of money. If I can give zero star I would do that. The product smells like alcohol and very sticky. It is like a mixture of alcohol and syrup. Anyway I had no choice since I opened it. I have been using it and it is almost finished, but my dark spots are never changed. I feel they are even darker than before. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME.</li>
            <li> After coming home with extra freckles from my 6 week vacation in Hawaii, I decided to give this a try before an IPL.  After 3 months of using this I don&#x27;t see any results besides break outs which I haven&#x27;t had in 20 years! I do not recommend!!   I will try the Laniege brand-bright renew line which they have launched at target.  It&#x27;s a popular make up brand from Korea and Seoul, Korea is the beauty capital of the world!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that noticeably eliminates spots and visible signs of aging after just several uses.</li>
            <li> This was kind of expensive item for me to purchase and the first time for me to try serums to help with blemishes. I have used Murad before and it always worked for me. Unfortunately this one did not. I have gone through 3/4 of the bottle and it has not even made a dent on my blemishes</li>
            <li> I must admit, it really works...and quickly.  I&#x27;m 52 and starting to get those lovely age/hormone spots.  This faded them really well.  Not completely gone, but barely noticeable.  Only have to use a little and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product everyday for about 3 weeks have not seen any results in lightening my sunspots. Will continue to use and repost if I see any change. UPDATE Used for 3 months has done nothing to lighten age spots or sun spots. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This Product is the first one that work well for me, and I have used many product on my face.</li>
            <li> Have been using this serum on and off for a few months and like it very much.  They do lighten up your spots but don&#x27;t expect them to disappear completely.  Will continue to use this product - love the Murad line.</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin is a bit of a train wreck - dry, bad pigment, cracky sometimes, too. I&#x27;m very particular about the products I buy for my skin - always looking for new ones and reading up on what&#x27;s the new healthy trend for them. It&#x27;s an uphill battle as I&#x27;ll never catch up with the trends, but hey, at least I try. I had heard about this product via one of my weekly searches and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product - I can certainly see a change in my pigment. I followed directions religiously as I always do and it worked in my favor. I plan to continue to use. It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product delivered fast results!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast shipping.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This thing works wonders. I have really bad acne scarring all over my face and when i tried this as a same, it literally started lightening them up within a few days and in a week some were almost gone. Im happy i found a full size one for half the price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product; I have had very good results from using it. Very quick service, very happy with product.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of lightening serum I have purchased.  I saved lots of money buying from this vendor and not direct from Murad.  Product works great.  Have told lots of people about this product.</li>
            <li> I started using the Murad products about 3 weeks ago now and I am amazed at my skin!!! I love washing my face now because I SEE and FEEL a difference.  Don&#x27;t let negative reviews get you down!! Get with a Murad dealer such as Massage Envy and let someone pick the right product for you.  I have never had a product change my skin like this!!  Its soft, bright, the age spots are disappearing - gone, no- but SO much better!! I need less makeup now and its looks better on my skin!! I can&#x27;t say enough about these products!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5 months now and have been using it consistently every night. I am in my 30&#x27;s and am trying to lighten/remove my sunspots, uneven tone, and old acne scars.      I have never used this type of hydroquinone based product and so far I have had good results, but it is very gradual for me. Perhaps some people it will be fast and some it may not work at all. But for me, it does work very gradually. I saw mild results after a couple weeks but it is very very gradual.      I did not aggravate my skin when I put it on at night. I made sure to put it on at night only and not in the daytime as they said not to. Also I made sure to put on suncreen every day too like they suggested.    Depending on how much you put on and use; initially I put it on generously on my cheeks and it helps even skin tone and sun spots to be a more uniform and lighter color.  I am now spot treating each sun spot as my skin tone is a nice even tone now, but my sun spots are still there, albeit a lighter color.      I did not use this in conjunction with the other Murad vitamin C product that they recommended; I will start using that this month in conjunction with this product in hopes of getting even better results.    Overall this product definitely worked for me, but is very gradual, but I am somewhat concerned about the side-effects I hear about hydroquinone, so I plan to stop using after another month or so just to be safe.</li>
            <li> I bought Murad Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum several months ago.  I used it religiously as directed every day.  Unfortunately, it did nothing for my age spots.  Apparently it works great for some people according to the reviews, but I am 60 years old and some age spots or sun damage began to appear on my face within the last 5 years.  It had no effect what-so-ever on any of them.  The product does last a long time and I will continue to use what little I have left, but will not purchase it again.  I will continue to  try other products for age spots if I can find some that aren&#x27;t too unreasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for age and sun spots! I have used this for a few weeks now,only where I need it,and I can see a noticeable difference.my spots are much LESS noticeable now!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and service!</li>
            <li> Works amazing for spot and Sun damage. I developed what looked like nose freckles due to Sun exposure and it had taken them away almost completely. With continued use I&#x27;m sure it will disappear. Great product!!! My mom is also hooked on it for more advanced damage still works amazing!!! Update: I&#x27;ve ordered this product again, received it within 3 day and it is still one of mine/mom favorite products.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well.  I purchased the Rapid Age Spot serum in the hopes of removing a couple of prominent spots from my hand and face.  It&#x27;s been slowly working on these spots, but I was surprised to see how much it&#x27;s improved the overall color of my skin.  The tiny spots I had all over have disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have read very good things about this product, so I ordered it and does seem to be working on my age spots.</li>
            <li> Works great, I received compliments at work telling me my complexion looked good, asking what make up I was using.</li>
            <li> I feel a little tingling but it is instructed that on the product.. need to be careful with the sun..need to use a sun block.</li>
            <li> I had a sunspot on my upper eyelid that is now completely gone and cheek spots are clearly lighter and continuing to fade.  I use this twice a day - after cleansing and before putting on a moisturizer with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed and recommend this highly.  I&#x27;m thinking of trying other Murad products.  Yes, more expensive than some, but this is the first one of this type that actually delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had spontaneous compliments on my complexion too.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously for three months and saw no difference, even though my spots are relatively light. I have a few friends who  had spots removed by laser, and that is the only thing I have seen that  works. This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> I tried this product and gave me a really bad rash. i have used many different products (expensive to non-expensive) and none have reacted on my skin.  i have a really nice skin, never had any problems.  please be extra careful i would not want another person to go through what i am going through. however, if you decide to try this product, please test on a very small section of your face and neck, until you see if it works.  However, i do not believe it is worthy to buy this product.  There are many good products in the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a week at night.  Maybe 35% faded already.  I have very fair light skin with freckles.  I have the spots that come from melasma, which I&#x27;ve been dealing with for years.  I had a prescription a couple of years ago for triluma.  That never worked at all after months of usage.  Also, the Olay prodcut did nothing for me.  So I picked this because it was 2% hydroquinine.  I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t go for 4%.  This stuff is harsh.  I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno moisturizer with SPF 30 daily for years, so find a similar product and put on every morning before your makeup.  You MUST use SPF (30 or higher) with this product! I went for a run with lots of sweatproof sunscreen but still turned red where I used the serum.  I skipped treatment that night.  Anyway, this stuff really dries my skin out.  I&#x27;m only using it on my dark spots.  They are definitely lightening.  I&#x27;m hoping to discontinue use in a few weeks.  It&#x27;s the first thing that has worked.  I need a lot less concealer to make the spots disappear.  I&#x27;m very happy about that.  If you are pregnant or breast feeding, you should Not use this.  Estée Lauder makes a good concealer, double wear.  Even if spots don&#x27;t lighten much more, I&#x27;m way better off than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- almost 4 weeks of use- skin isn&#x27;t as irritated with use anymore- dark spots 80% faded.  IMO if you don&#x27;t have any results in a few weeks, discontinue use and try something else.  I added a fifth star because I thought after the Rx and Olay did nothing that I was stuck with the dark spots forever.  And they were above my lip, so looked like a mustache, I felt very self conscious.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this out to get rid of brownish discoloration on my face. I used it one day and broke out in horrible acne. It figures. Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have overall good skin but have acne scars/ sunspots on my cheeks. I used this product for many months (2 times daily) and did not notice any changes. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a esthetician.  I love it!  The product is clear like a serium and light on the face.  I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin since using this product.  I am out side a lot and this product helps get rid of sun spots, evens out the skin, and nourishes the skin.  I put it on once a day at night after my shower.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned African American, who has been using the product for two to three weeks.  The reason I use the product is to lighten dark areas around my chin due to facial hair removal.  This product appears to be working, but it&#x27;s not an overnight process.</li>
            <li> The esthetician who gave me a facial recommended this serum for my skin. Should&#x27;ve known she was just pushing products but I&#x27;ve used other Murad products before and they&#x27;re pretty decent. This serum on the other hand, was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old Caucasian woman with moderate age spots on my face and hands.  I used this product every day as directed for 4 weeks with absolutely no noticeable results.  Useless, from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> I have been using fairly regularly for two months and do not notice any improvement at all.  I am going to see if I can return it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything except make your eyes water (even when not close to your eyes)... Disappointed I spent money on this:-/</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this wonderful potion and as their advertising claims, I saw rapid results. Really, the difference is astonishing. The skin on my face and decollete area had become so sun damaged from years of loving the beach. Now the spots seem like they are melting away and the uneven skin tone is all but gone. Not bad after using a product for less than two weeks! So I am now applying this to a few dark spots on my arms which have bugged me for years and make me look older than I have to. I will continue to buy this miracle stuff in a bottle as long as Murad makes it. I also love that I can get it from Amazon in 2 days and I am not forced into an auto ship program through Murad&#x27;s site. I was so impressed with this product that I ordered the Resurgence kit as well. Just got that today so we shall see but if it those products are anything like this one I&#x27;ll be one happy woman!</li>
            <li> Ever since my mom turned 40 she started getting age spots on her face. After seeing my mom being down for the longest time because of the brown spots, I did some research and came across this powerful gel. At first I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews but I prayed they were true. It&#x27;s been three weeks now and my mom is finally smiling again! This gel truly works. The age spots did not go away right away, but three weeks after, they are certainly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the fast change in the age spots! I will continue using it to see ultimate results quickly!</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, improves my skin tone, and you only need a little amount to cover all your face area.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to a person with dry/sensitive skin.  Also the smell is very very strong...(similar to vodka) I have a combination skin with oily T-zone and this serum improved my skin tone when used with Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Renewal Complex. 2 for better moisturization.  Little bit pricey... :(</li>
            <li> Out of all the facial spot removers I have tried this shows  the most promise and quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 year old black male with a medium complexion, I had dark spots from pimples and they really started to bother me. But after just 1 week of using this I actually did notice a difference and now that I finished the bottle (About 3 months later) most of the spots on my face have completely faded and the really dark ones are significantly lighter and smaller. I 100% recommend this product!</li>
            <li> not so sure about this product as it tends to create a sticky film that rubs off if I apply makeup over it. I don&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other &amp;#34;dark spot&amp;#34; lighteners and this is by far the best!  Very noticeable improvement in just a matter of a week to 10 days.  And it only takes a small amount for each application.  I have plenty left to ward off future spots.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple weeks now and it has removed some of the brown spots from my face.  I doesn&#x27;t come with very good instructions though so I have been winging it.</li>
            <li> I have been using for one week, and Murad has made the age spots a bit lighter&lt;br /&gt;but they are still there, but it took me a long time to get them, so maybe a while&lt;br /&gt;longer for them to be gone.  I have tried alot of products and at least this one did&lt;br /&gt;what it said lightened up the age spots.</li>
            <li> Great product! I Originally started using it when i was given a sample at Sephora and i liked the results! I ordered it and i&amp;#34;ve been using it now for about tree weeks. I see the brown spots getting lighter already. It&#x27;s a gentle product that works gradually without irritating or drying the skin and I am happy about  that because it does not make my make up look blotchy when i apply it the next day!  I just have to make sure to use a wash cloth with warm water when i wash my face and that removes all the dead cells released by the product leaving my skin tone and texture pretty even! I recommend the product to someone who is willing to be patient and  not to expect to get results over night.  I am using it all over the face not just on the spots and i can see an even skin tone already!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. My dark color spots had change to red at 1st and now it&#x27;s almost gone.</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised! I love Murad and I only purchase my products from Mass Beauty!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this serum for about a month now. its not immediate results; but if u stick to ur facial routine everyday, it does work. started noticing my dark marks getting lighter after about a week. worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! I can really see a difference within a few weeks! My complexion is much brighter, it doesn&#x27;t look as tired and the dark spots that have started showing up in recent years have faded!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Love it.</li>
            <li> One of my main staples in my skin care regime.  It&#x27;s amazing &amp; really balances out the pigment in your skin.</li>
            <li> It did not work on Age Spot and Pigmentation at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for more than two weeks now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a lot of results. Goes on nicely but I don&#x27;t see the brown spots fading. I&#x27;ve been using the product for four weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product doesn&#x27;t get a full 5-star review.  It works for my skin, and I have very troublesome olive Mediterranean skin that is prone to hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other products that simply did NOT work (that had the same promises).  This one DOES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must be good for Mediterranean skin types.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month there is no difference in my brown spots this stuff doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> pigment  is lightening up. wish i would have take a before picture. Fabulous, you just have stick with it use twice a day morning and at bed time.</li>
            <li> After 4 months use - very little if any difference in dark spots on my face.  Very disappointed after seeing glowing advertisements in every woman&#x27;s magazine I&#x27;ve opened in the past year or more!</li>
            <li> Works wonders!!! My deep acne marks were totally gone in a month! Definitely recommend to anyone who has trouble with marks</li>
            <li> I can see a slight difference ,had a spot near my eyebrow that has faded.Not a product to use occasionally ,must use daily for best results.</li>
            <li> I followed directions exactly for the full bottle and did not experience any lightening of age spots or skin. Disappointing after reading many positive reviews and purchased on the quality of the Murad name.</li>
            <li> the Rapid Age Spot and Pigment Lightening Serum, is a good product it has met my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my first bottle from a department store and was so happy to find it on Amazon for such a&lt;br /&gt;great price.</li>
            <li> this did not work for me</li>
            <li> I have some age spots which just showed up in the past year and discoloration due to pimples. The discoloration tends to fade after a long time, but I wanted something faster. The Murad is ... just okay. After one month, the age spots are still there. The discoloration is still there. I do like the way my skin looks at night after I&#x27;ve applied it. But so far, no discernible results. I&#x27;ll continue using for as long as I have product left. If my skin improves by then, I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> I have melasma &amp; if I&#x27;m not covering up my embarrassing spots with 8 tons of make up I&#x27;m hiding my face! But since I have tried this product on a whim (even though I have tried a lot of other products only to be let down...) It doesn&#x27;t take all the dark pigment away but it TRULY HELPS!!! Makes me not so ashamed of my face looking like a leopard. Give it a shot I was pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> i used the product two or three times a day for the first few weeks.  then i decreased to once or twice a day.  i just finished the bottle, about 3 months after i started using it.  my dark spot about the size of a dime is 90% lighter.  so i&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the only lightening product that I have used that really works, use daily for a month and see significant results, Love it!</li>
            <li> Really good product but much on the internet about it being dangerous to use.</li>
            <li> Great for dark spots.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my age spots.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with all these lightening products.  They don&#x27;t work and you end up frustrated and disappointed.  Go to a board certified dermatologist and get the brown spots removed professionally.  It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Initially concerned about the hydroquinone presence but was very impressed with the results.&lt;br /&gt; Dark brown patches began to fade to pink very quickly. Fully intended to purchase the full size but was diverted by another product on Amazon that apparently worked particularly well with my skin coloring (dark olive)&lt;br /&gt;Have to say that the &#x27;Porcelaina&#x27;  is also working very well so far and contains other &#x27;skin lightening&#x27; ingredients, slightly less expensive.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hands and it did work my brown spot got light it I use it every night love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and it has reduced some red areas on my face, but they are far from gone.  I&#x27;ll continue using it and hope it gets rid of all the redness.</li>
            <li> Excellent for skin lightening.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months, and I get all kinds of compliments on my skin.  This product works.</li>
            <li> The product came as described and was delivered quickly.  Love this product</li>
            <li> I spent $65 on this product and used it for three months with no results at all.  Totally was not worth it for me.  This was terribly disappointing.  Didn&#x27;t like the fragrance or stickiness of this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after noticing some dark skin discoloration on my upper lip. Within a week of using this product the discoloration faded. Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This stuff works for real. I actually first bought just a Murad sample kit from Sephora, not wanting to spend too much money if it didn&#x27;t work. I used the age spot serum as directed and seriously noticed a BIG difference in a week or two. It&#x27;s the only stuff I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve ever seen results with, especially that quickly and dramatically&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used up all the sample size and didn&#x27;t get a second bottle for a while, trying to go a cheaper route and see if anything else worked. I couldn&#x27;t find anything that gave results and decided I&#x27;d go back to what worked and bought this size. I used it again as directed and again noticed a huge difference in a few weeks. My dark spots are almost unnoticeable by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that when I first start using this stuff each time after a few days or weeks of a break from it, my skin will start to feel a little bubbly. Like when you get a sun burn and sometimes it starts forming water blisters. Whatever is forming on your face is not water blisters, but its just what it feels like. It is a little noticeable, but I think people would have to be really paying attention to see it. I feel like this reaction is the stuff actually working, and it only lasts a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to note that, yes there is humongous difference in my skin tone after a couple weeks and my spots reduce greatly. However, I find that after that initial reduction there is little-to-no reduction after that with continuous use. So I suggest using this stuff as directed, twice a day, for a month or two and let it reduce the spots, then maybe refrain from use for another month or two. Again, I think the skin bubbling is the result of this stuff actually working and I don&#x27;t get that reaction with continuous use, just after the first couple weeks. So I let my skin have a break from it and then bring it back in to my routine after a while.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product. I can say that it truly fades dark spots. It doesn&#x27;t work overnight, it takes a  couple of weeks to see some lightening and it doesn&#x27;t make them completely fade. However I have used this for three weeks and will continue using it. After all, it says if you don&#x27;t see any improvement in three months, discontinue use. Therefore I am going to use this for at least a total of three months. I expect it to fade the spots more. Even if the spots aren&#x27;t completely gone by that time, I will be very pleased that they have lightened so much. I will add comments to this review then.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing on age spots on my face. They disappeared.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum every day- half the bottle is gone and I haven&#x27;t not seen the slightest difference in my age spots. Very dissapointing!</li>
            <li> Since November 2010, I&#x27;ve been using Murad&#x27;s Post acne gel, which is pretty much the same as this product (give or take a little ingredients here and there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first time using Murad Environmental Shield Age Spot, I discovered a horrible stench that the post acne gel didn&#x27;t have. I regret buying it but will use it till I get the post acne gel which I will go back to. :(</li>
            <li> I love Murad products!</li>
            <li> I like it. Faded my one age spot a bit. Hoping it fades more. I notice it clears up my skin if I have a pimple too. People have complained about the smell but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, goes away once it drys on the face. I use it at at night all over my face, neck, and declate, but make sure to use a sph in the morning always.</li>
            <li> Great product. Cleared up my skin in two weeks or less. This is my third bottle. I will use this from now on.</li>
            <li> Used with a facial cleansing scrubber is best. Huge improvement with acne blemishes!! At times when it seemed to stop fading marks, I began to use every other day, then back to daily and I seen additional improvements.</li>
            <li> It was a great deal. It shipped when it was supposed to. Glad I got it here.</li>
            <li> Works great at first on dark age spots that are closer to the surface. However it does continue to work, it just takes longer. So keep up with the daily use and you will continue to see progress.</li>
            <li> not bad, it doesn&#x27;t smell good...</li>
            <li> I used a &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; sample of this product and it definitely lightened my age spot.  Just waiting on the this to continue use to see if it will disappear completely.</li>
            <li> Use this often and it is the best thing I have found but it is expensive.  I have used it faithfully and it has definitely helped, but has never eliminated the spots completely.  I think it has prevented more and has lightened the ones I have quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I look fresher! This product is great, I ordered another bottle, it&#x27;s evening out my sunspots.  It&#x27;s kind of sticky, but it&#x27;s worth the $$</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom, she puts it every night but I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in her face but it is working gradually.</li>
            <li> I love the murad product line and this one is no exception.  Not only does it lighten brown spots rapidly, but it also leaves my skin very smooth and soft.  It almost resurfaces it!  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Came with broken seal on box, four corners on box looked old and peeling, pump did not work. Shipping it back.</li>
            <li> Love Murad, Great price!</li>
            <li> I just bought a full bottle, THEN did my research (I do things backward sometimes) and learned the main ingredient in this Murad product is a substance that is BANNED in other countries, called hydroquinone. Google it! It causes tumors. Mine is going in the trash! SHAME ON MURAD.</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews but as I reorder this product I feel I need to help anyone out there who is looking for some guidance.  As a child I didn&#x27;t wear sunscreen.  I had an &amp;#34;olive&amp;#34; complection and never got sunburned so my family unfortunately thought it was unnecessary.  I had a few freckles on my face growing up but nothing major.  As an adult pregnant with my first child I got the &amp;#34;pregnancy mask&amp;#34; that faded after I gave birth.  With my second child, it unfortunately did not fade and I was left with what looked like my freckles just kind of exploded and joined together on my face.  I tried every product I could find - regardless of price - and also tried any at home method I heard of (lemon juice, etc.).  My dermatologist told me that it was just really one of the hardest things to get rid of.  He gave me some Tretinoin cream for a little bit of acne that I was having and basically told me that was all he could do.  I started using the cream and then bought a bottle of Murad Lightening serum.  Immediately - IMMEDIATELY - I could see a difference.  It literally started working and lightening my spots within the first few days.  I was amazed.  That was in October and it is now February and my complection is completely clear.  I wish I would have taken a before and after close up but I really didn&#x27;t think it was going to work any better than the other things I have tried in the past.  I don&#x27;t know if the Murad is the &amp;#34;cure all&amp;#34; by itself or if the Tretinoin that I had been using had a factor in it but I&#x27;m still using both and ordering a new bottle of Murad today.  I am very anxious to see what happens when I get out in the sun this summer but I plan to try NOT to get sun on my face.  I have been an avid sunscreen user since my problems came up but I think I might just wear a big hat all summer and not get ANY sun on my face if possible.  :)  Hope this helps someone!</li>
            <li> Did lighten spot on my face a little bit but not as much as I was hoping. Giving this product 3 stars</li>
            <li> the only thing it lightened was my wallet.. I wanted it to work, but like so many other products, it did not.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product after reading mixed reviews but have to say it&#x27;s working for me.  I developed chloasma after having my kids and some faded but I have one dark spot just under my eye. It&#x27;s very noticeable and makeup doesn&#x27;t cover it.  I feel like everyone sees it and thinks it&#x27;s age spots. Too early for that. However, after using Murad for five weeks I&#x27;m happy to share that it&#x27;s working! The spot is half gone and to the point where foundation mostly covers it.  This is a wonderful product that requires patience.  You won&#x27;t see overnight results but you will see them over time! Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Works on age spots on the face.</li>
            <li> Seen results in a week very satisfied will repurchased this item again</li>
            <li> I have pigmentation from being pregnant and for years have tried everything. This serum actually helped a lot. The spots on my forehead have almost disappeared and my skin looks amazing. I did exfoliate a lot before each use though, and I use extra virgin coconut oil as a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been using this religiously for several months, twice daily. My sun spots are only slightly lighter.  I was really expecting better results than this by now.</li>
            <li> If i could return this i would .  absolutely nothing, zero, nil , nada happened, not even a tiny tingle.  I think this was a complete waste of money and certainly cannot recommend it</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!  Does not work AT ALL!  Plus this is very expensive to boot so I was pretty disappointed. Try Clinique age spot corrector instead.  Saw results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This product was okay.  I could see that it was starting to lighten my brown spots but ultimately it did not work fast enough for me so I have switched products trying something else.  I can verify that it does lighten though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it lightening spots at all, but I do like how it feels on my face, so I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for 7 weeks. I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference so far (post acne dark spots/freckles) However, the product isn&#x27;t greasy &amp; absorbs quickly so you can apply moisturizer directly after. I&#x27;m going to try this out for a few more months and see what happens- still optimistic.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with a few tan spots on one cheek. I used this faithfully for a month and saw no difference. For the price, I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white/fair skinned, 34, have lived in CO my whole life and have gotten LOTS of sun and burns.  I went to Whole Foods and they had a Visia complexion analysis there that showed me my scores compared to other women my age and in sun spots and IV damage, my scores were BAD!!  I freaked out and have since been using every product I can find that will help me.  I periodically go back and do find my scores have been getting better.  I used the whole Murad environmental defense line - every product they have.  And it did help my scores.  So did the Clinique even better dark spot corrector when used in conjunction with their repair ware laser focus UV damage correcting serum.  Another line I like for lightening/brightening is MyChelle- apple brightening cleanser, apple brightening mist, serum, cream and peel along with their perfect c serum (applied under the apple brightening serum) also made my scores better on the sun damage and uv damage.  So as far as Murad, liked, loved it, but I&#x27;m always on to try the next thing so I would recommend it to anyone - try it!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered Murad Shield Age Spot Lightener. I have certainly seen an improvement and lightening of the dark age spots I have on my face. I still must use cosmetics to cover the dark areas but my skin has improved.</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t see much fading of my age spots.  I don&#x27;t think its worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the serum and I love it! All of my acne scars from the past 6 months or so went away! I have 1 scar that I am hoping will fade away by the end of this bottle. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this product and l loved it so I purchased the whole bottle.  It takes time but it does lighten age spots.</li>
            <li> So far this product has work great. Smaller pores, lighter sun spots.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is truly working but seems like it is.  I have hard sun spots that I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive Shiseido product to cheap Ambi... I can&#x27;t tell but after I finish the bottle, I can review better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it actually works.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of malasma on my face that nothing seems to cure.  I was hoping this product would help because I love Murad, but it has only slightly.  It is light weight and smells ok - just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for almost 5 months now and I love it. It made my age/brown spot very light. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a considerable difference but I did expect the results to happen faster. I still haven&#x27;t achieved the result I expected but so far so good. I would recommend it and since it&#x27;s not tested on animals, I love the product.</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;m 50, white, medium tone skin, some freckles.  I don&#x27;t use sunblock, but I don&#x27;t go outside much.  In the last few years I&#x27;ve noticed age spots starting to appear on the side of my face.  They started out pale brown and have gotten darker until they&#x27;re now as dark as a dark freckle.  I love murad products (resurgence is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used for looking younger) so I was optimistic when I bought this age spot pigment lightening gel  a couple of years ago.(after all, it&#x27;s supposed to be specifically FOR age spots)  Honestly I put it in a drawer and forgot about it until about 3 weeks ago when I noticed my spots were getting darker and I remembered I&#x27;d bought it.  I started using it every night after cleansing my face, just as directed.  I have not missed a night in 3 weeks, and simultaneously I started using sun block during the day, so as not to undo my progress.  But I have to say, I don&#x27;t think I have seen any change.  And I have probably used 20% of the bottle at this point.  Granted, it could be because it&#x27;s 2 years old, but it&#x27;s sat in a dark drawer in the original packaging and it doesn&#x27;t say anything about an expiration date, so I&#x27;m thinking the stuff just isn&#x27;t that good.  Also it&#x27;s possible that if I patiently finished the whole bottle, I could see results and maybe it just works really slow.  So on a scale of one to ten, ten being THE Best, I would rate this a two based on my first 3 weeks, and my affection for Murad in general.  However, honestly, I would not recommend it, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  For this much money (and I paid $50) it should kick @ss!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works on my pigmentation. Poduct good; prince great; good delivery</li>
            <li> It smells so funny!  I do not use on my face.  I used it only my both arms, little does change but it has to be consistently.  Forgetful will missed sorely.  lol</li>
            <li> I like this and it worked quite well. Right now I am trying something else.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this just takes time . Used for a week now with no visible results. Hoping to see something soon</li>
            <li> Well, I was skeptical for the price. I don&#x27;t typically like to try products like this especially ordering online without testing it beforehand. However, I was so sick of dealing with all of my skin problems that I decided to try it after doing extensive research. I LOVE this product!!!! It works. It is as simple as that. IT WORKS! I have extremely fair and sensitive skin with frequent skin problems. I deal with blackheads, scarring, discoloration, and redness. I have tried other products to clear up my skin such as Neutrogena beta-formula lotion that supposedly lightens skin or evens the tone. I have also been using exfoliants and my favorite so far is St. Ives the standard scrub. Yet, I still deal with so many skin problems. I have tried EVERYTHING from changing my sleeping position to my eating habits and changing my hygiene routine. Finally, I have found something that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use St. Ives now to exfoliate and the pink grapefruit scrub. However, they never used to work for me like they do now. I began to wonder why some people are blessed with great skin that is natural and they STILL wear makeup. While I wear no foundation and take great care of my skin. I found that it is a combination of the product and the instrument used to clean your face. Hands don&#x27;t do that great of a job, contrary to what many commercial advertise. This is why I decided to buy an automatic facial scrubber. I bought the (MelodySusie Multifunction 4-in-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System - With 4 Different Cleanser Heads) off of Amazon through prime. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!! I use the same two cleaners as before but WOW! what a difference this tool has made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it all off - Murad Lightening Serum. This product has transformed my face. The biggest result I have seen is an even tone and less noticeable scars. I don&#x27;t get those acne scars that last for weeks after it &amp;#34;heals&amp;#34;. Instead, they disappear within days. This product isn&#x27;t going to change your life or your skin completely. But, if you have similar problems such as those I have described - you will see a drastic change. It also lasts a significant amount of time!! One pump in the am and one in the pm IF THAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!! If you are debating between other products and Murad, I can tell you that you won&#x27;t find a better product for a better deal!&#x27;t going to change your life or your skin completely.

            <li> after reading all the reviews I decided to try this product for sun damage I had on both of my arms.. I  applied  it every single day for 2 months and did not see any difference . do not waste your money . I would recommend you  visit a dermatologist instead . That is what I am going to do next .</li>
            <li> If it works, it is a very slow process. Can&#x27;t tell any visible difference after using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for over a year and it has definitely lightened the brown spots on my cheeks. It&#x27;s 1/3 less when purchased online versus at a salon or department store that carries Murad products.</li>
            <li> So far, no age spots to speak of.  I do like this product.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Works great, Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> It lightened the area, but did not erase the spots even after a month of everyday usage.</li>
            <li> did not work on my face</li>
            <li> not what it is cut out to be  expensive - not worth the price  would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Murad should say this has shellfish in it!</li>
            <li> This product removes the dark spots ...really......tightens pores also......good product</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I faithfully used the product as directed for 5 weeks and saw no fading of the age spots.  I am 63 and realize you can&#x27;t reverse age, but for the price I had hoped for at least some change.</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I can notice some minor difference.  Will continue to use it for the next few weeks to see if spots get even lighter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, rapid results. I use it with a high SPF sunscreen to avoid discoloration from coming back from getting sun.</li>
