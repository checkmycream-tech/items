            <li>I have purchased some of the most expensive bronzers and by far this is my favorite!!!!</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference right away, after first use.</li>
            <li>after my purchse, i spoke with the owner if the tanning salon i go to and asked her more about the OC line (which apparently i should have done before my first amazon tanning product purchase)</li>
            <li>The first is the cap and dispensing.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>seller shipped promptly, and included free packets of lotion, as well as contact information to order from them directly.</li>

            <li>so far, there was immediate results</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell Bad, but compared to other better smelling tanning lotions, its lack-of good smell doesn&#x27;t help the experience.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really notice a instant tan, except an orangy skin tone, that like self tanners left knee&#x27;s, elbows, and hand looking orange.</li>

            <li> This product works excellent. If your looking for a good bronzer that helps you develop good color, this is a great choice. My only complaint about the product is the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell Bad, but compared to other better smelling tanning lotions, its lack-of good smell doesn&#x27;t help the experience. If you don&#x27;t care about scent, its a great choice, easy to apply, goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion!  It has a pleasant smell, and gives me a nice even tan.  I expecially like the fact that I can pronounce the first couple ingredients because they are aloe, and avacado oil! I had never used tanning lotion before, but am glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS TWICE IT SMELLS GREAT  IT WAS DELIVERED QUICK I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend told me about how awesome this product was and how it made her darker than any other lotion she has ever used.  I do not think the same, I don&#x27;t find it any better or worse.  I do have a couple qualms with it.  The first is the cap and dispensing.  The cap opens like a water bottle.  I would expect one of the caps that has a little hole in it.  I wind up using more product than I need.  It also has a slight self tanner smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles at my girlfriends recommendation but probably would not again in the future.  The seller was great though.</li>
            <li> I have been using the OC tanning products for a few years now. They don&#x27;t leave you with the funky tanning bed smell like most lotions do!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Love the free shipping! It makes my skin soft and gives me great brown color! Be sure to rub it in evenly because it can get streaky from time to time. Even so, I will definitely be buying this lotion again.</li>
            <li> This product gives you a lot of color. I rarely ever tan and I used this just once so far, there was immediate results and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. If you are like me and burn easy and have a light complexion, this gives you result right away!!</li>
            <li> Thrilled to get the product! Exactly what the seller claimed it to be and an awesome buy!! Will definitely buy from this seller again! Super quick shipping also</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and so dose my boyfriend. It&#x27;s great at the beach too.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 25 years and have used many indoor and outdoor tanning lotions/bronzers from the legend companies to the newer ones. I had not heard of this company until I ordered this bronzer almost a month ago. The dark color/bronzing results are incredible ! The bottom line if you want the .... \\&quot;I just returned from a tropical island look\\&quot; This product delivers ! :) Trust me I have used many lotions and have been disappointed with all their hype. This lotion will not let you down. :) I just ordered another bottle. Oh yeah... dont worry about some of the reviews describing the \\&quot;orange effect\\&quot;. All one has to do is follow the directions. \\&quot;Wash and wipe hands after applying bronzer\\&quot;. ;)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have children so don&#x27;t like to use tanning lotion with tingle and this is great.  I got great results only after a week.  The tan also last and no orange color.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with product. will leave orange spots on your feet and hands if you do not rub in all lotion.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used a lot of different tanning lotions in the years that i&#x27;ve tanned and i was not very impressed with this one.  i&#x27;ve heard great things about the &#x27;new&#x27; OC line of tanning lotions, and purchased it based on the reviews on amazon.com.  i just didn&#x27;t get the great results that others seem to have noticed.  perhaps it&#x27;s more of a level one lotion.  the smell was just okay - nothing too strong, and there was no &#x27;after tan&#x27; smell.  after my purchse, i spoke with the owner if the tanning salon i go to and asked her more about the OC line (which apparently i should have done before my first amazon tanning product purchase) and she&#x27;d commented that more people seemed to like the &#x27;over night celebrity&#x27; and &#x27;show off&#x27; a lot better than the 10X.  oh well, you don&#x27;t know until you try &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Great color. My favorite out of all bronzers used. I have purchased some of the most expensive bronzers and by far this is my favorite!!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice a instant tan, except an orangy skin tone, that like self tanners left knee&#x27;s, elbows, and hand looking orange. but the color faded after a day or two.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Not sticky and dosen&#x27;t leave a residue. Does leave a little bit of an aftersmell, but gives a great deep bronze. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> seller shipped promptly, and included free packets of lotion, as well as contact information to order from them directly. Good customer service, and the lotion is great as well. Noticed a difference right away, after first use. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion. It gets me results FAST. Also a little goes a long way. Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dye my hands.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and had a very decent tan before I ordered this product but when I would put it on it would literally burn my skin for hours.  This product is def better suited for someone w/out sensative skin.  Smelled amazing tho!</li>
            <li> THANK YOU FOR THE ENGERGIZED BRONZING LOTION. IT WORKS VERY GOOD AND TANS ME THE WAY I WANTED TO BE TANNED.</li>
