            <li>I love my extensions!</li>
            <li>and they were fantastic to add fullness and length!!</li>
            <li>These extensions are amazing according to my wife.  </li>
            <li>They are really nice clip in easily and stay in good.</li>
            <li>Very soft and silky and a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister and looked perfect with her natural color!</li>
            <li>It was quite nice, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a quick boost in hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>thought there would most tell all your friends, love it</li>
            <li>and I love it....</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>I love how they feel and look.</li>
            <li>Love my hair extensions they made it to my house on time.</li>
            <li>Curled them and they held up fine.</li>
            <li>Again, the price swayed me as well but honestly its worth spending more because the quality here is certainly lacking.</li>
            <li>this is not a remy hair product, clips are plastic and cheap and do no stay in hair.</li>
            <li>This is NOT 100% real hair!!!</li>
            <li>Super soft, and lovely!</li>
            <li>HONESTLY it came 3 weeks early.</li>
            <li>I will say that you will need to buy 2 packs to make your hair style look full.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re comparable to high end ones...and even better she thinks.</li>
            <li>Felt and looked very real, I&#x27;m aware it advertises as real hair but for $20 you never know!</li>
            <li>Had fun with it.</li>
            <li>Fun to have these and also they are worth 20 dollars.</li>
            <li>and these extensions just blended  right in.  </li>
            <li>so i returned it immediately and they refunded me right away.</li>
            <li>Hair was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>You need at least 2 packs to help with the thickness to make it more believable looking to be real.</li>
            <li>The hair was real.</li>
            <li>They are very discreet and hide well in my hair.</li>
            <li>Color did not match much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good but its pretty thin</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll just need more if you want it thick.</li>
            <li>I needed to trim mine because my real hair isn&#x27;t quite long enough.</li>
            <li>Will definitely make business with them in the near future.</li>

            <li> They didn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> Of course like most extensions they can get a little uncomfortable but I don&#x27;t see a lot if issue in that.</li>
            <li> It has plastic clips (only down fall)</li>
            <li> The only issue is with how thin and stringy they are.</li>
            <li> because they are only 70g though they are kinda thin which I didn&#x27;t realize before I purchased them</li>
            <li> They are stringy, super thin and foul smelling!!!</li>
            <li> My hair looks fuller and a little longer!</li>
            <li> not really happy with it, nothing like the other one that I had</li>
            <li> It is disappointing in the long run so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> but when I realized how thin the sections of hair were I was disappointed because it takes all seven pieces to look like realistic hair anyhow.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> They are a little thin but for the price it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> They got a little frayed but not too bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look fake at all.</li>
            <li> but I bought two packs so ill</li>
            <li> Very thin.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very soft and silky and a perfect match.  I have med brown hair with my ends sorta lighter like reddish color  and these extensions just blended  right in.  I am using them to fill in my hair at this point.  I needed to trim mine because my real hair isn&#x27;t quite long enough. i do wish they had 14&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product,  I would buy it again. Feels real great to style. Doesn&#x27;t fall out all the time when you run your fingers threw. Very happy customer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I have yet to actually wear it.  I did experiment with the product when it arrived and I do plan on wearing it in the future.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to order these because of some reviews on it. HONESTLY it came 3 weeks early. The hair was real. It has plastic clips (only down fall) I have thinner hair and only ordered one! One was the perfect amount for my hair. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. My hair looks fuller and a little longer! I suggest this! Especially how well it&#x27;s priced.</li>
            <li> I really loved the extensions. They are really nice clip in easily and stay in good. The only issue is with how thin and stringy they are. You need at least 2 packs to help with the thickness to make it more believable looking to be real.</li>
            <li> I Realy love them, best part there came earlyer then thought there would most tell all your friends, love it</li>
            <li> I have thin hair so these work great for me. The only downside is that every once in a while a stray will fall out. Too keep this from happening. Go and buy extension glue, go over the seam and it&#x27;ll solve that problem.</li>
            <li> These extensions are amazing according to my wife.  They&#x27;re comparable to high end ones...and even better she thinks. Can&#x27;t beat the price too! We ordered two on different dates and these were delivered way earlier than the estimated delivery date. Awesome seller! Keep it up guys. Will definitely make business with them in the near future.</li>
            <li> I love my extensions! because they are only 70g though they are kinda thin which I didn&#x27;t realize before I purchased them but the clips hold great and the color is awesome</li>
            <li> Great price, love these extensions</li>
            <li> Hair was smooth and soft. Felt and looked very real, I&#x27;m aware it advertises as real hair but for $20 you never know! I decided to dye them red for my hair to match them and they took the color well. They got a little frayed but not too bad. Curled them and they held up fine. Could be thicker but I bought two packs so ill have to double up on them.</li>
            <li> I changed my mind and did not want this hair clip and longer so i returned it immediately and they refunded me right away.</li>
            <li> It perfect and I love it....</li>
            <li> this is not a remy hair product, clips are plastic and cheap and do no stay in hair. I wish I could take them back.</li>
            <li> It was quite nice, and easy to use. Had fun with it.</li>
            <li> Fun to have these and also they are worth 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> The amount of pieces seemed like a plus but when I realized how thin the sections of hair were I was disappointed because it takes all seven pieces to look like realistic hair anyhow. It is disappointing in the long run so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them. Again, the price swayed me as well but honestly its worth spending more because the quality here is certainly lacking.</li>
            <li> This product was okay. I will say that you will need to buy 2 packs to make your hair style look full. They are a little thin but for the price it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>

            <li> Turned out great! Great product.</li>
            <li> Love my hair extensions they made it to my house on time. They didn&#x27;t take long at all. Great service</li>
            <li> I guess for the money it&#x27;s good but its pretty thin so you&#x27;ll just need more if you want it thick.</li>
            <li> This is NOT 100% real hair!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a quick boost in hair. Color did not match much but it work for that moment needed.</li>
            <li> Super soft, and lovely! Wonderful purchase, great value! Bought this for my sister and looked perfect with her natural color!</li>
            <li> Very thin.  Get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and quick delivery! Wore them for my wedding and they were fantastic to add fullness and length!!</li>
            <li> WARNING!!!  Do NOT waste your $ on cheap, (smelly like fake doll hair) extensions.  They are stringy, super thin and foul smelling!!!</li>
