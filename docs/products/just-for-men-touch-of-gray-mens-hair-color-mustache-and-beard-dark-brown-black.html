    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I happy with it....</li>
            <li>YMMV and good luck.</li>
            <li>Instead, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty good until you wash your face and you literally wash everything off and need to reapply.</li>
            <li>and more importantly my wife and hair stylist (whom recommended it) both think it looks great and makes me look younger.</li>
            <li>(i.e., it looks natural to someone who knows her hair dyes and who experienced it from very close).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I used it the way they said I should, it would have given up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This eventually worked out pretty well.</li>
            <li>much better results are achieved with their standard product, leaving that on for a reduced time period.</li>
            <li>Thanks &amp;#34;Touch of Gray&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>That said, my beard color is better than it&#x27;s been in many years -- no more big white patches on either side and, while I leave my chin mostly gray for the sake of keeping something real, it pretty well matches the gray hair concentration on my head.</li>
            <li>and I pretty much use it as directed.</li>
            <li>I cover my whole beard, grayist areas first and leave it in 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Never could see much change in the color.</li>
            <li>notice that my beard feels much coarser after using this product.</li>
            <li>The regular version (same company) requires mixing two bottles, but gives fully brown hairs, with some gray showing from below, much better than this product.</li>
            <li>The heck with it, I&#x27;m older and have a gray beard - if I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll shave it off.</li>
            <li>My beard has A LOT of gray and this does a good job of darkening it enough to look natural and not too dark</li>
            <li>my barber said I was better then this and shave my new less gray beard…</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li>Waited 10 min the first times and 15 the second.</li>
            <li>I have to believe that being intimate with a guy with a coarse dark beard is less pleasant than a soft gray beard.</li>
            <li>I get much better results using the regular beard dye, going a shade lighter, and leaving on slightly longer.  </li>
            <li>That said, I had to (a) apply it three days in a row before it was clear that anything had been dyed,</li>
            <li>My friend&#x27;s hairstylist wife, a very frank and open person who also cuts my hair, was surprised to find out it had been dyed</li>
            <li>(b) leave it in far longer than the five minutes noted in the directions</li>
            <li>It comes out with enough gray to look natural.</li>
            <li>Wow, I look two weeks younger!</li>
            <li>I used this product 3 days in a row and barely notice any reduction in gray.  </li>

            <li> Given that I&#x27;d probably have to reapply this every few days to maintain a consistent color, I&#x27;d probably have perpetually itchy skin.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m using the dark brown / black version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> way I&#x27;m using it bears little resemblance to the instructions.</li>
            <li> A total waste of Money and time!!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a semi permanent product, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Maybe I used it wrong, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It is a horrible product once soap and water are introduced.</li>

            <li> I get much better results using the regular beard dye, going a shade lighter, and leaving on slightly longer.  The &amp;#34;touch of gray&amp;#34; is not natural looking variation, or mixed in gray hairs.  It just is  brown tinged gray hair.  The regular version (same company) requires mixing two bottles, but gives fully brown hairs, with some gray showing from below, much better than this product.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a semi permanent product, don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It is a horrible product once soap and water are introduced. It looks pretty good until you wash your face and you literally wash everything off and need to reapply. DO NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even try my friends. Used three times double the amount of time and did squat. A total waste of Money and time!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves allot of grey almost can&#x27;t tell you used it</li>
            <li> My mom bought some Just For Men Beard and mustache for her business partner and he used it and IT TURNED HIS BEARD BLUE!</li>
            <li> Maybe I used it wrong, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> used before  works well</li>
            <li> Was trying to get my beard to match the gray in my hair. This eventually worked out pretty well. That said, I had to (a) apply it three days in a row before it was clear that anything had been dyed, (b) leave it in far longer than the five minutes noted in the directions (I do about 10 instead), and (c) mix it about half-and-half with the darker version. I also end up re-doing it about every other week. Also, it&#x27;s tricky getting at the roots without painting your face. That said, my beard color is better than it&#x27;s been in many years -- no more big white patches on either side and, while I leave my chin mostly gray for the sake of keeping something real, it pretty well matches the gray hair concentration on my head. My friend&#x27;s hairstylist wife, a very frank and open person who also cuts my hair, was surprised to find out it had been dyed (i.e., it looks natural to someone who knows her hair dyes and who experienced it from very close).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I&#x27;m using it bears little resemblance to the instructions. If I used it the way they said I should, it would have given up pretty quickly. Instead, I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results. YMMV and good luck.</li>
            <li> This product should be called &amp;#34;barely touches gray&amp;#34; . . . It enhanced some of the darker hairs, but did nothing for the ones that were already gray . . . much better results are achieved with their standard product, leaving that on for a reduced time period.</li>
            <li> The name implies that after using this, only a touch of gray is left.  In reality, only a touch of gray is removed.&lt;br /&gt;I had to apply this 3 times in order to get the color I want and I&#x27;m using the dark brown / black version.&lt;br /&gt;This is a problem if, like me, you keep your beard short.  I trim a couple of times a week and as soon as I do, it goes back to looking as if it had never been treated.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this can be solved by making the product cover more.&lt;br /&gt;There has to be a middle ground between this stuff and the shoe polish look.</li>
            <li> The process made my beard hair stiff and coarse. The chemicals made my skin itch for a couple of days. Given that I&#x27;d probably have to reapply this every few days to maintain a consistent color, I&#x27;d probably have perpetually itchy skin. I have to believe that being intimate with a guy with a coarse dark beard is less pleasant than a soft gray beard. The heck with it, I&#x27;m older and have a gray beard - if I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll shave it off.</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on what you want. I&#x27;ve used this for four applications and I pretty much use it as directed. My beard has A LOT of gray and this does a good job of darkening it enough to look natural and not too dark so it looks phony. I cover my whole beard, grayist areas first and leave it in 6-8 minutes. It comes out with enough gray to look natural. I happy with it....and more importantly my wife and hair stylist (whom recommended it) both think it looks great and makes me look younger. If it works for my wife, it works for me!</li>
            <li> my barber said I was better then this and shave my new less gray beard…</li>
            <li> Color doesn&#x27;t last very long, washes out within 2 days for me.</li>
            <li> Wow, I look two weeks younger! Thanks &amp;#34;Touch of Gray&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Waited 10 min the first times and 15 the second. Never could see much change in the color. But I would try again</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews that note the product name is misleading.  I used this product 3 days in a row and barely notice any reduction in gray.  I tried leaving it in for 10 minutes and the added time didn&#x27;t seem to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice that my beard feels much coarser after using this product.</li>
