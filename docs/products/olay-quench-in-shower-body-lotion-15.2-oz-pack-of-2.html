            <li>It also has a very mild shimmer which is an added bonus :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer, and no waiting for lotion to dry before you put clothes on.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and light, and gives your skin a light shimmer.</li>

            <li>I love Olay In-Shower Body Lotion and am so glad to have found a consistent source of it!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use,</li>

            <li>Easy to use in the shower, apply it like soap and then rinse.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>also found the smell to be too strong, but I tend to like milder fragrances.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my body feeling soft and smelling good</li>
            <li>Most specially in the winter months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will be good if you take a shower every day, otherwise, a normal lotion will be needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do warm it up under the hot water before using&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it for shaving, makes everythiing smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>and I like being able to quickly apply a moisturizer in the shower and rinse it off, so when I get out of the shower I don&#x27;t have to stand there</li>
            <li>I love how quick it is (compared to putting lotion on after the shower).</li>
            <li>The shimmer it leaves is gorgeous and very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the moisture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it will remain available on Amazon for awhile.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin always smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dorm use because you don&#x27;t have to get naked in front of your roommate to put on lotion after your shower...</li>
            <li>Even here at home, during the summer it keeps my legs smooth for&lt;br /&gt;shorts</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth, and in the winter it makes a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth and supple even in the winter.</li>
            <li>You just put in on in the shower and wash it off and your body feels smooth and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a light sparkle all day.  </li>
            <li>The price is cheap when you factor in the postage, etc.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for carrying such a great product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s important to take care of your skin as it&#x27;s the largest organ in your body according to my 4th grade science</li>
            <li>and it smells wonderful on your skin after you&#x27;ve dried off.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to have enough to get me through for a while.</li>
            <li>Under the light I can see their shinning.</li>
            <li>BUT, the few times I have used it, my skin feels awesome when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a while, now I found it on Amazon at a cheaper price and always available on the subscription plan.  </li>
            <li>Rub it all over and then lightly rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>This make your skin feel silky smooth and all the flakes on your legs (winter skin) disappear.  </li>
            <li>so everyone knows how fabulous I am...</li>
            <li>but in all serious..its so slight..I had to turn my arm to reflect light to see any..</li>
            <li>I finally looked on Amazon and was so happy to find it</li>
            <li>I really wish stores would go back to carrying this in-shower lotion - it&#x27;s just wonderful.</li>
            <li>This product is not easily found in retail outlets, so I was very happy to see Amazon has it.  </li>
            <li>I love the clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Love this product, clean fresh smell, not overpowering</li>
            <li>Smells great, is a superb moisturizer for my extra-dry skin, lasts all day; and has a little bit of sparkle to it, that stays on skin all day, and gives beautiful, subtle shimmer!!</li>
            <li>It is becoming harder to find and Amazon has done a great job of keeping it in stock and keeping us stocked up.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I used to live up north and</li>
            <li>I love this product for summer time - it really makes your skin look fantastic, and feel fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a great job keeping my skin from getting dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>Leave your skin very soft, and fragrance smell nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;And what I love best is it leaves a very subtle shimmer that makes your skin look like it&#x27;s glowing, but not in a glittery way.  </li>
            <li>Olay has really found the magic formula.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a superior alternative to regular body lotion.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps skin silky smooth! ...</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin nice and soft but not feeling oily or greasy on your skin.</li>
            <li>Super creamy and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It is quick, non-greasy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Super efficient.</li>
            <li>You know, I&#x27;ve been looking for weeks for this item in the stores and haven&#x27;t found it, so I am super hyped that it is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of moisturizers that make great promises but finally Olay has created one that really delivers.  </li>
            <li>After a quick rinse, you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>I wish everyone would try this, we girls are lucky to have it.</li>
            <li>i have been a fan of this product since it was first launched and given free samples with the quench lotion which is also a winner.</li>
            <li>It really does make my lotion more effective and last longer.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent, and the shimmer is subtle but fun.</li>
            <li>I really like the easy way that I can apply the lotion before stepping out of the shower,  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and really works.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re already naked and warm, you just quickly apply, rinse, and go.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re already naked and warm, you just quickly apply, rinse, and go.</li>
            <li>It smells great, leaves your skin silky soft, and my favorite part is the slight shimmer it leaves on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it, and it give you a little bit shimmer on your skin.</li>
            <li>Now my whole body isn&#x27;t just moisturized and smooth, it also glows.</li>
            <li>The bottle sizes are great and i use this product everyday in the shower after lathering and rinsing my body wash off.</li>
            <li>I get out of the shower feeling amazing and don&#x27;t need to apply any extra cream.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my skin looks and feels great</li>
            <li>Really keeps your skin moisturized and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>in-shower lotion makes moisturizing your skin so much easier and hassle free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used either \\&quot;Quench\\&quot; or the one with the shea butter for the last eight years, and I have no idea what I will do if they ever stop producing them, or change the ingredients as many companies see fit to do.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this shower lotion leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin has a nice shimmer afterwards, but I don&#x27;t feel as moisturized as I do with a regular body</li>
            <li>If I really want to get even more moisture on days when I was out in the sun, I would add lotion on top, but it is not necessary.</li>
            <li>find this stuff moisturizes better than regular lotion, lasts all day and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>There are several types available, I&#x27;ve tried two and enjoy both kinds!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical that a rinse off moisturizer would be effective, but this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as effective as a regular body lotion, but faster and easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and I love using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>The thing that I enjoy most about this body lotion is that you put it on right in the shower, then rinse briefly.  </li>
            <li>but this I can do right in the shower</li>
            <li>Hold it right there, Lazypants, not so fast!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to literally stick my arm up to his face right after a shower for him to see any of the \\&quot;glitter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I had to literally stick my arm up to his face right after a shower for him to see any of the \\&quot;glitter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Its a great alternative when I want to have a quick shower and am feeling lazy!</li>
            <li>but this product really does work, my skin feels so soft after using and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Was worried this would be gimmicky, but it&#x27;s perfect, especially for the winter.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use this stuff on my feet because, as others have pointed out, it can make the shower really slippery and falling on my butt in the shower isn&#x27;t something I really enjoy doing.</li>
            <li>Especially available on subscribe + save, so I get enough to last 2 months at a time and no shipping charge.  </li>
            <li>so I m always looking for nice product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works well for normal skin ....Not too good for dry skin ....&lt;</li>
            <li>I cannot find this product in any local stores any more and have to purchase it online.  </li>
            <li>it always leaves my skin moisturized and leaves a pretty shimmer as well.</li>
            <li>This is the closest I can find and it&#x27;s pretty darn</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my town so being able to find it online is terrific.  </li>
            <li>I know when I first read in-shower lotion I thought how could a lotion work in the shower</li>
            <li>currently has the Subscribe and save 15% offer which makes it a much better</li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many different types of body washes.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it on my daughter (4 years old).  </li>
            <li>It has never irritated her skin and leaves it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Well, first, you apply it in the shower and rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>she&#x27;s ready to get into her PJ&#x27;s as soon as I towel her off!  </li>
            <li>I gave it a try - and I have to say, I really like it!</li>
            <li>I love this product, and especially appreciate the fact that I can subscribe and get a shipment every month from Amazon since I can no longer find this in any store.  </li>
            <li>, this lotion makes my skin feel smooth and soft and quenched.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottles were larger and had more lotion in them.</li>
            <li>It is an interesting concept, like a conditioner that you rinse off, only for your body, not your hair.</li>
            <li>I love it, and already bought my second set.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased it I got 2 for $7.68 ....</li>
            <li>Moisturizes pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay In-Shower Body Lotion since it first came out</li>
            <li>I pay for make my skin health and comfortable soft.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered Quench.  </li>
            <li>I used Drano when I first noticed it</li>
            <li>/&gt;ALSO, okay, I use a lot of different things for shaving cream for my legs in an effort to get them feel smoother: conditioner, body soap with lotion, you name it.</li>
            <li>GLITTER&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I found it hilarious that people were complaining about the &#x27;glitter&#x27; in this product once I finally used it!</li>
            <li>I used it the first time today</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions and put it on after a shower when you skin is somewhat dry, then rinse it off, it leaves the body smooth and makes one sleep soundly throughout the night.  </li>
            <li>For good reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it since roughly 2002, or whenever it originally came out in different packaging.  </li>
            <li>This lotion leaves an amazing, long lasting smell and leaves your skin feeling fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen this in stores for several years and was so excited to see it on here!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much in the summer, but as soon as I feel that first fall nip in the air</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t make my skin more moist but smell strange and after I</li>
            <li>The smell sticks with you for most of your day as long as you aren&#x27;t doing anything too strenuous.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to rinse off and love the hint of sparkles it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to put this on while in the shower and simply rinse off and all your moisturizing needs are done!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; it adds to skin is kind of odd.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is strong, but I actually like that about it.</li>
            <li>This lotion is on my top 5 list of things I could not live without.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So when I used up my travel supply during a winter visit to the midwest and couldn&#x27;t find any at the local store, I was pleased to find Olay In-Shower Body Lotion in a newly restyled bottle on Amazon and ordered up a couple of bottles to tide me over.  </li>
            <li>It smells super fresh and clean and it leaves your skin soft while giving it a subtle shimmer that gives you a healthy dewy look.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really tell in regular light; but if you get under led lights or twisty bulb lights....</li>
            <li>I can already feel a huge different on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>I turn off the water after showering, put this lotion on, then turn the water back on and rinse lightly.</li>
            <li>and you are ready for your clothes --</li>
            <li>Putting on lotion in the shower makes it so much easier and does not leave your skin feeling greasy or on your clothes.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier using the lotion in the shower rather than</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin is left feeling smooth and silky...</li>
            <li>and this really helps my skin retain moisture.  </li>
            <li>to me it is just faster than applying after getting out of the shower, for me its a real time saver.</li>
            <li>Glitter is fun sometimes, but not everyday.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, lotion never does the trick for me anyway, and baby oil or Vaseline is really a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having a lotion to use in the shower makes it so much easier and efficient to use lotion.  </li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t really hang around</li>
            <li>My devotion has remained steadfast even though Olay has changed the name (it was \\&quot;Moisturinse,\\&quot; then \\&quot;Quench\\&quot;) and despite the fact that my local stores no longer stocked it on their shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i really wanted to like this, but maybe all the rave reviews inflated my expectations.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t really as moisturizing as baby oil, applied to damp skin after shower, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is a real time saver for me.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is really a cream</li>
            <li>Has really softened my skin</li>
            <li>so using this helps me so much during any type of season.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care for the way lotions feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves behind this refreshing fragrance and lovely shimmer.</li>
            <li>Smells clean, not crazy strong (I mean maybe while you&#x27;re putting it on, but it wouldn&#x27;t overpower a body spray or perfume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it in the winter, and it really saved me during my pregnancy when my skin was even more dry</li>
            <li>It is also really great for your feet, just be careful because it makes them extremely slippery in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The lotion kept my skin from becoming dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li>So much more convenient than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than most other stuff and clogs the razor in a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very hard to find in stores and the price is nice here!</li>
            <li>Would only use this fragrance during holidays or special occasions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some previous reviews and think that while, some good points are made, some things definitely need to be clarified about this</li>
            <li>My dry skin was so soft and felt so much better.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I will order it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Worked way better than I expected, didn&#x27;t need lotion at all and my legs were so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>i love the shimmers and sparkles and even though i have dark skin</li>
            <li>That is the only reason I did not give it full stars.</li>
            <li>I think this product is being phased out and it is becoming harder to find.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly hard to find in stores for such a great item</li>
            <li>My dry, itchy skin continues to be smooth &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li>I had been experiencing severe itching which prompted my doctor to do blood tests, etc., which happily, were negative but the itching actually caused me to bruise my tender skin from scratching.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older woman</li>
            <li>I am a rock climber, and applying regular lotion is such a pain because afterwards I have to scrub my hands to make sure the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave my hands grease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many negative comments about the smell, which is very strong at first and your bathroom will smell like it for a few hours, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry area, so I must have something that moisturizes nicely, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I have never heard about in-shower lotions until I saw this product on Amazon and all high reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>also love the shine and the little sparklers all over.</li>
            <li>Just wish I could find it as easily from other stores.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay In-Shower Body Lotion now for a few years and just love this product.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is normally oily.  </li>
            <li>I love Olay in shower body lotion since it came out a few years ago with the name \\&quot;Moisturinse.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>find this way easier than putting on normal lotion.</li>
            <li>find this way easier than putting on normal lotion.</li>
            <li>but it allows my skin to stay hydrated without having to use normal lotion.</li>
            <li>This lotion is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>soap up (I use a poof with a nice exfoliating center), rinse off soap, put on lotion, rinse off lotion, get out of shower and pat dry.</li>
            <li>It gives me the option to either not put on lotion right after the shower (for instance if I&#x27;m going to blow out my hair and don&#x27;t want greasy fingers), or add lotion and double up on moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, as there is nothing else that comes close to leaving skin soft and radiant!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a heavy duty moisturizer like Eucerin ( for really dry skin), but it does more than an adequate job</li>
            <li>I am new to the In-Shower Moisturizers but saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>This is a quick way to moisturize your body without the hassle of applying cream and waiting for it to dry.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to the smell of perfume and lotion</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents).</li>
            <li>I purchased this product initially (when it first came on the market) at Walmart with the Body Wash and Lotion.</li>
            <li>After using this stuff my super dry skin is soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real fan of the Olay Moisturinse In-Shower Body Lotion w/ shea butter, which is becoming really hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and not subject to dryness when I use it every other day in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lotion will give you body a slightly golden shinning cover after rinsing with water, and you&#x27;ll feel your skin not that dry</li>
            <li>, it makes you smooth and trust me, your lady (or dudes you let rub you down) will appreciate it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s faster and easier to apply lotion in the shower and this product makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 years old and often get mistaken for someone in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have my 21 year old daughter using Oil of Olay products NOW.</li>
            <li>I recently moved from a moist climate to a much drier one and my skin felt it.</li>
            <li>is so soft.  </li>
            <li>It seems against nature to put lotion on in the shower to begin with, I think that&#x27;d push it too far.</li>
            <li>I have a bottle in the shower and on on the sink so that after washing my hands I can rub it on and rinse it off to keep my hands soft.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make the bathtub slippery and leaves you soft and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your body soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft now.  </li>
            <li>and I never cease to be amazed at how soft and pliable my skin is.  </li>
            <li>Just smooth it on, and then I let it sit for a few.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to break out if I put anything (even too much sunblock) on my back or chest - so I just avoid those areas with lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have never been so soft.</li>
            <li>I think this stuff, so far, after 2 days of use does moisturize my skin</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>so I am sensitive to smells..</li>
            <li>My skin always feeling velvety soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>Went to visit my husband up north ms. where he is working and found it up there needless to say I have a good supply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be a lotion, but it feels more like a thick cream --</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s slowly getting better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite all these obstacles, I am a loyal fan and regular user of this</li>
            <li>No mess</li>
            <li>I also love the subtle sparkle it gives my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only lotion that&#x27;s ever had decent results with my skin, and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product over regular body lotion.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The first part of my order (2pk of 15.2 oz) was used and it was what I expected of my order.</li>
            <li>I have issues with dry skin a lot, and using this in the shower helps clear it right up, getting rid of any itchy dry skin by making it all soft.</li>
            <li>Price here is higher than other places.</li>
            <li>My skin does have a faint shimmer after I use it, which I love!  </li>
            <li>I think the smell is a clean, floral scent, which I like but do not love.</li>
            <li>* lazy and use a special overpriced drug store cream for that.</li>
            <li>The next step will be to disappear completely ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve abandoned all others because they simply do not leave my skin as soft and radiant as this one does.</li>
            <li>It is not available through any of the major retailers such as Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Target and so many other places.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, particularly in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I live in a dry state, and my skin shows this in the winter</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ve kept such an amazing secret!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; for my whole life and never has my skin FELT so smooth!</li>
            <li>I used to find it at Walmart and several of the grocery stores I hit frequently but just like back east, when Wallie World stops selling something</li>
            <li>If I use every two to three days, I have no dry skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Only draw back is that it does make the shower floor a little slippery, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and the hard water where I live doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not good about moisturizing after showering so this product fit the bill for me.  </li>
            <li>I just moved to a very dry climate, and within two showers, this helped bring my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>Excellent lotion if you hate that greasy feel from conventional lotion.  </li>
            <li>My skin was soft all day long!</li>
            <li>I found the product very hard to fine in a store.</li>
            <li>i almost don&#x27;t want to give this such a high rating, because then other people will buy it all up.</li>
            <li>The sparkles are unnecessary (plus, if you want to share with the man in your life, he might be less than thrilled).</li>
            <li>Since using the In Shower lotion, I have had no trouble with dry skin!</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have forgotten I used this stuff a few times right after getting out of the shower and scrubbed myself dry but it doesn&#x27;t seem to ruin the moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> i love to be able to use it in the shower.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer, and no waiting for lotion to dry before you put clothes on.  </li>

            <li> I love Olay In-Shower Body Lotion and am so glad to have found a consistent source of it!  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use,</li>

            <li> Easy to use in the shower, apply it like soap and then rinse.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> also found the smell to be too strong, but I tend to like milder fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my body feeling soft and smelling good</li>
            <li> Most specially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will be good if you take a shower every day, otherwise, a normal lotion will be needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do warm it up under the hot water before using&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it for shaving, makes everythiing smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> and I like being able to quickly apply a moisturizer in the shower and rinse it off, so when I get out of the shower I don&#x27;t have to stand there</li>
            <li> I love how quick it is (compared to putting lotion on after the shower).</li>
            <li> The shimmer it leaves is gorgeous and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the moisture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it will remain available on Amazon for awhile.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin always smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dorm use because you don&#x27;t have to get naked in front of your roommate to put on lotion after your shower...</li>
            <li> Even here at home, during the summer it keeps my legs smooth for&lt;br /&gt;shorts</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth, and in the winter it makes a huge difference for me.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin smooth and supple even in the winter.</li>
            <li> You just put in on in the shower and wash it off and your body feels smooth and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a light sparkle all day.  </li>
            <li> The price is cheap when you factor in the postage, etc.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you for carrying such a great product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s important to take care of your skin as it&#x27;s the largest organ in your body according to my 4th grade science</li>
            <li> and it smells wonderful on your skin after you&#x27;ve dried off.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to have enough to get me through for a while.</li>
            <li> Under the light I can see their shinning.</li>
            <li> BUT, the few times I have used it, my skin feels awesome when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while, now I found it on Amazon at a cheaper price and always available on the subscription plan.  </li>
            <li> Rub it all over and then lightly rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> This make your skin feel silky smooth and all the flakes on your legs (winter skin) disappear.  </li>
            <li> so everyone knows how fabulous I am...</li>
            <li> but in all serious..its so slight..I had to turn my arm to reflect light to see any..</li>
            <li> I finally looked on Amazon and was so happy to find it</li>
            <li> I really wish stores would go back to carrying this in-shower lotion - it&#x27;s just wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is not easily found in retail outlets, so I was very happy to see Amazon has it.  </li>
            <li> I love the clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product, clean fresh smell, not overpowering</li>
            <li> Smells great, is a superb moisturizer for my extra-dry skin, lasts all day; and has a little bit of sparkle to it, that stays on skin all day, and gives beautiful, subtle shimmer!!</li>
            <li> It is becoming harder to find and Amazon has done a great job of keeping it in stock and keeping us stocked up.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I used to live up north and</li>
            <li> I love this product for summer time - it really makes your skin look fantastic, and feel fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a great job keeping my skin from getting dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> Leave your skin very soft, and fragrance smell nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;And what I love best is it leaves a very subtle shimmer that makes your skin look like it&#x27;s glowing, but not in a glittery way.  </li>
            <li> Olay has really found the magic formula.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a superior alternative to regular body lotion.  </li>
            <li> It really keeps skin silky smooth! ...</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin nice and soft but not feeling oily or greasy on your skin.</li>
            <li> Super creamy and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It is quick, non-greasy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Super efficient.</li>
            <li> You know, I&#x27;ve been looking for weeks for this item in the stores and haven&#x27;t found it, so I am super hyped that it is on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of moisturizers that make great promises but finally Olay has created one that really delivers.  </li>
            <li> After a quick rinse, you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I wish everyone would try this, we girls are lucky to have it.</li>
            <li> i have been a fan of this product since it was first launched and given free samples with the quench lotion which is also a winner.</li>
            <li> It really does make my lotion more effective and last longer.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful scent, and the shimmer is subtle but fun.</li>
            <li> I really like the easy way that I can apply the lotion before stepping out of the shower,  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and really works.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re already naked and warm, you just quickly apply, rinse, and go.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re already naked and warm, you just quickly apply, rinse, and go.</li>
            <li> It smells great, leaves your skin silky soft, and my favorite part is the slight shimmer it leaves on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it, and it give you a little bit shimmer on your skin.</li>
            <li> Now my whole body isn&#x27;t just moisturized and smooth, it also glows.</li>
            <li> The bottle sizes are great and i use this product everyday in the shower after lathering and rinsing my body wash off.</li>
            <li> I get out of the shower feeling amazing and don&#x27;t need to apply any extra cream.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my skin looks and feels great</li>
            <li> Really keeps your skin moisturized and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> in-shower lotion makes moisturizing your skin so much easier and hassle free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used either \\&quot;Quench\\&quot; or the one with the shea butter for the last eight years, and I have no idea what I will do if they ever stop producing them, or change the ingredients as many companies see fit to do.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this shower lotion leaves my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin has a nice shimmer afterwards, but I don&#x27;t feel as moisturized as I do with a regular body</li>
            <li> If I really want to get even more moisture on days when I was out in the sun, I would add lotion on top, but it is not necessary.</li>
            <li> find this stuff moisturizes better than regular lotion, lasts all day and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> There are several types available, I&#x27;ve tried two and enjoy both kinds!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a rinse off moisturizer would be effective, but this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as effective as a regular body lotion, but faster and easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and I love using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> The thing that I enjoy most about this body lotion is that you put it on right in the shower, then rinse briefly.  </li>
            <li> but this I can do right in the shower</li>
            <li> Hold it right there, Lazypants, not so fast!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to literally stick my arm up to his face right after a shower for him to see any of the \\&quot;glitter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had to literally stick my arm up to his face right after a shower for him to see any of the \\&quot;glitter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Its a great alternative when I want to have a quick shower and am feeling lazy!</li>
            <li> but this product really does work, my skin feels so soft after using and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Was worried this would be gimmicky, but it&#x27;s perfect, especially for the winter.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this stuff on my feet because, as others have pointed out, it can make the shower really slippery and falling on my butt in the shower isn&#x27;t something I really enjoy doing.</li>
            <li> Especially available on subscribe + save, so I get enough to last 2 months at a time and no shipping charge.  </li>
            <li> so I m always looking for nice product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works well for normal skin ....Not too good for dry skin ....&lt;</li>
            <li> I cannot find this product in any local stores any more and have to purchase it online.  </li>
            <li> it always leaves my skin moisturized and leaves a pretty shimmer as well.</li>
            <li> This is the closest I can find and it&#x27;s pretty darn</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my town so being able to find it online is terrific.  </li>
            <li> I know when I first read in-shower lotion I thought how could a lotion work in the shower</li>
            <li> currently has the Subscribe and save 15% offer which makes it a much better</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many different types of body washes.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it on my daughter (4 years old).  </li>
            <li> It has never irritated her skin and leaves it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Well, first, you apply it in the shower and rinse it off.  </li>
            <li> she&#x27;s ready to get into her PJ&#x27;s as soon as I towel her off!  </li>
            <li> I gave it a try - and I have to say, I really like it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and especially appreciate the fact that I can subscribe and get a shipment every month from Amazon since I can no longer find this in any store.  </li>
            <li> , this lotion makes my skin feel smooth and soft and quenched.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottles were larger and had more lotion in them.</li>
            <li> It is an interesting concept, like a conditioner that you rinse off, only for your body, not your hair.</li>
            <li> I love it, and already bought my second set.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased it I got 2 for $7.68 ....</li>
            <li> Moisturizes pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay In-Shower Body Lotion since it first came out</li>
            <li> I pay for make my skin health and comfortable soft.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered Quench.  </li>
            <li> I used Drano when I first noticed it</li>
            <li> /&gt;ALSO, okay, I use a lot of different things for shaving cream for my legs in an effort to get them feel smoother: conditioner, body soap with lotion, you name it.</li>
            <li> GLITTER&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I found it hilarious that people were complaining about the &#x27;glitter&#x27; in this product once I finally used it!</li>
            <li> I used it the first time today</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions and put it on after a shower when you skin is somewhat dry, then rinse it off, it leaves the body smooth and makes one sleep soundly throughout the night.  </li>
            <li> For good reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it since roughly 2002, or whenever it originally came out in different packaging.  </li>
            <li> This lotion leaves an amazing, long lasting smell and leaves your skin feeling fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this in stores for several years and was so excited to see it on here!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much in the summer, but as soon as I feel that first fall nip in the air</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t make my skin more moist but smell strange and after I</li>
            <li> The smell sticks with you for most of your day as long as you aren&#x27;t doing anything too strenuous.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to rinse off and love the hint of sparkles it leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to put this on while in the shower and simply rinse off and all your moisturizing needs are done!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; it adds to skin is kind of odd.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is strong, but I actually like that about it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is on my top 5 list of things I could not live without.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So when I used up my travel supply during a winter visit to the midwest and couldn&#x27;t find any at the local store, I was pleased to find Olay In-Shower Body Lotion in a newly restyled bottle on Amazon and ordered up a couple of bottles to tide me over.  </li>
            <li> It smells super fresh and clean and it leaves your skin soft while giving it a subtle shimmer that gives you a healthy dewy look.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really tell in regular light; but if you get under led lights or twisty bulb lights....</li>
            <li> I can already feel a huge different on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> I turn off the water after showering, put this lotion on, then turn the water back on and rinse lightly.</li>
            <li> and you are ready for your clothes --</li>
            <li> Putting on lotion in the shower makes it so much easier and does not leave your skin feeling greasy or on your clothes.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier using the lotion in the shower rather than</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin is left feeling smooth and silky...</li>
            <li> and this really helps my skin retain moisture.  </li>
            <li> to me it is just faster than applying after getting out of the shower, for me its a real time saver.</li>
            <li> Glitter is fun sometimes, but not everyday.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, lotion never does the trick for me anyway, and baby oil or Vaseline is really a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having a lotion to use in the shower makes it so much easier and efficient to use lotion.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t really hang around</li>
            <li> My devotion has remained steadfast even though Olay has changed the name (it was \\&quot;Moisturinse,\\&quot; then \\&quot;Quench\\&quot;) and despite the fact that my local stores no longer stocked it on their shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i really wanted to like this, but maybe all the rave reviews inflated my expectations.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t really as moisturizing as baby oil, applied to damp skin after shower, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is a real time saver for me.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is really a cream</li>
            <li> Has really softened my skin</li>
            <li> so using this helps me so much during any type of season.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care for the way lotions feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves behind this refreshing fragrance and lovely shimmer.</li>
            <li> Smells clean, not crazy strong (I mean maybe while you&#x27;re putting it on, but it wouldn&#x27;t overpower a body spray or perfume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it in the winter, and it really saved me during my pregnancy when my skin was even more dry</li>
            <li> It is also really great for your feet, just be careful because it makes them extremely slippery in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The lotion kept my skin from becoming dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> So much more convenient than other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than most other stuff and clogs the razor in a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very hard to find in stores and the price is nice here!</li>
            <li> Would only use this fragrance during holidays or special occasions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some previous reviews and think that while, some good points are made, some things definitely need to be clarified about this</li>
            <li> My dry skin was so soft and felt so much better.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I will order it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Worked way better than I expected, didn&#x27;t need lotion at all and my legs were so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> i love the shimmers and sparkles and even though i have dark skin</li>
            <li> That is the only reason I did not give it full stars.</li>
            <li> I think this product is being phased out and it is becoming harder to find.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly hard to find in stores for such a great item</li>
            <li> My dry, itchy skin continues to be smooth &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li> I had been experiencing severe itching which prompted my doctor to do blood tests, etc., which happily, were negative but the itching actually caused me to bruise my tender skin from scratching.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older woman</li>
            <li> I am a rock climber, and applying regular lotion is such a pain because afterwards I have to scrub my hands to make sure the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave my hands grease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many negative comments about the smell, which is very strong at first and your bathroom will smell like it for a few hours, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry area, so I must have something that moisturizes nicely, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I have never heard about in-shower lotions until I saw this product on Amazon and all high reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> also love the shine and the little sparklers all over.</li>
            <li> Just wish I could find it as easily from other stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay In-Shower Body Lotion now for a few years and just love this product.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is normally oily.  </li>
            <li> I love Olay in shower body lotion since it came out a few years ago with the name \\&quot;Moisturinse.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> find this way easier than putting on normal lotion.</li>
            <li> find this way easier than putting on normal lotion.</li>
            <li> but it allows my skin to stay hydrated without having to use normal lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> soap up (I use a poof with a nice exfoliating center), rinse off soap, put on lotion, rinse off lotion, get out of shower and pat dry.</li>
            <li> It gives me the option to either not put on lotion right after the shower (for instance if I&#x27;m going to blow out my hair and don&#x27;t want greasy fingers), or add lotion and double up on moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, as there is nothing else that comes close to leaving skin soft and radiant!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a heavy duty moisturizer like Eucerin ( for really dry skin), but it does more than an adequate job</li>
            <li> I am new to the In-Shower Moisturizers but saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> This is a quick way to moisturize your body without the hassle of applying cream and waiting for it to dry.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to the smell of perfume and lotion</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product initially (when it first came on the market) at Walmart with the Body Wash and Lotion.</li>
            <li> After using this stuff my super dry skin is soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real fan of the Olay Moisturinse In-Shower Body Lotion w/ shea butter, which is becoming really hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and not subject to dryness when I use it every other day in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lotion will give you body a slightly golden shinning cover after rinsing with water, and you&#x27;ll feel your skin not that dry</li>
            <li> , it makes you smooth and trust me, your lady (or dudes you let rub you down) will appreciate it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster and easier to apply lotion in the shower and this product makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old and often get mistaken for someone in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have my 21 year old daughter using Oil of Olay products NOW.</li>
            <li> I recently moved from a moist climate to a much drier one and my skin felt it.</li>
            <li> is so soft.  </li>
            <li> It seems against nature to put lotion on in the shower to begin with, I think that&#x27;d push it too far.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle in the shower and on on the sink so that after washing my hands I can rub it on and rinse it off to keep my hands soft.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make the bathtub slippery and leaves you soft and not sticky.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your body soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft now.  </li>
            <li> and I never cease to be amazed at how soft and pliable my skin is.  </li>
            <li> Just smooth it on, and then I let it sit for a few.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to break out if I put anything (even too much sunblock) on my back or chest - so I just avoid those areas with lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have never been so soft.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff, so far, after 2 days of use does moisturize my skin</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> so I am sensitive to smells..</li>
            <li> My skin always feeling velvety soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> Went to visit my husband up north ms. where he is working and found it up there needless to say I have a good supply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be a lotion, but it feels more like a thick cream --</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slowly getting better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite all these obstacles, I am a loyal fan and regular user of this</li>
            <li> No mess</li>
            <li> I also love the subtle sparkle it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lotion that&#x27;s ever had decent results with my skin, and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product over regular body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The first part of my order (2pk of 15.2 oz) was used and it was what I expected of my order.</li>
            <li> I have issues with dry skin a lot, and using this in the shower helps clear it right up, getting rid of any itchy dry skin by making it all soft.</li>
            <li> Price here is higher than other places.</li>
            <li> My skin does have a faint shimmer after I use it, which I love!  </li>
            <li> I think the smell is a clean, floral scent, which I like but do not love.</li>
            <li> * lazy and use a special overpriced drug store cream for that.</li>
            <li> The next step will be to disappear completely ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve abandoned all others because they simply do not leave my skin as soft and radiant as this one does.</li>
            <li> It is not available through any of the major retailers such as Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Target and so many other places.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, particularly in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry state, and my skin shows this in the winter</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ve kept such an amazing secret!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; for my whole life and never has my skin FELT so smooth!</li>
            <li> I used to find it at Walmart and several of the grocery stores I hit frequently but just like back east, when Wallie World stops selling something</li>
            <li> If I use every two to three days, I have no dry skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Only draw back is that it does make the shower floor a little slippery, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and the hard water where I live doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good about moisturizing after showering so this product fit the bill for me.  </li>
            <li> I just moved to a very dry climate, and within two showers, this helped bring my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion if you hate that greasy feel from conventional lotion.  </li>
            <li> My skin was soft all day long!</li>
            <li> I found the product very hard to fine in a store.</li>
            <li> i almost don&#x27;t want to give this such a high rating, because then other people will buy it all up.</li>
            <li> The sparkles are unnecessary (plus, if you want to share with the man in your life, he might be less than thrilled).</li>
            <li> Since using the In Shower lotion, I have had no trouble with dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have forgotten I used this stuff a few times right after getting out of the shower and scrubbed myself dry but it doesn&#x27;t seem to ruin the moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a major problem with dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> Be careful about slipping in the shower, though, it can make it slick! :)</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and live in Colorado (DRY!)</li>
            <li> Then when you&#x27;re done and dry off, your skin is dry but wonderfully soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I live where the water is hard so this keeps skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> but the price is seriously inflated on Amazon right now.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you&#x27;re so lazy that&#x27;s too much effort for you</li>
            <li> Putting on lotion in the shower makes it so much easier for lazy people like me.</li>
            <li> but it only lasts so long.  </li>
            <li> However, just opened the second part of my order (2pk of 15.2 oz) and it&#x27;s been too long on your shelf.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin just as soft as any other lotion, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all!  </li>
            <li> my skin gets so dry in the winter and this is the only lotion that works!!!</li>
            <li> Only flaw is that you have to pat your skin dry else</li>
            <li> this is my second choice, only to their other in shower lotion with shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I figured it could do double duty since I also have very dry</li>
            <li> I am 44 and dont feel I am too old for a little sparkle..</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry it gets itchy, and it is such a pain to use lotion when you have to put it all over your body, then you have to wait for it to dry before getting dressed in the morning.  </li>
            <li> after I shower, which takes a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay in-shower lotions for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wish I stumbled onto this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Everyone I&#x27;ve told about this product is addicted, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a middle aged woman with dry skin, not a disco</li>
            <li> usually I would just live with the itch, and the consequences.  </li>
            <li> I still use lotion after showering on the very dry parts of my skin, but it does seem to work on the other areas of my skin that are not extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Softens skin extremely well, and effects last for 24 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product and other versions of it prepared by the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> no winter dry skin</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and itchy.</li>
            <li> It works, although some part of my skin still looks/feels dry.</li>
            <li> Before this in shower lotion, my winter skin would get sooooo dry &amp; itchy.</li>
            <li> You rinse it off in the shower, pat dry</li>
            <li> i have really dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> Her skin gets dry and sometimes ashy during the winter.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin as well as a chronic skin conditio</li>
            <li> I use my skin is still dry</li>
            <li> My skin is dry</li>
            <li> bathe for years and have managed to minimize dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> As an Irishman with dry skin, I rely on in-shower moisturizers to keep my skin from developing scales during the Winter.</li>
            <li> You then pat your skin dry.  </li>
            <li> After Water Aerobics needed something for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The only down side to this product is if your a guy this stuff seems to leave a shiny sheen on your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars as a moisturizer, but I knocked it down a couple stars because of the characteristics mentioned above.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry scaly winter skin!</li>
            <li> I bought out the shelves at my local drugstore when it fell to half price, fearing it was about to be discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have noticed that I still see red dots on my skin that used to be red bumps, not sure if I need to use the product longer or if it won&#x27;t get rid of the redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this in shower lotion</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I tend to get very dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> It smells so pretty and leaves subtle little sparkles.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves a very subtle (but not cheesy) shimmer to your skin.</li>
            <li> apply only to my arms, legs, stomach and a little on my butt cheeks if I&#x27;m wearing a bathing suit.  </li>
            <li> I like how smooth and moisturized my skin feels (I was afraid the lotion would come off when I dry after the shower with a towel, but it doesn&#x27;t!)</li>
            <li> it is the worst, but since i started using this product my skin fells great,super great product, hope i can keep getting it here</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m doing a whole routine for my chicken skin</li>
            <li> cold and naked applying lotion, then having to wait to get dressed til it is absorbed</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to supplement this product even in harsh Midwest winters with extra lotion.  </li>
            <li> And let me tell you, for anyone who has ever applied lotion to a child (or yourself)and then expected to put their PJ&#x27;s or clothes on them immediately afterward..</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding this product over the winter in my local stores, so ordered it in quantity online-</li>
            <li> Careful though, it also makes your skin sparkle.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find</li>
            <li> work long hrs and needed something to cut my &amp;#34;get ready&amp;#34; time down and</li>
            <li> This works  plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to give it a shot, since it had mineral oil as an ingredient that the other lotion does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> Since I started using Olay In-Shower Body Lotion three years ago I haven&#x27;t had to spend time using other lotions out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to apply any other lotion afterward which saves on time.</li>
            <li> I ordered extras to pass out to other members of my family.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use any other lotion.</li>
            <li> Other than that my skin feels moisturized.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any other products that work like this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep trying other brands (have some Nivea on the way)</li>
            <li> I may try the other type or I might switch over to Satin Care.</li>
            <li> and if you plan on putting on any other products after you shower I do not know how well they will absorb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve practiced using one side of the towel for my hair and the other side for my body.  </li>
            <li> but once you dry off, there are little gold sparks on your body which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I get it through Amazon because it is hard to find at local stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find in our local stores</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected!!</li>
            <li> No more dry, itchy skin if used faithfully.  </li>
            <li> What is does leave are little glittery bits all over my body, which I like quite a bit.</li>
            <li> She loves it because it leaves a little sparkle on her skin-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent is a little stronger than I might like/expect</li>
            <li> My skin has little specks of glimmer clinging to it now</li>
            <li> also find that I still have to use regular lotion on extra dry parts like heels, hands and that weird chafed skin behind my ears.</li>
            <li> It has little shiny particles in it (look at your skin closely after you&#x27;ve dried off - you&#x27;ll see a glittery film), which I think may be why it&#x27;s drying for me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little too heavy for me</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m buying a few from amazon just in case.</li>
            <li> I find it extremly frustrating that our big discount stores don&#x27;t carry it any longer.  </li>
            <li> No matter what heavy lotion</li>
            <li> ever since bbw stopped making their in shower conditioner a couple years back, i&#x27;m addicted to the olay.  </li>
            <li> This is a winter must, but you will want to use it year round.</li>
            <li> The scent is intoxicating, and the moisture is heavenly without feeling oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> read a few reviews where people have noted that the cream was \\&quot;too thick.\\</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days, intentionally not telling my boyfriend, and then once I asked him if he noticed my \\&quot;shimmering\\&quot; skin, he had no idea what I was talking about.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days, intentionally not telling my boyfriend, and then once I asked him if he noticed my \\&quot;shimmering\\&quot; skin, he had no idea what I was talking about.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product becomes drying if used too frequently - I use it once a week tops, just to use it up because I don&#x27;t want to waste it, otherwise I would just throw it away.</li>
            <li> I use less in the summer, usually two bottles (one 2-pack) per month.</li>
            <li> This is not easy for me to find</li>
            <li> I dont usually comment on products...but after reading some of the other negative ones...i am going to sing this products</li>
            <li> I think they got a bad bottle that has been left out too long or was packed somewhere either very cold or very hot.</li>
            <li> Very little fragrance, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usual place on the shelf,</li>
            <li> But, no more, this products works.</li>
            <li> lazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to make of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m to lazy to be bothered to apply lotion after showering</li>
            <li> but I have to admit I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> You shower as usual and rub it in just before leaving the shower.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re lazy.</li>
            <li> Alot of times I&#x27;m just too lazy to put on lotion after I bathe even though I know I need it..</li>
            <li> Recently, I have been unable to find it in the usual retail stores and am thankful that I can order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with regular body lotions as the fragrance made me sneeze like crazy, but the in-shower type never caused any allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Not in a really bad way, just different from the other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy; I hate having to spread and then rub in large amounts of lotion after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Had a really hard time finding in shower body lotion around here.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find it in retail stores</li>
            <li> m trying so hard wash it</li>
            <li> its thick...but not to the point that its hard to get out of the bottle..</li>
            <li> and it is so thick that I could hardly get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I heard about this product when doing some research online to find a way to get rid of my \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; on the back of one arm and my legs.  </li>
            <li> This summer I was at my building pool at least 3 days a week.</li>
            <li> but by no means too thick to squeeze out of the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it is very hard to spread over my skin since it&#x27;s so thick.  </li>
            <li> If I were on vacation, I would just call it &amp;#34;fabulous&amp;#34; and move on, but it&#x27;s a little weird to show up to work with sparkling skin.</li>
            <li> Sorta like Lavender gone bad - is that possible?  </li>
            <li> They either left my skin dry or they smelled awful.</li>
            <li> The water tends to be very hard and this in shower moisturizer does the trick.</li>
            <li> Does mean you will be in the shower five minutes longer!  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately they quit making it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spend hundreds of money buying products that promise to moisturize and combat dryness, but always at the end fail to do anything.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer using this than all my expensive lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive but with the shipping costs</li>
            <li> but it smells weird to me.  </li>
            <li> the dry winter months were awful for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid Olay has discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> and I hate the greasy feel of heavy or even water base lotions.</li>
            <li> Scent--its not that bad..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed in Olay for taking it off store shelves.</li>
            <li> I hated getting out and using body lotion when it was so cold out, now I never have to struggle with that ever again.  </li>
            <li> Which -I absolutely hate.  </li>
            <li> I hate applying sticky lotion and with this you just rub on and rinse off</li>
            <li> Hate to be without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Too awful to use.</li>
            <li> This one, awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is my second choice, only to their other in shower lotion with shea butter.  Olay has really found the magic formula. This works  plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real fan of the Olay Moisturinse In-Shower Body Lotion w/ shea butter, which is becoming really hard to find in stores. I ordered this to give it a shot, since it had mineral oil as an ingredient that the other lotion does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on great in the shower however it felt more sticky than smooth after getting out of the shower. Not in a really bad way, just different from the other product. I will probably stay with the shea butter version - when I can find it! Hopefully it will remain available on Amazon for awhile.</li>
            <li> the best really helps your skin.  use in shower then another moisturizer after.  no winter dry skin</li>
            <li> I started using this after-shower lotion years ago, and now I can only find it on Amazon. I turn off the water after showering, put this lotion on, then turn the water back on and rinse lightly. It is light and not sticky at all, and moisturizes perfectly for our dry winters when the heat is running all the time. I use less in the summer, usually two bottles (one 2-pack) per month. Very little fragrance, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume. I can skip a day, but I notice that my skin is dryer.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and itchy. Bought this in-shower body lotion because I don&#x27;t like feeling sticky to leave lotion on. It works, although some part of my skin still looks/feels dry. I&#x27;m happy with it, and it give you a little bit shimmer on your skin. Will recommend.</li>
            <li> I never have enough time.  So...to get out of the shower and then put lotion on adds an additional step, I do not have time for.  Olay in-shower, lets me put my lotion on before I get out of the shower. Super creamy and moisturizing.  I am hooked!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer no matter what season. Most specially in the winter months. Before this in shower lotion, my winter skin would get sooooo dry &amp; itchy. I also love the subtle sparkle it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product regularly several years ago, bought it at K-Mart or Wal-Mart for around $6.00.  Then it disappeared from the shelves and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere.  I&#x27;ve always had trouble with regular body lotions as the fragrance made me sneeze like crazy, but the in-shower type never caused any allergic reaction. While looking at body-washes on the Amazon site I was amazed to find Quench and with Subscribe and Save I&#x27;m getting it at a great price.  This stuff is the best for dry skin, leaves it smooth and silky all day.  You rinse it off in the shower, pat dry and you are ready for your clothes -- no waiting around for lotion to absorb.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It is quick, non-greasy and lasts all day. I&#x27;m just disappointed in Olay for taking it off store shelves. The next step will be to disappear completely ... so buy it now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3-4 years and absolutely love it.  Putting on lotion in the shower makes it so much easier and does not leave your skin feeling greasy or on your clothes. This lotion is on my top 5 list of things I could not live without. I cannot find this product in any local stores any more and have to purchase it online.  I was so happy to find it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best shower lotion ever! Feels good,smells great! I bought it once then couldn&#x27;t find it in any store. I&#x27;m so glad I found it on line</li>
            <li> I love the Olay In Shower Lotion. It&#x27;s faster and easier to apply lotion in the shower and this product makes my skin so soft. My favorite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use lotion anymore and only use this- it always leaves my skin moisturized and leaves a pretty shimmer as well.</li>
            <li> I got these on a recommendation from a friend.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  I&#x27;m an alligator in the winter and am constantly slathering on lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried using baby oil and lotion but it only lasts so long.  With this, I lotion up in the shower and I&#x27;m good to go.  There was a product years ago by Curel that I loved but unfortunately they quit making it.  This is the closest I can find and it&#x27;s pretty darn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to people.</li>
            <li> i have really dry skin in the winter it is the worst, but since i started using this product my skin fells great,super great product, hope i can keep getting it here</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  Stops the winter itches!  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere in my town so being able to find it online is terrific.  I&#x27;m 44 years old and often get mistaken for someone in my 30&#x27;s.  I use ALL Oil of Olay products and I attribute my good skin to it.  I have my 21 year old daughter using Oil of Olay products NOW.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is to body wash what conditioner is to body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff, it smells amazing and makes my skin silky smooth. I recently moved from a moist climate to a much drier one and my skin felt it. This was a great find, helps lock in the moisture from the shower and leaves skin feeling smooth. And the scent is divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING FOR THE MEN: this will make your skin all glittery, my boyfriend got caught sneaking some of the body lotion that way :)</li>
            <li> I just moved to a very dry climate, and within two showers, this helped bring my skin back to normal. It works as advertised, but it leaves my skin shimmering from what look like tiny sparkles. If I were on vacation, I would just call it &amp;#34;fabulous&amp;#34; and move on, but it&#x27;s a little weird to show up to work with sparkling skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot go without this in-shower body lotion. It makes it so much easier using the lotion in the shower rather than after I shower, which takes a long time. I know when I first read in-shower lotion I thought how could a lotion work in the shower but this product really does work, my skin feels so soft after using and I love the smell. Great Product !</li>
            <li> Since I moved to AZ this stuff has become a regular part of my skin care routine.  I used to find it at Walmart and several of the grocery stores I hit frequently but just like back east, when Wallie World stops selling something so does everyone else.  I&#x27;m so glad I can get it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Had a really hard time finding in shower body lotion around here.  So went to Amazon and bought 6 of them.  Went to visit my husband up north ms. where he is working and found it up there needless to say I have a good supply.  This lotion is the ONLY lotion that I will use, at times I will get itchy and, I use the Olay in shower body lotion. Very happy to know that I can get it at Amazon,</li>
            <li> I had been experiencing severe itching which prompted my doctor to do blood tests, etc., which happily, were negative but the itching actually caused me to bruise my tender skin from scratching.  I tried various after-shower products to no avail and then came across Olay Quench.  Problem is solved!  I will continue to use it even through the summer.</li>
            <li> Love this in-shower moisturizer. So much more convenient than other moisturizers.Keeps my skin always smooth. Have used this for about 1 year.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for the skin. It leaves behind this refreshing fragrance and lovely shimmer. Lasts long. Its for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this in-shower lotion!  I am afraid Olay has discontinued it.  I cannot find it anywhere in stores.</li>
            <li> Leave your skin very soft, and fragrance smell nice</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I had a $10 coupon and I needed to use it off soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion will give you body a slightly golden shinning cover after rinsing with water, and you&#x27;ll feel your skin not that dry anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will be good if you take a shower every day, otherwise, a normal lotion will be needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, I like it.</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well for normal skin ....Not too good for dry skin ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Need not worry about moisturizing after shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently came to know about it and loving it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon currently has the Subscribe and save 15% offer which makes it a much better buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad Amazon carries the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, it&#x27;s one of those things i tell all my friends about.  i have been using it a couple of times a week for years now.  I can&#x27;t live without it in the winter, and it really saved me during my pregnancy when my skin was even more dry (i didn&#x27;t know that was possible).  My skin is so dry it gets itchy, and it is such a pain to use lotion when you have to put it all over your body, then you have to wait for it to dry before getting dressed in the morning.  usually I would just live with the itch, and the consequences.  until a friend told me about this stuff, she stumbled on it on accident thinking it was a body wash.  it is so convenient!  i love the shimmer it leaves on my skin, and my husband notices when i&#x27;ve used it because it leaves my skin is so soft.  It is also really great for your feet, just be careful because it makes them extremely slippery in the shower.  I was just going to the store to get more and didn&#x27;t find it in it&#x27;s usual place on the shelf, oh no!  and i went to another store and found the same thing.  i hope it is not being discontinued!  i&#x27;m buying a few from amazon just in case.</li>
            <li> I can always find everything on Amazon and 99% of time, at a better price with no tax and shipping!! No Brainer!!!  Love this Olay Quench In-Shower!!</li>
            <li> This was great for a month or so, but then it began to give me a bumpy rash on my arms! I&#x27;ve stopped use for now, but I miss it. It has a wonderful scent, and the shimmer is subtle but fun. It&#x27;s great for dorm use because you don&#x27;t have to get naked in front of your roommate to put on lotion after your shower...you get to put lotion on in the privacy of the shower! Super efficient.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many different types of body washes. I was always dissatisfied with the results. They either left my skin dry or they smelled awful. Then I found the yellow bottle of Olay In-Shower Body Lotion. I loved it! I still love that kind (shea butter) but have found that I prefer the \\&quot;Quench\\&quot; In-Shower Body Lotion best. It does not leave a film on my skin like the shea butter variation. What is does leave are little glittery bits all over my body, which I like quite a bit. It&#x27;s almost like my skin shimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only form of body wash/lotion I will use anymore. I&#x27;ve abandoned all others because they simply do not leave my skin as soft and radiant as this one does. I&#x27;ve used either \\&quot;Quench\\&quot; or the one with the shea butter for the last eight years, and I have no idea what I will do if they ever stop producing them, or change the ingredients as many companies see fit to do. I live in a very dry area, so I must have something that moisturizes nicely, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, as there is nothing else that comes close to leaving skin soft and radiant!</li>
            <li> This product actually works! I&#x27;ve spend hundreds of money buying products that promise to moisturize and combat dryness, but always at the end fail to do anything. But, no more, this products works. All you have to do is put it on after showering and then you rinse it off and bam. Its done. It smells wonderful, it moisturizes but once you dry off, there are little gold sparks on your body which is a plus. Now my whole body isn&#x27;t just moisturized and smooth, it also glows. LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I purchased this product initially (when it first came on the market) at Walmart with the Body Wash and Lotion. Recently, this product has been removed from all stores in Kansas. Why, I don&#x27;t know. This product add extra body moisture and silkiness to the skin. I was without this product for 2 weeks until I found it on Amazon. My body did not have the extra silkiness and moisture with the Body wash and Lotion alone. I would recommend this product highly. I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! The shimmer it leaves is gorgeous and very natural looking. My skin is softer using this than all my expensive lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It stays on until the next time I shower. I just wish I could find it in stores! I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> A bunch of moisture going out of drain</li>
            <li> I love it. The best for  your skin and easiest to apply.</li>
            <li> Since this product has disappeared from store shelves, the internet seems to be the only place to find it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s still around, because it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found to keep my skin from drying and flaking,&lt;br /&gt; especially when in AZ in the winter. Even here at home, during the summer it keeps my legs smooth for&lt;br /&gt;shorts-wearing season.</li>
            <li> Since I started using Olay In-Shower Body Lotion three years ago I haven&#x27;t had to spend time using other lotions out of the shower.  It works great and saves me a lot of time getting ready for work. I find it extremly frustrating that our big discount stores don&#x27;t carry it any longer.  I wonder if they have a clue what a dis-service they have created by taking it off the shelves?</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay In-Shower Body Lotion now for a few years and just love this product.  I used to buy it retail at Wal-Mart, Target and/or Walgreens but none of them carry the product anymore.  I was so thrilled to find it on Amazon as I was afraid it had been discontinued.  I&#x27;m not good about moisturizing after showering so this product fit the bill for me.  I slather it on after showering and rinse off.  My skin stays moisturized for hours and I don&#x27;t have to supplement this product even in harsh Midwest winters with extra lotion.  It does not leave the shower floor slippery and has a nice light scent that does not conflict with my fragrance.  There is no way I can think of to improve this product.</li>
            <li> I found the product very hard to fine in a store. Works great to soften skin and has a nice smell. I live where the water is hard so this keeps skin feeling soft. A nice pamper your self in shower lotion.</li>
            <li> You know, I&#x27;ve been looking for weeks for this item in the stores and haven&#x27;t found it, so I am super hyped that it is on Amazon.  I primarily use it on my daughter (4 years old).  Her skin gets dry and sometimes ashy during the winter.  This stuff is perfect for her.  It has never irritated her skin and leaves it soft and smooth.  She loves it because it leaves a little sparkle on her skin- It makes her feel like a princess!  And it&#x27;s a superior alternative to regular body lotion.  Why?  Well, first, you apply it in the shower and rinse it off.  This is a bonus for me because while I&#x27;m applying it, I&#x27;ve already applied the conditioner to her hair and it gives it time to soak in. And let me tell you, for anyone who has ever applied lotion to a child (or yourself)and then expected to put their PJ&#x27;s or clothes on them immediately afterward.. you&#x27;ve got another thing coming.  It&#x27;s a hassle to have to have her wait to get dressed while the lotion soaks in.  By doing it in the shower- she&#x27;s ready to get into her PJ&#x27;s as soon as I towel her off!  I highly recommend this product over regular body lotion.  Suitable for all skin types and ethnicities (my daughter is mixed)  I even use it in the winter- and my skin is normally oily.  But- as you age, your skin becomes drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and you don&#x27;t get that greasy \\&quot;lotion didn&#x27;t soak all they way into my hands after applying\\&quot; feel either.  Which -I absolutely hate.  Awesome Awesome product!  So GLAD Amazon has it!!!</li>
            <li> This product is not easily found in retail outlets, so I was very happy to see Amazon has it.  Helps with dry scaly winter skin!</li>
            <li> I have never heard about in-shower lotions until I saw this product on Amazon and all high reviews. I gave it a try - and I have to say, I really like it! Whoever thought of this idea - thank you! I like how smooth and moisturized my skin feels (I was afraid the lotion would come off when I dry after the shower with a towel, but it doesn&#x27;t!) and I like the healthy shimmer that the lotion leaves on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower.  Then I get out and do not have to apply lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will love it</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding this product over the winter in my local stores, so ordered it in quantity online-my skin gets so dry in the winter and this is the only lotion that works!!! Love it. Only draw back is that it does make the shower floor a little slippery, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and I use this product regularly in the shower. Works well to keep my skin hydrated and you don&#x27;t need to apply any other lotion afterward which saves on time. Only flaw is that you have to pat your skin dry else all the hydration disappears for some reason.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of moisturizers that make great promises but finally Olay has created one that really delivers.  This product DOES make a difference in your skin!</li>
            <li> I have tried several kinds but none have worked like this one does....  No wonder my dermatologist suggested it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put it on while you are conditioning your hair and by the time your done with that it is time to rinse off...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin is left feeling smooth and silky...</li>
            <li> I love this product! after use i didn&#x27;t have to apply lotion at all. My skin was soft all day long! I would be buying it again for sure!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and especially appreciate the fact that I can subscribe and get a shipment every month from Amazon since I can no longer find this in any store.  This is easy to use, so convenient, and works like a charm!!  I hope they NEVER stop making this product.  If they do, I&#x27;ll cry :)!!</li>
            <li> I have chronic eczema, so I either have to slather myself in lotion after every shower or use a shower oil/in-shower body lotion (in addition to always taking multivitamins with Vitamin D). Unfortunately this product becomes drying if used too frequently - I use it once a week tops, just to use it up because I don&#x27;t want to waste it, otherwise I would just throw it away. It has little shiny particles in it (look at your skin closely after you&#x27;ve dried off - you&#x27;ll see a glittery film), which I think may be why it&#x27;s drying for me. I&#x27;ll buy the yellow capped version next time.</li>
            <li> As you may have noticed, this is one of the most positively-reviewed items for skin.  For good reason!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it since roughly 2002, or whenever it originally came out in different packaging.  My dry, itchy skin continues to be smooth &amp; silky.  Whenever I am traveling and forget to pack it, or on any day that I run out, I definitely notice a difference.  It&#x27;s like conditioner, but for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  It leaves your skin feeling silky smooth, and in the winter it makes a huge difference for me.  No more dry, itchy skin if used faithfully.  I hope Olay never stops making it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this in-shower lotion.  I have dry skin as well as a chronic skin conditio and this really helps my skin retain moisture.  My skin literally does not feel the same without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It leaves my skin silky and not greasy.  I ordered extras to pass out to other members of my family.  They all love it.</li>
            <li> The bottle sizes are great and i use this product everyday in the shower after lathering and rinsing my body wash off. i have been a fan of this product since it was first launched and given free samples with the quench lotion which is also a winner. i love the shimmers and sparkles and even though i have dark skin it is still visible</li>
            <li> Loved this product. I get out of the shower feeling amazing and don&#x27;t need to apply any extra cream. I&#x27;m very sensitive to the smell of perfume and lotion but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with this products smell. I actually loved the glittery shine it gives off after you apply it. Will keep purchasing</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and simply can&#x27;t go without it.  It is the only thing that makes the tiny bumps on the back of my arms go away!  I have been looking for it for weeks in stores all over Texas and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I&#x27;m glad it is available here!</li>
            <li> As always one of wife&#x27;s favorite products arrived as ordered and of course,right on time. We were out one day and back in business the next.</li>
            <li> I have used Olay products before and for me this product does what it state. I live in a dry state, and my skin shows this in the winter, this lotion makes my skin feel smooth and soft and quenched. I really like the easy way that I can apply the lotion before stepping out of the shower,  to me it is just faster than applying after getting out of the shower, for me its a real time saver. I think the smell is a clean, floral scent, which I like but do not love. That is the only reason I did not give it full stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to slather lotion and let it dry before dressing every morning, and this in-shower lotion fits my lifestyle perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I can only get it on line, but I use it whenever I shower.</li>
            <li> Glitter is fun sometimes, but not everyday. However, it has a really good smell. Would only use this fragrance during holidays or special occasions.</li>
            <li> I was so bummed after not being able to find this product in any store.  Thank goodness that Amazon still sells it.  This lotion leaves an amazing, long lasting smell and leaves your skin feeling fantastic.  Not slimy at all.  No after shower lotion needed.  It also leaves a very subtle (but not cheesy) shimmer to your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy; I hate having to spread and then rub in large amounts of lotion after I get out of the shower. Not to mention, lotion never does the trick for me anyway, and baby oil or Vaseline is really a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this. I slather it on after I&#x27;ve washed up, and then I just rinse it off. I&#x27;m hesitent to use it with a lufa... It seems against nature to put lotion on in the shower to begin with, I think that&#x27;d push it too far. It&#x27;s the only lotion that&#x27;s ever had decent results with my skin, and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong, but I actually like that about it. Careful though, it also makes your skin sparkle. I found this out while at the pool when my boyfriend asked me if I were a vampire. Jokes on him though, he&#x27;s the one that knows enough about Twilight to make references.</li>
            <li> Love this in shower body lotion. It keeps my skin smooth and supple even in the winter. I have it shipped to me as a regular subscription from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and the hard water where I live doesn&#x27;t help. No matter what heavy lotion I use my skin is still dry and I hate the greasy feel of heavy or even water base lotions. I bought this to try to see it it would help. It is wonderfu! After using this stuff my super dry skin is soft and moisturized and I don&#x27;t have to use any other lotion. All you have to do is after washing rub this on like regular lotion and rinse off. It&#x27;s that simple. The only down side to this product is if your a guy this stuff seems to leave a shiny sheen on your skin (I like the glittery look but some may not). I have a bottle in the shower and on on the sink so that after washing my hands I can rub it on and rinse it off to keep my hands soft. It&#x27;s great stuff and won&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> This in shower body lotion has changed my life.  Honestly, I used to live up north and the dry winter months were awful for my skin.  Having a lotion to use in the shower makes it so much easier and efficient to use lotion.  I hated getting out and using body lotion when it was so cold out, now I never have to struggle with that ever again.  I will never skip using this product when I take a shower!  It also has a very mild shimmer which is an added bonus :)</li>
            <li> I especially love this in shower lotion because it is the one with shimmer. I hate applying sticky lotion and with this you just rub on and rinse off and there you go, awesome skin! It smells super fresh and clean and it leaves your skin soft while giving it a subtle shimmer that gives you a healthy dewy look.  For some reason this lotion is never in stores so I have to order it online. I am very happy that I can still buy it.</li>
            <li> I really wish stores would go back to carrying this in-shower lotion - it&#x27;s just wonderful. Smells great, is a superb moisturizer for my extra-dry skin, lasts all day; and has a little bit of sparkle to it, that stays on skin all day, and gives beautiful, subtle shimmer!!</li>
            <li> Hate to be without this stuff! I don&#x27;t like to moisturize after the shower...lazy I guess...but this I can do right in the shower and it smells GREAT!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  The sparkle is great.  I wish the bottles were larger and had more lotion in them.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this shower lotion leaves my skin.  It is so easy to put this on while in the shower and simply rinse off and all your moisturizing needs are done!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> Was worried this would be gimmicky, but it&#x27;s perfect, especially for the winter.  It gives me the option to either not put on lotion right after the shower (for instance if I&#x27;m going to blow out my hair and don&#x27;t want greasy fingers), or add lotion and double up on moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is a little stronger than I might like/expect but my boyfriend loves the way my skin smells now so I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it after using body wash. I put it on, then rinse it off. It really does make my lotion more effective and last longer. Also, a little goes a long way. I will buy this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> i almost don&#x27;t want to give this such a high rating, because then other people will buy it all up. But i absolutely love this stuff. I have issues with dry skin a lot, and using this in the shower helps clear it right up, getting rid of any itchy dry skin by making it all soft. It does have a bit of glitter in it, which I don&#x27;t love, because it looks like i am wearing glitter, but thats okay when I have such good-looking skin!</li>
            <li> Quench is an in-shower body lotion. Put in on in the shower and rinse it off. I&#x27;m not sure what to make of it. I save a step after showering, but I have an extra step in the shower. It&#x27;s supposed to be a lotion, but it feels more like a thick cream -- I have to work to squeeze it out of the bottle. My skin has a nice shimmer afterwards, but I don&#x27;t feel as moisturized as I do with a regular body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to think of it, I like the feel of a body lotion better. When my bottle of Quench runs out, I&#x27;m going back to body lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m to lazy to be bothered to apply lotion after showering so I bought this product to multi-task while in the shower. The only thing I dislike about the product is that there appears to be some sort of &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; residue. Other than that my skin feels moisturized. It would be great if they made a product that contained SPF.</li>
            <li> ever since bbw stopped making their in shower conditioner a couple years back, i&#x27;m addicted to the olay.  it&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer, and no waiting for lotion to dry before you put clothes on.  just wish it came in more scents.</li>
            <li> I have a major problem with dry skin in the winter but I have to admit I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to moisturizing.  This product is awesome and makes things so easy!  You just put in on in the shower and wash it off and your body feels smooth and moisturized all day.  Everyone I&#x27;ve told about this product is addicted, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my dry skin.  It is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t make the bathtub slippery and leaves you soft and not sticky.  I think this product is being phased out and it is becoming harder to find.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because my skin is dry.  It is hard to find it in retail stores so was happy to find it on Amazon.  It is just like a conditioner for your hair but for your skin instead.</li>
            <li> This Oley in shower body lotion is the total best moistureizer I have ever used. It leaves your body soft and shinny. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this product...was bummed when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  Leaves a light sparkle all day.  Can&#x27;t live with out it! An affordable luxury.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It is not available through any of the major retailers such as Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Target and so many other places.  I was ecstatic to find it online.  The price is cheap when you factor in the postage, etc.  It seems expensive but with the shipping costs and that is double the size that I know was sold in thes stores, it is an excellent value.  If you follow the directions and put it on after a shower when you skin is somewhat dry, then rinse it off, it leaves the body smooth and makes one sleep soundly throughout the night.  A+++ (Highest rating, 5 Stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott Newberg -- Email:  stevenaz1015@aol.com or scott.newberg@asu.edu (I obtain email from each address.  Most write to the AOL address, others write to the &amp;#34;.edu&amp;#34; address.  I get mail from both email boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for carrying such a great product.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my skin looks and feels great and I&#x27;m almost 50. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t any other products that work like this one. It is becoming harder to find and Amazon has done a great job of keeping it in stock and keeping us stocked up.</li>
            <li> This is a winter must, but you will want to use it year round. You shower as usual and rub it in just before leaving the shower. After a quick rinse, you&#x27;re done. The scent is intoxicating, and the moisture is heavenly without feeling oily or heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy as well as pleased with the product.  It definitely works.  They probably have a customer for now and ever.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful love the shimmer.</li>
            <li> I love the clean fresh smell. It is an interesting concept, like a conditioner that you rinse off, only for your body, not your hair. My skin does feel very soft and clean. If I really want to get even more moisture on days when I was out in the sun, I would add lotion on top, but it is not necessary. This is a quick way to moisturize your body without the hassle of applying cream and waiting for it to dry. And you can&#x27;t beat the price on top of everything! I love it, and already bought my second set.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nice and thick. I use it for shaving, makes everythiing smooth and easy. You have to make sure that you rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really keeps skin silky smooth! ...but the price is seriously inflated on Amazon right now. The first time I purchased it I got 2 for $7.68 ....</li>
            <li> Best moisturiser/body lotion I have ever found, just wish Amazon would ship it to Australia.  Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy, but still feels moisturised.  Wish I had found it years ago.</li>
            <li> I love this and can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.  It smells great, leaves your skin silky soft, and my favorite part is the slight shimmer it leaves on the skin.  Beautiful!</li>
            <li> I am so bummed that I can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.  I will order it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> The first part of my order (2pk of 15.2 oz) was used and it was what I expected of my order. However, just opened the second part of my order (2pk of 15.2 oz) and it&#x27;s been too long on your shelf. It not a lotion but like a paste (both packs). Too awful to use. Can it be replaced?</li>
            <li> For some reason you can no longer find this lotion in the store. I am so glad I can still buy it here on Amazon with subscription services.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel!  It smells so pretty and leaves subtle little sparkles.  So much better than lotioning after the shower.  I don&#x27;t use it much in the summer, but as soon as I feel that first fall nip in the air and I know everyone is about to turn on the heaters, I stock up and use it every day.  Surprisingly hard to find in stores for such a great item - so glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> I bought this accidentally, but I will continue to buy this product. It smells great, and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Ever had to deal with putting clothing on while extra sticky....not with this. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  I have tried everything from over the counter lotions to prescription lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works as well as this does.  My skin is so soft now.  I cannot believe what a difference this has made.  I will always have this in my vanity!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Moisturizes pretty well. But stays in the bathtub, so make sure you Tilex the shower every time you get out.</li>
            <li> this body lotion is the best ever! i love to be able to use it in the shower. i am no longer able to find it in stores, so i hope it continues to be available on line</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re lazy. Aren&#x27;t we all in one way or another? We all have our ways to cut corners and when you see this stuff in the health and beauty section of the store, you&#x27;re thinking OMG I CAN TOTALLY JUST PUT LOTION ON IN THE SHOWER AND SAVE TIME!! Hold it right there, Lazypants, not so fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, using this product actually ADDS a step because you have to rinse it off. Of course, if you&#x27;re so lazy that&#x27;s too much effort for you, you deserve those ashy elbows of yours. So here&#x27;s how it works: soap up (I use a poof with a nice exfoliating center), rinse off soap, put on lotion, rinse off lotion, get out of shower and pat dry. I have forgotten I used this stuff a few times right after getting out of the shower and scrubbed myself dry but it doesn&#x27;t seem to ruin the moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this stuff moisturizes better than regular lotion, lasts all day and smells fantastic. The smell doesn&#x27;t really hang around but I have an army of cats at my house so it&#x27;s possible that inhaling cat litter and cat puke all day has dulled my senses a notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find that I still have to use regular lotion on extra dry parts like heels, hands and that weird chafed skin behind my ears. I don&#x27;t really use this stuff on my feet because, as others have pointed out, it can make the shower really slippery and falling on my butt in the shower isn&#x27;t something I really enjoy doing. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face because I&#x27;m not *that* lazy and use a special overpriced drug store cream for that. Yes it adds ANOTHER step but it&#x27;s important to take care of your skin as it&#x27;s the largest organ in your body according to my 4th grade science teacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, dudes can use this too! It doesn&#x27;t make you fruity, it makes you smooth and trust me, your lady (or dudes you let rub you down) will appreciate it!</li>
            <li> I love Olay in shower body lotion since it came out a few years ago with the name \\&quot;Moisturinse.\\&quot;  I bought out the shelves at my local drugstore when it fell to half price, fearing it was about to be discontinued.  My devotion has remained steadfast even though Olay has changed the name (it was \\&quot;Moisturinse,\\&quot; then \\&quot;Quench\\&quot;) and despite the fact that my local stores no longer stocked it on their shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all these obstacles, I am a loyal fan and regular user of this in-shower lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I used up my travel supply during a winter visit to the midwest and couldn&#x27;t find any at the local store, I was pleased to find Olay In-Shower Body Lotion in a newly restyled bottle on Amazon and ordered up a couple of bottles to tide me over.  They arrived just in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy heck, when did Olay reformulate this stuff to include GLITTER?!  My skin has little specks of glimmer clinging to it now and I feel like one of those mirrored disco balls.  I read through the description here on Amazon and nowhere in the description do I see that they&#x27;ve added sparkles to the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion still does its awesome job of moisturizing my skin, but please, Olay, ditch the glimmer stuff.  I am a middle aged woman with dry skin, not a disco queen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never given a less-than-stellar review to Olay products, but my sparkly skin causes me to subtract one star.</li>
            <li> i really wanted to like this, but maybe all the rave reviews inflated my expectations. it wasn&#x27;t really as moisturizing as baby oil, applied to damp skin after shower, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Since using the In Shower lotion, I have had no trouble with dry skin! I use it daily and highly recommend it. I get it through Amazon because it is hard to find at local stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay In-Shower Body Lotion since it first came out and I never cease to be amazed at how soft and pliable my skin is.  I&#x27;m an older woman and it&#x27;s done wonders for my aging skin including elbows, knees and chest, but mostly my skin has improved so that others notice.  I&#x27;ve never been one to use lotion all over my body, but I will do it as part of my shower ritual and I wouldn&#x27;t be without out it.  I&#x27;ve even created a travel bottle to take with me.</li>
            <li> This is not easy for me to find so I was so happy to find it on Amaz.  Especially available on subscribe + save, so I get enough to last 2 months at a time and no shipping charge.  The thing that I enjoy most about this body lotion is that you put it on right in the shower, then rinse briefly.  Alot of times I&#x27;m just too lazy to put on lotion after I bathe even though I know I need it..This takes care of that!  I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a heavy duty moisturizer like Eucerin ( for really dry skin), but it does more than an adequate job and it smells wonderful on your skin after you&#x27;ve dried off.  I can still feel some the next morning.  There are several types available, I&#x27;ve tried two and enjoy both kinds!</li>
            <li> I can NOT find this product at Walmart, Target, the supermarket, or drug stores for some reason. This stuff is great. I love to use it after I shave. Just smooth it on, and then I let it sit for a few. It smells great and rinses off easily, but leaves your skin moisturized. Great for those who are in a rush and don&#x27;t have time to use lotion after the shower.</li>
            <li> Putting on lotion in the shower makes it so much easier for lazy people like me. However this is definitely not as moisturizing as a standalone applied moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I can&#x27;t find this stuff in stores.  It is so easy and convenient to put this lotion on while in the shower and rinse it off.  Then when you&#x27;re done and dry off, your skin is dry but wonderfully soft and hydrated.  It is a real time saver for me.  It does have a bit of shimmer to it, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever try it on my face though.  I hope they do not discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I can no longer find it in stores so I order it from Amazon.  I have dry skin and live in Colorado (DRY!) and I like being able to quickly apply a moisturizer in the shower and rinse it off, so when I get out of the shower I don&#x27;t have to stand there cold and naked applying lotion, then having to wait to get dressed til it is absorbed...I don&#x27;t have time of patience for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what I love best is it leaves a very subtle shimmer that makes your skin look like it&#x27;s glowing, but not in a glittery way.  I love this product for summer time - it really makes your skin look fantastic, and feel fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply only to my arms, legs, stomach and a little on my butt cheeks if I&#x27;m wearing a bathing suit.  My skin tends to break out if I put anything (even too much sunblock) on my back or chest - so I just avoid those areas with lotion.  No clogged pores on any of my body that I use it on. :)</li>
            <li> I can only find it in the stores at Christmas time as part of a set. I am so happy to have enough to get me through for a while. It makes my skin so nice and smooth :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the moisture of my skin.  I still use lotion after showering on the very dry parts of my skin, but it does seem to work on the other areas of my skin that are not extremely dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry so I m always looking for nice product for my dry skin. This one, awful. It don&#x27;t make my skin more moist but smell strange and after I m trying so hard wash it but still something left on my skin. Under the light I can see their shinning. I do not like my skin just looks shining with some material I can&#x27;t tell. I pay for make my skin health and comfortable soft. I m so glade it didn&#x27;t damage my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay in-shower lotions for a long time.  This is the first time I ordered Quench.  The lotion is really a cream and it is so thick that I could hardly get it out of the bottle.  Also, it is very hard to spread over my skin since it&#x27;s so thick.  Just added time to my shower time.  I ordered six bottles and returned five.  Had to keep the opened one - it&#x27;s going in the trash.  I will go back to the shea butter in-shower lotion.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this in stores for several years and was so excited to see it on here!  It&#x27;s awesome and so much easier to do it in the shower.  It makes my skin just as soft as any other lotion, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all!  Try it!  Be careful about slipping in the shower, though, it can make it slick! :)</li>
            <li> Love this lotion because I can use it in the shower.  You can shower and lotion all at one time. No mess</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Softens skin extremely well, and effects last for 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;2. Has really softened my skin and I have keratosis pilaris all over my arms and legs.&lt;br /&gt;3. Super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Clogs up the shower drain! I used Drano when I first noticed it but the clogging started up again almost immediately. I&#x27;m still going to use this but will have to keep a supply of Drano (get it from your local Dollar Store). I&#x27;ve had to use Drano/Liquid Plummer about once/week to keep the drain clear.&lt;br /&gt;2. Price here is higher than other places. Check Google shopping to compare prices.&lt;br /&gt;3. Container isn&#x27;t optimal for using in the shower. It&#x27;s big and clunky. I bought a big bottle dispenser from the dollar store and put this lotion in that for easier use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m very happy with this and will keep buying it. I&#x27;ve seen many negative comments about the smell, which is very strong at first and your bathroom will smell like it for a few hours, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;ve also never noticed any glitter whatsoever. I want to try the shea butter version next.</li>
            <li> This is moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t make me break out (which I&#x27;m prone to on my shoulders), so that&#x27;s a plus. I love how quick it is (compared to putting lotion on after the shower). I use it on weekday mornings when I&#x27;m getting ready for work and save the lotion for the weekends when I have a few extra minutes. My only complaints are 1) the sparkles and 2) the fragrance. The sparkles are unnecessary (plus, if you want to share with the man in your life, he might be less than thrilled). The fragrance is a little too heavy for me (I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents). I&#x27;m going to keep trying other brands (have some Nivea on the way) but this is a back-up plan.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product when doing some research online to find a way to get rid of my \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; on the back of one arm and my legs.  I figured it could do double duty since I also have very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing. I have never been so soft. And it does leave you \\&quot;shimmery\\&quot;. You can&#x27;t really tell in regular light; but if you get under led lights or twisty bulb lights....you just shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m doing a whole routine for my chicken skin and it&#x27;s slowly getting better. However, I&#x27;ll keep buying this even if I do get rid of my problem.  I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;ve kept such an amazing secret!</li>
            <li> I have used Olay In-Shower Body Lotion for more than 5 years and love it.  I have very dry skin, particularly in the winter.  Using the In-Shower Body Lotion makes it so easy to hydrate my skin and keep it moist.</li>
            <li> Great product! Never forget to put on your lotion again! Easy to use in the shower, apply it like soap and then rinse.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times. BUT, the few times I have used it, my skin feels awesome when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I have been using it every time I shower/bathe for years and have managed to minimize dry skin issues. Recently, I have been unable to find it in the usual retail stores and am thankful that I can order it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> could not get through the winter without it.. Dry,dry skin is no longer a problem</li>
            <li> So Great!!! I love this stuff. Arrived as expected!! great job!&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived and was just descibed!! Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Quench in shower body lotion for about a week now. I&#x27;ve read some previous reviews and think that while, some good points are made, some things definitely need to be clarified about this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MOISTUREIZER&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start with the easy point, yes this is a GREAT moisturizer. I&#x27;ve dealt with \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; for my whole life and never has my skin FELT so smooth! Now, I have noticed that I still see red dots on my skin that used to be red bumps, not sure if I need to use the product longer or if it won&#x27;t get rid of the redness.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, okay, I use a lot of different things for shaving cream for my legs in an effort to get them feel smoother: conditioner, body soap with lotion, you name it. However, this product DOES NOT make a good shaving cream! It&#x27;s thicker than most other stuff and clogs the razor in a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREASEY-NESS&lt;br /&gt;What I LOOVE about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t stick to your hands. I am a rock climber, and applying regular lotion is such a pain because afterwards I have to scrub my hands to make sure the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave my hands grease. I swear, even after I scrub, my hands will still hold on to regular lotion. With the in-shower stuff, my hands do not feel greasy or slippery afterwards! It&#x27;s so nice not to have to worry about greasy lotion-y hands. SO, if you are looking for a HAND lotion, this would probably not be your best bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEXTURE&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews where people have noted that the cream was \\&quot;too thick.\\&quot; I haven&#x27;t noticed that at all. I think they got a bad bottle that has been left out too long or was packed somewhere either very cold or very hot. They texture is that of a thicker conditioner but by no means too thick to squeeze out of the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL&lt;br /&gt;It smells like lavender. Smells clean, not crazy strong (I mean maybe while you&#x27;re putting it on, but it wouldn&#x27;t overpower a body spray or perfume).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE &#x27;GLITTER&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I found it hilarious that people were complaining about the &#x27;glitter&#x27; in this product once I finally used it! You have to literally have your nose to your skin in bright light to see it. I used it for a few days, intentionally not telling my boyfriend, and then once I asked him if he noticed my \\&quot;shimmering\\&quot; skin, he had no idea what I was talking about. I had to literally stick my arm up to his face right after a shower for him to see any of the \\&quot;glitter.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t find it at all distracting or even noticeable. You&#x27;d have to be reallllly scrutinizing your skin to notice any \\&quot;glitter.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;I find this way easier than putting on normal lotion. You&#x27;re already naked and warm, you just quickly apply, rinse, and go. No rubbing in, making sure it absorbs, waiting, yadda yadda. I like it, and will continue using it!that people were complaining about the &#x27;glitter&#x27; in this product once I finally used it!

            <li> I absolutely love this product, I love how it leaves your skin feeling moisturized all day just from the shower!  I don&#x27;t know why stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> Great feel good product. Will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a rinse off moisturizer would be effective, but this stuff is great.  My dry skin was so soft and felt so much better.  I wish I stumbled onto this a long time ago.  It smells good, too.  This is now a &#x27;must have&#x27; product for me.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are hooked on this lotion!  We both use it every time we take a shower.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of a greasy film.  My skin does have a faint shimmer after I use it, which I love!  It&#x27;s sometimes hard to find in our local stores so I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I love it feels like I&#x27;ve put lotion on without actually putting it on. Like skipping a step in moisturizing but having all the benefits of it.</li>
            <li> I am new to the In-Shower Moisturizers but saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a shot.  I used it the first time today (it arrived before I took my shower).  I can already feel a huge different on my arms and legs.  They feel very smooth, but not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee I will be using this product on a daily basis from now on.</li>
            <li> A great product! Worked way better than I expected, didn&#x27;t need lotion at all and my legs were so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> A must have when showering at the health club.  The water tends to be very hard and this in shower moisturizer does the trick.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff, so far, after 2 days of use does moisturize my skin but it smells weird to me.  Sorta like Lavender gone bad - is that possible?  Anyway, I will not be purchasing this again.  I may try the other type or I might switch over to Satin Care.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion when I am in the shower and love the way my skin feels after I put it on. Plus it adds a shimmer on my skin which I love.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t feel like lot ironing up after a shower, I use this before I get out.  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good and leaves your skin feeling wonderful. I will definitely buy more when I run out. Oil of Olay is my favorite for lotions</li>
            <li> I was very happy and surprised with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work long hrs and needed something to cut my &amp;#34;get ready&amp;#34; time down and this does the trick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin moisturized and smelling nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue using.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the good reviews on Amazon, but I was not as blown away as many of them they seemed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, it seems that a lot of people think this works as a super-moisturizing body wash.  In fact, it is just lotion.  On the bottle, it says to wash with soap and rinse off before putting on the lotion and rinsing it off.  For me, this adds too many steps--I&#x27;d rather just put on lotion after my shower and not have to bother with rinsing it off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the smell to be too strong, but I tend to like milder fragrances.  The smell sticks with you for most of your day as long as you aren&#x27;t doing anything too strenuous.  The \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; it adds to skin is kind of odd.  Some people like it and some don&#x27;t; I&#x27;m indifferent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as moisturizing, this does a great job.  I&#x27;d give it five stars as a moisturizer, but I knocked it down a couple stars because of the characteristics mentioned above.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I love it.  This summer I was at my building pool at least 3 days a week. The lotion kept my skin from becoming dry and flaky.  It&#x27;s also kept my skin looking younger.[[ASIN:B001JQLNJG Olay Quench In-Shower Body Lotion, 15.2 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty great. So handy to be able to use it in the shower. Really keeps your skin moisturized and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> As an Irishman with dry skin, I rely on in-shower moisturizers to keep my skin from developing scales during the Winter. I have used this product and other versions of it prepared by the same manufacturer. My skin is smooth and not subject to dryness when I use it every other day in the shower. I also use the body shampoo version for extrs care.</li>
            <li> I love Olay In-Shower Body Lotion and am so glad to have found a consistent source of it!  I started using it years ago, but all of the stores in my area stopped carrying it.  It&#x27;s as effective as a regular body lotion, but faster and easier to apply.  I love anything that can help streamline my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion if you hate that greasy feel from conventional lotion.  Put it on in the shower then rinse it off (like hair conditioner) and your skin will fee moisturized and nourished but not greasy.  Love the light scent it has.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It is moisturizing and makes my skin feel so soft. It makes life easier when you can do it all in the shower.</li>
            <li> How nice to be all lotioned up before getting out of the shower. It smells so nice. I wish everyone would try this, we girls are lucky to have it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my body feeling soft and smelling good&lt;br /&gt;I also love the shine and the little sparklers all over.</li>
            <li> Love this product, clean fresh smell, not overpowering</li>
            <li> I like this product!  It does save a step however I would not recommend using it as shaving cream as it will clog your razor and if you plan on putting on any other products after you shower I do not know how well they will absorb. Its a great alternative when I want to have a quick shower and am feeling lazy!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have very dry skin and this in shower lotion helps a lot. It&#x27;s scent is very light and flowery. Good for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find</li>
            <li> Using this lotion after my shower and rinsing off is a dream! My skin is soft and I love using it in the shower. Very easy to rinse off and love the hint of sparkles it leaves behind.  Will continue to purchase and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! Smells nice and light, and gives your skin a light shimmer. Very hard to find in stores and the price is nice here!</li>
            <li> I cannot shower without this! I have very dry skin so using this helps me so much during any type of season. Also I love it when I use it in the summer that it leaves a shimmer on my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, this adds an extra step in the shower (it is not soap!) but it allows my skin to stay hydrated without having to use normal lotion. No stickiness, no waiting for the lotion to absorb. Just slather on in the shower and rinse. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while, now I found it on Amazon at a cheaper price and always available on the subscription plan.  You use this at the end of your shower.  Rub it all over and then lightly rinse it off.  You then pat your skin dry.  You will need a separate towel for your hair so as not to get it in your hair.  I&#x27;ve practiced using one side of the towel for my hair and the other side for my body.  This make your skin feel silky smooth and all the flakes on your legs (winter skin) disappear.  It is also great when you are peeling from sun exposure.  I am fair so I burn, peel and burn again.  This helps with the itching from peeling.  If I use every two to three days, I have no dry skin at all.  Does mean you will be in the shower five minutes longer!  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really works.  After Water Aerobics needed something for dry skin.  Smells good and easy to use..</li>
            <li> I dont usually comment on products...but after reading some of the other negative ones...i am going to sing this products praises!&lt;br /&gt;1) Product thickness-- its thick...but not to the point that its hard to get out of the bottle..I do warm it up under the hot water before using&lt;br /&gt;2) Scent--its not that bad..I dont wear any kind of perfume..so I am sensitive to smells..but this one..not so bad..its nice not overpowering at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Sparkles--yes there are tiny sparkles..but not obnoxious. I am 44 and dont feel I am too old for a little sparkle..after all I sparkle on the inside..why not bring it to the outside so everyone knows how fabulous I am...but in all serious..its so slight..I had to turn my arm to reflect light to see any..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this..and will buy it until it gets discontinued</li>
            <li> absolutely love this Olay Quench In-shower lotion. I tend to get very dry itchy skin but I don&#x27;t really care for the way lotions feel on my skin. Then I found this in-shower lotion. You slather it on while in the shower and rinse it off. It leaves your skin nice and soft but not feeling oily or greasy on your skin. It does a great job keeping my skin from getting dry and itchy. I was buying this at Walmart, but they stopped carrying it and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. I finally looked on Amazon and was so happy to find it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This in-shower lotion makes moisturizing your skin so much easier and hassle free. I am never without it now.</li>
            <li> I love this produce. My skin always feeling velvety soft after I use it. Just wish I could find it as easily from other stores.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great. Easy to use.</li>
