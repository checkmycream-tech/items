            <li>#34;China Glaze is a Great brand of nail polish.</li>

            <li>This is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>AMAZING DEAL!</li>
            <li>The colors included are great with a good variety.</li>
            <li>I am loving this concept!  </li>
            <li>Good consistency, good coverage, beautiful rich colors and the magnets work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(I applied the polish &amp; immediately held the magnet closely over my nail &amp; waited a good 30 seconds)</li>
            <li>it is really good.</li>
            <li>which is surprising.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>but I guess there good for winter.</li>
            <li>I thought magnetic nail polish was a good idea, then I applied it.  </li>
            <li>be looking forward to more magnet designs!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>Colors are amazing and now all my co-workers want this amazing nail polish too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, good product, good price, and attentive (if not upfront) seller.</li>
            <li>However the chevron and star patterns don&#x27;t look nearly as nice as in the pictures.</li>
            <li>This is such a great value and you get the magnet with 3 designs and it works great!</li>
            <li>They are really quick to respond which is great.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to manage.</li>
            <li>thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that this chips very easily.  </li>
            <li>It does look really great if you have the patience to get it right.  </li>
            <li>magnets aren&#x27;t great polish is good, but wow do they smell.</li>
            <li>The star pattern looks great at first, but then the nail polish spreads as it dries, causing it to fade.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors and much easier to use the separate magnet rather than the drug store bottles with the magnet in the handle.</li>
            <li>This is the first time i had purchased magnetic polish and this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Sometimes we need to beware if it&#x27;s too good to be true</li>
            <li>Just make sure not to put the magnet too close to the polish or it will lift up onto the magnet.</li>
            <li>The polish color is okay.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish</li>
            <li>Will be buying more China glaze polish.</li>
            <li>So I ordered this online and love, love it.  </li>
            <li>sally hansen works better</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to practice more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that some patterns work better with some colors.  </li>
            <li>Some of the colors work better than others, some of the designs work better than others.</li>
            <li>I do find that this polish stays on better than non metallic polish.</li>
            <li>If you like shiny nails you will have to get a shinny top coat</li>
            <li>and I recommend finding a better seller..</li>
            <li>For the price of the set, even if you just wear these as normal polish and don&#x27;t bother with the magnet, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m keeping the kit because it&#x27;s a pretty good buy, but I won&#x27;t purchase anything else from them.</li>
            <li>Pattens are very cool</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>The nail polish has 6 nice colors; however, the magnet did not work well at all - pretty disapointed.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed getting this set, cool colors as well with a matt finish.</li>
            <li>everything looked fine, there where 3 polishes in the box.</li>
            <li>The diagonal lines show up fine on the nail.</li>
            <li>Light purple</li>
            <li>it is arched slightly to fit a finger.  </li>
            <li>Shipping and delivery was fantastic too.  </li>
            <li>The magnet isn&#x27;t very strong so you certainly need to hold it in place for closer to 45seconds instead of the recommended 5-10.</li>
            <li>I am on my second color of polish and each one has had its own way to stand out!</li>
            <li>Even my 50 plus girls are wearing it and leaving with a smile on their faces !  </li>
            <li>They even leave the original price tag on them</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li>everyone thinks its amazing when they see it and ask were my nails professionally done...</li>
            <li>With the chevron, the point is more of a curve and one side doesn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li>cool design!!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>and they look cool</li>
            <li>This magnetic nail polish is pretty cool and the magnet is fairly easy to use to make the effect.</li>
            <li>when not using the pattens it is very cute just painted on and one coat is enough.</li>
            <li>The magnetized designs are a cool novelty, but the performance of this polish really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>love that it offers 3 patterns on 1 tool.</li>
            <li>Its a fun idea</li>
            <li>Collection 6pcs./ w/magnet, the price was right, and I received it within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>these are meant to be laid right at your cuticle...</li>
            <li>Emailed seller right away.</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Cling on\\&quot; only needs one, but looks better with two.</li>
            <li>Love the 3 options, especially the star.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen magnetic polish was my first introduction to this concept</li>
            <li>Order only if you are sure it&#x27;s what you want</li>
            <li>What a fabulous bargain, and it shipped quickly and was packaged properly.</li>
            <li>It seems to dry kind of fast like the crackle polishes so doing one nail at a time is a must.</li>
            <li>Other magnetic polishes are going for $10-15 a bottle in some places, so for the price, this is an amazing deal.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a new fast easy look for nails.</li>
            <li>, polish then kind of curl your finger to hold slightly over the magnet.  </li>
            <li>Really wish the magnetix was easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I learned really fast how to make these work well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li>It does pull at the polish, and looking at it from the side I&#x27;ve seen it pull up as much as an eighth of an inch with some polishes - making the polish touch</li>
            <li>they seem to work very well</li>
            <li>Its very time consuming.</li>
            <li>Really???</li>
            <li>Although I love the colors, the magnet that came with them is not very strong so the design doesn&#x27;t come out very defined.</li>
            <li>While I am overall satisfied with the product, it was listed as a six piece set when I only received five.</li>
            <li>very pretty and only need maybe 1 coat sometimes</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t understand why they haven&#x27;t updated the listing and the price, they were extremely quick to respond to my inquiry and quick to issue a refund for the missing</li>
            <li>it works really well on acrylic nails as well as natural nails.  </li>
            <li>but i just skip the magnetic part and just use the polish like normal.</li>
            <li>Also, you need to move quickly because the polish dries quickly and the design can only be formed on wet polish.</li>
            <li>I wanted the new one.</li>
            <li>three designs per magnet much better deal than other polished which only offer one.  </li>
            <li>First, a note about the seller and the product: there are only 5 colors.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as shown in the description, with six different colors of</li>
            <li>I am a busy mom, so I do not have to much time left for myself.</li>
            <li>far--</li>
            <li>&quot;, so far 2 of them looks as stripes, absolutelly identical.</li>
            <li>these dry very matte.</li>
            <li>The magnet barely works.</li>
            <li>how much fun it has been to offer my clients something different and a little out there.  </li>
            <li>This polish is drying very fast, if you messed up a little bit: magnet-induced print will \\&quot;cover\\&quot; it.</li>
            <li>So far for me, the star is barely noticeable when the polish is dry.</li>
            <li>Funny thing about this order is that my daughter ordered the same kit,  the identical nail polish was missing out of one of her boxes.</li>
            <li>The only one I&#x27;ve had any problem with is \\&quot;attraction\\&quot;, which is super thick and should only need one coat, but doesn&#x27;t pick up the magnet design well.</li>

            <li> how much fun it has been to offer my clients something different and a little out there.  </li>
            <li> This polish is drying very fast, if you messed up a little bit: magnet-induced print will \\&quot;cover\\&quot; it.</li>
            <li> So far for me, the star is barely noticeable when the polish is dry.</li>
            <li> Funny thing about this order is that my daughter ordered the same kit,  the identical nail polish was missing out of one of her boxes.</li>
            <li> The only one I&#x27;ve had any problem with is \\&quot;attraction\\&quot;, which is super thick and should only need one coat, but doesn&#x27;t pick up the magnet design well.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a thick layer of wet polish then put the magnet over and hover over it going from one side to the other.</li>
            <li> I wish the magnet was a bit stronger, but if you hold it close to the nail (with a thick coat of polish) for 15 seconds it works pretty well (except for the \\&quot;attraction\\&quot; color, as I mentioned).</li>
            <li> Magnetic nail polishes are a little difficult to use at first, but you quickly get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The one color that you would figure should at least be in the set (burgundy)isn&#x27;t even in it making the whole set just a blur of the same color.</li>
            <li> The quicker you get the magnet above the polish, the clearer the design, but if your nails are curved the design tends to only show in the center.</li>
            <li> The trick to the magnet is this: the magnet has these little tabs that stick out near each design magnet--</li>
            <li> I am keeping it, but I expected six bottles of polish, but only recieved five.  </li>
            <li> The purple and mauve polishes tend to have the most subtle effects, with the gold and green being very flashy and having a very distinct showing of pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then went and checked feed back from this company, and read that there were other consumers who purchased the same kit, and had the same polish missing!.</li>
            <li> very sad but glad I still have 5 others to play with.</li>
            <li> I wish some of the colors were a little brighter, but I like them overall.</li>
            <li> If you lay the magnet on your finger using the arch thing and are careful about not tipping it too</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another issue I noticed is that the magnet pulls strongest from the center.  </li>
            <li> You have to apply to one nail then place the magnet on that nail for a few minutes for the pattern to appear, then move on to the next nail &amp; repeat.  </li>
            <li> Their polishes are great but the magnetic polishes are horrible and the magnet is not strong enough to make a pattern in the polish.</li>
            <li> They refunded me $3 and told me the other color was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate ordering from other merchants, just read their reviews and this will help you determine if you will have issues with the item.</li>
            <li> Other merchants should not be punished due to one merchant not shipping their items correctly.</li>
            <li> I can see the design and tell what it is, even if it&#x27;s not super sharp quality.</li>
            <li> Must do only one nail at a time and hold magnet extreemly close which is hard to do w/o smudging.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see ANY design at all, the dark purple I see something</li>
            <li> /&gt;There all dark</li>
            <li> It is definitely not worth the time.  </li>
            <li> If your fingernails have a lot of curve to them, you might find it easier to use the diagonal strip design and paint half of each nail, then paint the other half.  </li>
            <li> The magnet that it comes with is really weak, so the design only shows up in the center of your nail where the polish is closest to the magnet.  </li>
            <li> I wish the magnet was a little stronger but that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I found that it was a little easier by placing magnet on table</li>
            <li> The price fluctuates everyday and you don&#x27;t even get all the items described.</li>
            <li> waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li> The seller, however is a little shady.  </li>
            <li> I was not satisfied it was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I know there are some negative reviews due to &#x27;Lovetec&#x27; not sending out all the colors but that doesn&#x27;t mean all merchants are like this.</li>
            <li> The colors look really dark but the effect is not so dramatic you think you are wearing Gothic colors.  </li>
            <li> These work as well as the Layla Magneffect polishes, but are so much less expensive, and the China Glaze magnet is easier to use.</li>
            <li> It requires a rather thick layer for the magnetic patterns to show up, which makes for a rather inflexible finish.  </li>
            <li> The trick is that you have to get a REALLY thick coat on your nails!  </li>
            <li> Just get a very thick coat then hold the magnet over it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this China glaze product as I ordered the complete set.:</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the item.  </li>
            <li> Saw the description doesn&#x27;t match and realized it was the wrong collection.</li>
            <li> The bottles were broken when I got them my wife was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I just think its crazy that they have not changed this.</li>
            <li> I dropped it and broke the gold :(</li>
            <li> Even with two base coats, this nail polish chips to the point of looking ragged within 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> but it is ugly (not the defined starburst pattern as advertised)!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst China glaze product I have ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the China Glaze 2012-Magnetix Collection 6pcs./ w/magnet, the price was right, and I received it within a couple of days. I happily opened my package a found 2 boxes of nail polish and the magnet enclosed. Upon opening the 1st. box everything looked fine, there where 3 polishes in the box. I opened the second box and found only 2 nail polishes in the box. I wrote to them on Friday morning and have yet to receive an answer, and now I noticed that they&#x27;ve changed there name to Beautyland. Funny thing about this order is that my daughter ordered the same kit,  the identical nail polish was missing out of one of her boxes. I then went and checked feed back from this company, and read that there were other consumers who purchased the same kit, and had the same polish missing!. Sometimes we need to beware if it&#x27;s too good to be true, I&#x27;m keeping the kit because it&#x27;s a pretty good buy, but I won&#x27;t purchase anything else from them.</li>
            <li> Even with two base coats, this nail polish chips to the point of looking ragged within 48 hours.  The magnet that it comes with is really weak, so the design only shows up in the center of your nail where the polish is closest to the magnet.  The magnetized designs are a cool novelty, but the performance of this polish really isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set which came with one of each color and one magnet. The magnet isn&#x27;t very strong so you certainly need to hold it in place for closer to 45seconds instead of the recommended 5-10. Also, you need to move quickly because the polish dries quickly and the design can only be formed on wet polish. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy. I can see the design and tell what it is, even if it&#x27;s not super sharp quality. For the price of the set, even if you just wear these as normal polish and don&#x27;t bother with the magnet, it&#x27;s a great deal. I&#x27;ve seen some people going and buying the Icing brand of this since those magnets are stronger and will work with this polish.</li>
            <li> Really wish the magnetix was easier to use.  Takes a bit to master the magnet.  It does look really great if you have the patience to get it right.  Must do only one nail at a time and hold magnet extreemly close which is hard to do w/o smudging.  I found that it was a little easier by placing magnet on table, polish then kind of curl your finger to hold slightly over the magnet.  This seemed to help prevent from getting too close.</li>
            <li> rather than buy separately, i chose this set which came with all colors and two magnets.  What a fabulous bargain, and it shipped quickly and was packaged properly. This polish is some of the best magnetic type out there.  Good consistency, good coverage, beautiful rich colors and the magnets work perfectly.  three designs per magnet much better deal than other polished which only offer one.  The star shape is the best.</li>
            <li> Great colors!  Great price!  The magnet will make three different designs according to which end you place over your nail.</li>
            <li> The nail polish has 6 nice colors; however, the magnet did not work well at all - pretty disapointed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The china glaze works as advertised.  The seller, however is a little shady.  They are really quick to respond which is great.  However, I only received 5 colors.  They refunded me $3 and told me the other color was discontinued.  They have not changed their listing.  It is still listed as 6 colors.  This should have been updated by now and I just think its crazy that they have not changed this.</li>
            <li> These work as well as the Layla Magneffect polishes, but are so much less expensive, and the China Glaze magnet is easier to use. Magnetic nail polishes are a little difficult to use at first, but you quickly get the hang of it. Just make sure not to put the magnet too close to the polish or it will lift up onto the magnet. I definitely recommend these polishes!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick. Although I love the colors, the magnet that came with them is not very strong so the design doesn&#x27;t come out very defined.</li>
            <li> I have 2 shades. Light purple I can&#x27;t see ANY design at all, the dark purple I see something but it is ugly (not the defined starburst pattern as advertised)! I hope Sally&#x27;s will take them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I applied the polish &amp; immediately held the magnet closely over my nail &amp; waited a good 30 seconds)</li>
            <li> The polish color is okay. Nothing amazing. The magnet barely works. It&#x27;s not strong at all. Very disappointed in this. May attempt to buy another  type of magnet in hope that that one will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to note... I did receive everything in the picture.</li>
            <li> I got this set for Mother&#x27;s Day and I finally tried them today..... I learned really fast how to make these work well.  The trick is that you have to get a REALLY thick coat on your nails!  Just get a very thick coat then hold the magnet over it.  The trick to the magnet is this: the magnet has these little tabs that stick out near each design magnet-- these are meant to be laid right at your cuticle... it is arched slightly to fit a finger.  If you lay the magnet on your finger using the arch thing and are careful about not tipping it too far-- you will get defined, cool-looking patterns in about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish it is really good. Pattens are very cool and I have had alot of people ask me about it.&lt;br /&gt;Even when not using the pattens it is very cute just painted on and one coat is enough. Will be buying more China glaze polish.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! It works just like it claims! I am on my second color of polish and each one has had its own way to stand out! This was also the best deal around!! Couldn&#x27;t find six bottles and a magnet for this cheep anywhere!! I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a new fast easy look for nails.</li>
            <li> Product arrived today and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it! Colors are beautiful and works as described. I wish the magnet was a little stronger but that&#x27;s my only complaint. It seems to dry kind of fast like the crackle polishes so doing one nail at a time is a must. As soon as I opened one of the boxes (it comes as two boxes with 3 polishes each) I dropped it and broke the gold :( very sad but glad I still have 5 others to play with.</li>
            <li> I had seen this locally but they were sold out...So I ordered this online and love, love it.  The colors look really dark but the effect is not so dramatic you think you are wearing Gothic colors.  I can&#x27;t express as a nail tec how much fun it has been to offer my clients something different and a little out there.  Even my 50 plus girls are wearing it and leaving with a smile on their faces !  Shipping and delivery was fantastic too.  Thanks !</li>
            <li> First, a note about the seller and the product: there are only 5 colors. The \\&quot;instant chemistry\\&quot; color has been discontinued. While I can&#x27;t understand why they haven&#x27;t updated the listing and the price, they were extremely quick to respond to my inquiry and quick to issue a refund for the missing polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish: The colors included are great with a good variety. How well the magnet works depends on the polish. The \\&quot;You move me\\&quot; and \\&quot;pull me close\\&quot; are thinner and need two coats. The \\&quot;Cling on\\&quot; only needs one, but looks better with two. The only one I&#x27;ve had any problem with is \\&quot;attraction\\&quot;, which is super thick and should only need one coat, but doesn&#x27;t pick up the magnet design well. I haven&#x27;t tried the purple color yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnet: I like having three designs to choose from, and the cuticle guide is helpful. I wish the magnet was a bit stronger, but if you hold it close to the nail (with a thick coat of polish) for 15 seconds it works pretty well (except for the \\&quot;attraction\\&quot; color, as I mentioned). The only thing I wish for all magnetic polish is for the magnet to be curved to match the curve of your nails...there&#x27;s always a spot on my nail that doesn&#x27;t pick up the design (maybe a stronger magnet would do the trick, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good product, good price, and attentive (if not upfront) seller.</li>
            <li> The price fluctuates everyday and you don&#x27;t even get all the items described. The one color that you would figure should at least be in the set (burgundy)isn&#x27;t even in it making the whole set just a blur of the same color. They even leave the original price tag on them so you see that you got ripped off.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst China glaze product I have ever used. Their polishes are great but the magnetic polishes are horrible and the magnet is not strong enough to make a pattern in the polish. Very disappointed in this China glaze product as I ordered the complete set.:(</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish. It goes on well, it lasts for a while and the colors looks the same on the nail as in the bottle. What I don&#x27;t like it the magnet that comes with it. The diagonal lines show up fine on the nail. However the chevron and star patterns don&#x27;t look nearly as nice as in the pictures. With the chevron, the point is more of a curve and one side doesn&#x27;t show up very well. The star pattern looks great at first, but then the nail polish spreads as it dries, causing it to fade. So far for me, the star is barely noticeable when the polish is dry.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and much easier to use the separate magnet rather than the drug store bottles with the magnet in the handle. Love the 3 options, especially the star.</li>
            <li> Received all 6 china glaze colors as well as the magnet. I am loving this concept!  Sally Hansen magnetic polish was my first introduction to this concept and I have to say I like this system better.&lt;br /&gt;1 coat of polish and immediately hold the magnet over the nail...whallah...cool design!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be looking forward to more magnet designs!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with the item.  I am keeping it, but I expected six bottles of polish, but only recieved five.  I feel I was mislead and I will not be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> this product is a lot of work, it takes a lot of patience and a great deal of practice to apply well. it works really well on acrylic nails as well as natural nails.  everyone thinks its amazing when they see it and ask were my nails professionally done...give yourself a two hour application/drying time window.....</li>
            <li> This magnetic nail polish is pretty cool and the magnet is fairly easy to use to make the effect. I wish some of the colors were a little brighter, but I like them overall.</li>
            <li> This magnet sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see no design with any of the colors.&lt;br /&gt;Huge waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sally hansen works better which is surprising.</li>
            <li> While I am overall satisfied with the product, it was listed as a six piece set when I only received five. I don&#x27;t know if this was an accidental oversight or not.</li>
            <li> Good price. Good quality. I am a busy mom, so I do not have to much time left for myself.This polish is drying very fast, if you messed up a little bit: magnet-induced print will \\&quot;cover\\&quot; it.Very easy to manage. The only concern: it says 3 \\&quot;patterns\\&quot;, so far 2 of them looks as stripes, absolutelly identical. Maybe I need to practice more. Still no complains, Happy to have it.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed getting this set, cool colors as well with a matt finish. Good deal.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Sally Hansen brand at Target for $9 for one bottle. This is such a great value and you get the magnet with 3 designs and it works great! Love them! Colors are amazing and now all my co-workers want this amazing nail polish too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item on Wednesday night from Best Buy Beauty&#x27; and had it by Friday morning. I know there are some negative reviews due to &#x27;Lovetec&#x27; not sending out all the colors but that doesn&#x27;t mean all merchants are like this. Don&#x27;t hesitate ordering from other merchants, just read their reviews and this will help you determine if you will have issues with the item. Other merchants should not be punished due to one merchant not shipping their items correctly.</li>
            <li> magnets aren&#x27;t great polish is good, but wow do they smell. very pretty and only need maybe 1 coat sometimes 2 depending on the 1st swipe.</li>
            <li> Other magnetic polishes are going for $10-15 a bottle in some places, so for the price, this is an amazing deal.  The product was exactly as shown in the description, with six different colors of polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that this chips very easily.  It requires a rather thick layer for the magnetic patterns to show up, which makes for a rather inflexible finish.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that some patterns work better with some colors.  The purple and mauve polishes tend to have the most subtle effects, with the gold and green being very flashy and having a very distinct showing of pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic surface is a bit tricky to learn to use.  It does pull at the polish, and looking at it from the side I&#x27;ve seen it pull up as much as an eighth of an inch with some polishes - making the polish touch the magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I noticed is that the magnet pulls strongest from the center.  If your fingernails have a lot of curve to them, you might find it easier to use the diagonal strip design and paint half of each nail, then paint the other half.  The quicker you get the magnet above the polish, the clearer the design, but if your nails are curved the design tends to only show in the center.</li>
            <li> got this for a friends bday and she loves it. they seem to work very well and they look cool</li>
            <li> The lady I bought these for just loves using them. she says: &amp;#34;China Glaze is a Great brand of nail polish. The Magnetix collection is no exception.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received all 6 colors yesterday and tested them all with all the magnets. I love them! All the colors are great and the magnet worked flawlessly. Make sure you have a thick layer of wet polish then put the magnet over and hover over it going from one side to the other. I bought from Beautyland and received in one week and had all 6 colors well packaged. I&#x27;ve already received lots of compliments on the charcoal color!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful I just wish some of these were brighter colors.&lt;br /&gt;There all dark but I guess there good for winter.</li>
            <li> I thought magnetic nail polish was a good idea, then I applied it.  It is definitely not worth the time.  You have to apply to one nail then place the magnet on that nail for a few minutes for the pattern to appear, then move on to the next nail &amp; repeat.  I wish I would have realized this prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> The bottles were broken when I got them my wife was really disappointed. I was not satisfied it was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> AMAZING DEAL! Colors are beautiful and are great with or without the magnet. 1 coat does it. Magnet can be used with any magnetic polish brand. love that it offers 3 patterns on 1 tool.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors work better than others, some of the designs work better than others. Its very time consuming. Its a fun idea but i just skip the magnetic part and just use the polish like normal. I do find that this polish stays on better than non metallic polish. If you like shiny nails you will have to get a shinny top coat these dry very matte.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i had purchased magnetic polish and this stuff works great. It also comes with a magnet with three different designs. do one nail at a time to get the best results, the colors are nice but wish i could find some lighter shades.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product. Saw the description doesn&#x27;t match and realized it was the wrong collection. I wanted the new one. Emailed seller right away. No response. Emailed twice again the following day to cancel the order - Saturday. No response. Then they shipped the order on Sunday. Really??? THIS ITEM CANNOT BE RETURNED. Order only if you are sure it&#x27;s what you want and I recommend finding a better seller..</li>
