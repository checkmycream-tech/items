            <li> After talking to customer service about another product by this seller, they offered me this one at a discount to try to see if it was a better fit for me. I like how this makes my skin feel &amp; I have noticed improved brightness. I was very pleased with their customer service as well. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks.  It does make my face a bit smoother buy no changes in wrinkles.  I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream!  Does not irritate skin and seems to really moisturize</li>
            <li> Very soft when going on skin. A little hours a long way. My face feels very smooth the next morning. Easily absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer! Helps keep my face moisturized and fresh!!</li>
            <li> Irritated my skin at 1st but then it was ok. It was just ok.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product. It spreads smoothly and has no annoying scent. I look forward to the results which after only a few uses so far, has begun its job of making my skin clearer and younger looking. I will definitely reorder this product!</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I’ve crossed over the 30 mark, having noticed a few more wrinkles and crow’s feet (really?), I figured there is no time like the present to begin taking better care of my skin. I bought this product because frankly, I liked the Totally About Me aspect. After using it for little over a week, I’m starting to see some of those wrinkles disappear and my skin feels softer. Sometimes I even do a double take in the mirror!!! It really works!!!</li>
            <li> Goes on, and is absorbed very easily. Leaves my skin soft, and with no fragrance. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks, so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the long-term benefits. Very glad I was selected to give my unbiased review for this product in exchange for a discount.</li>
            <li> Recently acquired, and so far so good! I have super sensitive skin, and generally have reactions to most things. This did not cause any adverse reactions, and I am noticing smoother skin. I would definitely recommend giving this a go if you are in search of your holy grail facial care!</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin, leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Started using it the second I got it in the mail. I have a few wrinkles under my eyes and they seem to be getting smoother.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great!  I can see the age spots diminish and I have no irritation from using this product.  I will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells soft and sensual. Feels like silk going on. After a week I can start to see a difference already!</li>
            <li> Love this and will defintley purchase again! Very nice bottling and feels very good and soft on skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling very nice.  This is very easy to use.  I keep it on my nightstand so I don&#x27;t forget and it is a nightly ritual now.</li>
