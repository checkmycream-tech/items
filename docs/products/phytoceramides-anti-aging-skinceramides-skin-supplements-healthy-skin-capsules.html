            <li>Even more so with this brand which made me even happier.  </li>
            <li>I have started to notice my skin looks and feels a lot more supple since I&#x27;ve begun to take this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this product</li>

            <li>I think these are a great help for my skin so far.</li>
            <li>Great poduct so far.</li>
            <li>:) I leave this review saying, try them for yourself, I recommend them and as with any supplement - check with your own physician first for consultation and advice and remember, results are varied from person to person.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is Made in the USA and it is also gluten free.</li>
            <li>The capsules are easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>These pills are easy to swallow and have no after taste</li>
            <li>Phytoceramides is the way to go, it is an amazing skin care product and works exactly how it is described.</li>
            <li>I also have some fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This arrived rather quickly!</li>
            <li>A loyal customer from now on!</li>
            <li>The best thing about these pills is they don’t mess with your digestive system.</li>
            <li>but since I started taking these I have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This is also gluten free for those of you that need to watch the gluten.</li>
            <li>They are also gluten free.  </li>
            <li>She says there is no weird taste and the capsules are easy to swallow, she swears by and says as soon as she runs out she will be ordering again!</li>
            <li>I literally have better skin than I have ever had right now</li>
            <li>As I have been looking for a good brand of phytoceramides to continue to take instead of continuing to try a bunch of different brands I am super excited to say that I have found the brand that I am sticking with and will continue to purchase these!  </li>
            <li>but it is worth a shot anyway!</li>
            <li>nice results after 6 weeks, back for more.</li>
            <li>This product is the most amazing facial cream I&#x27;ve tried yet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a 5 bit I won&#x27;t be able to see results this fast from taking these</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use this product and hope to see continued good</li>
            <li>Excited to give this a little more time to see how good it works.</li>
            <li>Very Nice pill that gives ya a behind the scenes feel better, look better combo.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li>My skin, well to be more specific, under and around my eyes have looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sure results would not be instantaneous and will likely require more than one bottle to experience noticeable changes.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and was just as advertised, it was on a friends wishlist</li>
            <li>This impacts many facets of our appearance particularly the skin.</li>
            <li>The results have been very evident and I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li>and I definitely will be because I love the way they make my skin look and feel!  </li>
            <li>The product it works, my face and hold body feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The wife tried it and really like the plant based anti-aging formula that is also gluten free.  </li>
            <li>I love the effects so far for Phytoceramides.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re gluten free and 100% safe and natural, These are now a permanent addition to my supplement regimen, I highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started taking these right away and can notice a difference already.</li>
            <li>As many as previously stated, we rarely eat healthy.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable since their bottle contains a 60 day supply for $19.55 good value, You do have to be patient though and give it at least 30 days of regular use,  great supplement that seems to reproduce the lost cells that were</li>
            <li>Even the few fine lines around my lips are now gone for good thanks to this.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, no problems with seller at all.</li>
            <li>The cream is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, but gets rid of wrinkles within weeks.</li>
            <li>Well, telling others about the benefits of this is the first step.</li>
            <li>The lost radiance is now restored to my skin thanks to Ad-vent!</li>
            <li>I will def buy more for her in future.</li>
            <li>You have to give it some time to work, since this is more like a supplement rather than a topical type treatment.</li>
            <li>Anything having to do with skin health is at the top of my wish list this year and a recent name to catch my eye is Phytoceramides.</li>
            <li>asked what I&#x27;m doing to have such a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I have tried topical stuff before, mostly creams</li>
            <li>but I didn’t exactly feel or see any change.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying out anti-aging supplements</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone that wants to have healthier looking skin!</li>
            <li>(even from the first time I&#x27;ve taken it), is that it doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach or give me any stomach pain.  </li>
            <li>I will gladly change my ratings if I see changes in the future.</li>
            <li>so I will need to purchase more in the next week</li>
            <li>No issues with the item so far, no weird taste and the pills are an average size so that is nice too!</li>
            <li>This really worked, especially for the price, I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>Wow, I love these pills, I was in a wow</li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure that it is because of these supplements as I have not changed any other aspect of my diet or skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in the smoothness of my skin since starting this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Phytoceramides for six months, and I see a real difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Just like the bottle promises, this really helps with the lines.</li>
            <li>If you take a picture of your face in the same light once a week, every week, you will see it.</li>
            <li>then you will appreciate the results as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I really can not tell to much difference yet.  </li>
            <li>Yet another discovery thanks to perusing Amazon which led to doing some research and then ordering a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these have helped my eczema so much.</li>
            <li>Just by feeling it you can tell its much softer and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>Item came packaged well, and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I am always excited when I get the chance to try different supplements as a reviewer especially when I get to try different brands of phytoceramides because we all know that some brands are just better than others!  </li>
            <li>looks much tighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge believer of beauty in a bottle, but I can&#x27;t deny what I am seeing with my own two eyes.</li>
            <li>I saw some great reviews and was anxious to try this, specially concerning the disppearance of dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Great supplement for softening facial lines and wrinkles, makes skin look great, and the price isnt bad!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer, and the lines by my eyes are less prominent.  </li>
            <li>The capsule is easy to take with a glass of water and has no real taste that I could tell.</li>
            <li>I have given this a decent try; I bought two bottles</li>
            <li>My skin was firmer and became smoother which was my main concern.</li>
            <li>how quickly I saw a difference in my skin after starting this supplement!  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product through some friends who take Phytoceramides and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>His product (for sale at a premium) has the same amount of phytoceramide, which is the active ingredient that is suppose to boost collagen production in your own</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will do a little more after a few more weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised at how fast it started working.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how fast it started working.</li>
            <li>I have been taking it for a few weeks now and swear my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try a new brand and wish that I hadn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li>So I told her to try something new.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are not a 20 year old&#x27;s hands, but no wrinkles, or veins popping out!</li>
            <li>The fresh and radiant look of natural skin without any cosmetics is something that I have missed in a long time.</li>
            <li>particular Phytoceramides supplements are a powder that come in small easy to swallow gel capsules.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and ordered my Yalmeh phytoceramides, despite having more than a half a bottle left of these.  </li>
            <li>She said it helps clear up some of her achnie.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my skin so much softer and I feel so much younger using this.</li>
            <li>No form of acid re-flux and no harsh effects or allergies on the skin.</li>
            <li>and so far have not suffered from any adverse side effects or repeating.</li>
            <li>It really does decrease appearance of wrinkles and makes your face glow like you were younger</li>
            <li>Natural is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am in complete surprise at how well and</li>
            <li>At first these made me break out but after a week and a half i noticed my skin felt smoother and more firm..</li>
            <li>The fine lines only bother me slightly, but I was really hoping that this product might help with the dry skin that comes with my rosacea and eczema.</li>
            <li>I have a lot less flaking and drying which means less fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li>Phytoceramides&#x27; were indicated for and a major reason why I wanted to try taking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really easy to incorporate into my usual daily vitamin regimen.</li>
            <li>So after a couple of weeks of this so far, I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference already.</li>
            <li>It has fixed my damaged skin over the years in just a short time.  </li>
            <li>I am not a heavy sufferer of acne but the slight redness that had been appearing recently on my skin is now gone thanks to Phytoceramides!</li>
            <li>Ive been taking these phytoceramides by Ad-vent for roughly 3 weeks now and the one huge thing I have noticed is that my Tzone is WAY less oily.</li>
            <li>Skin is the largest organ of the body and the tiny amount of dry powdered Phytoceramides needs to circulate and nourish the whole thing</li>
            <li>I am still on my first bottle, but I do see a slight improvement in the dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li>It would do me no good if it was so huge</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and with other products, I really can&#x27;t do that sometimes because it irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a few weeks to really notice a difference - and I am about to go into month 3 - and my hands are showing the results!</li>
            <li>I have invested so much money on creams, and serums, and topical products, only to be let down when I didn&#x27;t get the outcome I hoped for.</li>

            <li> I have started to notice my skin looks and feels a lot more supple since I&#x27;ve begun to take this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product</li>

            <li> Great poduct so far.</li>
            <li> :) I leave this review saying, try them for yourself, I recommend them and as with any supplement - check with your own physician first for consultation and advice and remember, results are varied from person to person.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is Made in the USA and it is also gluten free.</li>
            <li> The capsules are easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> These pills are easy to swallow and have no after taste</li>
            <li> Phytoceramides is the way to go, it is an amazing skin care product and works exactly how it is described.</li>
            <li> I also have some fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This arrived rather quickly!</li>
            <li> A loyal customer from now on!</li>
            <li> The best thing about these pills is they don’t mess with your digestive system.</li>
            <li> but since I started taking these I have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This is also gluten free for those of you that need to watch the gluten.</li>
            <li> They are also gluten free.  </li>
            <li> She says there is no weird taste and the capsules are easy to swallow, she swears by and says as soon as she runs out she will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I literally have better skin than I have ever had right now</li>
            <li> As I have been looking for a good brand of phytoceramides to continue to take instead of continuing to try a bunch of different brands I am super excited to say that I have found the brand that I am sticking with and will continue to purchase these!  </li>
            <li> but it is worth a shot anyway!</li>
            <li> nice results after 6 weeks, back for more.</li>
            <li> This product is the most amazing facial cream I&#x27;ve tried yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 5 bit I won&#x27;t be able to see results this fast from taking these</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this product and hope to see continued good</li>
            <li> Excited to give this a little more time to see how good it works.</li>
            <li> Very Nice pill that gives ya a behind the scenes feel better, look better combo.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li> My skin, well to be more specific, under and around my eyes have looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sure results would not be instantaneous and will likely require more than one bottle to experience noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and was just as advertised, it was on a friends wishlist</li>
            <li> This impacts many facets of our appearance particularly the skin.</li>
            <li> The results have been very evident and I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> and I definitely will be because I love the way they make my skin look and feel!  </li>
            <li> The product it works, my face and hold body feel very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The wife tried it and really like the plant based anti-aging formula that is also gluten free.  </li>
            <li> I love the effects so far for Phytoceramides.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re gluten free and 100% safe and natural, These are now a permanent addition to my supplement regimen, I highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started taking these right away and can notice a difference already.</li>
            <li> As many as previously stated, we rarely eat healthy.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable since their bottle contains a 60 day supply for $19.55 good value, You do have to be patient though and give it at least 30 days of regular use,  great supplement that seems to reproduce the lost cells that were</li>
            <li> Even the few fine lines around my lips are now gone for good thanks to this.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, no problems with seller at all.</li>
            <li> The cream is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, but gets rid of wrinkles within weeks.</li>
            <li> Well, telling others about the benefits of this is the first step.</li>
            <li> The lost radiance is now restored to my skin thanks to Ad-vent!</li>
            <li> I will def buy more for her in future.</li>
            <li> You have to give it some time to work, since this is more like a supplement rather than a topical type treatment.</li>
            <li> Anything having to do with skin health is at the top of my wish list this year and a recent name to catch my eye is Phytoceramides.</li>
            <li> asked what I&#x27;m doing to have such a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I have tried topical stuff before, mostly creams</li>
            <li> but I didn’t exactly feel or see any change.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying out anti-aging supplements</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone that wants to have healthier looking skin!</li>
            <li> (even from the first time I&#x27;ve taken it), is that it doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach or give me any stomach pain.  </li>
            <li> I will gladly change my ratings if I see changes in the future.</li>
            <li> so I will need to purchase more in the next week</li>
            <li> No issues with the item so far, no weird taste and the pills are an average size so that is nice too!</li>
            <li> This really worked, especially for the price, I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Wow, I love these pills, I was in a wow</li>
            <li> and I am pretty sure that it is because of these supplements as I have not changed any other aspect of my diet or skin care regimen.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the smoothness of my skin since starting this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Phytoceramides for six months, and I see a real difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Just like the bottle promises, this really helps with the lines.</li>
            <li> If you take a picture of your face in the same light once a week, every week, you will see it.</li>
            <li> then you will appreciate the results as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I really can not tell to much difference yet.  </li>
            <li> Yet another discovery thanks to perusing Amazon which led to doing some research and then ordering a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these have helped my eczema so much.</li>
            <li> Just by feeling it you can tell its much softer and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> Item came packaged well, and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I am always excited when I get the chance to try different supplements as a reviewer especially when I get to try different brands of phytoceramides because we all know that some brands are just better than others!  </li>
            <li> looks much tighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge believer of beauty in a bottle, but I can&#x27;t deny what I am seeing with my own two eyes.</li>
            <li> I saw some great reviews and was anxious to try this, specially concerning the disppearance of dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great supplement for softening facial lines and wrinkles, makes skin look great, and the price isnt bad!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer, and the lines by my eyes are less prominent.  </li>
            <li> The capsule is easy to take with a glass of water and has no real taste that I could tell.</li>
            <li> I have given this a decent try; I bought two bottles</li>
            <li> My skin was firmer and became smoother which was my main concern.</li>
            <li> how quickly I saw a difference in my skin after starting this supplement!  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through some friends who take Phytoceramides and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> His product (for sale at a premium) has the same amount of phytoceramide, which is the active ingredient that is suppose to boost collagen production in your own</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will do a little more after a few more weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at how fast it started working.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how fast it started working.</li>
            <li> I have been taking it for a few weeks now and swear my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try a new brand and wish that I hadn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> So I told her to try something new.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are not a 20 year old&#x27;s hands, but no wrinkles, or veins popping out!</li>
            <li> The fresh and radiant look of natural skin without any cosmetics is something that I have missed in a long time.</li>
            <li> particular Phytoceramides supplements are a powder that come in small easy to swallow gel capsules.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and ordered my Yalmeh phytoceramides, despite having more than a half a bottle left of these.  </li>
            <li> She said it helps clear up some of her achnie.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin so much softer and I feel so much younger using this.</li>
            <li> No form of acid re-flux and no harsh effects or allergies on the skin.</li>
            <li> and so far have not suffered from any adverse side effects or repeating.</li>
            <li> It really does decrease appearance of wrinkles and makes your face glow like you were younger</li>
            <li> Natural is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am in complete surprise at how well and</li>
            <li> At first these made me break out but after a week and a half i noticed my skin felt smoother and more firm..</li>
            <li> The fine lines only bother me slightly, but I was really hoping that this product might help with the dry skin that comes with my rosacea and eczema.</li>
            <li> I have a lot less flaking and drying which means less fine lines and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Phytoceramides&#x27; were indicated for and a major reason why I wanted to try taking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really easy to incorporate into my usual daily vitamin regimen.</li>
            <li> So after a couple of weeks of this so far, I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference already.</li>
            <li> It has fixed my damaged skin over the years in just a short time.  </li>
            <li> I am not a heavy sufferer of acne but the slight redness that had been appearing recently on my skin is now gone thanks to Phytoceramides!</li>
            <li> Ive been taking these phytoceramides by Ad-vent for roughly 3 weeks now and the one huge thing I have noticed is that my Tzone is WAY less oily.</li>
            <li> Skin is the largest organ of the body and the tiny amount of dry powdered Phytoceramides needs to circulate and nourish the whole thing</li>
            <li> I am still on my first bottle, but I do see a slight improvement in the dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li> It would do me no good if it was so huge</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and with other products, I really can&#x27;t do that sometimes because it irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a few weeks to really notice a difference - and I am about to go into month 3 - and my hands are showing the results!</li>
            <li> I have invested so much money on creams, and serums, and topical products, only to be let down when I didn&#x27;t get the outcome I hoped for.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to tell yet.</li>
            <li> They are in a clear capsule that you can see the white powder through which I like that they are not tablets so they will break down easier in my digestive system and get to work quicker!  </li>
            <li> She told me that it does not have any weird after taste and the capsule can be easily swallowed.</li>
            <li> My skin had been getting pretty rough lately and my age was starting to catch up to me</li>
            <li> My friend who tried it first (we challenged each other,) said she couldn&#x27;t notice the change right off, but it is a subtle and slow change.</li>
            <li> It has not really made a difference in the eczema on my hands, but the dry skin on my cheeks is definitely better despite being exposed to cold, dry, wintery air on a regular basis and a recent flare up of my rosacea.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an easy way to slow down the aging process, this is it!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anybody who doesn&#x27;t want wrinkles, or even to people who just dont want dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used to have a problem with my skin being dry</li>
            <li> The inclusion of vitamin A leaves me slightly conflicted about this product as that&#x27;s not something I feel I need to supplement in my diet as it&#x27;s already coming in other sources such as topical retinol&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT I was looking at my face today and it did seem to be a lot less red.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, damaged skin I decided to get these Phytoceramides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry, damaged skin</li>
            <li> and my skin seems brighter and a little firmer, I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments and friends and co-workers</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone looking for a little extra boost and rejuvenation to their skin.</li>
            <li> I got this product and gave it to my mom, she started taking it and only after a few days, noticed a difference in her skin.</li>
            <li> Plus I have taken it on an empty stomach before and no problems.  </li>
            <li> My dry skin on my t-zones are less dry and a friend complimented me the other day saying that they noticed a glow about me.</li>
            <li> This winter has been particularly cold and my skin is really feeling it, I hydrate and moisturize but still nothing has provided long lasting relief and results</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what other benefits this product has to offer.</li>
            <li> There is no funny taste or after taste</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this contains NO Additives, Artificial Ingredients, Binders, Fillers, and Preservatives!</li>
            <li> Obviously I still have my wrinkles but with the brightness of my skin from this product, I feel as though they&#x27;re hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that wrinkles seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> whatever you want to call them do seem less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> Her skin has tightened and she has much less noticeable wrinkles and the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking it for a little while now</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Received this product a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> I also had a few wrinkles and have noticed they have shrunk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from an oily Tzone for as long as I can remember, and it&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a dramatic difference with facial lines as of yet, but I will continue to take it and see what my end results are.</li>
            <li> This has given my skin the extra moisture that it needs, as we head into the dry, cold season.</li>
            <li> Will update once I finish the round!</li>
            <li> In addition to the 350 mg&#x27;s of Phytoceramides which are derived from wheat there is also 5000 IU&#x27;s of vitamin A and 400 IU&#x27;s of vitamin D along with small amounts of vitamins C and E.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this product.</li>
            <li> If you hate lines as much as me (I shouldnt be getting lines at my age!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been asked if I got Botox, (which I&#x27;m afraid of), and I told them about Phytoceramides.</li>
            <li> No more worry lines around my eyes or on my forehead!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aging mother who is beginning to develop serious wrinkles even at age 48, and it works miracles.</li>
            <li> have very dry skin and terrible eating habits, and phytoceramides make a noticeable difference, especially during the winter, when the cold outside and the heat inside are vying to see which can make my skin crispier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50s - and even if I may look younger in my face and neck (genetic) - age will always rear its ugly face whilst looking at one&#x27;s hands...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any ill side effects to this supplement, which is great&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say a bad word about this product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product can see and feel the difference in the skin and its moisture. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Arrived shortly after ordering. I like this because it shrinks my pores while evening out my skin tone. No wrinkles either!</li>
            <li> I have given this a decent try; I bought two bottles so I used it for two months. I won&#x27;t be buying another as I didn&#x27;t notice that this did anything to help. I&#x27;m over 40 so I&#x27;m not some young thing with great skin without lines or wrinkles. I can&#x27;t afford to spend money on something that isn&#x27;t providing any noticeable help. I had no adverse problems so it doesn&#x27;t seem like it will hurt you if you want to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Great supplement for softening facial lines and wrinkles, makes skin look great, and the price isnt bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Phytoceramides for six months, and I see a real difference in my skin.  It&#x27;s softer, and the lines by my eyes are less prominent.  These are effective, and a great price.</li>
            <li> Product worked great to help reduce the fine lines around my lips. Started working within a week of taking them. I was very pleased with this product. Firmer and softer skin is every woman&#x27;s wish and this product helps you achieve it. I will recommend this product to my friend and family and will purchase product as needed. Thanks for a wonderful product Ad-Vent</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love.. a must have! This is also gluten free for those of you that need to watch the gluten. I definitely have a moisturized face, skin and even my hands feel smoother. I can&#x27;t wait to see what other benefits this product has to offer. I was told I look great.. what have I been doing? Well, telling others about the benefits of this is the first step. Thank You!</li>
            <li> This is one great item that I am glad to have. This pills is a miracle thing and I love it for what all it does for me. It helps keep my skin so much softer and I feel so much younger using this. It takes the wrinkles from under my eyes and also the circles that I had under my eyes away. I have had people say that I look 5 to 7 years younger using these and that makes me feel great. Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NOTICED SOME IMPROVEMENTS</li>
            <li> I like that the capsules are smaller and are veggie.  I am 45 so I am happy to try these for my aging skin.  They are also gluten free.  I think these are a great help for my skin so far.</li>
            <li> The lost radiance is now restored to my skin thanks to Ad-vent! The fresh and radiant look of natural skin without any cosmetics is something that I have missed in a long time. Look good and you feel good!</li>
            <li> I started taking these right away and can notice a difference already. My dry skin on my t-zones are less dry and a friend complimented me the other day saying that they noticed a glow about me. There is no funny taste or after taste so that is a plus. I would definitely recommend these for softer skin.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this vitamins for a short while and I can already feel my skin is softer and more radiant. I look forward to seeing how continued use will effect my skin. Great poduct so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed after taking this pill for around 18 days that my complexion was turning a gray, pasty color. That was enough for me to quit taking this pill. I would not recommend this pill to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product - I like this fountain of youth in a capsule.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a few weeks to really notice a difference - and I am about to go into month 3 - and my hands are showing the results! I am in my 50s - and even if I may look younger in my face and neck (genetic) - age will always rear its ugly face whilst looking at one&#x27;s hands... Yes, they are not a 20 year old&#x27;s hands, but no wrinkles, or veins popping out! only 2 age spots! ha! :)))&lt;br /&gt;I am sticking with it - and keep hydrating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 46now and starting to show signs of aging! Eeeeek! So, I figured, instead of just trying a ton of topical stuff, why not go from the inside-out as well? I LOVE that this contains NO Additives, Artificial Ingredients, Binders, Fillers, and Preservatives! So after a couple of weeks of this so far, I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference already. :) I leave this review saying, try them for yourself, I recommend them and as with any supplement - check with your own physician first for consultation and advice and remember, results are varied from person to person.</li>
            <li> As a 50 year old, it feels good that people think I look 38! I like this product.. This is my third time ordering.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the smoothness of my skin since starting this. My face feels so much more hydrated, the fine lines have softened around my eyes and my skin now has a healthy glow. It is really easy to incorporate into my usual daily vitamin regimen. The capsules are easy to swallow. I love the fact that this is Made in the USA and it is also gluten free. If you are looking for an easy way to slow down the aging process, this is it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these capsules for a couple of weeks now. My skin, well to be more specific, under and around my eyes have looked so healthy. My skin looks brighter and I am noticing the smaller lines on my forehead are disappearing around the edges. Obviously I still have my wrinkles but with the brightness of my skin from this product, I feel as though they&#x27;re hardly noticeable. These pills are easy to swallow and have no after taste so they work great for me. I plan to continue use of this product and hope to see even more results.</li>
            <li> At first these made me break out but after a week and a half i noticed my skin felt smoother and more firm.. i will definitely continue to use these</li>
            <li> Been taking these for a couple weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, but I know it said they need to be taken for 60 days to start seeing results. Hopefully I do! Very fast shipping, no problems with seller at all. Will update once I finish the round!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try a new brand and wish that I hadn&#x27;t.. They don&#x27;t work for me at all.  My nails are brittle and breaking, and my skin is going back to the way it was before starting a phytoceramide regime a year ago.  I went ahead and ordered my Yalmeh phytoceramides, despite having more than a half a bottle left of these.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product, i bought this for my partner. She told me that it does not have any weird after taste and the capsule can be easily swallowed. The item came before the time posted which was great. I will def buy more for her in future. She also recommended her friends to add this on their wishlist for future presents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already noticed a big difference since using this! I think it like, hydrates your skin from the inside out. I have a lot less flaking and drying which means less fine lines and wrinkles! This really worked, especially for the price, I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Just like the bottle promises, this really helps with the lines. You have to give it some time to work, since this is more like a supplement rather than a topical type treatment. My friend who tried it first (we challenged each other,) said she couldn&#x27;t notice the change right off, but it is a subtle and slow change. If you take a picture of your face in the same light once a week, every week, you will see it. If you hate lines as much as me (I shouldnt be getting lines at my age! AHHH) then you will appreciate the results as much as I do. I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> The best thing about these pills is they don’t mess with your digestive system. No form of acid re-flux and no harsh effects or allergies on the skin. Definitely recommended for those with troublesome skin!</li>
            <li> I really can not tell to much difference yet.  Hopefully it will do a little more after a few more weeks</li>
            <li> My skin had been getting pretty rough lately and my age was starting to catch up to me but since I started taking these I have noticed a huge difference. Within a few days my skin started to get softer and it looks much healthier, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable since their bottle contains a 60 day supply for $19.55 good value, You do have to be patient though and give it at least 30 days of regular use,  great supplement that seems to reproduce the lost cells that were</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend use it alot. She said it helps clear up some of her achnie.</li>
            <li> It made my skin have a brighter appearance</li>
            <li> Anything having to do with skin health is at the top of my wish list this year and a recent name to catch my eye is Phytoceramides. Yet another discovery thanks to perusing Amazon which led to doing some research and then ordering a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These particular Phytoceramides supplements are a powder that come in small easy to swallow gel capsules. In addition to the 350 mg&#x27;s of Phytoceramides which are derived from wheat there is also 5000 IU&#x27;s of vitamin A and 400 IU&#x27;s of vitamin D along with small amounts of vitamins C and E. The inclusion of vitamin A leaves me slightly conflicted about this product as that&#x27;s not something I feel I need to supplement in my diet as it&#x27;s already coming in other sources such as topical retinol&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking it for a little while now and so far have not suffered from any adverse side effects or repeating. As for any change in my skin I&#x27;m quite sure results would not be instantaneous and will likely require more than one bottle to experience noticeable changes. Skin is the largest organ of the body and the tiny amount of dry powdered Phytoceramides needs to circulate and nourish the whole thing BUT I was looking at my face today and it did seem to be a lot less red. This was something Phytoceramides&#x27; were indicated for and a major reason why I wanted to try taking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll come back after a month when this bottle is fully finished and leave an update. Ad-vent Products provided a discount code to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li> Excited to give this a little more time to see how good it works.</li>
            <li> Quality moisture retention</li>
            <li> I recently added this to my vitamin/supplement regimen and I am already seeing results.  I&#x27;ve been using for close to 2 weeks now and my skin seems brighter and a little firmer, I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments and friends and co-workers asked what I&#x27;m doing to have such a healthy glow.  This winter has been particularly cold and my skin is really feeling it, I hydrate and moisturize but still nothing has provided long lasting relief and results, that is until I started taking these Phytoceramides.  They&#x27;re gluten free and 100% safe and natural, These are now a permanent addition to my supplement regimen, I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I was not compensated for my review and the opinions are 100% my own. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising. *</li>
            <li> I have tried topical stuff before, mostly creams but I didn’t exactly feel or see any change. This is my first time trying out anti-aging supplements and I love them! These gluten free supplements are amazing and I already see a change in my skin after a month!</li>
            <li> Love these and yes, people, (including my own sister), have asked me what I&#x27;m doing to my face. I&#x27;ve actually been asked if I got Botox, (which I&#x27;m afraid of), and I told them about Phytoceramides. They do not upset my stomach and I just take one every night. GREAT and YES, they work!</li>
            <li> Great product...nice results after 6 weeks, back for more.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful supplement containing Vitamins A,C,D &amp; E which are vital in helping to replace lost ceramides in your skin. I take this supplement in addition to a facial regimen and my skin feels younger or softer than it did 10 years ago. What&#x27;s nice about this supplement is that you take it once a day and it works to help keep your skin radiant from the inside out.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and was just as advertised, it was on a friends wishlist and she is really enjoying it. She says there is no weird taste and the capsules are easy to swallow, she swears by and says as soon as she runs out she will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aging mother who is beginning to develop serious wrinkles even at age 48, and it works miracles. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve ever seen her more stress free because she doesn&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles anymore! The cream is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, but gets rid of wrinkles within weeks. I&#x27;ve also noticed that her skin is a lot smoother than before. I would recommend this to anybody who doesn&#x27;t want wrinkles, or even to people who just dont want dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the product for about two weeks and I have noticed that wrinkles seem less noticeable. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after I finish the product.</li>
            <li> Very Nice pill that gives ya a behind the scenes feel better, look better combo.  The wife tried it and really like the plant based anti-aging formula that is also gluten free.  We have been very happy with our purchase and she is glad we tried this phytoceramides vitamin pill on her behalf!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, damaged skin I decided to get these Phytoceramides.&lt;br /&gt; I have been taking for a couple of days now, my skin seemed healthier even glowing.This has given my skin the extra moisture that it needs, as we head into the dry, cold season. I haven&#x27;t had any ill side effects to this supplement, which is great&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m really surprised at how fast it started working.  I&#x27;m am very pleased with my purchase will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Received this product a few days ago.  I don&#x27;t know if it is my imagination but my face looks firmer and smoother!  Will continue to use this and see if my mom has good results as well.</li>
            <li> I love this supplement because didn&#x27;t give me side effect. The product it works, my face and hold body feel very smooth and soft. Take a picture before you take it and wait about 1 week later then take a picture again and you will see a big different. I will order more when it on sale.</li>
            <li> I got this product and gave it to my mom, she started taking it and only after a few days, noticed a difference in her skin. She&#x27;s always had issues with her skin (the way it looks, feels, etc). So I told her to try something new. And she has fallen in love with this product. I would recommend this to everyone that wants to have healthier looking skin!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and with other products, I really can&#x27;t do that sometimes because it irritates my skin.  But with this skin care product, I never have that problem and the results for my skin are just amazing.  It has fixed my damaged skin over the years in just a short time.  Definitely works.</li>
            <li> As many as previously stated, we rarely eat healthy.  This impacts many facets of our appearance particularly the skin. After my wife saw a show that discussed phytoceramides, I went on a search to find this supplement which lead me to this product.  The results have been very evident and I would recommend this product without hesitation. Just follow the directions/dosage and be patient. The results my wife got have been amazing and she (and I) are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Phytoceramides is the way to go, it is an amazing skin care product and works exactly how it is described. It made a world of difference on my skin, I could feel the difference within days of using it . My skin was firmer and became smoother which was my main concern. I would recommend this to anyone who wants softer smoother skin, it is great and worked amazingly for me!</li>
            <li> Because I have not taken care of my skin when I was younger I am paying for it.  I am always looking for ways to improve my skin from the inside out. I have to say after taking these I am seeing a difference for the better!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, damaged skin and my mom recommended I get a supplement. I decided to get these Phytoceramides.&lt;br /&gt; I have been taking for a week now. Within a couple of days my skin seemed healthier even glowing. I was really surprised at how fast it started working. I also had a few wrinkles and have noticed they have shrunk. I&#x27;m am very pleased with my purchase will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say a bad word about this product. Works great.</li>
            <li> these have helped my eczema so much. i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a little over two weeks and my skin feels great. There is definitely a noticeable difference in the firmness of my skin and it has also helped with my eczema. My skins blemishes appear to have faded.&lt;br /&gt;I am most pleased with the fact that it is gluten free, odorless and especially easy to swallow.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> have used phytoceramides love them</li>
            <li> This product is the most amazing facial cream I&#x27;ve tried yet! It really does decrease appearance of wrinkles and makes your face glow like you were younger</li>
            <li> This stuff works great I have been taking it for a few weeks now and swear my skin feels so much better. Just by feeling it you can tell its much softer and looks healthier. I will continue taking this to get the maximum effects. This is great for those worrying about aging and wanting healthier skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in exchange of my honest unbiased review. All reviews are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> I got a discount coupon for this product from this seller just in time to replace the brand I&#x27;d been using before it ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that this offers very good efficacy in a reasonably-sized capsule so that its wonderfully balanced blend of ceramides &amp; vitamins can continue to improve my skin&#x27;s ability to hold and use moisture. It would do me no good if it was so huge I couldn&#x27;t swallow it, or if I had to take 9 a day to make it work. I feel like this is a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin and terrible eating habits, and phytoceramides make a noticeable difference, especially during the winter, when the cold outside and the heat inside are vying to see which can make my skin crispier.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that I try to never run out of.</li>
            <li> I read about phytoceramides from the Dr. Oz show. His product (for sale at a premium) has the same amount of phytoceramide, which is the active ingredient that is suppose to boost collagen production in your own skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got it on Saturday, and can&#x27;t wait to see results!!! Item came packaged well, and shipped fast. No issues with the item so far, no weird taste and the pills are an average size so that is nice too!</li>
            <li> This arrived rather quickly! I have been taking these since they have arrived and I can feel the difference in my skin. Extremely satisfied will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I love the effects so far for Phytoceramides.  What I&#x27;ve noticed immediately is that as I started taking this about a week ago (even from the first time I&#x27;ve taken it), is that it doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach or give me any stomach pain.  Plus I have taken it on an empty stomach before and no problems.  What I also noticed with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t contain wheat.  I have been staying away from gluten because of side effects I get (headaches, stomach pain, and bowel issues).  I just over all feel good since I&#x27;ve been taking it.  It&#x27;s hard to explain, but I like it.  I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough.  I am sooo pleased.</li>
            <li> Natural is just what I wanted. After trying this out for a couple of weeks, I felt that my skin was moisturized. I used to have a problem with my skin being dry and so this product helped me out. Makes me feel good knowing that I&#x27;m improving my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 5 bit I won&#x27;t be able to see results this fast from taking these but it is worth a shot anyway!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the 18th of Feb and have been taking this since I received it. I have not noticed a dramatic difference with facial lines as of yet, but I will continue to take it and see what my end results are. I will gladly change my ratings if I see changes in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading and hearing a lot of great things about phytoceramides, and I couldn&#x27;t deny the fact that I wanted to know if the things I heard were indeed true. Amazingly I was offered a chance to try some for myself at a discounted price. This is my honest experience, and unbiased opinion. Ive been taking these phytoceramides by Ad-vent for roughly 3 weeks now and the one huge thing I have noticed is that my Tzone is WAY less oily. I&#x27;ve suffered from an oily Tzone for as long as I can remember, and it&#x27;s pretty annoying. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin just seems to appear more healthy and bright. I&#x27;m not a huge believer of beauty in a bottle, but I can&#x27;t deny what I am seeing with my own two eyes. I have invested so much money on creams, and serums, and topical products, only to be let down when I didn&#x27;t get the outcome I hoped for. I never thought that my skin could look like this at age 35. I will be keeping phytoceramides as part of my beauty regimen from now on. I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> These skin pills are the best love it makes my skin soft and smooth I&#x27;m only 32 I have good genes anyway so I&#x27;m happy with the results</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars only because I don&#x27;t know yet. I saw some great reviews and was anxious to try this, specially concerning the disppearance of dark circles under my eyes. BUT, the research says it takes 4-8 weeks before you see a difference and it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to tell yet.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through some friends who take Phytoceramides and highly recommend it. I was a little skeptical, but I wanted to give it a try. I suffer from rosacea and eczema. I also have some fine lines around my eyes. The fine lines only bother me slightly, but I was really hoping that this product might help with the dry skin that comes with my rosacea and eczema. I am still on my first bottle, but I do see a slight improvement in the dryness of my skin. My beauty regimen has remained the same with the exception of adding this product. It has not really made a difference in the eczema on my hands, but the dry skin on my cheeks is definitely better despite being exposed to cold, dry, wintery air on a regular basis and a recent flare up of my rosacea. I&#x27;m very happy because it&#x27;s something that I struggle with especially at this time of year. I will definitely continue to use this product and hope to see continued good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are my own and they reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I am always excited when I get the chance to try different supplements as a reviewer especially when I get to try different brands of phytoceramides because we all know that some brands are just better than others!  So I was elated when I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I am in complete surprise at how well and how quickly I saw a difference in my skin after starting this supplement!  Not only did my skin look brighter and healthier but I also noticed that those bothersome pimples that I have never had to deal with before children but have now had also cleared up!  My skin feels nice and smooth.  It is moisturized and the lines-wrinkles(cringe) whatever you want to call them do seem less pronounced.  Even more so with this brand which made me even happier.  As I have been looking for a good brand of phytoceramides to continue to take instead of continuing to try a bunch of different brands I am super excited to say that I have found the brand that I am sticking with and will continue to purchase these!  I am almost out of my bottle so I will need to purchase more in the next week and I definitely will be because I love the way they make my skin look and feel!  I literally have better skin than I have ever had right now and I am pretty sure that it is because of these supplements as I have not changed any other aspect of my diet or skin care regimen.  They are in a clear capsule that you can see the white powder through which I like that they are not tablets so they will break down easier in my digestive system and get to work quicker!  I have noticed no bothersome side effects, actually I have noticed no side effects at all!  The capsule is easy to take with a glass of water and has no real taste that I could tell.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this product. Just took one bottle and didn&#x27;t see or feel anything. Will probably not buy again.</li>
            <li> These veggie, gluten-free capsules detoxifies your skin beautifully, giving it a taut appearance to the skin! No more worry lines around my eyes or on my forehead! A loyal customer from now on!</li>
            <li> I am not a heavy sufferer of acne but the slight redness that had been appearing recently on my skin is now gone thanks to Phytoceramides! The natural ingredients have worked their charm on my skin just perfectly. Also my skin is not so oily anymore. Thank you Ad-Vent!</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She&#x27;s been using it on her forehead for quite some time now. Her skin has tightened and she has much less noticeable wrinkles and the skin looks much tighter. She feels very satisfied with it and plans to continue using it as time goes on.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended phytoceramides.  Ad-vent products got great reviews so I ordered it.  I have started to notice my skin looks and feels a lot more supple since I&#x27;ve begun to take this product. I recommend this product for anyone looking for a little extra boost and rejuvenation to their skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, I love these pills, I was in a wow after I used this product the result was amazing I loved the way my face felt after using it I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and my recommendations are go for it, it&#x27;s definitely effective and worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have been taking only one pill a day and it has worked well. Even the few fine lines around my lips are now gone for good thanks to this. The fountain of youth in a capsule is more convenient than creams and what’s more I haven’t experienced any kind of break out on my skin.</li>
