    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect product for those with fragrance allergies.</li>
            <li>My head is no longer itchy and my hair has a great bounce to it!</li>
            <li>Best ever shampoo  </li>
            <li>A very good shampoo for those having scalp problems..</li>
            <li>Have happily used this shampoo for about 2 decades.</li>
            <li>Great for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>All products are great.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo, and has helped me a lot with Psorasis that I have on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lathers up very good.</li>
            <li>and they are a good combination.</li>
            <li>This time, it just doe not seem to be as good.</li>
            <li>I tried to be fair and washed my hair with this shampoo for almost a month.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy once more.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Thank you Abba for coming up with a great chemical free shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and feels good.</li>
            <li>I found it amazing that its mostly cleared up with the removal of toxins.</li>
            <li>This is best shampoo for those who are sensitive and trust me I would know.  </li>
            <li>I went on the internet many times, reading alot of customer reviews to see if I could find the one that worked for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, have come to love it.</li>
            <li>mostly, my wife LOVES the way my hair looks with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and so I went on amazon and the price was much better for the oz&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>They have much better products than this one.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be okay, but nothing I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I would never recommend it to anyone, unless you&#x27;re okay with dandruff.</li>
            <li>I think this is the best shampoo currently on the market.</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Abba&#x27;s pure gentle shampoo is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the Abba Gentle shampoo and my hair loved it.  </li>
            <li>Also it is easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from cheap brands to salon exclusives and settled on this after a recommendation from a salon owner.</li>
            <li>comments:&lt;br /&gt;It is labeled gluten free, but contains barley.</li>
            <li>and they said it tests lower than the required ppm for gluten free labeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smell good and feel soft while being manageable</li>
            <li>Very gentle, seems not to strip natural oil so that need for leave-in conditioner is greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The &#x27;strong&#x27; fragrance a reviewer made note of is quite mild in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is much milder than most shampoos.</li>
            <li>I am very displeased, and even more displeased that I ordered the biggest bottle offered.</li>
            <li>it lathers very quickly even in the first wash, despite any hair oil you may have in your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Abba loyal.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great and the color last do much longer</li>
            <li>My order came quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I would have preferred something more natural smelling.</li>
            <li>But you have to use more than the normal amount of shampoo b/c of it&#x27;s gentle effect I guess.</li>
            <li>And I say currently on the market because I liked the last generation of this formula much more.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is super gentle.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine textured and this shampoo seems to give it more body and life than any other shampoo I have used in 41 years!</li>
            <li>I love this product and has used it over the last 3 years.</li>
            <li>Second, I never got that real lasting clean feeling from this product and it made me feel like I needed to wash my hair more often.</li>
            <li>The Pure Gentle shampoo leaves my hair feeling like it hasn&#x27;t been washed.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t anything else really matter?</li>
            <li>been using this product from my hair styling place for a month or so and really like it</li>
            <li>Maybe it is too gentle?</li>
            <li>It is a gentle shampoo and they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is not a bad product just not something I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the other free and gentle shampoos out there.  </li>
            <li>You may need to use a little more than you are used to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as gentle or as moisturizing as the old version.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to foam up like other shampoos, but as long as my head is clean and itch free</li>
            <li>When I checked the bottle, though it appears to have lived up to its claims that it was Sulfate-free, DEA-free, and free of synthetic dyes, it contained just about every other chemical you can think of.</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty big</li>
            <li>Ironically, I love the Abba Pure Gentle Conditioner (in spite of its chemicals), probably because the fragrance is very subtle and subdued.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the abba pure gentile shampoo for about 3 years now, and this current formula for about 1 year.</li>
            <li>On a whim I got this product because it was sulfate-free and natural</li>
            <li>My scalp is sensitive and this works wonders for it.  </li>
            <li>The light scent I barely notice and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or leave it flat.</li>
            <li>One hour later, new dandruff flakes appear on my head again!</li>
            <li>Though this shampoo appears to moisturize well and leaves hair feeling soft and silky (rather than straw-like) even after rinsing, its (chemically-created) perfume-y smell was so overbearing that I ended up washing my hair a second time (with my old shampoo), just to try to remove the noxious, choking smell from my head.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair as well as other name-brand shampoos so have to shampoo every single day.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but cap was broken and shampoo was leaking into box.</li>
            <li>I shampoo my hair daily so it makes sense to use a daily shampoo that is gentle and won&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>First, the smell is not very appealing to me.</li>
            <li>It makes the hair feel soft...and it really has calmed down the irritation for me.    </li>
            <li>and if you have hair like my mom&#x27;s (thin, dries easily), then I HIGLY RECOMMEND this shampoo.  ^_^</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lather on this shampoo may be a little less than the cheap stuff.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The lather on this shampoo may be a little less than the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this shampoo for someone with oily hair because it is not a harsh enough cleanser, but other hair types it should work for</li>
            <li> My old girlfriend from college used this stuff, I thought it was ridiculous how much she used to pay for it.  </li>
            <li> It makes her hair soft without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I could tell almost immediately that this product was not &#x27;natural&#x27; just by the amount of suds that remained in the shower drain long after rinsing.</li>
            <li> Somehow I have trouble believing this product is the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot;, \\&quot;natural solution\\</li>
            <li> Her troubles with shampoos are that they either dry out her hair and make it like straw or are too moisturizing and make it look greasy and unkempt.  </li>
            <li> Living in Southern California with periodic trips to the Sierra&#x27;s, the dusty conditions all but force frequent washing, creating dry hair issues.</li>
            <li> I was getting little bumps from all shampoos and this was the only one that I can use.</li>
            <li> If perfume-soaked hair is your thing, you&#x27;ll love this shampoo - because performance-wise, it wasn&#x27;t bad at all, and if it weren&#x27;t for the perfume-y smell, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even be on here complaining.</li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone that has to be careful when buying shampoo</li>
            <li> Also one should note that all natural shampoos will not give you the curl, bounce, thick volume you may be looking for....</li>
            <li> the synthectic ingredients in the other shampoos is what give that curly bouncy look.    </li>
            <li> (I suspected that the sulfates in the other shampoos were drying her hair out).  </li>
            <li> Almost all of the other shampoos either make my head itch, or my hair fall out, or both.</li>
            <li> But not happy with this new formula.</li>
            <li> Hated it at first because it&#x27;s action is different than the product it replaced in ABBA&#x27;s line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had such a hard time finding something that wasn&#x27;t going to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I regret making such a bad investment in the first place.</li>
            <li> Hair feels limp and like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for 2 days.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day and it&#x27;s one of the few shampoos that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Barley contains much less gluten than wheat, but is usually still avoided for gluten intolerant people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought abba hair care products locally but found the price here to be less expensive.</li>
            <li> Not only is this shampoo expensive, but you can&#x27;t return it after using up one-third of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Some reviews about this product are negative.</li>
            <li> (it is very thick and curly).  </li>
            <li> And because I could not creame or relax my hair, that made things worse.    </li>
            <li> I got this shampoo for my mom who has thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong shampoo.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have happily used this shampoo for about 2 decades. But not happy with this new formula. It&#x27;s not as gentle or as moisturizing as the old version. Sorry to say I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but cap was broken and shampoo was leaking into box.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for shampoo that would not irritate my eczema on my scalp  for quite some time. And because I could not creame or relax my hair, that made things worse.    I went on the internet many times, reading alot of customer reviews to see if I could find the one that worked for me and I have.    Some reviews about this product are negative. But everyone is different, so you got to try it for yourself and see.....I would recommend it a million times...it lathers very quickly even in the first wash, despite any hair oil you may have in your hair. Also it is easy to wash out. It makes the hair feel soft...and it really has calmed down the irritation for me.    Also one should note that all natural shampoos will not give you the curl, bounce, thick volume you may be looking for....the synthectic ingredients in the other shampoos is what give that curly bouncy look.    This shampoo is about healing and restoring all that you hair and scalp has lost.    And I finally found the nerve to creame my hair and I am happy once more.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo for my mom who has thin hair.  Her troubles with shampoos are that they either dry out her hair and make it like straw or are too moisturizing and make it look greasy and unkempt.  On a whim I got this product because it was sulfate-free and natural (I suspected that the sulfates in the other shampoos were drying her hair out).  SHE LOVES IT!  It makes her hair soft without weighing it down.  I do not recommend this shampoo for someone with oily hair because it is not a harsh enough cleanser, but other hair types it should work for and if you have hair like my mom&#x27;s (thin, dries easily), then I HIGLY RECOMMEND this shampoo.  ^_^</li>
            <li> Hated it at first because it&#x27;s action is different than the product it replaced in ABBA&#x27;s line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, have come to love it. Very gentle, seems not to strip natural oil so that need for leave-in conditioner is greatly reduced. Living in Southern California with periodic trips to the Sierra&#x27;s, the dusty conditions all but force frequent washing, creating dry hair issues. With this, only occasionally need to add some conditioner after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And mostly, my wife LOVES the way my hair looks with this shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t anything else really matter?</li>
            <li> been using this product from my hair styling place for a month or so and really like it and so I went on amazon and the price was much better for the oz&#x27;s.  will order some time again.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong shampoo. The Pure Gentle shampoo leaves my hair feeling like it hasn&#x27;t been washed. Maybe it is too gentle? Hair feels limp and like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for 2 days. I won&#x27;t be buying it again. They have much better products than this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product and has used it over the last 3 years. My hair is healthy and feels good. I love the smell and it lathers up very good. I use it with the condition as well and they are a good combination.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the Abba Gentle shampoo and my hair loved it.  This time, it just doe not seem to be as good. I don&#x27;t know what has changed.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty big so that&#x27;s a plus. But you have to use more than the normal amount of shampoo b/c of it&#x27;s gentle effect I guess. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my hair as well as other name-brand shampoos so have to shampoo every single day.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be okay, but nothing I would purchase again. First, the smell is not very appealing to me. I would have preferred something more natural smelling. Second, I never got that real lasting clean feeling from this product and it made me feel like I needed to wash my hair more often. Overall, it is not a bad product just not something I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Avoid this shampoo at all costs! I tried to be fair and washed my hair with this shampoo for almost a month. Whenever I washed my hair with this shampoo, I get dandruff practically the next day. Do you know how embarrassing it is for your co-workers to see you with dandruff? I would brush the flakes of dandruff off my hair. One hour later, new dandruff flakes appear on my head again! I will never use this shampoo again! I would never recommend it to anyone, unless you&#x27;re okay with dandruff. Not only is this shampoo expensive, but you can&#x27;t return it after using up one-third of the bottle. I regret making such a bad investment in the first place.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is super gentle. I wash my hair every day and it&#x27;s one of the few shampoos that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Although rebottled/rebranded, I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for the last 12 years.  My old girlfriend from college used this stuff, I thought it was ridiculous how much she used to pay for it.  That didn&#x27;t last, this did.  This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best shampoo currently on the market. Of course that is just my opinion. And I say currently on the market because I liked the last generation of this formula much more. I have tried everything from cheap brands to salon exclusives and settled on this after a recommendation from a salon owner. Almost all of the other shampoos either make my head itch, or my hair fall out, or both. I&#x27;ve been using the abba pure gentile shampoo for about 3 years now, and this current formula for about 1 year. My wife and I both like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some comments:&lt;br /&gt;It is labeled gluten free, but contains barley. Barley contains much less gluten than wheat, but is usually still avoided for gluten intolerant people. I contacted abba regarding this and they said it tests lower than the required ppm for gluten free labeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;strong&#x27; fragrance a reviewer made note of is quite mild in my opinion. It is much milder than most shampoos. It has not affected my nose or eyes like some fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lather on this shampoo may be a little less than the cheap stuff. It doesn&#x27;t seem to foam up like other shampoos, but as long as my head is clean and itch free I don&#x27;t care about lather. You may need to use a little more than you are used to.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo.  My scalp is sensitive and this works wonders for it.  My hair is fine textured and this shampoo seems to give it more body and life than any other shampoo I have used in 41 years!</li>
            <li> Though this shampoo appears to moisturize well and leaves hair feeling soft and silky (rather than straw-like) even after rinsing, its (chemically-created) perfume-y smell was so overbearing that I ended up washing my hair a second time (with my old shampoo), just to try to remove the noxious, choking smell from my head. (And some of it still remained, even then.) I could tell almost immediately that this product was not &#x27;natural&#x27; just by the amount of suds that remained in the shower drain long after rinsing. When I checked the bottle, though it appears to have lived up to its claims that it was Sulfate-free, DEA-free, and free of synthetic dyes, it contained just about every other chemical you can think of. Somehow I have trouble believing this product is the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot;, \\&quot;natural solution\\&quot; it claims to be in its description (on the bottle). I am very displeased, and even more displeased that I ordered the biggest bottle offered. I feel misled. If perfume-soaked hair is your thing, you&#x27;ll love this shampoo - because performance-wise, it wasn&#x27;t bad at all, and if it weren&#x27;t for the perfume-y smell, I probably wouldn&#x27;t even be on here complaining. Ironically, I love the Abba Pure Gentle Conditioner (in spite of its chemicals), probably because the fragrance is very subtle and subdued.</li>
            <li> I have had such a hard time finding something that wasn&#x27;t going to irritate my skin. This is the perfect product for those with fragrance allergies. My head is no longer itchy and my hair has a great bounce to it!</li>
            <li> I buy Abba for our family. Great for all types of hair. It is a gentle shampoo and they don&#x27;t test on animals. I&#x27;m Abba loyal. All products are great.</li>
            <li> Best ever shampoo  , I would never want to go back to regular shampoo  .  My hair looks great and the color last do much longer</li>
            <li> A very good shampoo for those having scalp problems.. it lives up to its name gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone that has to be careful when buying shampoo</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo, and has helped me a lot with Psorasis that I have on my scalp. When I started using this shampoo, looking for something healthier with out all the chemicals, my psorasis started clearing up. Now I only have an occasional spot rather than an entire head of it. I found it amazing that its mostly cleared up with the removal of toxins. What does that say about our shampoos. Thank you Abba for coming up with a great chemical free shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is best shampoo for those who are sensitive and trust me I would know.  I have tried all the other free and gentle shampoos out there.  I was getting little bumps from all shampoos and this was the only one that I can use. The light scent I barely notice and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or leave it flat.</li>
            <li> I shampoo my hair daily so it makes sense to use a daily shampoo that is gentle and won&#x27;t dry out my hair.  Abba&#x27;s pure gentle shampoo is perfect for me. It cleans my hair and rinses out well without leaving any residue. I&#x27;ve always bought abba hair care products locally but found the price here to be less expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Makes my hair smell good and feel soft while being manageable (it is very thick and curly).  My order came quickly and was well packaged.  Good price.  I recommend this seller.</li>
