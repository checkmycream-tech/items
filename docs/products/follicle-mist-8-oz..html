            <li> This product is great for natural hair and does wonders for itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I started using the Hydratherma line in July and have been very impressed with the products.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is extremely dry and her hair would resemble hay and she has a lot of hair (used to be much longer than it is now, but due to the dryness, it broke off).  The line has been great for keeping her hair moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The follicle mist works very well with softening and moisturing the scalp.  My daughter has a relaxer and has very thick hair, this has helped tremendously with softening the new growth.  I am natural and every bit of a 4c type hair.  This product has also softened my roots.  Combined with the growth lotion and oil, my hair is soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;My mother who is 75 years old, had severe thinning of her hair as well as her hair breaking off.  I gave her some of my Hydratherma products and now she is stuck on them.  She uses the follicle mist, leave-in conditioner, growth lotion and oil daily.  Her friends have been telling her how thick her is starting to become (yes, it was that noticeable).  Her hair is much more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I highly recommend it for people who want their scalp moistened and softened.  It works great for people either transitioning from relaxer to natural.  It is also great to keep the new growth softened so you can go longer between relaxers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this product works, but it does!  I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out my hair for more than a year.  Before discovering Follicle Mist by accident I was using Nioxin follicle booster which I have to say helps to grow out hair on thinning areas, but it is messy and not practical to use on the whole scalp twice a day. Although hair grows on average about 1cm to half an inch per month and I can&#x27;t say this product has changed that rate, this product has dramatically improved my shedding problem.  I&#x27;ve only used half a bottle and my hair does look thicker and feels stronger and since it is stronger it breaks less and it looks about one inch longer! I use this product on my scalp twice a day followed by a scalp massage and a quick blow dry.  This product doesn&#x27;t interfere with any other hair products I currently use and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell like other products that help with hair growth.  I came back and ordered more of it because I don&#x27;t want to run out.  I would like to see more Hydratherma Naturals products on Amazon to see what else can I discover.</li>
            <li> You can use this daily or you can use it after deep conditioning every week.  I prefer doing it after deep conditioning because you have to separate your hair slowly and spray the roots.  It would be time consuming to do this every day, but it does make your head tingle slightly, which means it is working.  It stimulates growth, which is great and it always feels good to get a head massage.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Its a great leave-in conditioner and its makes your hair healthy. Overall, I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything special about this spray.  Don&#x27;t know about growth or shedding as its only been a few weeks and I don&#x27;t use it all the time.  It does smell good and plays nicely with my hair gel.</li>
            <li> after giving birth my edges seemed very weak.  i have never had this problem before but ive been using this product and it seems to be helping alot.  this is my third bottle i love it</li>
            <li> I love her products and how they make my natural hair feel I have no complaints money well spent will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> I use this spray to keep my roots moisturized. I&#x27;ve noticed growth and less breakage. I spray it on my scalp every morning and night</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I have been growing out my natural hair for over two years and had some breakage along they way. This product has done wonders to help strengthen my hair.</li>
            <li> This product I use faithfully! I spray mist twice a day.  I use the whole line of Hydratherma Naturals but I believe this product is key to my hair becoming thicker and healthier than before. This product is a MUST have especially if you are natural!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Hydrathermal Naturals products. My natural hair is soft, manageable and overall healthy using this product line. Thank-you for such an excellent product</li>
            <li> This product works on my hair.  This is my second time ordering this product.  It really thicken my hair and it is growing nicely.  It is a bit expensive but it&#x27;s working for me. I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed anything about follicle mist because I&#x27;ve only recently began using it, so I can&#x27;t say whether it works or not. I do, however, really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I use the follicle Mist by spraying it on my scalp everyday. I added some essential oils to it as well and it&#x27;s worked in my favor. I cannot make any claims of whether my hair has grown faster. I use several other products and take supplements to aid the health of my hair, for growth and retainment. I will say this that this products is compatible with what I am doing so it works for my hair care needs.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.  Not sure if I will buy again.  I heard a lot of hype on the Hydratherma Naturals website but I think those women had good hair to begin with.  Kind of misleading.</li>
            <li> Great spray however I need to be able to order a  refill or larger size. Also the price is a bit much . its great on 4b hair. I used it up too fast.</li>
            <li> This made my hair hard and dry. I used it to spray my roots during a sew-in. I&#x27;ll stick with my Aphogee for protein.</li>
            <li> I love to put this product on my hair right when I section my hair or do mini twists.  It absorbs very quickly and really provides a good balance of moisture.  This is one of my staple products.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and I have been using all kinds of hair products to Thickin my hair,but this product right here!! Does the job and it smells good also that&#x27;s a plus for me!</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a month now, and I noticed that after a while it dried out my hair. I have type 4c kinky hair so I am not too sure if the amount of protein in the product had anything to do with it. It however did make my scalp feel very invogarated and I liked that a lot. I will give it more time and re post another review later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 4 years natural this month and am finally seeing my hair thrive CONSISTENTLY. I would take 4 steps forward and then screw up and take 8 steps back lol. Anyway, I bought this product on a whim. I read the claims it made on the bottle and thought why not? I was shedding a lot if hair lately. I&#x27;ve been using it one month and my shedding has decreased drastically!! It took a couple weeks to see a difference. I use it as directed, on wash day as a leave in on my scalp and hair, massage it in a bit, and also spray on my scalp throughout the week. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair soft or help with defanging but it&#x27;s not meant to. My only gripe is its not all natural, but it works! My wimpy sides are also growing out!! And it doesn&#x27;t leave any buildup or have any weird side affects. I love this stuff! Use it sparingly, don&#x27;t saturate the hair just coat it with a few sprays.</li>
            <li> For those women that have thin or bald spots, you have to try this product. I have used it for years. Before using I had bald spots coming at the crown of my head from using perms.  This product really works. My hair grew back. I still use it to continue strengthening my hair to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> I was transitioning to completely natural when I was diagnosed with cancer.  All of my hair fell out and I was looking for something to help my hair grow back (it was shoulder length when it fell out).  I found hydratherma naturals and their products did it!  I sprayed this on my bald head everyday (sometimes more than once--I really wanted it to work fast).  It truly did work.  My hair grew back over a year 4 to 6 inches and as thick as it was before.  I highly recommend all of their products.</li>
