            <li> American Crew Pomade version is clear so why is this yellow.</li>
            <li> but I think I prefer it as some of the clear ones I&#x27;ve gotten in the past were a bit too runny.</li>
            <li> (Maybe half of it is mixed with Vaseline).</li>
            <li> which may be why it costs less, but it works all the same.  </li>
            <li> My Hair  is thick and medium length and is difficult to manage, but this works better than anything I have ever tried, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to work.  </li>
            <li> Saw the other person comment on the color of the pomade.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shine and doesn&#x27;t make it look dull like American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> plenty for a few months.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was getting because I&#x27;ve used the product in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my hair for at least 15 years, maybe longer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it (really thick and oily like Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Uses it every day and works well, even with his thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Weird smell and doesn&#x27;t hold my hair that well.</li>
            <li> Product was a fake....</li>

            <li> Great price and all 4 were good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it (really thick and oily like Vaseline. Wait! I thought this was a water-based product), it doesn&#x27;t smell like it (where is that refreshing smell), and it doesn&#x27;t look like it (yellow and opaque vs clear translucent). CVS, Walmart, &amp; Walgreens&#x27; American Crew Pomade version is clear so why is this yellow. (Maybe half of it is mixed with Vaseline). Also, the cover looks like it has been xerox copied so many times. They can&#x27;t even print it correctly.</li>
            <li> Grooms exactly as I like it.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was getting because I&#x27;ve used the product in the past.  Nothing was amiss with the order -- all aspects perfect.</li>
            <li> I ordered a pack of 4 and all four were half full when&lt;br /&gt;I opened them.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about 15 years. Continually try to find better and always come back to this. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great deal on an even better product.  I use this religiously for years and the price at the stores has gotten a bit too much.  Buying it on Amazon was a great deal.  I could tell that it had gotten hot and melted either before or in transit.  The creamy consistency of the regular product was not the same, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed the usefulness of the product.</li>
            <li> Weird smell and doesn&#x27;t hold my hair that well. The pomade is pretty sticky.</li>
            <li> Saw the other person comment on the color of the pomade. Despite the color change still did the job for my hair. Keeps it in place without looking like glue was poured on and there is no sticky film.  Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves this stuff. Uses it every day and works well, even with his thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Product was a fake.... dont buy. I returned.</li>
            <li> I can still never tell whether this pomade is real American Crew or a knock off - it&#x27;s the cloudy version, but it works and smells pleasant. All 4 were cloudy but I think I prefer it as some of the clear ones I&#x27;ve gotten in the past were a bit too runny.</li>
            <li> Good Price. I would have paid this price for only 2. It was like getting one FREE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my hair for at least 15 years, maybe longer.  My Hair  is thick and medium length and is difficult to manage, but this works better than anything I have ever tried, and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product to work.  This 4-pack is a good deal too.  This stuff costs twice as much in a retail store.  Sometimes it looks different from jar to jar, (the opacity varies) which may be why it costs less, but it works all the same.  It comes plastic wrapped and there have never been any fingerprints on the top of the product when I have unscrewed the lid (it happens in stores).  The stuff washes off my hands with water and is not greasy.  It makes my hair shine and doesn&#x27;t make it look dull like American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to get this stuff at the sway meet all the time for $4 a piece if I bought 5 but no one has it any more so I have to pay more here</li>
            <li> What more could you want?  This product came legit and exactly as advertised.  Save some money and stock up!!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> plenty for a few months. works well, nice shine, not as much hold as i would like but it works at keeping my hair presentable at work.</li>
            <li> What a great deal pack And fast service. My husband loves the product. Cant beat this kind of deal any where. Thank u, i will shop it again</li>
            <li> Awesome product in an awesome package. Now I have my 6 month supply in one shot!</li>
            <li> Bought a 4 pack. All 4 were half full or had a significant portion taken out. Rip off.</li>
