            <li>I will give it more time.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I look more rested.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye cream and have used it for awhile.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It smells very nice and the texture is okay for my skin and feeling, but so far I don&#x27;t see any results on my wrinkles, though have been applying it for 2 months already!</li>
            <li>I find it light enough to use during the day, too, which is great!</li>
            <li>easily leaving no greasy</li>
            <li>The cream is light and easy to apply, and soaks in very quickly.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes and reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great multi functional all in one eye cream for a middle of the road priced eye cream.</li>
            <li>I would never purchase this product at the store for the original store price.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>dries quickly and makeup applies well after.</li>
            <li>I dab it on my eye area and it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb too quick.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>But, it is worth buying it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>An economical way to purchase RoC products.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>I saw results within the first two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I use twice daily and feel like my eyes look better.</li>
            <li>I will update later when I have more results.</li>
            <li>I was really eager to try this cream for my wrinkles, which I did, but the cream doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I do not use too much either.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference as yet.  </li>
            <li>Use this for two weeks,for my eye wrinkles not much help， but remove wrinkles is not an easy thing,so I will stick to it, have a look</li>
            <li>I got it online because I had bought the older version in stores and had worked for me, so why change?</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Roc Retinol Day and Night cream for a little over 1 year and love them both.</li>
            <li>I see this tube lasting a couple of months, which is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I  have visible improvement of fine lines and dark spots</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised myself, given the price!</li>
            <li>I get compliments on how young I look all the time!</li>
            <li>but so far have not noticed any change or improvement.</li>
            <li>So far I feel this is making a difference.</li>
            <li>It has been a week since I started to use the eye cream, it&#x27;s to early to say, but,</li>
            <li>I do not like the fragrance, which I smell for quite a while since it&#x27;s near my nose.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, I will get used to using it more frequently in the next few weeks and will se a change.</li>
            <li>Not much better than the cheap stuff</li>
            <li>I tried a few eye creams, but most of them were heavy and oily and didn&#x27;t provide much relief.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other department store brands and so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this very long, about one month, but I can&#x27;t tell much difference.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and have only used it 3 days so far.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try - far beyond the usual amount I would spend on an eye cream - and thankfully, it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Was open package when i got it, and the effects were barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I will definitely return to this product and other products from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I think the regular roc eye cream is better than thos 5 in 1 eye cream, and smell so bad .</li>

            <li> It is however, extremely pricey if you were to buy it at the store like Cvs, Rite Aid, Walgreens, ect...</li>

            <li> I could tell after 2-3 uses that it was going to provide relief; the skin under my eyes was soft and didn&#x27;t feel thin and brittle anymore.</li>
            <li> The same product is not necessarily good on everyone&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Expensive, yes, but a tiny dot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I did notice some improvement, though I do prefer something a little creamier for the day, so I&#x27;ve been using this at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it does all it claims to, but I&#x27;m not bothered by that.</li>
            <li> but not good for me</li>
            <li> This is expensive at $25</li>
            <li> Quite disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have been using this eye cream every day (some days morning and night) for about two weeks but so far have not noticed any change or improvement. Quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any change</li>
            <li> I like this cream as I feel it keeps my eyes moisturized.  I&#x27;m not sure it does all it claims to, but I&#x27;m not bothered by that.</li>
            <li> It works, very good eye cream</li>
            <li> Yes, it works! I&#x27;m surprised myself, given the price! On my second tube! Use it morning and night and it works really nicely under makeup. Sometimes I even dab some on top of my concealer mid-day to revive my eyes and perk up my under eye area. It&#x27;s great. Discovered it through an article on Refinery29 on FB.</li>
            <li> I did notice some improvement, though I do prefer something a little creamier for the day, so I&#x27;ve been using this at night.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  I saw results within the first two weeks.  My family says my face looks a lot fresher.</li>
            <li> So far I feel this is making a difference. I am 40 and minimal wrinkles but wanted to help prevent. I feel like it goes on well dries quickly and makeup applies well after. I use twice daily and feel like my eyes look better. I will continue to order this.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Was open package when i got it, and the effects were barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li> I was really eager to try this cream for my wrinkles, which I did, but the cream doesn&#x27;t work. It smells very nice and the texture is okay for my skin and feeling, but so far I don&#x27;t see any results on my wrinkles, though have been applying it for 2 months already!</li>
            <li> Remember, no anti-aging cream works as a miracle but this brand has visibly reduced my wrinkles. I got it online because I had bought the older version in stores and had worked for me, so why change? The same product is not necessarily good on everyone&#x27;s skin. What I recommend women is to try it.</li>
            <li> Hope it does all it says it does. Feels nice going on - I wear contacts, and have had no irritation. Good sized amount.</li>
            <li> I Love this product; results within one week and it goes on very light.  I have tried a few other department store brands and so far this one is my favorite. I will definitely return to this product and other products from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Not much better than the cheap stuff</li>
            <li> I have used ROC products for years and this one is great. Moisturizes and reduces fine lines. I get compliments on how young I look all the time!</li>
            <li> this product  it&#x27;s okay but not good for me I think the regular roc eye cream is better than thos 5 in 1 eye cream, and smell so bad .</li>
            <li> It has been a week since I started to use the eye cream, it&#x27;s to early to say, but, I like the feel of it, very light...</li>
            <li> My eyes almost always break out in a rash after use and I cannot use on my lids or else my eyes burn all day long. On a positive note, a have noticed my dark circles seem less apparent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great multi functional all in one eye cream for a middle of the road priced eye cream. It is however, extremely pricey if you were to buy it at the store like Cvs, Rite Aid, Walgreens, ect... I would never purchase this product at the store for the original store price. But, it is worth buying it from Amazon. For me it did everything I needed it to. I have puffy, very dry &amp; extreme dark circles. This is the second time I have purchased this product &amp; I would definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> Great for a fresher and more alert appearance.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye correction cream.  It&#x27;s not oily, and it does help dark circles and eye sags disappear.</li>
            <li> So far so good! It&#x27;s creamy!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes. I have dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried several brands that also haven&#x27;t worked. This cream is good at moisturizing my eye area. The scent is nice too. It helped w/some puffiness. I dab it on my eye area and it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb too quick. If I put concealed on too soon it gets cakey. I do not use too much either. This is expensive at $25 so I will use the rest of it before trying another. Its been a month since I started using it twice daily.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long, about one month, but I can&#x27;t tell much difference.  I will give it more time.  I do not like the fragrance, which I smell for quite a while since it&#x27;s near my nose.  I would prefer unscented.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this every day. I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference as yet.  Hopefully, I will get used to using it more frequently in the next few weeks and will se a change.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for very long; however, it seems to do the job:  my lines and puffiness look less defined after I use this.  I have been using it twice a day - morning and bedtime.  I feel like I look more rested.  I will continue this routine.  I have used lots of stuff but didn&#x27;t see an immediate response until Roc. It is not greasy at all; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I recently turned 30 and started noticing dark circles under my eyes, and the area constantly felt dry and stretched. I tried a few eye creams, but most of them were heavy and oily and didn&#x27;t provide much relief. I decided to give this a try - far beyond the usual amount I would spend on an eye cream - and thankfully, it was worth it. I could tell after 2-3 uses that it was going to provide relief; the skin under my eyes was soft and didn&#x27;t feel thin and brittle anymore. The cream is light and easy to apply, and soaks in very quickly. I find it light enough to use during the day, too, which is great! After 2 weeks of use 2x a day, the eye area is noticeably brighter and healthier-looking. This cream is definitely effective and more than does the trick. Expensive, yes, but a tiny dot goes a long way. I see this tube lasting a couple of months, which is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and have only used it 3 days so far. The tube is fairly small but it seems like a drop goes a long way. It&#x27;s very smooth going on and massages into skin easily leaving no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Roc Retinol Day and Night cream for a little over 1 year and love them both. I  have visible improvement of fine lines and dark spots so hopefully the Multi Correxion 5-in-1 works well with those products. I will update later when I have more results.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference but had no problems with it either.</li>
            <li> Use this for two weeks,for my eye wrinkles not much help， but remove wrinkles is not an easy thing,so I will stick to it, have a look how the effect</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  Regular lotion with vitamin e seemed to be just as beneficial</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream and have used it for awhile. Amazon has it for a great price. What can be better than a great eye cream and a great price!!</li>
            <li> I swear by this eye cream! They are the best! I have tried a few eye cream and so far ROC met all the expectations!</li>
            <li> I am 44 and no longer have puffy eyes or dark circles thanks to this fabulous product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> An economical way to purchase RoC products.  Moderately effective eye cream that seems to hydrate well.</li>
            <li> Helps the friend to buy, she said with is being very good.Can then use looked the long-term effect, the good speech can continue the purchase.</li>
