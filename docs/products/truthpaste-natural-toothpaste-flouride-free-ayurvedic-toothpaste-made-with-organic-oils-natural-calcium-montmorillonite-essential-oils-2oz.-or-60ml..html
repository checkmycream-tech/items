            <li>I wake up and start my day with healing, thus leading to a healthy day!  </li>

            <li>Thank you diamond dental systems for creating this amazing TRUTHPASTE.</li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s amazing..</li>
            <li>and it seems to do a better job with cleaning my teeth and leaving my gums feeling good.</li>
            <li>Feels kind of like clay.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>but will do and will be buying more of this good stuff here.</li>
            <li>I like the taste of this more than I anticipated upon opening, considering the topnotes of clove EO, as clove just isn&#x27;t my fave, yet honestly, I am learning to love the taste!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best whitening and cleaning paste i have used.  </li>
            <li>This is the best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I read that they use naturally sourced botanical extracts &amp; herbs for their EO&#x27;s, and use an excellent quality Colloidal Silver.  </li>
            <li>but as far as the quality, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>would kindly and respectfully ask you to consider removing or modifying your Amazon product review.</li>
            <li>If you’d like us to send you a fresh TruthPaste for you to experience we’d be happy to accommodate this.&lt;br /&gt;Again our deepest apologies for your displeasing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirsten</li>
            <li>Also, as a frequent traveler, the 2oz container is perfect in my carry on!</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant, tastes like a mild mix of mint, cinnamon.</li>
            <li>gums look good, no bad breath</li>
            <li>Excellent product, makes your mouth feel super clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>We would be happy to work with you in any way to create a positive experience out of this.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>

            <li>I love love love this paste.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Its safe to practically eat.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not disgusting.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you why I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I am coming close to the end of my jar and will without doubt be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this paste.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a glass jar ~although</li>
            <li>turmeric &amp; Colloidal Silver will help in the battle, but it&#x27;s best to try to keep water out whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>(I love clove and mint).  </li>
            <li>scent but could have more mint oil.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell or taste of it, and I love that it&#x27;s a healthier alternative to name brand toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so satisfied with a product before</li>
            <li>and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bear it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Love treating my teeth with non toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Really it is pretty much the perfect toothpaste in my opinion</li>
            <li>Flavor could be improved upon a bit, but it does the job and my teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>ingredients you can trust, great taste, mouth and teeth feel super clean and healthy, gums enjoy the nurturing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>mouth feels very clean from brushing ,but rinsing is a bit of a chore.</li>

            <li>Love that they have truly done their research to provide the healthiest ingredients for optimal oral health, support fair trade &amp; produce their product responsibly in the USA.  </li>
            <li>The first few weeks of using the product my mouth felt great, the taste was a very pleasant wintergreen</li>
            <li>Simply a great all natural toothpaste sans fluoride.</li>
            <li>but I think it is worth it! :)</li>
            <li>I was planning to create a toothpaste including clay, oils &amp; bamboo charcoal among other botanicals, but finding TruthPaste gve me a perfect option to improve on my family&#x27;s health!  </li>
            <li>My mouth/teeth feel healthy and clean after using.</li>
            <li>It was working fine.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is great, my teeth are whiter, and I love that my teeth feel clean all day long (even after eating).</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that Amazon is now carrying the most all Natural Organic Toothpaste brand TRUTHPASTE.</li>
            <li>Feels so silky and smooth on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Smooth creamy texture.</li>
            <li>By mouth-feel, he consistency of the paste was extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to check and see if it&#x27;s available in a tube.</li>
            <li>Truthpaste is the only truly great toothpaste I have found.</li>
            <li>I have one other brand I liked more, but this is pretty good.</li>
            <li>My teeth are smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>Ingredients in the toothpaste are safe with no fluoride and do the job, which is  exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and fresh for hours!</li>
            <li>Seems to clean well.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li>What a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Thus far, it&#x27;s next to the the best I&#x27;ve purchased online.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy TruthPaste as much as I am!!</li>
            <li>I really dug the TruthPaste for the most part.  </li>
            <li>This makes my mouth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li>Healthy,  natural ingredients that are good for you, and naturally anti-bacterial.</li>
            <li>No bad taste, and no residual after effects.  </li>
            <li>Once you get used to the lack of foaming and the herbal/clay taste, its not bad.  </li>
            <li>My teeth &amp; tongue feel very clean with each use and I like to make a &amp;#34;mouthwash&amp;#34; after brushing by placing appx 1/2 tsp in my mouth and adding water to freshen my breath &amp; mouth as a whole.  </li>
            <li>It makes your mouth feel so fresh and clean..</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I was feeling pretty confident until my first dentist visit.  </li>
            <li>I got this and the charcoal one (which is kind of messy but whitens nicely).  </li>
            <li>I really liked the clean feeling it leaves in my mouth and also knowing it has pure natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff my teeth feel like new enamel</li>
            <li>Hands down the most amazing tooth paste I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>But to reiterate - I do love this product and feel like I am truly cleaning my mouth and teeth naturally!</li>
            <li>Seriously it is an amazing product because it takes care of the obvious needs and literally leaves me wanting to brush my teeth again.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I would be surprised if it wasn&#x27;t just clay, it was that smooth!</li>
            <li>--Thanks so much for developing it:))</li>
            <li>Makes your mouth feel fresh too.</li>
            <li>but it has a few ingredients I&#x27;d rather do without and foams more than I like now that I&#x27;m use to the non-foaming kind.  </li>
            <li>your teeth are worth investing in.</li>
            <li>but I do not like this or most natural toothpaste, but I&#x27;m continuing to try the mall until I find one I like</li>
            <li>and it taste so fresh and minty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey comparatively speaking but worth it.</li>
            <li>Truthpaste is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to get that fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>And it really does freshen breath and clean the surface of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different fluoride free tooth pastes on the market and have never come across any that were able to give me such nutrition!  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with finding a natural toothpaste that will also maintain a bright white smile.</li>
            <li>I make my own organic soaps, creating my own recipes &amp; make organic body butters as well as other personal care products.  </li>
            <li>It works very well against a mild case of gingivitis, keeping it under control.</li>
            <li>but I expected as much - anything good for you</li>
            <li>I really think there&#x27;s better tasting natural toothpastes out there.</li>
            <li>Natural ingedients and teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>TruthPaste has proven that ALL NATURAL ingredients that are RECOGNIZABLE &amp; SAFE can also significantly WHITEN &amp; DEEP CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Keeping water outis important b/c although this co uses Rosemary EO for it&#x27;s preserving qualities &amp;#60;3, any introduction of water to a product w/o a broadband preservative can become breeding ground for staph, molds, and many other undesirables.  </li>
            <li>You get used to the different taste but your teeth will feel so super clean after the first use!</li>
            <li>Thanks Truthpaste!</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth very well and makes mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Brings back memories of mud pies :-)</li>
            <li>I mention this as I am immunodeficient &amp; know there are others who have to be aware.  </li>
            <li>but TruthPaste is my heads and above favorite.  </li>
            <li>But this truthpaste is a step above baking soda for sure.  </li>
            <li>I think I may have a sensitivity to one or more essential oils.</li>
            <li>well this is the first time I&#x27;ve been in over a year</li>
            <li>couldnt wait until i got it and brushed away love the feeling it taste</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Good tasting stuff that has one main difference I feel to other toothpastes, it leaves a pleasing, lubricant-type feeling on the teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other toothpaste alternatives, such as tooth soap, and while I liked the others, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Other than the silver, the formula is amazing...</li>
            <li>Part of me would like to see it in a tube of some kind just so it reduces the risk of contaminating the container with bacteria or other debris.</li>
            <li>Cleans well, didn&#x27;t stain my teeth, none of that coated feeling the next morning, sensitivity is pretty much gone and my teeth and gums look healthy.  </li>
            <li>I find that the taste of this, unusual at first, is growing on me.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth giving a try if you are interested in getting those teeth whitened naturally.</li>
            <li>It was kind of odd because it hadn&#x27;t done that before.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and it goes a long way, if you have halitosis it really helps a lot</li>
            <li>or they tell me they&#x27;re watching certain teeth -</li>
            <li>and it seemed fine, especially with my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m upgrading my review from 1 to 3 stars based on the following interaction I had with the company and the fact that I have a gene that makes me more sensitive to certain tastes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that i want to brush my teeth for much longer now</li>
            <li>but it feels like it really scrubs my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really like the taste</li>
            <li>I used it a week and really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my gums or teeth</li>
            <li>They really need to change the texture so you can rinse it off your brush</li>
            <li>thank you so much for this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much for your feedback on TruthPaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands of natural toothpastes and I thought they all worked really well...</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Your whole mouth is left tingly clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazingly clean, gums feel tight, and breath is really fresh!</li>
            <li>Flouride, TEA, PEG&#x27;s and other noxious ingredients dubbed &#x27;safe for consumption.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Nothing has ever left my mouth feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only just started using Truth Paste, so I can not speak for long term oral health, however, I can already attest to a very clean result immediately after use!  </li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first to try an all natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would love to see a little spoon or spatula included</li>
            <li>Using Truthpaste after oil pulling everyday my oral health has never felt and looked better.</li>
            <li>Also, its nice to have a toothpaste that is natural and not filled with ingredients that remind me of my college chem classes!  </li>
            <li>but none have left my mouth as fresh as this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other Natural toothpaste products and so far Truthpaste has been working for me.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old son likes this better than the other natural toothpaste brand that&#x27;s made specifically for kids.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone straight back to a more conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The only improvem I could suggest would be how it&#x27;s packaged/dispensed - it comes in a nice little glass jar - but how to conveniently dispense it?</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this was for the turmeric, because I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s a natural tooth whitener and the homemade turmeric paste I was using</li>
            <li>Bentonite clay, essential oils, travel-friendly glass jar, none of those toxic chemicals... highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>well worth the long wait</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super bitter and made me gag.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste definitely is the truth!!!&lt;br /&gt;Within the first couple of brushing I&#x27;ve noticed the difference in my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention its made of all natural components.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is way better than the chemical mess that the regular toothpastes are made from.</li>
            <li>But after the first try my gums and mouth had this fresh feeling that lasted longer than other regular toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>After 4 uses, twice daily, it really started to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural toothpastes and cared for none.</li>
            <li>Like the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I had been using baking soda as my natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>but a week really is probably not enough time to reap any benefits.  </li>
            <li>I started with a tube of the Doterra which cleans well and helped my tooth not be so sensitive, but I&#x27;d read that glycerin blocks mineralization (don&#x27;t know how scientific that claim is)</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like they have been professionally polished, every day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for fluoride free toothpaste for a while now and have tried a few</li>
            <li>minty refreshing the only thing my family is missing the foam</li>
            <li>But after getting sensitive to some other toothpastes, I figured it was worth a try</li>
            <li>I have used many natural toothpastes over the past several years and TruthPaste is the finest of all--</li>
            <li>I use the charcoal kind just once every couple of weeks because the powder is kind of messy, but not too bad and whitens a bit.  </li>
            <li>I probably use 10% of what I normally would use if it were regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t read the rest of the ingredients very carefully and when it arrived I was surprised to find that colloidal silver is very high up on the list.</li>
            <li>I run an all natural preschool and we brush our teeth daily in school with TRUTHPASTE !</li>
            <li>I know, it seems strange, but clay draws out impurities and the way they&#x27;ve mixed this product with essential oils, the taste is really yummy!  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say i have never experienced a healthier dental product!</li>
            <li>Wish it was about half the price, but as I&#x27;m on my second container, I&#x27;d say its worth it---</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean after using TruthPaste, and I swear after only a few uses my teeth look whiter!</li>
            <li>My teeth seriously feel smooth and are whiter than ever.</li>
            <li>Apparently it was not doing the job I thought cleaning my teeth, there was tons of tartar buildup above and below the gums.</li>
            <li>but the first few times I used it</li>
            <li>After almost soaking it on my tooth for a half hour it really took the pain away.</li>
            <li>One thing I recommend is to remove TruthPaste from jar with a dry, clean finger or small spoon to avoid adding water to this product as well as avoiding cross contamination of germs from multiple tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>It blew my mind because they all had really good reviews, tasted so bad though.</li>

            <li> (like so many of the so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes do!</li>
            <li> It has been the most amazing dental product i have found along my healing path!  </li>
            <li> I wake up and start my day with healing, thus leading to a healthy day!  </li>

            <li> Thank you diamond dental systems for creating this amazing TRUTHPASTE.</li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s amazing..</li>
            <li> and it seems to do a better job with cleaning my teeth and leaving my gums feeling good.</li>
            <li> Feels kind of like clay.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> but will do and will be buying more of this good stuff here.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of this more than I anticipated upon opening, considering the topnotes of clove EO, as clove just isn&#x27;t my fave, yet honestly, I am learning to love the taste!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best whitening and cleaning paste i have used.  </li>
            <li> This is the best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I read that they use naturally sourced botanical extracts &amp; herbs for their EO&#x27;s, and use an excellent quality Colloidal Silver.  </li>
            <li> but as far as the quality, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> would kindly and respectfully ask you to consider removing or modifying your Amazon product review.</li>
            <li> If you’d like us to send you a fresh TruthPaste for you to experience we’d be happy to accommodate this.&lt;br /&gt;Again our deepest apologies for your displeasing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirsten</li>
            <li> Also, as a frequent traveler, the 2oz container is perfect in my carry on!</li>
            <li> Smells pleasant, tastes like a mild mix of mint, cinnamon.</li>
            <li> gums look good, no bad breath</li>
            <li> Excellent product, makes your mouth feel super clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> We would be happy to work with you in any way to create a positive experience out of this.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> I am glad we ordered two jars as it took a while to get it delivered.</li>
            <li> I love love love this paste.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Its safe to practically eat.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not disgusting.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you why I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I am coming close to the end of my jar and will without doubt be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this paste.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a glass jar ~although</li>
            <li> turmeric &amp; Colloidal Silver will help in the battle, but it&#x27;s best to try to keep water out whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> (I love clove and mint).  </li>
            <li> scent but could have more mint oil.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell or taste of it, and I love that it&#x27;s a healthier alternative to name brand toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so satisfied with a product before</li>
            <li> and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bear it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Love treating my teeth with non toxic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Really it is pretty much the perfect toothpaste in my opinion</li>
            <li> Flavor could be improved upon a bit, but it does the job and my teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> ingredients you can trust, great taste, mouth and teeth feel super clean and healthy, gums enjoy the nurturing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> mouth feels very clean from brushing ,but rinsing is a bit of a chore.</li>

            <li> Love that they have truly done their research to provide the healthiest ingredients for optimal oral health, support fair trade &amp; produce their product responsibly in the USA.  </li>
            <li> The first few weeks of using the product my mouth felt great, the taste was a very pleasant wintergreen</li>
            <li> Simply a great all natural toothpaste sans fluoride.</li>
            <li> but I think it is worth it! :)</li>
            <li> I was planning to create a toothpaste including clay, oils &amp; bamboo charcoal among other botanicals, but finding TruthPaste gve me a perfect option to improve on my family&#x27;s health!  </li>
            <li> My mouth/teeth feel healthy and clean after using.</li>
            <li> It was working fine.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is great, my teeth are whiter, and I love that my teeth feel clean all day long (even after eating).</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that Amazon is now carrying the most all Natural Organic Toothpaste brand TRUTHPASTE.</li>
            <li> Feels so silky and smooth on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Smooth creamy texture.</li>
            <li> By mouth-feel, he consistency of the paste was extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to check and see if it&#x27;s available in a tube.</li>
            <li> Truthpaste is the only truly great toothpaste I have found.</li>
            <li> I have one other brand I liked more, but this is pretty good.</li>
            <li> My teeth are smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Ingredients in the toothpaste are safe with no fluoride and do the job, which is  exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and fresh for hours!</li>
            <li> Seems to clean well.</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel clean.</li>
            <li> What a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Thus far, it&#x27;s next to the the best I&#x27;ve purchased online.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling so clean.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy TruthPaste as much as I am!!</li>
            <li> I really dug the TruthPaste for the most part.  </li>
            <li> This makes my mouth feel super clean.  </li>
            <li> Healthy,  natural ingredients that are good for you, and naturally anti-bacterial.</li>
            <li> No bad taste, and no residual after effects.  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to the lack of foaming and the herbal/clay taste, its not bad.  </li>
            <li> My teeth &amp; tongue feel very clean with each use and I like to make a &amp;#34;mouthwash&amp;#34; after brushing by placing appx 1/2 tsp in my mouth and adding water to freshen my breath &amp; mouth as a whole.  </li>
            <li> It makes your mouth feel so fresh and clean..</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I was feeling pretty confident until my first dentist visit.  </li>
            <li> I got this and the charcoal one (which is kind of messy but whitens nicely).  </li>
            <li> I really liked the clean feeling it leaves in my mouth and also knowing it has pure natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff my teeth feel like new enamel</li>
            <li> Hands down the most amazing tooth paste I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> But to reiterate - I do love this product and feel like I am truly cleaning my mouth and teeth naturally!</li>
            <li> Seriously it is an amazing product because it takes care of the obvious needs and literally leaves me wanting to brush my teeth again.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I would be surprised if it wasn&#x27;t just clay, it was that smooth!</li>
            <li> --Thanks so much for developing it:))</li>
            <li> Makes your mouth feel fresh too.</li>
            <li> but it has a few ingredients I&#x27;d rather do without and foams more than I like now that I&#x27;m use to the non-foaming kind.  </li>
            <li> your teeth are worth investing in.</li>
            <li> but I do not like this or most natural toothpaste, but I&#x27;m continuing to try the mall until I find one I like</li>
            <li> and it taste so fresh and minty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey comparatively speaking but worth it.</li>
            <li> Truthpaste is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to get that fresh and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> And it really does freshen breath and clean the surface of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different fluoride free tooth pastes on the market and have never come across any that were able to give me such nutrition!  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with finding a natural toothpaste that will also maintain a bright white smile.</li>
            <li> I make my own organic soaps, creating my own recipes &amp; make organic body butters as well as other personal care products.  </li>
            <li> It works very well against a mild case of gingivitis, keeping it under control.</li>
            <li> but I expected as much - anything good for you</li>
            <li> I really think there&#x27;s better tasting natural toothpastes out there.</li>
            <li> Natural ingedients and teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> TruthPaste has proven that ALL NATURAL ingredients that are RECOGNIZABLE &amp; SAFE can also significantly WHITEN &amp; DEEP CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Keeping water outis important b/c although this co uses Rosemary EO for it&#x27;s preserving qualities &amp;#60;3, any introduction of water to a product w/o a broadband preservative can become breeding ground for staph, molds, and many other undesirables.  </li>
            <li> You get used to the different taste but your teeth will feel so super clean after the first use!</li>
            <li> Thanks Truthpaste!</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth very well and makes mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories of mud pies :-)</li>
            <li> I mention this as I am immunodeficient &amp; know there are others who have to be aware.  </li>
            <li> but TruthPaste is my heads and above favorite.  </li>
            <li> But this truthpaste is a step above baking soda for sure.  </li>
            <li> I think I may have a sensitivity to one or more essential oils.</li>
            <li> well this is the first time I&#x27;ve been in over a year</li>
            <li> couldnt wait until i got it and brushed away love the feeling it taste</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Good tasting stuff that has one main difference I feel to other toothpastes, it leaves a pleasing, lubricant-type feeling on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other toothpaste alternatives, such as tooth soap, and while I liked the others, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Other than the silver, the formula is amazing...</li>
            <li> Part of me would like to see it in a tube of some kind just so it reduces the risk of contaminating the container with bacteria or other debris.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, didn&#x27;t stain my teeth, none of that coated feeling the next morning, sensitivity is pretty much gone and my teeth and gums look healthy.  </li>
            <li> I find that the taste of this, unusual at first, is growing on me.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth giving a try if you are interested in getting those teeth whitened naturally.</li>
            <li> It was kind of odd because it hadn&#x27;t done that before.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and it goes a long way, if you have halitosis it really helps a lot</li>
            <li> or they tell me they&#x27;re watching certain teeth -</li>
            <li> and it seemed fine, especially with my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m upgrading my review from 1 to 3 stars based on the following interaction I had with the company and the fact that I have a gene that makes me more sensitive to certain tastes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that i want to brush my teeth for much longer now</li>
            <li> but it feels like it really scrubs my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really like the taste</li>
            <li> I used it a week and really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my gums or teeth</li>
            <li> They really need to change the texture so you can rinse it off your brush</li>
            <li> thank you so much for this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much for your feedback on TruthPaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of natural toothpastes and I thought they all worked really well...</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Your whole mouth is left tingly clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazingly clean, gums feel tight, and breath is really fresh!</li>
            <li> Flouride, TEA, PEG&#x27;s and other noxious ingredients dubbed &#x27;safe for consumption.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Nothing has ever left my mouth feeling so clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using Truth Paste, so I can not speak for long term oral health, however, I can already attest to a very clean result immediately after use!  </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first to try an all natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would love to see a little spoon or spatula included</li>
            <li> Using Truthpaste after oil pulling everyday my oral health has never felt and looked better.</li>
            <li> Also, its nice to have a toothpaste that is natural and not filled with ingredients that remind me of my college chem classes!  </li>
            <li> but none have left my mouth as fresh as this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other Natural toothpaste products and so far Truthpaste has been working for me.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son likes this better than the other natural toothpaste brand that&#x27;s made specifically for kids.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone straight back to a more conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The only improvem I could suggest would be how it&#x27;s packaged/dispensed - it comes in a nice little glass jar - but how to conveniently dispense it?</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this was for the turmeric, because I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s a natural tooth whitener and the homemade turmeric paste I was using</li>
            <li> Bentonite clay, essential oils, travel-friendly glass jar, none of those toxic chemicals... highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> well worth the long wait</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super bitter and made me gag.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste definitely is the truth!!!&lt;br /&gt;Within the first couple of brushing I&#x27;ve noticed the difference in my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention its made of all natural components.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is way better than the chemical mess that the regular toothpastes are made from.</li>
            <li> But after the first try my gums and mouth had this fresh feeling that lasted longer than other regular toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> After 4 uses, twice daily, it really started to whiten my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural toothpastes and cared for none.</li>
            <li> Like the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I had been using baking soda as my natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> but a week really is probably not enough time to reap any benefits.  </li>
            <li> I started with a tube of the Doterra which cleans well and helped my tooth not be so sensitive, but I&#x27;d read that glycerin blocks mineralization (don&#x27;t know how scientific that claim is)</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like they have been professionally polished, every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for fluoride free toothpaste for a while now and have tried a few</li>
            <li> minty refreshing the only thing my family is missing the foam</li>
            <li> But after getting sensitive to some other toothpastes, I figured it was worth a try</li>
            <li> I have used many natural toothpastes over the past several years and TruthPaste is the finest of all--</li>
            <li> I use the charcoal kind just once every couple of weeks because the powder is kind of messy, but not too bad and whitens a bit.  </li>
            <li> I probably use 10% of what I normally would use if it were regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t read the rest of the ingredients very carefully and when it arrived I was surprised to find that colloidal silver is very high up on the list.</li>
            <li> I run an all natural preschool and we brush our teeth daily in school with TRUTHPASTE !</li>
            <li> I know, it seems strange, but clay draws out impurities and the way they&#x27;ve mixed this product with essential oils, the taste is really yummy!  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say i have never experienced a healthier dental product!</li>
            <li> Wish it was about half the price, but as I&#x27;m on my second container, I&#x27;d say its worth it---</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean after using TruthPaste, and I swear after only a few uses my teeth look whiter!</li>
            <li> My teeth seriously feel smooth and are whiter than ever.</li>
            <li> Apparently it was not doing the job I thought cleaning my teeth, there was tons of tartar buildup above and below the gums.</li>
            <li> but the first few times I used it</li>
            <li> After almost soaking it on my tooth for a half hour it really took the pain away.</li>
            <li> One thing I recommend is to remove TruthPaste from jar with a dry, clean finger or small spoon to avoid adding water to this product as well as avoiding cross contamination of germs from multiple tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> It blew my mind because they all had really good reviews, tasted so bad though.</li>
            <li> Its really in the herbal oil formula with ingredients such as Turmeric oil, Neem, Black Cumin, Tulsi, Frankincense, Myrrh, Mineral Clay!</li>
            <li> great but a little gritty and leaves an odd afer taste and feeling that&#x27;s a little hard to get rid of -</li>
            <li> Although brushing with it is fine, you have to scrub your toothbrush after every use and it still looks awful, so I went back to store-bought toothpaste until I can find something better.  </li>
            <li> The last two weeks of the product were the only time it left any residual product behind, before then, it would rinse right</li>
            <li> I have been using Earthpaste for the past year and really like it but decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> Been using a few weeks now, and have no negative comments.  </li>
            <li> so I tried out a few different kinds (Doterra OnGuard, Himalaya Herbals Neem &amp; Pomegranate, Natural Tooth and Gum Powder w/ Activated Charcoal)</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about this product but feel in love with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would certainly buy the TruthPaste again, but the price makes it a little hard to buy it regularly.</li>
            <li> I will not use commercial toothpaste, too many really bad chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I no longer wake up with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I found that my skin peels on the under side of my tongue and on the inside of my cheeks when I use TruthPaste, which I&#x27;m very sad about because I love everything else about it.</li>
            <li> Would prefer a larger jar over a bunch of small ones...to last a couple of months, maybe.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gritty</li>
            <li> I was a little taken back,</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s necessary to include this in the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> and I could not tell there were any other ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unlike any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My only concern is the small amount per jar.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and feel cleaner than with any other toothpaste I have ever</li>
            <li> The only small downfall to this is the taste</li>
            <li> the end of the jar I started to grow a little tired of the TruthPaste, mostly because the product started to leave little globs of paste behind on my tongue and in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It tastes better than regular toothpaste, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty film or dry feeling in my mouth after I brush.  </li>
            <li> I am not using mine because it&#x27;s like dipping your toothbrush in dark clay.  </li>
            <li> TruthPaste has been rigorously tested for stability and none of our batches have shown any signs of rancidity or degradation.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, TruthPaste is a complex formula with an array of flavors that we all experience differently.</li>
            <li> I previously used a toothpaste from another online provider</li>
            <li> I tried the Himalaya Herbal one when I ran out as it was much less</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little less pricey though</li>
            <li> The price is a little pricey</li>
            <li> is going to have a little bit of a drawback</li>
            <li> was really messy.</li>
            <li> I am a firm beleiver in using Colloidial Silver as a prevention/cure and like the fact that truth paste already has as an ingredient.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and decrease all the chemicals you exposure yourself to everyday.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, this is a winner.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; but was looking for something all natural and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Hard to find fluoride and other additives banished !</li>
            <li> Finally found a toothpaste that actually works, without a bunch of bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> , it has lasted me a few weeks because I only use it at nights to make it last :(</li>
            <li> But the Truthpaste folks are apparently anxious to hear my review...</li>
            <li> it yourself&amp;#34; toothpastes &amp; was not satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I usually get fillings every time I go to the dentist</li>
            <li> it is going to make it hard for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> icky toxins, sugars, flouride.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle difference, but I think this might be milder for his taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such a painful cleaning in my life.</li>
            <li> The information the company provides about their product and the ingredients is jaw dropping to say the least!  </li>
            <li> I take my toothbrushing routine VERY seriously.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it&#x27;s been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It might seem expensive compared to a tube of toothpaste</li>
            <li> it comes w a plastic lid, product is not in contact w lid &amp; plastic lids on glass jars are difficult to avoid!~.  </li>
            <li> It tastes great...feels great....and has Nothing bad, weird or unnatural in it!</li>
            <li> I found TRUTHPASTE about six months ago when I was having a very bad teeth ache.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes AWFUL!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Hard to find fluoride and other additives banished ! It works great too:)</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste you will ever find I love this stuff, stay away from fluoride and use truthpaste.</li>
            <li> My wife has an issue with both Fluoride and any tooth paste that contains Baking Soda. She loves the TruthPaste, the taste and the good job it does with her teeth. She couldn&#x27;t be happier. I am glad we ordered two jars as it took a while to get it delivered.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second jar of TruthPaste.  This is by far the best whitening and cleaning paste i have used.  After 4 uses, twice daily, it really started to whiten my teeth.  I have chewed Copenhagen for 20+  years so my teet were not the whitest by any means.  Definitely worth giving a try if you are interested in getting those teeth whitened naturally.</li>
            <li> I like this product! My mouth/teeth feel healthy and clean after using. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to get away from flouride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Truthpaste is AMAZING!! It makes your mouth feel so fresh and clean..I find it to be the best tasting toothpaste iv ever used as well..I almost wanna eat it!!.It even seems to pull out toxins.I find that i want to brush my teeth for much longer now cause it tastes so good!..My mouth feels better than ever! Thanks Truthpaste!</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about this product but feel in love with it once I used it. Cleans teeth very well and makes mouth feel fresh. I love that it is all natural. I wish it was not so pricey it is going to make it hard for me to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I love love love this paste. Feels so silky and smooth on my teeth and gums. Leaves my mouth fresh and clean. Use twice a day. I keep in refrigerator. Spoon out what I need. Highly recommend. Complements my routine.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I no longer wake up with a dry mouth. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories of mud pies :-)</li>
            <li> Finally found a toothpaste that actually works, without a bunch of bad chemicals. My teeth seriously feel smooth and are whiter than ever.</li>
            <li> TruthPaste is an amazing product, I use it along with oil-pulling. Bentonite clay, essential oils, travel-friendly glass jar, none of those toxic chemicals... highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This tooth paste is amazing! My teeth feel cleaner and whiter and I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks! I will definitely continue to use this product and would recommend this to anyone! The price is a little pricey but I think it is worth it! :)</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Smooth creamy texture. I am still trying to get used to the taste. Seems to clean well. Leaves your mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that Amazon is now carrying the most all Natural Organic Toothpaste brand TRUTHPASTE. This company does not skimp out on the ingredients.  They use the highest quality herbal extracts and minerals. Its safe to practically eat. I run an all natural preschool and we brush our teeth daily in school with TRUTHPASTE ! No Fluoride, No Toxins, No Glycerine!!! The kids love the taste too!  I found TRUTHPASTE about six months ago when I was having a very bad teeth ache. After almost soaking it on my tooth for a half hour it really took the pain away. Its really in the herbal oil formula with ingredients such as Turmeric oil, Neem, Black Cumin, Tulsi, Frankincense, Myrrh, Mineral Clay! Thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you diamond dental systems for creating this amazing TRUTHPASTE. It&#x27;s wonderful to find a product and know it&#x27;s amazing.. Just by reading and knowing all the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Mahalo&lt;br /&gt;Tobey G</li>
            <li> It makes brushing my teeth a joy</li>
            <li> Thank you for such an amazing product! My teeth and mouth have never felt better! I was only in the dental hygienist chair for10 minutes! Goodbye Colgate and Listerine!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations.  It heals the gums and feels so fresh!!&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  Will continue to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, so the jury is still out. But the Truthpaste folks are apparently anxious to hear my review... The main reason I bought this was for the turmeric, because I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s a natural tooth whitener and the homemade turmeric paste I was using was really messy. But I didn&#x27;t read the rest of the ingredients very carefully and when it arrived I was surprised to find that colloidal silver is very high up on the list. I&#x27;m a bit concerned by this because of the FDA warnings about argyria, and (rarer) kidney and neurological problems. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s necessary to include this in the toothpaste. Other than the silver, the formula is amazing... every oil and mineral that is reputed to be beneficial for oral health.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel clean. Not too big on the taste but it&#x27;s not disgusting. Will buy again if it continues to work for me</li>
            <li> Using Truthpaste after oil pulling everyday my oral health has never felt and looked better.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Your whole mouth is left tingly clean.</li>
            <li> I really liked the clean feeling it leaves in my mouth and also knowing it has pure natural ingredients! I wish it was a little less pricey though, it has lasted me a few weeks because I only use it at nights to make it last :(</li>
            <li> I really dug the TruthPaste for the most part.  The first few weeks of using the product my mouth felt great, the taste was a very pleasant wintergreen and I could not tell there were any other ingredients in it. By mouth-feel, he consistency of the paste was extremely smooth. I would be surprised if it wasn&#x27;t just clay, it was that smooth! So you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the jar I started to grow a little tired of the TruthPaste, mostly because the product started to leave little globs of paste behind on my tongue and in my mouth. It was kind of odd because it hadn&#x27;t done that before.  The last two weeks of the product were the only time it left any residual product behind, before then, it would rinse right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly buy the TruthPaste again, but the price makes it a little hard to buy it regularly. It&#x27;s not necessarily the fault of the company, because the ingredients involved in making the product are costly.  Part of me would like to see it in a tube of some kind just so it reduces the risk of contaminating the container with bacteria or other debris.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural toothpastes and cared for none. It blew my mind because they all had really good reviews, tasted so bad though. This toothpaste is different. Tastes and smells delicious. well worth the long wait</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you why I love this stuff. It&#x27;s a little gritty but it feels like it really scrubs my teeth.  So it&#x27;s a yes for me!</li>
            <li> You get used to the different taste but your teeth will feel so super clean after the first use!</li>
            <li> This is great toothpaste.  My teeth are smooth and clean.  It tastes better than regular toothpaste, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty film or dry feeling in my mouth after I brush.  I&#x27;ve tried other toothpaste alternatives, such as tooth soap, and while I liked the others, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The taste is okay… Although I didn&#x27;t love it. But after getting sensitive to some other toothpastes, I figured it was worth a try and it seemed fine, especially with my Sonicare toothbrush. I was feeling pretty confident until my first dentist visit.  Oh dear God. I&#x27;ve never had such a painful cleaning in my life. Apparently it was not doing the job I thought cleaning my teeth, there was tons of tartar buildup above and below the gums. I&#x27;ve gone straight back to a more conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other Natural toothpaste products and so far Truthpaste has been working for me. I am a firm beleiver in using Colloidial Silver as a prevention/cure and like the fact that truth paste already has as an ingredient. I am coming close to the end of my jar and will without doubt be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This makes my mouth feel super clean.  Didn&#x27;t miss the foaming of commercial toothpastes.  It was a great purchase</li>
            <li> I have been using Earthpaste for the past year and really like it but decided to try this one. I really like the taste and it seems to do a better job with cleaning my teeth and leaving my gums feeling good. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is way better than the chemical mess that the regular toothpastes are made from. Do yourself a favor and decrease all the chemicals you exposure yourself to everyday. Update: I went to get my teeth cleaned and hygienist praised me on my teeth, so it works well!</li>
            <li> Good tasting stuff that has one main difference I feel to other toothpastes, it leaves a pleasing, lubricant-type feeling on the teeth. Good job you guys, will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product &amp; will purchase it along with your mouth rinse again.</li>
            <li> I have used many natural toothpastes over the past several years and TruthPaste is the finest of all--My teeth feel amazingly clean, gums feel tight, and breath is really fresh! I am delighted to have this wonderful healthy product and plan to give TruthPaste as gifts as well--Thanks so much for developing it:))</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and it goes a long way, if you have halitosis it really helps a lot</li>
            <li> Hands down the most amazing tooth paste I&#x27;ve ever used.  Nothing has ever left my mouth feeling so clean.  It&#x27;s unlike any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> What a clean feeling. After 2 weeks of use, can say its the best tooth cleaning product to ever use.</li>
            <li> as ohters say it takes a time or 2 to get used to it. mouth feels very clean from brushing ,but rinsing is a bit of a chore. gums look good, no bad breath</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this paste. You have to know that it&#x27;s not like regular toothpaste. That&#x27;s why you are buying it. My teeth are whiter. My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist every time I brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t look that great but it works!  A little goes a long way.  Makes your mouth feel fresh too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using Truth Paste, so I can not speak for long term oral health, however, I can already attest to a very clean result immediately after use!  I love that it comes in a glass jar ~although it comes w a plastic lid, product is not in contact w lid &amp; plastic lids on glass jars are difficult to avoid!~.  I love that they are using organic oil and and clay &amp; turmeric!  I read that they use naturally sourced botanical extracts &amp; herbs for their EO&#x27;s, and use an excellent quality Colloidal Silver.  Love that they have truly done their research to provide the healthiest ingredients for optimal oral health, support fair trade &amp; produce their product responsibly in the USA.  I began the search for a sincerely healthy toothpaste in an effort to rid my home of Sodium Laurel Sulfate (SLS, SLSe), parabens, glycerin (from where it doesn&#x27;t belong!) Flouride, TEA, PEG&#x27;s and other noxious ingredients dubbed &#x27;safe for consumption.&#x27;  I was thrilled when I found this company before even using the product!  Love the ingred&#x27;s list posted atop for us to see &amp; appreciate!  I make my own organic soaps, creating my own recipes &amp; make organic body butters as well as other personal care products.  I was planning to create a toothpaste including clay, oils &amp; bamboo charcoal among other botanicals, but finding TruthPaste gve me a perfect option to improve on my family&#x27;s health!  I like the taste of this more than I anticipated upon opening, considering the topnotes of clove EO, as clove just isn&#x27;t my fave, yet honestly, I am learning to love the taste!  My teeth &amp; tongue feel very clean with each use and I like to make a &amp;#34;mouthwash&amp;#34; after brushing by placing appx 1/2 tsp in my mouth and adding water to freshen my breath &amp; mouth as a whole.  One thing I recommend is to remove TruthPaste from jar with a dry, clean finger or small spoon to avoid adding water to this product as well as avoiding cross contamination of germs from multiple tooth brushes.  Keeping water outis important b/c although this co uses Rosemary EO for it&#x27;s preserving qualities &amp;#60;3, any introduction of water to a product w/o a broadband preservative can become breeding ground for staph, molds, and many other undesirables.  The antibacterial &amp; antiviral qualities of the EO&#x27;s. turmeric &amp; Colloidal Silver will help in the battle, but it&#x27;s best to try to keep water out whenever possible.  I mention this as I am immunodeficient &amp; know there are others who have to be aware.  Hope you enjoy TruthPaste as much as I am!!</li>
            <li> Love it,  love it,  love it!!!! I will never go back to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My teeth feel clean and fresh for hours!</li>
            <li> I will not use commercial toothpaste, too many really bad chemicals.  I&#x27;ve tried my share of tooth powders, oils, etc. but TruthPaste is my heads and above favorite.  I like the texture of it, the flavor is great (I love clove and mint).  Really it is pretty much the perfect toothpaste in my opinion, I have no plans to search again.  It can&#x27;t get any better for me!</li>
            <li> Like the natural ingredients.  Feels kind of like clay.&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent but could have more mint oil.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get out onto tooth brush though.</li>
            <li> For a couple of months I tried several online &amp;#34;do it yourself&amp;#34; toothpastes &amp; was not satisfied.  I found Truthpaste online &amp; decided to give it a try.  Thus far, it&#x27;s next to the the best I&#x27;ve purchased online.  My only concern is the small amount per jar.  Would prefer a larger jar over a bunch of small ones...to last a couple of months, maybe.  Ingredients in the toothpaste are safe with no fluoride and do the job, which is  exactly what I was looking for.  I previously used a toothpaste from another online provider but unfortunately it&#x27;s been discontinued.  Thank you for providing a good product that is safe &amp; works!</li>
            <li> I had been using baking soda as my natural toothpaste.  It was working fine.  But this truthpaste is a step above baking soda for sure.  Makes my teeth feel cleaner and smoother and whiter.  It&#x27;s the consistency of the polishing cream that dentists use often when they are polishing your teeth at the end of a checkup.  That&#x27;s a good thing and I would recommend this to a friend and buy this again.</li>
            <li> I found that my skin peels on the under side of my tongue and on the inside of my cheeks when I use TruthPaste, which I&#x27;m very sad about because I love everything else about it. I think I may have a sensitivity to one or more essential oils. I don&#x27;t mind the smell or taste of it, and I love that it&#x27;s a healthier alternative to name brand toothpastes. My husband has no problem with TruthPaste.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son likes this better than the other natural toothpaste brand that&#x27;s made specifically for kids.  It&#x27;s a subtle difference, but I think this might be milder for his taste.</li>
            <li> Love this!  The flavor is great, my teeth are whiter, and I love that my teeth feel clean all day long (even after eating).</li>
            <li> I have one other brand I liked more, but this is pretty good. Flavor could be improved upon a bit, but it does the job and my teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I am not using mine because it&#x27;s like dipping your toothbrush in dark clay.  Although brushing with it is fine, you have to scrub your toothbrush after every use and it still looks awful, so I went back to store-bought toothpaste until I can find something better.  I used it a week and really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my gums or teeth but a week really is probably not enough time to reap any benefits.  They really need to change the texture so you can rinse it off your brush but as it is, it gets caught in the bristles and you can&#x27;t get it out.</li>
            <li> Amazing toothpaste! I absolutely love it. I would love to see a little spoon or spatula included so you don&#x27;t have to dip your finger or toothbrush in it but as far as the quality, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant feeling after brushing with this paste. A little goes a long way. I probably use 10% of what I normally would use if it were regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Truthpaste......and will order it again!!  My teeth are whiter and feel cleaner than with any other toothpaste I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;It also has a pleasant taste.........thank you so much for this product.  I am VERY satisfied!!  :)</li>
            <li> I usually get fillings every time I go to the dentist or they tell me they&#x27;re watching certain teeth - well this is the first time I&#x27;ve been in over a year and they said I have perfect teeth and that they&#x27;ve never seen my teeth so clean before!! I&#x27;ve never been so satisfied with a product before, I&#x27;m already on my second bottle! The only small downfall to this is the taste initially I&#x27;m of course used to it by now but the first few times I used it I was a little taken back, but like I said now I&#x27;m used to it!</li>
            <li> Love the myrrhy aftertaste!</li>
            <li> Been using a few weeks now, and have no negative comments.  No bad taste, and no residual after effects.  In my humble opinion, this is a winner.</li>
            <li> ingredients you can trust, great taste, mouth and teeth feel super clean and healthy, gums enjoy the nurturing.&lt;br /&gt;no icky toxins, sugars, flouride.</li>
            <li> TruthPaste is good tooth paste.  It works very well against a mild case of gingivitis, keeping it under control.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first to try an all natural toothpaste.  But after the first try my gums and mouth had this fresh feeling that lasted longer than other regular toothpastes.  It might seem expensive compared to a tube of toothpaste but it seems like its lasting a lot longer than my Crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get off of the fluoridated store type toothpastes so I tried out a few different kinds (Doterra OnGuard, Himalaya Herbals Neem &amp; Pomegranate, Natural Tooth and Gum Powder w/ Activated Charcoal) and this one is my favorite.  I started with a tube of the Doterra which cleans well and helped my tooth not be so sensitive, but I&#x27;d read that glycerin blocks mineralization (don&#x27;t know how scientific that claim is) so I thought I&#x27;d try something without it when I ran out.  I got this and the charcoal one (which is kind of messy but whitens nicely).  Once you get used to the lack of foaming and the herbal/clay taste, its not bad.  Cleans well, didn&#x27;t stain my teeth, none of that coated feeling the next morning, sensitivity is pretty much gone and my teeth and gums look healthy.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any tarter buildup at all and what I had is greatly diminished.  Also, its nice to have a toothpaste that is natural and not filled with ingredients that remind me of my college chem classes!  I use the charcoal kind just once every couple of weeks because the powder is kind of messy, but not too bad and whitens a bit.  I tried the Himalaya Herbal one when I ran out as it was much less but it has a few ingredients I&#x27;d rather do without and foams more than I like now that I&#x27;m use to the non-foaming kind.  (If I didn&#x27;t have the $ for this, I&#x27;d go with the DoTerra.)  The lack of a traditional tube doesn&#x27;t bother me, not sharing with anyone so I can just scoop some on with the toothbrush.  Wish it was about half the price, but as I&#x27;m on my second container, I&#x27;d say its worth it---your teeth are worth investing in.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes AWFUL! It&#x27;s super bitter and made me gag. I couldn&#x27;t bear it more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;m upgrading my review from 1 to 3 stars based on the following interaction I had with the company and the fact that I have a gene that makes me more sensitive to certain tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Deidre,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for your feedback on TruthPaste.

            <li> great but a little gritty and leaves an odd afer taste and feeling that&#x27;s a little hard to get rid of - but I expected as much - anything good for you is going to have a little bit of a drawback</li>
            <li> Seem like great ingredients but I do not like this or most natural toothpaste, but I&#x27;m continuing to try the mall until I find one I like</li>
            <li> I love this stuff my teeth feel like new enamel and it taste so fresh and minty.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this &amp;#34;toothpaste&amp;#34; but was looking for something all natural and decided to give it a try. This product is truly amazing!!!! I will never go back to conventional toothpaste. My teeth have never felt cleaner or looked brighter!!!! It&#x27;s Iike getting a cleaning at the dentist every time. All you need is a pea size amount on an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Would buy again.  Love treating my teeth with non toxic ingredients.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Simply a great all natural toothpaste sans fluoride. I&#x27;m a convert already.</li>
            <li> periorub is meant for healing the space between your gums (healthier gums) basically.  It works great as toothpaste</li>
            <li> Loving the smell, flavor, and sensations of this amazing paste! Doesn&#x27;t take much to get that fresh and clean feeling. Also have one of their tongue scrapers, work great together!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothpaste. The ingredients are just wonderful!  Healthy,  natural ingredients that are good for you, and naturally anti-bacterial. Smells pleasant, tastes like a mild mix of mint, cinnamon. No fluoride,  which is GREAT. I feel like I will definitely buy this again The only improvem I could suggest would be how it&#x27;s packaged/dispensed - it comes in a nice little glass jar - but how to conveniently dispense it? I am NOT about to dip my toothbrush in the jar - ewww - so, I have been using disposable plastic butter knives. I&#x27;m going to check and see if it&#x27;s available in a tube. But to reiterate - I do love this product and feel like I am truly cleaning my mouth and teeth naturally!</li>
            <li> Clay-based toothpaste?  I know, it seems strange, but clay draws out impurities and the way they&#x27;ve mixed this product with essential oils, the taste is really yummy!  A little goes a long way.  And it really does freshen breath and clean the surface of your teeth.  It&#x27;s pricey, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;ve used many different brands of natural toothpastes and I thought they all worked really well... until I tried this. My mouth feels so clean after using TruthPaste, and I swear after only a few uses my teeth look whiter! It&#x27;s also helped with some sensitivity I was having in one tooth. It&#x27;s pricey comparatively speaking but worth it. I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> Love it! love it!I just transferred it to a tube!!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this. Didn&#x27;t care for the consistency.  I really think there&#x27;s better tasting natural toothpastes out there.</li>
            <li> couldnt wait until i got it and brushed away love the feeling it taste minty refreshing the only thing my family is missing the foam but will do and will be buying more of this good stuff here.</li>
            <li> Still lovin&#x27; the Truth.</li>
            <li> Very nice texture and wonderful flavor.</li>
            <li> A truly great product! It is the best cleaner for teeth I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;m in my sixties)! Leaves my mouth feeling so clean. My teeth feel like they have been professionally polished, every day. My dental hygienist even noticed a difference, after just using it for 1 week. I am very happy to have found something so good, that it is also fluoride free. Thank you TruthPaste!</li>
            <li> I find that the taste of this, unusual at first, is growing on me. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> Truthpaste is the only truly great toothpaste I have found. It&#x27;s so amazing!! Already noticing my teeth are whiter after about a month&#x27;s use. It tastes great...feels great....and has Nothing bad, weird or unnatural in it! (like so many of the so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes do! Truthpaste is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I take my toothbrushing routine VERY seriously. I have struggled with finding a natural toothpaste that will also maintain a bright white smile. TruthPaste has proven that ALL NATURAL ingredients that are RECOGNIZABLE &amp; SAFE can also significantly WHITEN &amp; DEEP CLEAN. The refreshing peppermint experience is the best way to wake up and also usher me to sleep. Also, as a frequent traveler, the 2oz container is perfect in my carry on! TruthPaste leaves my mouth REFRESHED &amp; GORGEOUSLY clean! :D THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, makes your mouth feel super clean and fresh! Look at the ingredient list, this is a product you can trust. I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste definitely is the truth!!!&lt;br /&gt;Within the first couple of brushing I&#x27;ve noticed the difference in my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention its made of all natural components.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for fluoride free toothpaste for a while now and have tried a few but none have left my mouth as fresh as this product.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! Personally have been using the truthpaste for two weeks!  It has been the most amazing dental product i have found along my healing path!  I have tried many different fluoride free tooth pastes on the market and have never come across any that were able to give me such nutrition!  Seriously it is an amazing product because it takes care of the obvious needs and literally leaves me wanting to brush my teeth again.  I catch my self eating it! I have noticed an overall improvement in my dental health and physical health.  I wake up and start my day with healing, thus leading to a healthy day!  The information the company provides about their product and the ingredients is jaw dropping to say the least!  I can honestly say i have never experienced a healthier dental product!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Natural ingedients and teeth feel super clean.</li>
