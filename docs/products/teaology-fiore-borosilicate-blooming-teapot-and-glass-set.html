            <li>This is actually perfect for me though.</li>
            <li>This tea pot was perfect.</li>
            <li>, the candle doesn&#x27;t stay lit, but I don&#x27;t use that any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s proven itself sturdy and a beautiful tea set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy customer :)</li>
            <li>I love this tea set!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous set and the cups are very unique.</li>
            <li>It does list how many ounces it holds.</li>
            <li>My guests love the set.</li>
            <li>The description states that the package weighs 2 pounds - it doesn&#x27;t even come close to 1 pound at most.</li>
            <li>its quite attractive being clear.</li>
            <li>It arrived as expected and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>My family absolutely love this beautifully unique tea set.</li>
            <li>the quality is good but the main reason i bought this was for the warmer below.</li>
            <li>It appears cheap.</li>
            <li>Really only good for blooming teas, or use an infuser.</li>
            <li>glasses are really cool, and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Very pretty set</li>
            <li>so this one is something fresh.</li>
            <li>I returned it right away, and had to absorb $10 postage.</li>
            <li>Tea very hot, the cup is very convenient, which is not in the hands of hot!</li>
            <li>Its light (in weight), inviting (seeing all the different tea flavours and components floating around) and very pretty (the shape &amp; design being unique..love the handle)..</li>
            <li>This tea pot is very pretty but the original description conveniently left out the dimension or it&#x27;s capacity</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Its so fragile and light.</li>
            <li>and I think that even if it had arrived intact it would not have had much durability</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very angry!!!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>photo looks very elegance and beautiful&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>very cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected but arrived quickly, and is is very pretty!</li>
            <li>From the picture looks great, but it is very, very small, Barely enough to fill the glass set . .</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this little tea pot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the old style tea pot</li>
            <li>It is small, extremely light weight, and fragile.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets in buying this set, it gave us an Alice in Wonderland</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Yes it is small, but the description does tell you that it holds 20 oz of fluid.</li>
            <li> Simply, its waste of $$ getting this one !</li>
            <li> The candle will always burn out due to lack of oxygen and to combat this, I had to place the teapot in slightly slanted (off position)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the handle catches the lid when you pull it off, if you don&#x27;t lift it from the front end first.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t write any reviews on Amazon but am compelled to write this one.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little disappointed that the tea light in the warmer won&#x27;t stay lit.</li>
            <li> this is so small not what i expected.... and the glass is so weak</li>
            <li> This jar is extremely small, unlike advertised here.</li>
            <li> the tea pot and cups are very small.</li>
            <li> Small thin glass.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> One of the cups arrived broken</li>
            <li> The glass on the set is extremely thin</li>
            <li> Product is VERY small!  </li>
            <li> The set arrived in 2 very thin weak boxes and the teapot spout was broken off.</li>
            <li> I might be doing something wrong</li>
            <li> for the material of the teapot set, I concur with the rest of the reviewers that it does feel very thin to the point where I feel like it is going to shatter with the slightest touch.</li>
            <li> Toooooo thin........ Would not even recommend it to my worst enemy..</li>
            <li> Although the warmer base has holes to allow oxygen to flow through, that is not sufficient.</li>
            <li> The worst item Ive ever bought on Amazon.</li>

            <li> My family absolutely love this beautifully unique tea set. Yes it is small, but the description does tell you that it holds 20 oz of fluid. This is actually perfect for me though. I shared 2 pots with my 2 nieces and my sister and by the time all four of us finished two pots, using the glasses that came with it, we were all fighting over the bathroom!! I have no regrets in buying this set, it gave us an Alice in Wonderland feel. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really only good for blooming teas, or use an infuser. Very pretty set but the metal holder was a bit bent for me. Since i mostly only use the pot and cups it&#x27;s not too big of a deal.</li>
            <li> This tea pot is very pretty but the original description conveniently left out the dimension or it&#x27;s capacity the tea pot and cups are very small.</li>
            <li> i like the tea set the quality is good but the main reason i bought this was for the warmer below. as soon as i set the teapot on the warmer the candle goes out.. any solutions?</li>
            <li> this is so small not what i expected.... and the glass is so weak&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t like it .. it&#x27;s seems like toys</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but arrived quickly, and is is very pretty!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but it&#x27;s a bit smaller than I expected. That&#x27;s my fault though. It does list how many ounces it holds. It&#x27;s a gorgeous set and the cups are very unique. My guests love the set. Even the guys. I might be doing something wrong but I&#x27;m a little disappointed that the tea light in the warmer won&#x27;t stay lit. That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> This tea pot will only last for a one time use. Toooooo thin........ Would not even recommend it to my worst enemy.. This tea pot is IZBALA.</li>
            <li> This jar is extremely small, unlike advertised here. Its so fragile and light. Simply, its waste of $$ getting this one !</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Small thin glass. It feels like it would shatter if used. One of the cups arrived broken but as I would never use it I&#x27;m not going to ask for a replacement. The worst item Ive ever bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This set does not, in any way, look as what is advertised on the listing. It is small, extremely light weight, and fragile. The description states that the package weighs 2 pounds - it doesn&#x27;t even come close to 1 pound at most. I returned it right away, and had to absorb $10 postage. NOT recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little tea pot. Its light (in weight), inviting (seeing all the different tea flavours and components floating around) and very pretty (the shape &amp; design being unique..love the handle)..its quite attractive being clear. I&#x27;m used to the old style tea pot so this one is something fresh. Works well! Tnx! Very happy customer :)</li>
            <li> I love this tea set! I got it for Christmas and have used it three times a week since.&lt;br /&gt;The glasses are really cool, and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the handle catches the lid when you pull it off, if you don&#x27;t lift it from the front end first.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the candle doesn&#x27;t stay lit, but I don&#x27;t use that any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s proven itself sturdy and a beautiful tea set.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
            <li> In order for the candle to stay lit you have to lean the pot to one side, will not work as shown. BEWARE</li>
            <li> This tea pot was perfect. It arrived as expected and was in perfect condition. I love it! I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> From the picture looks great, but it is very, very small, Barely enough to fill the glass set . .</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t write any reviews on Amazon but am compelled to write this one. Although the warmer base has holes to allow oxygen to flow through, that is not sufficient. The candle will always burn out due to lack of oxygen and to combat this, I had to place the teapot in slightly slanted (off position) so sufficient oxygen can flow though, and the candle don&#x27;t burn out.&lt;br /&gt;As for the material of the teapot set, I concur with the rest of the reviewers that it does feel very thin to the point where I feel like it is going to shatter with the slightest touch. Buyers BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Yes, I like tea. Tea very hot, the cup is very convenient, which is not in the hands of hot!</li>
            <li> The set arrived in 2 very thin weak boxes and the teapot spout was broken off. The glass on the set is extremely thin and I think that even if it had arrived intact it would not have had much durability</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very angry!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s different between this product and the photo,&lt;br /&gt;The photo looks very elegance and beautiful&lt;br /&gt;But I receive product looks very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s completely different!!!</li>
            <li> Product is VERY small!  It has extremely fragile glass.  It appears cheap. Arrives in a tiny package covered with Chineese writing.</li>
