            <li>I love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>The brush is quite nice, almost like a Lancome brush, and the formula stays on and yet does wash off.</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again honestly.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very glad I ordered it and plan to use it more.</li>
            <li>It also washes off very easily every day in the shower, without any makeup remover needed.  </li>
            <li>It is washable waterproof, so it does come off very easily with soap and water (as not to damage your lashes).  </li>
            <li>Very smooth and even finish and builds on nicely.</li>
            <li>by far the best mascara i have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>and it washes off fairly easily!</li>
            <li>The mascara does not clump up and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was happy to find Remarkable back on the shelves at Target.  </li>
            <li>Does not give them the chunky look like most of the others.</li>
            <li>I love that you can wash off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>Raccoon :)</li>
            <li>This mascara was just ok for me.</li>
            <li>Im in love with my cover girl mascara</li>
            <li>I love this mascara for my bottom lashes because it doesn&#x27;t run.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars, only because in a perfect world I&#x27;d love it to make my lashes appear thicker too</li>
            <li>I have tried many, like most of you.</li>
            <li>The brush is magnificent as it leaves my lashes long and voluminous.</li>
            <li>I do great with all natural mascaras</li>
            <li>So my eyes get irritated easy with mascara</li>
            <li>It does not clump, it layers easily, it does not leave raccoon eyes after hours of use.</li>
            <li>Item arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this exact kind in stores now.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>glides on smoothly and stays on.</li>
            <li>A lot of waterproof mascara is &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; but this go on smoothly and wears well.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and decided to purchase this mascara because it was so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Light dip in the pool?</li>
            <li>So far  so good  </li>
            <li>works pretty well for the price!!</li>
            <li>It is working fine, but I use a lash defining mascara first and top it with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I did as we spent a lot of time in the water</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe that more companies have not jumped onto the bandwagon with a &amp;#34;washable waterproof&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been wearing it daily for when we expect snow, just to be safe and make sure I do not end up with raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>Nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara because it stays on your lashes as needed and then at night it&#x27;s not hard to wash off.</li>
            <li>I went to GENTLY BLOT under my eyes with a tissue and there was mascara all over my tissue!!  </li>
            <li>and I never worrried about my mascara, yet I was able to easily wash it off in the shower with my facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>(a girl can dream, right?).  </li>
            <li>this stuff doesn&#x27;t smudge, and stays on as long as you need it to and then comes off very easily with eye make up remover...</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to my mom, who is very picky about her makeup, and she loves it!</li>
            <li>wash.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to work out without having to wash off my mascara from earlier in the the day beforehand.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it</li>
            <li>Color looks great and last all day long.</li>
            <li>I remembered when I first started trying out makeup, this was the first mascara I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;ll likely repurchase because I&#x27;m that satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Chinese mascara is better.</li>
            <li>Your lashes are thick but not clumpy, it&#x27;s a very nice formula.</li>
            <li>I have been using this mascara for a really long time and it is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run/smudge easily, yet comes off with ease when I wash my face with my regular face</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t totally dunk your head underwater without it washing off, but if you&#x27;re like me and just want to get in the pool to play without dunking your head, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I liked it as well as some of the more expensive kinds.</li>
            <li>Works very well for a cheaper product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even really like this is a God sent.</li>
            <li>My lashes owe much gratitude to CoverGirl.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I really like it, for the price.  </li>
            <li>I liked the last  same CG</li>
            <li>I love how the brush did not clump my eyelashes together like other mascaras.</li>
            <li>The brown is great for everyday and the black is nice for a more dramatic evening look.  </li>
            <li>The waterproof kind is not only like glue on your lashes and very difficult to remove, but it also smears really easy if you have any kind of moisturizer or makeup near your eyes.  </li>
            <li>decent delivery time and quality product</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this 5-star worthy is if it had a curved brush, which is what I prefer.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This mascara is surprisingly long lasting, yet easier than most to wash off.</li>
            <li>Even with applying two coats to both my top and bottom lashes, one bottle usually lasts me 6-9 months and doesn&#x27;t thicken within a few months like most</li>
            <li>new.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always come back to this one, thanks CoverGirl!</li>
            <li>After trying at least 20 different brands/styles/colors of mascara over the past 10-15 years (worked at a drug store in high school), this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My old mascara used to leave mascara on my eyelids every time I wore it.  </li>
            <li>It was waterproof enough, but it doesn&#x27;t get my lashes near as full or long in appearance as another</li>
            <li>I was seeking a quality mascara last minute to ship along with some other products I ordered this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It clumps sometimes, but as long as you are careful when you apply it, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It really lengthens your lashes and makes them appear full and thick, it does not smear off, and I have never had irritated eyes from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stays on a long time, made my lashes full and long!</li>
            <li>It stays on through normal daily activities, but washes off with soap at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>have used CoverGirl Professional waterproof mascara in the BLUE tube for years and it IS waterproof!  </li>
            <li>my lashes are thin and they look better when I use it</li>
            <li>and yes, it did wash off easily since there was hardly any left</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the CoverGirl Professional waterproof formula in the BLUE tube because it does what it says it will!</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this covergirl mascara UNLESS you are going in water, it definitely runs and turns  all under your eyes black</li>
            <li> Mascara is waterproof, very black, lasts the whole day and does not flake</li>
            <li> at which point it comes off with my normal facial cleanser - no special eye makeup remover required.  </li>
            <li> The free gift was a piece of bubble gum, which was whimsical....</li>
            <li> At 27, that is not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; waterproof aspect is exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes already</li>
            <li> Makes them look LONG and NATURA.  </li>
            <li> The mascara was not sealed but open with a staple holding it closed.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t go on too wet, so there&#x27;s no drying time necessary.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, but does clump a bit.</li>
            <li> I have used several other brands and types.  </li>
            <li> This mascara went on dry and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> you have to mix them with a little salene to get them back to  </li>
            <li> I have already bought a few extra tubes for friends to try and added it to my subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Get wet wearing this, and you&#x27;ll have raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> It does lengthen them and provide minimal volume</li>
            <li> I hate full waterproof mascara because it&#x27;s so hard to get off, but regular mascara smudges and runs too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy makeup user, but I wear at least mascara 6 days a week on average.</li>
            <li> Crazy but true.</li>
            <li> It goes on very dark and makes your eyelashes look very long.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to the Avon washable waterproof mascara -- neither are truly waterproof, as to be expected since they are washable, but the CoverGirl goes on rather thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li> Other brands that I tried just seemed to slide off of my lashes - the mascara would not adhere, and I&#x27;d have black smear marks under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought and immediately thrown away four different brands of mascara lately.</li>
            <li> it also goes on thick and requires only 1 coat.</li>
            <li> Not exactly waterproof!</li>
            <li> and I do not have to continually wipe under my eyes like i used to with my previous mascara.</li>
            <li> Very black is truly black and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; but does build on itself.  </li>
            <li> I got upset and started crying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, even wildly expensive ones, and I ALWAYS come back.</li>
            <li> In addition I like the small mascara brush....</li>
            <li> Not sure if the mascara is used?  </li>
            <li> My eyes watered just a bit and this mascara ran terribly and caused burning which caused more tears.  </li>
            <li> Clumpy and small amount for the price</li>
            <li> Hard thing to find...</li>
            <li> Some of the mascaras were waterproof, but very thick and clumpy, and I could not get the product off with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes, so I always bought waterproof, but hate taking it off, usually along with a few eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Very thick, but not gloppy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, I believe Cover Girl changed the packaging, and for some reason I was unable to find it for about a month, or two.  </li>
            <li> It drove me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Then it got into my eyes and stung like crazy!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all too &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; and make my eyelashes look disgusting.</li>
            <li> and this is the worst mascara ever!  </li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This mascara is hands-down the best for anyone who wears contacts, or who wears any kind of eye cream.  It never smears or runs, and it never irritates my eyes.  On top of that, it looks great.  A couple of times I bought water-proof mascara because I knew I&#x27;d be in the pool splashing around.  The waterproof kind is not only like glue on your lashes and very difficult to remove, but it also smears really easy if you have any kind of moisturizer or makeup near your eyes.  It drove me crazy.  This mascara never ever smudges under your eyes.  You can&#x27;t totally dunk your head underwater without it washing off, but if you&#x27;re like me and just want to get in the pool to play without dunking your head, it works fine.  It also washes off very easily every day in the shower, without any makeup remover needed.  I think it&#x27;s the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> The brush is quite nice, almost like a Lancome brush, and the formula stays on and yet does wash off. Crazy but true. I have only used it once or twice but I&#x27;m very glad I ordered it and plan to use it more. Your lashes are thick but not clumpy, it&#x27;s a very nice formula.</li>
            <li> by far the best mascara i have ever purchased. it stays on all day and I do not have to continually wipe under my eyes like i used to with my previous mascara. it also goes on thick and requires only 1 coat.</li>
            <li> this stuff actually does what it says. glides on smoothly and stays on. I have a bad habit of rubbing my eyes, so I always bought waterproof, but hate taking it off, usually along with a few eyelashes. this stuff doesn&#x27;t smudge, and stays on as long as you need it to and then comes off very easily with eye make up remover...(I don&#x27;t use soap on my eyes.) I have recommended this to my mom, who is very picky about her makeup, and she loves it! it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it stays on your lashes as needed and then at night it&#x27;s not hard to wash off. I use baby oil to remove it which removes all traces of the mascara.</li>
            <li> Works very well for a cheaper product. I liked it as well as some of the more expensive kinds. It does allow you to build your lashes well, but you have to remember to wash it off every night or you may have issues with breakage, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Love the product that is why I bought it when I saw it!  The free gift was a piece of bubble gum, which was whimsical....the shipping was the cost of the product....</li>
            <li> So my eyes get irritated easy with mascara but this one does not irritate my eyes.  I do great with all natural mascaras but they always smear:( This one doesn&#x27;t smear of flake and it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. works pretty well for the price!!</li>
            <li> Excellent price at the time I purchased! This mascara is surprisingly long lasting, yet easier than most to wash off.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to the Avon washable waterproof mascara -- neither are truly waterproof, as to be expected since they are washable, but the CoverGirl goes on rather thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li> It  is waterproof which is a plus.  In addition I like the small mascara brush....it makes it a lot easier to put mascara on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I am 35 and have been looking for a mascara like this since I have been using makeup!!! It does not clump, it layers easily, it does not leave raccoon eyes after hours of use. and it washes off fairly easily! I have already bought a few extra tubes for friends to try and added it to my subscribe and save. After years of spending $25 on a tube of mascara I didn&#x27;t even really like this is a God sent. Thank you Cover girl don&#x27;t EVER stop making this</li>
            <li> My old mascara used to leave mascara on my eyelids every time I wore it.  I always thought it was because I had deep set eyes and curly lashes.  Turns out it was just the quality of the mascara.  I tried this one based on the ratings and haven&#x27;t had that problem since</li>
            <li> I only wear this mascara.  it works best for me. my lashes are thin and they look better when I use it</li>
            <li> A lot of waterproof mascara is &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; but this go on smoothly and wears well.  I plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love how the brush did not clump my eyelashes together like other mascaras. It also did not smudge during the day!</li>
            <li> Very black is truly black and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; but does build on itself.  I&#x27;ve tried to stray to more expensive mascara but I&#x27;ve always come back to this one, thanks CoverGirl!</li>
            <li> I was not a believer that waterproof could be washable but I love this stuff!!!!  So glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to purchase this mascara because it was so cheap.  I have long eyelashes already so I&#x27;m not looking for anything that promises &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve found that those products clump easilly and build up you have to mix them with a little salene to get them back to  new.  I have no complaints about this product, it goes on flawless and the brush seperates my lashes with no clumping or fuss.</li>
            <li> After trying at least 20 different brands/styles/colors of mascara over the past 10-15 years (worked at a drug store in high school), this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve tried. I have always used waterproof mascara, as non-waterproof and contacts just don&#x27;t mesh. I&#x27;ve also always been prone to mascara running and creating creases under my eyes, even waterproof. At 27, that is not a good look.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34; waterproof aspect is exactly as stated. It doesn&#x27;t run/smudge easily, yet comes off with ease when I wash my face with my regular face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been able to work out without having to wash off my mascara from earlier in the the day beforehand. I don&#x27;t get worried if it&#x27;s going to smear/run if it starts raining while I&#x27;m at the dog park, and I&#x27;ve even gone to the beach with it already on and didn&#x27;t regret forgetting to take my makeup off beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it lasts. I&#x27;m not a heavy makeup user, but I wear at least mascara 6 days a week on average. Even with applying two coats to both my top and bottom lashes, one bottle usually lasts me 6-9 months and doesn&#x27;t thicken within a few months like most formulas.&lt;br /&gt;This has become a staple in my makeup kit, and doesn&#x27;t look to be leaving anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I have used several other brands and types.  Have found this to be the best of all.  One coat covers the lashes.  Makes them look LONG and NATURA.  Does not give them the chunky look like most of the others.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, even wildly expensive ones, and I ALWAYS come back. My lashes owe much gratitude to CoverGirl.</li>
            <li> Used to be a faithful L&#x27;oreal user for years till I tried this . It&#x27;s the best no clump no smear mascara ever!</li>
            <li> This mascara went on dry and clumpy.  It also did not wash off well and I had raccoon eyes at the end of the day!  I now use million lashes waterproof mascara which stays put, and the only cleanser I&#x27;ve found to remove it. Dhc olive oil deep cleaning face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have bought and immediately thrown away four different brands of mascara lately. They&#x27;re all too &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; and make my eyelashes look disgusting. This CoverGirl mascara is perfect. It gives me the results I want without having to try and remove giant clumps after application.</li>
            <li> I love that you can wash off with soap and water.  I always wash my face with oil of olay so no need to scrub your eyes with makeup remover!</li>
            <li> Great product! Stays on a long time, made my lashes full and long! Would buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t do anything at all for my eyelashes. It may work well for others, but didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> Not exactly waterproof! Tearing up at a commercial? You&#x27;ll be fine. Humidity or sweat? Light dip in the pool? Raccoon :)</li>
            <li> Good mascara...happy with this purchase I would  buy this again.I shop on Amazon for everything and think they are great!</li>
            <li> This mascara was just ok for me. It didn&#x27;t flake. It was waterproof enough, but it doesn&#x27;t get my lashes near as full or long in appearance as another I use so I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that CoverGirl would make the claims that it does for the performance of this mascara!  They couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth!  I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl mascaras ever since I started wearing makeup (35+ years) and this is the worst mascara ever!  I was drawn in because it said it was &amp;#34;washable&amp;#34;.  I thought that it would just be easier to remove but still be waterproof.  Not even close!  The first day I wore it I had a doctor appointment.  I got upset and started crying.  I went to GENTLY BLOT under my eyes with a tissue and there was mascara all over my tissue!!  Then it got into my eyes and stung like crazy!  By the time my appointment was over, the majority of the mascara was on the tissue and my eyes were extremely red and irritated from the mascara!  I got home and yes, it did wash off easily since there was hardly any left and I didn&#x27;t need any makeup remover which means it is NOT waterproof!  If you want something waterproof, don&#x27;t even touch this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used CoverGirl Professional waterproof mascara in the BLUE tube for years and it IS waterproof!  It does take longer to remove than regular mascara since it is a waterproof formula which I will take any day over this stuff that claims to be waterproof but is definitely not!  &amp;#34;Remarkable Washable&amp;#34;???  What a joke!  I&#x27;m going back to the CoverGirl Professional waterproof formula in the BLUE tube because it does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> Burns and tears up my eyes.  Didn&#x27;t like this at all</li>
            <li> Item arrived very quickly. The mascara does not clump up and goes on very smoothly. Color looks great and last all day long. For the price can not be beat. I would buy again.The brush makes for easy application and make eye lashes look great!!</li>
            <li> I have tried all sort of mascaras, expensive and inexpensive alike, but this is my favorite. It goes on very dark and makes your eyelashes look very long. I would highly recommend this covergirl mascara UNLESS you are going in water, it definitely runs and turns  all under your eyes black, you NEED eye make up remover to get it off, otherwise THE BEST Mascara ever.</li>
            <li> I remembered when I first started trying out makeup, this was the first mascara I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ve always loved it. It works great and marvelously.</li>
            <li> It clumps sometimes, but as long as you are careful when you apply it, it&#x27;s fine. It lasts all day and then some. I can go swimming with this on.</li>
            <li> decent delivery time and quality product ty ...I was seeking a quality mascara last minute to ship along with some other products I ordered this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Im in love with my cover girl mascara</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I love this mascara. The brush is magnificent as it leaves my lashes long and voluminous. 100% recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just received this mascara in the mail.  My package appears to have foundation or something like it on the outside.  The mascara was not sealed but open with a staple holding it closed. Not sure if the mascara is used?  Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  I doesn&#x27;t smear or run, even if my eyes water.  Basically it doesn&#x27;t come off until I wash my face, at which point it comes off with my normal facial cleanser - no special eye makeup remover required.  I like that it comes in two colors. The brown is great for everyday and the black is nice for a more dramatic evening look.  I really can&#x27;t believe that more companies have not jumped onto the bandwagon with a &amp;#34;washable waterproof&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara for my bottom lashes because it doesn&#x27;t run.  I can&#x27;t find this exact kind in stores now.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  Not waterproof at all.  Get wet wearing this, and you&#x27;ll have raccoon eyes.  I will never use this again.</li>
            <li> So far  so good  I liked the last  same CG I had  used up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a tropical vacation my husband and I were going on.  I&#x27;m happy I did as we spent a lot of time in the water and I never worrried about my mascara, yet I was able to easily wash it off in the shower with my facial cleanser.  I gave it 4 stars, only because in a perfect world I&#x27;d love it to make my lashes appear thicker too (a girl can dream, right?).  It does lengthen them and provide minimal volume and I am very happy with my purchase.  I&#x27;ve even been wearing it daily for when we expect snow, just to be safe and make sure I do not end up with raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Great, waterproof mascara that won&#x27;t clump and doesn&#x27;t contain fibers.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t go on too wet, so there&#x27;s no drying time necessary.  The only thing that would make this 5-star worthy is if it had a curved brush, which is what I prefer.  That being said, I&#x27;ll likely repurchase because I&#x27;m that satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I really like it, for the price.  I have tried many, like most of you. I would get it again.</li>
            <li> Ths is a great mascara! Very thick, but not gloppy! I would buy this mascara again! Makes your lashes pop!</li>
            <li> I have always loved covergirl and this is no exception. Mascara is waterproof, very black, lasts the whole day and does not flake</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear on oily skin.  Hard thing to find...</li>
            <li> My eyes watered just a bit and this mascara ran terribly and caused burning which caused more tears.  Not water proof or even water resistant. As a regular mascara, just run of the mill.</li>
            <li> Waterproof but not to the point where you can&#x27;t wash it off. Holds up all day. Very smooth and even finish and builds on nicely. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary. Lasts a long time, but does clump a bit. Though I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again honestly.</li>
            <li> Very low quality mascara. Cheap-o Chinese mascara is better. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Clumpy and small amount for the price</li>
            <li> Great mascara but it tends to smudge.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for a really long time and it is my favorite mascara.  It is washable waterproof, so it does come off very easily with soap and water (as not to damage your lashes).  It really lengthens your lashes and makes them appear full and thick, it does not smear off, and I have never had irritated eyes from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I believe Cover Girl changed the packaging, and for some reason I was unable to find it for about a month, or two.  I had to try different brands of mascara - and I did not like any of them.  Some of the mascaras were waterproof, but very thick and clumpy, and I could not get the product off with soap and water.  Other brands that I tried just seemed to slide off of my lashes - the mascara would not adhere, and I&#x27;d have black smear marks under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find Remarkable back on the shelves at Target.  I hope Cover Girl never discontinues this product!</li>
            <li> I had looked in stores and not found this.  It is working fine, but I use a lash defining mascara first and top it with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for years and it&#x27;s great. I hate full waterproof mascara because it&#x27;s so hard to get off, but regular mascara smudges and runs too much. This is a happy medium. It stays on through normal daily activities, but washes off with soap at the end of the day.</li>
