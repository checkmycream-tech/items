            <li>The dryer is so light-</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair so its not too hot</li>
            <li>an am glad I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Great blow dryer minus the fact that the nozel keeps moving around.</li>
            <li>Cool button stopped working with in one week.</li>
            <li>Hair dryer was nice but did not seem very hot and not like the old T3 that I have had for years.</li>
            <li>It is light enough and as per some reviews does not get really hot, but I assume this is a good thing as it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.</li>
            <li>Not exactly featherweight, but a great dryer.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Unbelievably light and dries hair fast!</li>
            <li>It is light and dries your hair fast!</li>
            <li>Was great for one and a half months and then, stopped working.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is impeccable and leave my hair smooth and less frizzy from blow drying or retouches!  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the investment</li>
            <li>I always love my blowout after the salon but can never get the same results home even using salon products in my hair.</li>
            <li>I guess I need to use this several more times before I judge.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about buying this drier because I didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference, but it really does.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in weight but love the other functions of the dryer.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the heat switch is directly under my hand and easy to change without realizing it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li>will try a few more times and update review.</li>
            <li>The first time my daughter used this one had doubts because she thought that not too much hot air was coming out of the new blower, but then she came to my room and said “mom, it dry faster and the hair does not look frizzy”.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair very quickly and helps to cut down on the frizz.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 60 years old!</li>
            <li>I feel that this does not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>With this new T3 I can use on high while I get excess wetness out, so much quicker than my last dryer.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and with minimal frizz.</li>
            <li>Never used a professional blow dryer before</li>
            <li>I replaced my second Chi hairdryer with T3 Featherweight Ver 2, highly recommended by my hair stylist of 18 years!  </li>
            <li>but feels gentle on the scalp if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li>the cool button is not cool air ,</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, smoother but doesn&#x27;t dry faster really.  </li>
            <li>Very light and drys in half the time as previous dryers.</li>
            <li>Made with high quality materials, will last a long time.</li>

            <li> I have thick hair, color treated and highlighted and it can be frizzy.  Never used a professional blow dryer before but I needed to do something!  I always love my blowout after the salon but can never get the same results home even using salon products in my hair. This dryer is amazing. Frizz and dry time down by half at least. It is light enough and as per some reviews does not get really hot, but I assume this is a good thing as it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Worth the $$! Drying time cut in half, less frizz, and less damage from heat. Don&#x27;t have to use straightener 1/2 time bc invested in such a great dryer!!</li>
            <li> Dries my thick hair in record time! Not exactly a quiet hairdryer but quieter than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> Expensive and nothing lightweight about it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife and quit working after 3 months and of course not eligible for return past 20 days</li>
            <li> After weeks of research and reading online reviews, I decided to purchase this blow dryer. By far this is the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I have very fine hair so its not too hot and I have much less frizz and my hair looks and feels healthier.  It&#x27;s very light weight just as it claims to be. Totally worth the investment an am glad I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> Shipped item faster than dated. Love it!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, works as advertised. My wife and I are very happy with this product and service.</li>
            <li> I guess I need to use this several more times before I judge.  I have thick slightly wavy hair and it takes forever to dry.  I didn&#x27;t notice any time reduction. (previously had a Conair Infiniti).  the cool button is not cool air , rather warm.&lt;br /&gt;I will try a few more times and update review.</li>
            <li> Was great for one and a half months and then, stopped working.</li>
            <li> I replaced my second Chi hairdryer with T3 Featherweight Ver 2, highly recommended by my hair stylist of 18 years!  This hair dryer is impeccable and leave my hair smooth and less frizzy from blow drying or retouches!  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!  From order to delivery, this company met all my expectations, my T3 arrived in pristine condition.  Highly recommend the T3 and this firm!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, smoother but doesn&#x27;t dry faster really.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this blow dryer! Lightweight and does everything it says it will! My hair is silkier now!</li>
            <li> Not exactly featherweight, but a great dryer. Made with high quality materials, will last a long time. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is that the heat switch is directly under my hand and easy to change without realizing it. A small design flaw. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about buying this drier because I didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference, but it really does. 1/2 the blowout time and no flyaways. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and with minimal frizz. The cord is heavy and extra long throwing the balance of the dryer off.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this dryer. Very light and drys in half the time as previous dryers.</li>
            <li> The air power could be a bit stronger</li>
            <li> Unbelievably light and dries hair fast!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. It is light and dries your hair fast!</li>
            <li> This dryer makes me so very happy! I have long blond hair that is on the oily side. Thus I wash and blow dry my hair just about every day. If I don&#x27;t go slow my hair ends up fuzzy. With this new T3 I can use on high while I get excess wetness out, so much quicker than my last dryer. Then I lower the air speed to finish up. This dryer has cut my dry time in half!! PLUS with this dryer your hair does not get the fuzzies. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The dryer is so light- I have wavy fizzy hair and it has cut my styling time in half. A must have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and dries my hair quickly. Love it.</li>
            <li> NOT featherweight. End of story.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic blow dryer at an excellent price. I purchased one 10 years ago and paid $250. It is very lightweight and cuts the dry time in half. I have very thick curly hair and this dryer give me the smoothest blow out of any dryer I have ever used. The product arrived extremely from the seller. I highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! This is the best blower I had ever bought. I have a 3000w one that I just threw it away. The first time my daughter used this one had doubts because she thought that not too much hot air was coming out of the new blower, but then she came to my room and said “mom, it dry faster and the hair does not look frizzy”. What used to take me 1 ½ hour to do my daughter’s hair, now is done in less than 30 minutes and hair looks shiny as ever and no need to used finishing products to avoid frizzing.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. Easy to use and light weight, I especially love the feature with the button for cool air to set your hair in place. Faster and quicker drying process but feels gentle on the scalp if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> Previously owned this item. Purchased it again as it works great.</li>
            <li> The T3 is the best hairdryer I own.  I bought one for my daughter several months ago and just bought another one for my second daughter.  We now all own one and we love how it dries your hair quickly, smoothly and leaves hair with a great shine,</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer and great price</li>
            <li> Hair dryer was nice but did not seem very hot and not like the old T3 that I have had for years. I was very disappointed that I had to pay a lot for return shipping when I decided not to keep it. I had not had that problem previously from Amazon. After reading reviews I was also concerned about it&#x27;s reliability.</li>
            <li> Ok. Still working on it. It seems like faster dry my hair and feel my hair not to dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair very quickly and helps to cut down on the frizz.  This is my second T3 dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use earplugs anymore!</li>
            <li> This is my third T3 hair dryer. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in weight but love the other functions of the dryer.</li>
            <li> Cool button stopped working with in one week.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hairdryer and $100 cheaper than thru Ulta!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleek design, lightweight, great speed selection, and temp control.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described works great and is lightweight!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is amazing!! The best choice for sleek, smooth and sexy hair.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing hair dryer!  it made my hair full and healthier!</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I have ever bought and I&#x27;m 60 years old! I have shoulder length hair that can have frizz and now my hair is gorgeous, shiny and I love it! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Product is as perfect as it appeared in the product description.  Seemingly completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Best dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. Doesn&#x27;t burn or damage hair.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer minus the fact that the nozel keeps moving around.</li>
            <li> I feel that this does not get hot enough.  When&#x27;d doing long haired clients it takes a bit longer to dry.</li>
