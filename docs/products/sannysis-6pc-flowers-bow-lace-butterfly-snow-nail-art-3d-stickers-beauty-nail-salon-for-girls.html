            <li>Make sure you put clear coat on top of sticker to last longer.</li>
            <li>There are so many different fun designs and themes you can create with these.</li>
            <li>I like it very much and got it on time</li>
            <li>Most of them are white.</li>
            <li>They look really cute with sheer or nude nail polish.</li>

            <li>This looks cute on my nails and on my little girl too.</li>
            <li>After I complete my manicure, and remove the tacky residue, I placed the decal that is desired on my finger, then use ANOTHER top coat of the gel manicure, set it, cure it, under the light and it the decals last at least 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Nice n thin, most have slight sparkle to them.</li>
            <li>These came early!</li>
            <li>I am not a flashy type person, so I generally only apply to the ring finger of each hand, instead of every nail.  </li>
            <li>i use tweezers to apply them so it does not loose the stickiness.</li>

            <li> but they are smaller than a lot of other products.  </li>

            <li> Wanted what was picture (laces &amp; bows), but received stickers of mustaches, cartoon pigs, and a bunch of other things.</li>
            <li> A few are black, and some are pink.</li>
            <li> A few broke when I tried to peel them off.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the variety and assortment you receive; especially at the cost!  </li>
            <li> These are really small.  </li>
            <li> The stickers are so thick and they look chalky.  </li>
            <li> They are 3d but very small.  </li>
            <li> The quality was poor.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Buy a lot of these for stocking up on all of the teen birthday presents you&#x27;ll have to get.  They take a while to get here, but the teens like them.</li>
            <li> I love it, will be buying more.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stick on for long and are kinda rubbery feeling but not bad!</li>
            <li> Not enough color variety.</li>
            <li> these are so cool and beautiful, i received way more than i asked for!!!</li>
            <li> Quality is good, but the design doesn&#x27;t look as good as the one showing on photo.  For the price I am paying, I think I will go with other seller.</li>
            <li> These are great. You can make the simplest to a more intriquet design.&lt;br /&gt;Love them and will buy more when I get the chance.</li>
            <li> These came early! Which is awesome! I got just what I ordered 6 sheets bows, crosses and crowns, butterfly&#x27;s, misc flowers, hearts and snow flakes, pink and white bows. Also had a cute thank you type business card. Have not applied as of yet but I did get what I ordered before est arrival date.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, cute designs. The bows don&#x27;t look that good but the rest are cute.Make sure you put clear coat on top of sticker to last longer.</li>
            <li> So cute and attractive  .after  bought this my friends they too want too buy😊</li>
            <li> I liked the product. It was cheap and exactly as described. 6 packages and each one is different. No problem with delivery.</li>
            <li> I got these nail stickers at an incredible deal. Most of them are white. A few are black, and some are pink. They look really cute with sheer or nude nail polish. I plan on using them when my nail polish starts to chip (as a coverup to make it last longer.)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the variety and assortment you receive; especially at the cost!  This is a no &amp;#34;brainer&amp;#34; and a winning product for me.  I even choose to cut down the  larger designs with cuticle scissors.  I am not a flashy type person, so I generally only apply to the ring finger of each hand, instead of every nail.  I am looking forward to sharing with my daughter and grand daughter for  their Easter manicures.  The larger designs will also look great on toes. If you pair them with a tiny rhinestone, compliments will always be coming your way.  I use these with Red Carpet Gel Nail System.  After I complete my manicure, and remove the tacky residue, I placed the decal that is desired on my finger, then use ANOTHER top coat of the gel manicure, set it, cure it, under the light and it the decals last at least 2 weeks.  Don&#x27;t forget to remove the tacky residue after completing your final steps.  This would also work with regular polishes, I would just be sure to apply 2 separate applications of top coat/sealer. over the decals.</li>
            <li> Bought these on a whim, and I&#x27;m glad I did! The stickers are super cute and really nice quality, even if there are a few that I don&#x27;t absolutely love. Easy to use and you can&#x27;t even tell that they&#x27;re stickers once they&#x27;re on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(These would also make really great stocking stuffers!)</li>
            <li> I love these. They are wonderful for the price and the quality is awesome. Perfect for a great look in between nail salon visits. Love love love... easy to use at home or professional.</li>
            <li> these are very nice, thank you.</li>
            <li> Good value for your money.  A few broke when I tried to peel them off. I didn&#x27;t really get too upset since I didn&#x27;t spend too much.</li>
            <li> Multiple options for the artist in you.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Son excelentes y bellos</li>
            <li> The items I received matched what was shown and described. There were no duplicates received either. Very pretty designs!</li>
            <li> Received stickes totally different than the ones shown!</li>
            <li> use them and get complaments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this item. They are so cute, and super easy to use. I personally would suggest using needle nose tweezers to remove them from the plastic sheet and also for applying them to your nails. There are so many different fun designs and themes you can create with these.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stick properly and are hard to get of the film, they only lasted for about 2 days, I will never buy again</li>
            <li> I like it very much and got it on time</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be so cute! Lol I only ordered them for the bow/love sheet but I absolutely love them! And they came 10 days before they were supposed to :)</li>
            <li> I love the stickers they&#x27;re so pretty! I recommend this seller 100% go ahead and purchase some its worth the buy!!</li>
            <li> Wanted what was picture (laces &amp; bows), but received stickers of mustaches, cartoon pigs, and a bunch of other things. I&#x27;ll still use it for my 11yr old daughter, but I wanted this to be more for me.</li>
            <li> Lots of variety, lots of beautiful stickers, many of which are pretty small, but still nice.</li>
            <li> This looks cute on my nails and on my little girl too.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good quality, but (in my opinion) only half the designs were decent.  It&#x27;s still a great deal.</li>
            <li> This did not stand up to any expectation I had.  The quality was poor. The stickers are so thick and they look chalky.  I allow my daughter to use them to play just not to throw them out</li>
            <li> Very cute. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very useful/./love each one...its worth it</li>
            <li> They arrived on time &amp; used them right away. They do stay on if you put a top coat polish on. I&#x27;m totally going to order more.</li>
            <li> These are great. For some reason they came delivered by registered mail. That&#x27;s a pain.</li>
            <li> thank you they are very cute. My daughters love them. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this nail art I got a lot of compliments on it when I had them on for easter&lt;br /&gt;looking forward to getting more</li>
            <li> They are just as described. They can be applied easily and last the length of the manicue. Good deal.</li>
            <li> Love all the design...would buy again from them...</li>
            <li> Really fun variety...</li>

            <li> Took a very long time to receive but the was alot of different designs to choose from. I love using the different designs everytime I paint my nails!!!</li>
            <li> These stickers aren&#x27;t good quality I have to go through 10 of them just so I can actually get one intact!</li>
            <li> these stickers stick very well on the nail. came with instructions and very well packed. i use tweezers to apply them so it does not loose the stickiness. the designs are very pretty and will definitely buy them again when i run out of it. it even got delivered on time</li>
            <li> These are &amp;#34;BEAUTIFUL&amp;#34;, user friendly and LAST FOREVER. I VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND; -}</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Look great!</li>
            <li> These are very cute. Nice n thin, most have slight sparkle to them. I got the 6 shown on bottom picture..lacey flowers, pink bows, crowns n crosses, love sheet w/white bows, butterflys n my fav Snowflakes. I too used with gel nail top coat n stayed til I removed. VERY HAPPY! Def worth money! I may order again to fill a few manicures full like in picture :) FUN !! Oh AND I got them in 20 days, still was another 7 to 20 days on eta for delivery!</li>
            <li> really nice and they go on easily and last even with out being coated!</li>
            <li> Great product; on time shipping.  Recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I use these all the time. Whoever came up with this idea is a genius!</li>
            <li> These are really small.  I have not tried them yet but they are smaller than a lot of other products.  They are 3d but very small.  I will hold judgement until I have a chance to try them.</li>
