            <li>love this stuff its amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is great when u first apply ...after the scent settles it smells off...</li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>I really love the ingredients-</li>
            <li>I get better definition from leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great twist out and defined curls.</li>
            <li>My favorite product for twist outs/braid outs</li>
            <li>I have 4B curls and love using this for a twist out.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it could be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>If you love moisture without buildup, you will love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use my oil mix of avocado oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, vitamin e, rosemary and clary sage oil underneath this (for hair growth) and then put this on top and braid up.</li>
            <li>etc... I sincerely hope she doesn&#x27;t stop making this.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and works keeps my hair moisturized</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>It has given my twist outs more definition with a boost of added moisture plus shine.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>however it elongates and shea moisture causes more shrinkage.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with the condition that it arrived in.  </li>
            <li>I just use shea butter and flaxseed to twist my hair which is more affordable.</li>
            <li>Its even better when I use it with carols daughters loc butter.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most moisturizing hair creams I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>I have 4b hair and my coils and kinks love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product, my curls really came out nice!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff works well and smells like sweet almonds!</li>
            <li>Great product I only gave it 4 stars because it can be slightly more moisturzing</li>
            <li>My first time using this product on my 4c Mane and I am loving the texture of my hair already...</li>
            <li>arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>While maintaining a style is important to me, health and moisture reigns on my list of hair needs.</li>
            <li>and it was frizz free with Cantu.</li>
            <li>NO COMBING, but lightly finger detangle.</li>
            <li>I still prefer braid outs as I find they give more definition in general, but with this product they are amazing.</li>
            <li>Because my hair easily matts and tangles, in the evening I applied my favorite hair milk and twist/braid large sections at night.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it !</li>
            <li>So far my second day hair in 60% humidity is holding great!</li>
            <li>I also mixed this along with Camille Rose Curl Maker for a more defined twist out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a paste-butter that somehow gives as much definition and shine as a gel without the hardness and drying effect of a gel.</li>
            <li>I love her whole line</li>
            <li>Out of all of the products that I have tried, this one is the best, hands down!!!</li>
            <li>The old ingredients which I like best are as follows: almond milk, distilled water, aloe vera leaf juice, BTMS, almond oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, brazil nut oil, amla oil, pumpkin seed oil, macadamia nut oil, baobab oil, honey, manketti oil, nettle, algae, L-cystine, xanthum gum, optiphen, fragrance.*********The new ingredients on my new jar are as follows:</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product so much that I&#x27;m about to place my second order ahead of time.  </li>
            <li>Great smell very moisturizing, especially compared to the Curl Milk.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that my hair actually kept its hold with this product!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it with other Camille Rose products it does not mix well with anything else.</li>
            <li>I compared it to the Cantu twist and lock shea butter gel and by far the Cantu held a twist out a ton better.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it leaves my feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it because of the texture, but it melted right in my hands and in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used this for a twist out (with no leave in underneath it) for the first time today.</li>
            <li>It absorbs FAST!</li>
            <li>My curls are more defined and last longer.</li>
            <li>will be back with more update.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it and looked at the twisting butter</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft !!</li>
            <li>The next morning I have a beautiful braid out that will last well until the third day and fifth if I&#x27;m super vigilant about tying it up, sleeping with my satin scarf,</li>
            <li>With such a great product I am interested in the other things offered from this line.</li>
            <li>The product feels light weight but can easily weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>and it only takes a little of this product for each section to be on your way to beautiful moisturizer curls.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is a butter as compared to a pudding because I tend to let my hair air dry</li>
            <li>, it def helps keep my tightly curled, super thick 4A/4B hair moisturized and smelling delicious!</li>
            <li>I did not get as much shrinkage with this product</li>
            <li>When I look at the ingredients, there is nothing that will really hold my hair, just a bunch of oils.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a twisting butter, it doesn&#x27;t define my curls as much as I want.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much, and I applied after my leave-in.</li>
            <li>Not bad, light texture, as opposed to a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li>kind of chemical like, though the ingredients are mostly natural, which was odd.</li>
            <li>love the smell, keeps the hair stretched and long, and keeps hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>so twist outs normally don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>The ingredients have changed**********I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar and have a second jar waiting.</li>
            <li>keeps my twists looking fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>Natural ladies pick it up!</li>
            <li>all natural and none of those ingredients that you have to goggle about.</li>
            <li>My hair is sensitive to products infused with protein-rich oils, but this product was an exception.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO moisturizing and keeps my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>But so far, I like it</li>
            <li>I came across this product while searching YouTube videos for how to get waist length natural 3c/4a hair and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and defined after use.</li>
            <li>Unexpected surprise, the moisture my hair receives from this product.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for about 4 months</li>
            <li>Works well with my 4a/4b natural hair</li>
            <li>Except mine was old and brown.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the product, I did get some shedding for the first few uses, but now I don&#x27;t get any with the use of this product.</li>
            <li>I have 3b/3c coarse hair and my 3b areas are easily weighed down which happens with this product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not overpowering or artificial smelling) which is nice!</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, but extremely fine</li>
            <li>It had too many oils and when my hair was dry, it felt hard.  </li>
            <li>It makes my dry and thirsty hair shine and come alive!!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and moisturized and I noticed far less shedding and tangles.</li>
            <li>To the reviewer who said that it left her hair hard and crunchy, less is always more.</li>

            <li> I love that this is a butter as compared to a pudding because I tend to let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> , it def helps keep my tightly curled, super thick 4A/4B hair moisturized and smelling delicious!</li>
            <li> I did not get as much shrinkage with this product</li>
            <li> When I look at the ingredients, there is nothing that will really hold my hair, just a bunch of oils.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a twisting butter, it doesn&#x27;t define my curls as much as I want.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much, and I applied after my leave-in.</li>
            <li> Not bad, light texture, as opposed to a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li> kind of chemical like, though the ingredients are mostly natural, which was odd.</li>
            <li> love the smell, keeps the hair stretched and long, and keeps hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> so twist outs normally don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The ingredients have changed**********I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar and have a second jar waiting.</li>
            <li> keeps my twists looking fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li> Natural ladies pick it up!</li>
            <li> all natural and none of those ingredients that you have to goggle about.</li>
            <li> My hair is sensitive to products infused with protein-rich oils, but this product was an exception.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO moisturizing and keeps my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> But so far, I like it</li>
            <li> I came across this product while searching YouTube videos for how to get waist length natural 3c/4a hair and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and defined after use.</li>
            <li> Unexpected surprise, the moisture my hair receives from this product.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about 4 months</li>
            <li> Works well with my 4a/4b natural hair</li>
            <li> Except mine was old and brown.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the product, I did get some shedding for the first few uses, but now I don&#x27;t get any with the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c coarse hair and my 3b areas are easily weighed down which happens with this product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overpowering or artificial smelling) which is nice!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, but extremely fine</li>
            <li> It had too many oils and when my hair was dry, it felt hard.  </li>
            <li> It makes my dry and thirsty hair shine and come alive!!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and moisturized and I noticed far less shedding and tangles.</li>
            <li> To the reviewer who said that it left her hair hard and crunchy, less is always more.</li>
            <li> This product is very concentrated and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> If you stay in a dry environment I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> With this product my hair was frizzy and dry looking the next day.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with other products that \\&quot;hold\\&quot; my curls together such as Curl Keeper and Jane Carter Solution&#x27;s Nourish and Shine.</li>
            <li> You only need a little (I learned this the hard way) and if you use too much it weighs your hair down (and leaves a white cast).</li>
            <li> Instead of making it feel soft, it felt hard and dry after applying it to wet hair immediately after washing.</li>
            <li> and I have different hair textures in my head, more specifically a straighter part of my hair that is very hard to keep twisted when I do my 2 strand twists.</li>
            <li> When I took my Bantu knots out all the hair was clumped and wet and having to pull it apart</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair and this product did not do what I expected.</li>
            <li> This and the other products from this line didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I cannot recommend these products due to my experience.</li>
            <li> and I do mean instant!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake or leave my hair dry, stiff or brittle!  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that holds but doesn&#x27;t make the hair hard and subsequently dry for years.</li>
            <li> It may be a little pricey</li>
            <li> leaves my twists really fluffy and well defined.</li>
            <li> Almond milk, aloe vera juice, btms, almond oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, pumpkin seed oil, macadamia oil, hemp, honey, green tea, marshmellow root, amla, optiphen, fragrance.</li>
            <li> but my hair still had shrinkage just a little less than usual.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, every time that I used the product it left my hair incredibly dry and hard.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair really hard and greasy feeling and shed as well</li>
            <li> Ships fast problem was USPS was horrible and delayed the delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> thats all it takes to keep my hair twisted and elongated...</li>
            <li> It smelled like artificial almond/vanilla candles which is not how I want my hair to smell.</li>
            <li> (that I&#x27;m cutting off gradually)</li>
            <li> when I just cut 6-7 inches off of my hair to start from scratch and make it healthier ..:(</li>
            <li> Expensive for no reason !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and would not recommend it for my hair texture.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was AWESOME!!  The best I&#x27;ve used yet and I&#x27;m recommending it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and moisturizes my hair.  I&#x27;ve only had the chance to use it once.  I use it as a moisturizer and as a holding product when I two-strand twist my hair.</li>
            <li> I used the product for a twist out. It provided my hair with great hold and it also smells great (like cookie dough lol). So if you&#x27;re desiring hold for your styles, it&#x27;s a great product. Unfortunately, every time that I used the product it left my hair incredibly dry and hard. While maintaining a style is important to me, health and moisture reigns on my list of hair needs.</li>
            <li> Lovely product. Great smell very moisturizing, especially compared to the Curl Milk. This product is great for twist outs not so great for wash and go&#x27;s. The product feels light weight but can easily weigh your hair down. I have 3b/3c coarse hair and my 3b areas are easily weighed down which happens with this product. I did not get as much shrinkage with this product but my hair still had shrinkage just a little less than usual. If you stay in a dry environment I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This and the other products from this line didn&#x27;t work for me.  My hair actually started coming out.  I cannot recommend these products due to my experience.</li>
            <li> ********Beware.....The ingredients have changed**********I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar and have a second jar waiting. I really love the ingredients- all natural and none of those ingredients that you have to goggle about. I use the twisting butter to do my twists and this product leaves my twists really fluffy and well defined. When I first started using the product, I did get some shedding for the first few uses, but now I don&#x27;t get any with the use of this product. It has alma in it and alma does make my hair shed, but it has really great benefits as well, so I&#x27;m glad that my hair likes it now and no longer sheds when I use it. It has a very pleasant scent- like cake/ sugar cookies. ************Update******** The ingredients have changed. The old ingredients which I like best are as follows: almond milk, distilled water, aloe vera leaf juice, BTMS, almond oil, olive oil, jojoba oil, brazil nut oil, amla oil, pumpkin seed oil, macadamia nut oil, baobab oil, honey, manketti oil, nettle, algae, L-cystine, xanthum gum, optiphen, fragrance.*********The new ingredients on my new jar are as follows: Almond milk, aloe vera juice, btms, almond oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, pumpkin seed oil, macadamia oil, hemp, honey, green tea, marshmellow root, amla, optiphen, fragrance.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my 3C curls. I get better definition from leave in conditioner.  When I look at the ingredients, there is nothing that will really hold my hair, just a bunch of oils.  I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> perfect for twist outs!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for my hair. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great twist out and defined curls.</li>
            <li> It smelled like artificial almond/vanilla candles which is not how I want my hair to smell. I compared it to the Cantu twist and lock shea butter gel and by far the Cantu held a twist out a ton better. I could see curl definition and it was frizz free with Cantu. With this product my hair was frizzy and dry looking the next day. When I took my Bantu knots out all the hair was clumped and wet and having to pull it apart made my hair look uncombed and without definition.</li>
            <li> My favorite product for twist outs/braid outs</li>
            <li> My hair is sensitive to products infused with protein-rich oils, but this product was an exception. Not only did it moisturize my hair, but it added a glossy finish to my ever-dull strands (I have 3a-3b curls). Although it&#x27;s a twisting butter, it doesn&#x27;t define my curls as much as I want. However, it does get rid of fizziness. I use this product along with other products that \\&quot;hold\\&quot; my curls together such as Curl Keeper and Jane Carter Solution&#x27;s Nourish and Shine. Overall, I think that this product is a must-have for people that are in need of extra moisture for their hair.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff!  I have 4B curls and love using this for a twist out.  It&#x27;s SO moisturizing and keeps my hair really soft.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or leave my hair dry, stiff or brittle!  It smells amazing as well!!  It&#x27;s expensive but i&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I used this for a twist out (with no leave in underneath it) for the first time today. It&#x27;s very similar to the CR Moisture Butter in my opinion. I feel like it could be more moisturizing. It absorbs FAST! You only need a little (I learned this the hard way) and if you use too much it weighs your hair down (and leaves a white cast). But so far, I like it but it&#x27;s not my favorite. It smells like vanilla cake batter (similar to Donna Marie&#x27;s Dream Curling Cream but it&#x27;s not overpowering or artificial smelling) which is nice!</li>
            <li> I love the product. It is an excellent way to moisturize your natural hair. With such a great product I am interested in the other things offered from this line.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing twisting butter that I have ever used. My hair is soft and moisturized and I noticed far less shedding and tangles. To the reviewer who said that it left her hair hard and crunchy, less is always more. This product is very concentrated and you only need a small amount. Out of all of the products that I have tried, this one is the best, hands down!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it leaves my feeling soft and manageable. I finally found something that works. I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Perfect I use this to twist my dreads as well as my daughters it works great and also smells magnificent!!</li>
            <li> This product is the best product for twist outs. It makes my dry and thirsty hair shine and come alive!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> If you love moisture without buildup, you will love this stuff. It also smells yummy. It is the perfect butter for winter months.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that holds but doesn&#x27;t make the hair hard and subsequently dry for years. I came across this product while searching YouTube videos for how to get waist length natural 3c/4a hair and decided to try it. This product has done wonders for my hair. It&#x27;s soft and defined after use. My hair is thick, but extremely fine and I have some heat damage at my ends (that I&#x27;m cutting off gradually) so twist outs normally don&#x27;t work for me. They do with this product however! I still prefer braid outs as I find they give more definition in general, but with this product they are amazing. I love that this is a butter as compared to a pudding because I tend to let my hair air dry 90 percent prior to braiding it up and this doesn&#x27;t saturate the hair with additional water. It&#x27;s more of a paste-butter that somehow gives as much definition and shine as a gel without the hardness and drying effect of a gel. I use my oil mix of avocado oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, vitamin e, rosemary and clary sage oil underneath this (for hair growth) and then put this on top and braid up. The next morning I have a beautiful braid out that will last well until the third day and fifth if I&#x27;m super vigilant about tying it up, sleeping with my satin scarf, etc... I sincerely hope she doesn&#x27;t stop making this.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products !! It&#x27;s great for twistouts or just moisturizing your hair ! It leaves my hair super soft !! It may be a little pricey but it&#x27;s worth it !</li>
            <li> This twisting butter is great! My curls are more defined and last longer. Unexpected surprise, the moisture my hair receives from this product.</li>
            <li> Smells very good, and great conditioning for your hair.  I used it for twisting as well as for moisturizing after washing hair.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair moisturized as well as keeps my twists looking fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair and this product did not do what I expected. Instead of making it feel soft, it felt hard and dry after applying it to wet hair immediately after washing. I&#x27;m very disappointed and would not recommend it for my hair texture.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and works keeps my hair moisturized</li>
            <li> Bought this from target. The smell is great when u first apply ...after the scent settles it smells off...kind of chemical like, though the ingredients are mostly natural, which was odd. It also made my hair really hard and greasy feeling and shed as well( I used it for twist outs/ braid outs.)..when I just cut 6-7 inches off of my hair to start from scratch and make it healthier ..:( I will not purchase this again...ever.</li>
            <li> wonderful! smelled great too!</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product. It has given my twist outs more definition with a boost of added moisture plus shine. This product is &amp;#34;The Queen Bee&amp;#34; in my styling routine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do s***  for hair!! Expensive for no reason !!</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about 4 months and I have different hair textures in my head, more specifically a straighter part of my hair that is very hard to keep twisted when I do my 2 strand twists. I am very pleased that my hair actually kept its hold with this product! It smells wonderful!!! I am very impressed and will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. Natural ladies pick it up! Great winter product, great for twist out and bantu knot outs. It smell amazing will order again.....</li>
            <li> Great product I only gave it 4 stars because it can be slightly more moisturzing but I haven&#x27;t tried the moisture butter yet so I will report back as soon as I do. I love her whole line, it def helps keep my tightly curled, super thick 4A/4B hair moisturized and smelling delicious!</li>
            <li> Love this product, my curls really came out nice!</li>
            <li> Love Camille Rose and you will to. smells wonderful. Excellent packaging. arrived quickly! Also it is lighter than the shea moisture curl enhancing smoothie but still has the same effect. however it elongates and shea moisture causes more shrinkage. :)</li>
            <li> My first time using this product on my 4c Mane and I am loving the texture of my hair already...Just finished twisting my hair....I sprayed water and use a tiny portion per strand to twist ...thats all it takes to keep my hair twisted and elongated...lets see what it will look like tomorrow...will be back with more update.</li>
            <li> It had too many oils and when my hair was dry, it felt hard.  I will not repurchase for my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair product! The seller Aveyou was great... Ships fast problem was USPS was horrible and delayed the delivery. Even came in a nice tote bag! I don&#x27;t necessarily have to twist my hair... It says it can also be used for wash and go styles as well. I have 3a/3b curly frizzy hair... Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product so much that I&#x27;m about to place my second order ahead of time.  This twisting butter was like an instant softener for my hair and I do mean instant!  I noticed an immediate difference after applying this product to my hair after shampooing.  I am a 3c/4a curly girl and it only takes a little of this product for each section to be on your way to beautiful moisturizer curls.  The product arrived in the time posted online and I am satisfied with the condition that it arrived in.  When I first opened it and looked at the twisting butter I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it because of the texture, but it melted right in my hands and in my hair.  The was no residue after application so I am 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, my hair loves it!</li>
            <li> Best product for 2 strand twist.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it&#x27;s too expensive to keep buying. Left my hair moisturized. And smells great! I just use shea butter and flaxseed to twist my hair which is more affordable.</li>
            <li> Works well with my 4a/4b natural hair whan wearing twist-outs. Its even better when I use it with carols daughters loc butter. Great definition and hold.</li>
            <li> Not bad, light texture, as opposed to a heavy cream.  Leaves hair with surprising definition (my type is 4C). Don&#x27;t need much, and I applied after my leave-in. Because my hair easily matts and tangles, in the evening I applied my favorite hair milk and twist/braid large sections at night. NO COMBING, but lightly finger detangle. So far my second day hair in 60% humidity is holding great! The hair is not crunchy like that from a gel set, it is not oily either although when I touch it there is a shine on my fingers. The smell is good for those who like vanilla or cake batter scent, I prefer fruit scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Beautiful twist outs.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My twists outs look so good and I get so many compliments since I&#x27;ve been using this product. Just make sure you use it with other Camille Rose products it does not mix well with anything else. I also mixed this along with Camille Rose Curl Maker for a more defined twist out and I wanted my hair to hold up for a night out it did not disappoint. I only wish it was cheaper on Amazon, but Target always sells. Please reduce the price Amazon the. I would give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> love this stuff its amazing.</li>
            <li> love the smell, keeps the hair stretched and long, and keeps hair super soft and shiny. literally the best twistout cream i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> loved this product hair was silky.</li>
            <li> It caused build up on my hair and didn&#x27;t feel so moisturized may be it need to try sgain</li>
            <li> This is one of the most moisturizing hair creams I&#x27;ve ever encountered. This is my go to hair creame.  I have 4b hair and my coils and kinks love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works well and smells like sweet almonds!</li>
            <li> Usually a great product.  Except mine was old and brown.</li>
