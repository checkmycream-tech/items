            <li>so glad i buy this</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>I so will order more..</li>
            <li>It is awesome especially if you are using SkinTac to keep something on your skin, this removes it with ease and no pain.  </li>
            <li>It works, but takes more than you would expect.</li>
            <li>Good product it does exactly what it suppose to...</li>
            <li>Solvent works very good for removing bonding tape on hair extensions, its a must when using the double sided tape.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got to really get it on the extensions good for them to come out</li>
            <li>They came out fairly easy.</li>
            <li>This product was so easy to use and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit oily but some hand soap or shampoo removes that quite easily.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love how easy it helped my tape extensions slide right off without tearing out hair or leaving scalp irritated!</li>
            <li>Just wish it smelled a whole lot better!</li>
            <li>This product is nicely scented and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>The product however is fantastic, and can be applied with a cotton pad in addition to the sprayer.</li>
            <li>With C-22 and gold bond glue, I no longer dread redoing my wefts and ending up with hair that I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Great Product will definitely buy from this vendor again</li>
            <li>Cannot with good conscious recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Might not be good for those with sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Removes glue super easy.  </li>
            <li>The C-22 Solvent will release any tape or glue used to secure a Lace Front or a Full Lace unit.</li>
            <li>Its super cheap, and did the job it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>Smells good, kind of messy, but</li>
            <li>The glue tracks I had in the front of my hair slid right out!</li>
            <li>Gets my tape hair extensions right out!  </li>
            <li>They slid right out!</li>
            <li>I went through the product quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived fairly quickly</li>
            <li>It worked quickly and very well!!</li>
            <li>it took my extensions off really fast and easy, its super greasy so wash your hair after of course.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li>would say to get just to have, comes in useful</li>
            <li>or more and then gently lift the unit from the scalp when you are ready to remove your unit.</li>
            <li>Everything slipped out lovely took me 15 minutes, however because of the oil I had to go to a salon and to a professional removal treatment.</li>
            <li>out.it give off a fruity smell fresh feeling sense.i like it.it work</li>
            <li>Fast and natural, kind of hurts my scalp</li>
            <li>The smell is nice - it can be a little strong, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>i wass thinking on not to buy believe is not necesary, but i make a mess on my hair with the glue and this thing save me :P</li>
            <li>and the glue just comes right out of your hair&lt;</li>
            <li>The texture is oily, but washes right out of hair after 2-3 shampoos.</li>
            <li>I would say 5 seconds and your tape will slide right off.</li>
            <li>but it takes tape right off</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oily, so you will need to wash your hair right after use.</li>
            <li>This solvent made them come right out, without any pain or pulling.</li>
            <li>This stuff made them come right out, without any breakage.  </li>
            <li>It washes right out.</li>
            <li>The citrus solvent works very well and it does clean the glue from your scalp.  </li>
            <li>The reviews which stated that you need this product if you are using super tape or wig adhesive are absolutely correct.</li>
            <li>best results, let the solvent soak for a few minutes and use hot water when possible.</li>
            <li>It is very, very olily and greasy.</li>
            <li>One bottle was more than enough to remove all the tape-in extensions.  </li>
            <li>Next, I used dish soap (just at the top of the extensions where the tape goes) and that worked well at removing the greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The first product I used to removed tape in hair extensions was called Hair Extension Release</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>First time using taped in hair, I did it myself.</li>
            <li>I would buy again most definitely!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what its suppose to do....</li>
            <li>It removes the adhesive pretty well and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>It works, does the job, short time to get it done, Recommends and worth it!!</li>
            <li>my seamless extensions come right out with any damage and it nourishes my hair!</li>
            <li>and I pretty much don&#x27;t even feel like tackling my extension hair.</li>
            <li>First, I cleaned the back of my hand with alcohol until the cotton ball was free of debris.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super sensitive and I had no issues.</li>
            <li>This is easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>It does remove certain types of adhesive that it is meant to be used with.</li>
            <li>First off, the spray pump did not work right and the strong smelling oily liquid ran down over my hand.</li>
            <li>It made my whole house smell</li>
            <li>This item works really well.</li>
            <li>it makes it so much eaiser to use.</li>
            <li>This product loosens glue from the skin very well, but it does leave a smear of glue here and there.</li>
            <li>I would suggest cleaning your skin after getting the glue/tape off because it really oily.</li>
            <li>I purchased two bottles, not knowing how much I would need.  </li>
            <li>The solvent really loosens the grip on the tape, making it easier to just slip out of your hair.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this product..</li>
            <li>It went way better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, too.  </li>
            <li>very good.love</li>
            <li>PLUS really works on skin and on hair system ....</li>
            <li>helped me so much getting them out</li>
            <li>Got it really fast.  </li>
            <li>it really works to remove hair glue</li>
            <li>It is as gentle as baby oil.  </li>
            <li>Used to remove tape in extensions &amp; this worked very well</li>
            <li>Havent used the product yet, but the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>It whole process was a Hot Mess and created more problems.</li>
            <li>Absolutely does what it&#x27;s supposed to and the initial smell is like peeling a fresh orange ..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>Just use a little more solvent in those areas, wipe off the glue, and then wash with soap and water.</li>
            <li>It is oily which although a little messy, makes it very easy to comb through and get all of the glue residue out of my hair easily.  </li>
            <li>Its not hard.</li>
            <li>I sprayed a couple of wefts at a time, left on for about two minutes, they eased right on out, no snags or hair loss.  </li>
            <li>It works average, it didnt remove all of the glue, has funny smell, I worked for a while, but if you can deal with the smell it works average, kind of gooey, once you spray it</li>
            <li>If you are new to this, as I am, I would suggest you either go to your beautician for assistance or watch some of the instructional videos on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t locate the brand new solvent to remove my tape-in hair extensions</li>
            <li>But C-22 worked fast enough and without so much drying alcohol getting onto the skin.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on where the weft is attached and leave it for a few seconds, and gently pull the weft free.  </li>
            <li>First time i used it it took me forever to get it out, second time I used a comb</li>
            <li>It is extremely oily, so be sure to pick up a clarifying shampoo to get rid of the extra oil.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong but it does work well...</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it washes out of my hair without any residue left behind.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and dries clear.</li>
            <li>I used this to soak and remove seamless tape extensions.  </li>
            <li>I just spray it on the areas to be released, wait a few minutes and the tape comes up smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a wigmaker and I&#x27;m working to put together a list of products that are gentle on skin and, whenever possible, water based.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the quickest way to remove the Walker&#x27;s Ultra Hold Adhesive Tape or glue.</li>
            <li>It may take up to one minute to completely remove glue.</li>
            <li>I wear Glam Seamless Extensions and use their organic coconut oil bond</li>
            <li>remover-100% natural and organic and</li>
            <li>Purchased seamless hair extensions.</li>
            <li>So many uses for gluey sticky things that require gentle removal.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product and the others I mentioned.</li>
            <li>I applied new double sided tape to my hair extensions and have had no problems with them staying attached.</li>
            <li>Once those strands are on, you better hope you have a bottle of this or plan on some serious hair pulling and possibly a bald spot.</li>
            <li>We have gone through at least 4 bottles of this and its a huge savings over the gouging Hair Club does to you.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much too often.</li>
            <li>One treatment and 6 professional hair washes later and my hair is still oily):</li>
            <li>the extensions come right off with a little tug.</li>
            <li>The scariest thing is that I don&#x27;t do much to my hair (I.e. due, flat iron or bleach)</li>
            <li>It only takes a few minutes to remove all wefts with little glue residue that is easily removed.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Was able to remove 80 tape-in hair extensions in 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Requires a good shampooing after using to remove oils but still well worth it.</li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchased.</li>
            <li> so glad i buy this</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> I so will order more..</li>
            <li> It is awesome especially if you are using SkinTac to keep something on your skin, this removes it with ease and no pain.  </li>
            <li> It works, but takes more than you would expect.</li>
            <li> Good product it does exactly what it suppose to...</li>
            <li> Solvent works very good for removing bonding tape on hair extensions, its a must when using the double sided tape.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got to really get it on the extensions good for them to come out</li>
            <li> They came out fairly easy.</li>
            <li> This product was so easy to use and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit oily but some hand soap or shampoo removes that quite easily.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love how easy it helped my tape extensions slide right off without tearing out hair or leaving scalp irritated!</li>
            <li> Just wish it smelled a whole lot better!</li>
            <li> This product is nicely scented and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> The product however is fantastic, and can be applied with a cotton pad in addition to the sprayer.</li>
            <li> With C-22 and gold bond glue, I no longer dread redoing my wefts and ending up with hair that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> Great Product will definitely buy from this vendor again</li>
            <li> Cannot with good conscious recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Might not be good for those with sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Removes glue super easy.  </li>
            <li> The C-22 Solvent will release any tape or glue used to secure a Lace Front or a Full Lace unit.</li>
            <li> Its super cheap, and did the job it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Smells good, kind of messy, but</li>
            <li> The glue tracks I had in the front of my hair slid right out!</li>
            <li> Gets my tape hair extensions right out!  </li>
            <li> They slid right out!</li>
            <li> I went through the product quickly.</li>
            <li> It arrived fairly quickly</li>
            <li> It worked quickly and very well!!</li>
            <li> it took my extensions off really fast and easy, its super greasy so wash your hair after of course.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li> would say to get just to have, comes in useful</li>
            <li> or more and then gently lift the unit from the scalp when you are ready to remove your unit.</li>
            <li> Everything slipped out lovely took me 15 minutes, however because of the oil I had to go to a salon and to a professional removal treatment.</li>
            <li> out.it give off a fruity smell fresh feeling sense.i like it.it work</li>
            <li> Fast and natural, kind of hurts my scalp</li>
            <li> The smell is nice - it can be a little strong, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> i wass thinking on not to buy believe is not necesary, but i make a mess on my hair with the glue and this thing save me :P</li>
            <li> and the glue just comes right out of your hair&lt;</li>
            <li> The texture is oily, but washes right out of hair after 2-3 shampoos.</li>
            <li> I would say 5 seconds and your tape will slide right off.</li>
            <li> but it takes tape right off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily, so you will need to wash your hair right after use.</li>
            <li> This solvent made them come right out, without any pain or pulling.</li>
            <li> This stuff made them come right out, without any breakage.  </li>
            <li> It washes right out.</li>
            <li> The citrus solvent works very well and it does clean the glue from your scalp.  </li>
            <li> The reviews which stated that you need this product if you are using super tape or wig adhesive are absolutely correct.</li>
            <li> best results, let the solvent soak for a few minutes and use hot water when possible.</li>
            <li> It is very, very olily and greasy.</li>
            <li> One bottle was more than enough to remove all the tape-in extensions.  </li>
            <li> Next, I used dish soap (just at the top of the extensions where the tape goes) and that worked well at removing the greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The first product I used to removed tape in hair extensions was called Hair Extension Release</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> First time using taped in hair, I did it myself.</li>
            <li> I would buy again most definitely!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its suppose to do....</li>
            <li> It removes the adhesive pretty well and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> It works, does the job, short time to get it done, Recommends and worth it!!</li>
            <li> my seamless extensions come right out with any damage and it nourishes my hair!</li>
            <li> and I pretty much don&#x27;t even feel like tackling my extension hair.</li>
            <li> First, I cleaned the back of my hand with alcohol until the cotton ball was free of debris.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sensitive and I had no issues.</li>
            <li> This is easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> It does remove certain types of adhesive that it is meant to be used with.</li>
            <li> First off, the spray pump did not work right and the strong smelling oily liquid ran down over my hand.</li>
            <li> It made my whole house smell</li>
            <li> This item works really well.</li>
            <li> it makes it so much eaiser to use.</li>
            <li> This product loosens glue from the skin very well, but it does leave a smear of glue here and there.</li>
            <li> I would suggest cleaning your skin after getting the glue/tape off because it really oily.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles, not knowing how much I would need.  </li>
            <li> The solvent really loosens the grip on the tape, making it easier to just slip out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product..</li>
            <li> It went way better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, too.  </li>
            <li> very good.love</li>
            <li> PLUS really works on skin and on hair system ....</li>
            <li> helped me so much getting them out</li>
            <li> Got it really fast.  </li>
            <li> it really works to remove hair glue</li>
            <li> It is as gentle as baby oil.  </li>
            <li> Used to remove tape in extensions &amp; this worked very well</li>
            <li> Havent used the product yet, but the shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> It whole process was a Hot Mess and created more problems.</li>
            <li> Absolutely does what it&#x27;s supposed to and the initial smell is like peeling a fresh orange ..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Just use a little more solvent in those areas, wipe off the glue, and then wash with soap and water.</li>
            <li> It is oily which although a little messy, makes it very easy to comb through and get all of the glue residue out of my hair easily.  </li>
            <li> Its not hard.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a couple of wefts at a time, left on for about two minutes, they eased right on out, no snags or hair loss.  </li>
            <li> It works average, it didnt remove all of the glue, has funny smell, I worked for a while, but if you can deal with the smell it works average, kind of gooey, once you spray it</li>
            <li> If you are new to this, as I am, I would suggest you either go to your beautician for assistance or watch some of the instructional videos on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t locate the brand new solvent to remove my tape-in hair extensions</li>
            <li> But C-22 worked fast enough and without so much drying alcohol getting onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on where the weft is attached and leave it for a few seconds, and gently pull the weft free.  </li>
            <li> First time i used it it took me forever to get it out, second time I used a comb</li>
            <li> It is extremely oily, so be sure to pick up a clarifying shampoo to get rid of the extra oil.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but it does work well...</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and it washes out of my hair without any residue left behind.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and dries clear.</li>
            <li> I used this to soak and remove seamless tape extensions.  </li>
            <li> I just spray it on the areas to be released, wait a few minutes and the tape comes up smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wigmaker and I&#x27;m working to put together a list of products that are gentle on skin and, whenever possible, water based.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the quickest way to remove the Walker&#x27;s Ultra Hold Adhesive Tape or glue.</li>
            <li> It may take up to one minute to completely remove glue.</li>
            <li> I wear Glam Seamless Extensions and use their organic coconut oil bond</li>
            <li> remover-100% natural and organic and</li>
            <li> Purchased seamless hair extensions.</li>
            <li> So many uses for gluey sticky things that require gentle removal.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product and the others I mentioned.</li>
            <li> I applied new double sided tape to my hair extensions and have had no problems with them staying attached.</li>
            <li> Once those strands are on, you better hope you have a bottle of this or plan on some serious hair pulling and possibly a bald spot.</li>
            <li> We have gone through at least 4 bottles of this and its a huge savings over the gouging Hair Club does to you.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much too often.</li>
            <li> One treatment and 6 professional hair washes later and my hair is still oily):</li>
            <li> the extensions come right off with a little tug.</li>
            <li> The scariest thing is that I don&#x27;t do much to my hair (I.e. due, flat iron or bleach)</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes to remove all wefts with little glue residue that is easily removed.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research about products similar to this - and this one wins hands down!!!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I would ever use this on a lace hair peiece, unless I was going to wash the piece and let it dray for a few days to get the strong orange smell out of it.</li>
            <li> the spray bottle sucks and breaks down easily</li>
            <li> The sprayer on my bottle sticks frequently, which is kind of frustrating, but it&#x27;s possible mine is just not a great example.</li>
            <li> This bottle goes a long way, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for me, Im not going to complain because its messy, and hard to remove from hair.</li>
            <li> It was so hard to remove them that my hair was really damaged in the process.</li>
            <li> it is very oily and hard to get off but works.  </li>
            <li> Not all together unpleasent but strange.</li>
            <li> I pour a little on, wait about 20 minutes and the hair extensions usually slip right out.  </li>
            <li> I then spread 2 thin layers of protectant, letting the first layer dry before adding the second.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other solvents and always find myself coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li> but if you are not a professional be careful with this as I had to wash my hair with dawn and clarifying shampoo over and over to get all of the tape and oil out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Pieces literally fell off my head, and I didn&#x27;t loose any hair.  </li>
            <li> Spray, let it sit for about 30 sec.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Also, the solvent does burn a little if it sits on the scalp too long.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no use to me if the other products to use it with does not work.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other kinds of extensions....</li>
            <li> Maybe it might work for other things</li>
            <li> It is extremely oily, but nothing that can&#x27;t be shampooed away.</li>
            <li> I have tried other glue solvents and nothing</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t burn my clients scalp like other products</li>
            <li> I purchased it with other items to  Walker Ultra Hold glue down my lace front.  </li>
            <li> This gently removes wig tape and residue from expensive hairpieces.  </li>
            <li> I used this to remove my lace wig that was held down with tape</li>
            <li> but it is a little messy and takes a little too long to remove all the glue</li>
            <li> It does what it says and I agree with the other 4-5 star ratings!  </li>
            <li> Stings slightly if gets in eyes from smallest residue.</li>
            <li> but it took me about a half an hour to remove the ultra hold glue from my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells chemical with a slight hint of citrus.</li>
            <li> I used it on tape residue after removing my lace front wig and if it gets in the hair it leaves a mess that won&#x27;t just wash out with a shampoo treatment.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> I spray a little on my extension where the tape is at and within a minute or less</li>
            <li> Be careful of this, it is very harsh.</li>
            <li> Big huge difference from the other crap that&#x27;s out there!</li>
            <li> it works, but it&#x27;s a little of a pain.</li>
            <li> but I found it to sting a little.  </li>
            <li> The smell can be a little overpowering, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I had tape extensions and was having a hard time getting an appointment to get them taken out - I work long hours and my hair stylist couldn&#x27;t get me in, so I ordered this product and took them out myself!!!  </li>
            <li> HAVE BROUGHT A FEW BOTTLES</li>
            <li> I use gold bond glue which works very well for me, but it was very difficult to remove the wefts until I found citrus 22.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 3 bottles seeing how small these were...</li>
            <li> I used this before and it is a harsh chemical!</li>
            <li> It is a hard working product and it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> The reviews which are negative, Im trying to figure out why...</li>
            <li> The smell was not pleasant and it was oily.  </li>
            <li> As I slowly ran my fingers through my hair, my hair looked like it was just melting off!</li>
            <li> Very hard to get out of hair had to wash 2 times then used dish soap to remove all the oil residue.</li>
            <li> When the protectant no longer felt tacky, I applied a thin layer of Ultra Hold.</li>
            <li> No happy.</li>
            <li> Not too irritating on skin.</li>
            <li> But it left my extensions sticky from the glue and hard to get off as well as my hair and my extension hair so horribly greasy.</li>
            <li> This product definately made it a lot less painful to take out my tape in extenstions.</li>
            <li> but my experience left me feeling very disappointed in the product.</li>

            <li> I felt lightheaded and faint with that one.</li>
            <li> It works removed the messy glue the glue was awful</li>
            <li> Unbelievable compared to others and outrageous prices on others, not here with C-22!</li>

            <li> The product was BAD.</li>
            <li> SO BAD</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t to bad either.</li>
            <li> You will be nothing but frustrated.</li>
            <li> and I mean nothing works like this siovent!!!!</li>
            <li> I believe the citrus base helps to remove the glues and soothe your skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this actually dissolved the tape from my tape extensions</li>
            <li> I used this to soak and remove seamless tape extensions.  It made my whole house smell and it did turn the tape into goo... but if you are not a professional be careful with this as I had to wash my hair with dawn and clarifying shampoo over and over to get all of the tape and oil out of my hair.</li>
            <li> it works, but it&#x27;s a little of a pain. You&#x27;ve got to really get it on the extensions good for them to come out and even then the tape from your extensions will be stuck in your hair. First time i used it it took me forever to get it out, second time I used a comb and it helped with getting the tape out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since it was getting great reviews! I used this product to take out my tape extensions. They came out fairly easy. I jumped in the show to get the remaining residue out of my hair. As I was running my fingers through my hair I got handfuls of my own hair and even with shampooing, my hair kept falling out! I got out because I was so scared. As I slowly ran my fingers through my hair, my hair looked like it was just melting off! My hair is so thin now and I will never ever use this product on my hair ever again! The scariest thing is that I don&#x27;t do much to my hair (I.e. due, flat iron or bleach) I just put in argan oil! So it had to be the solvent that did this!</li>
            <li> I like the citrus scent but it&#x27;s no use to me if the other products to use it with does not work.</li>
            <li> Great product wash hands very well. Stings slightly if gets in eyes from smallest residue.</li>
            <li> The citrus smells is amazing and this works well on lace wig tape but not so good on glue. I used this to remove my lace wig that was held down with tape and it work great, but when I used it a second time to remove the ultra hold glue it did worked to release the lace wig but it took me about a half an hour to remove the ultra hold glue from my skin. I would say use this to remove lace wig tape but not to remove the lace wig glues.</li>
            <li> This item works really well. I just spray it on the areas to be released, wait a few minutes and the tape comes up smoothly.  I have not tried it on glue. The smell is pleasant and I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it is Great! I love the smell &amp; that it is a Spray&lt;br /&gt;bottle it makes it so much eaiser to use. It works so good all you have to do is&lt;br /&gt;spray it on and let it sit for awhile and the glue just comes right out of your hair&lt;br /&gt;with no Breakage! I would recommend this product to my family,friends &amp; Clients!!</li>
            <li> If you need a glue removal product for hair extensions I suggest using the one that the brand of hair extensions make. I tried this and it had zero effect.... Oh well I should of known better.</li>
            <li> This product loosens glue from the skin very well, but it does leave a smear of glue here and there. Just use a little more solvent in those areas, wipe off the glue, and then wash with soap and water. Be careful not to use too much too often. It will irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> The sell did a good job on packaging and delivery. The product was BAD. First off, the spray pump did not work right and the strong smelling oily liquid ran down over my hand. I am not sure I would ever use this on a lace hair peiece, unless I was going to wash the piece and let it dray for a few days to get the strong orange smell out of it. My hands smelled like an orange for hours, even after washing them with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes removal of tapewefts a breeze.</li>
            <li> IC used the walker no shine tape for my extensions, and this was the cheapest solvent to remove them. It worked great. Smells good, kind of messy, but oh well. Very hard to get out of hair had to wash 2 times then used dish soap to remove all the oil residue. This stuff will strip your hair color out if you dye it so I would suggest re dying your hair afterwards. The reviews which are negative, Im trying to figure out why... It works... Just spray and remove the tape. Its not hard. Worked fine for me, Im not going to complain because its messy, and hard to remove from hair. Its super cheap, and did the job it was supposed to. Great product. Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Maybe I could give this item a fair rating had I received it but I didn&#x27;t. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t apply the glue because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get it off.</li>
            <li> This product is by FAR excellent! The glue tracks I had in the front of my hair slid right out! No breakage, no damage, no hassle! The texture is oily, but washes right out of hair after 2-3 shampoos. I strongly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Works so well like magic! You just spray it in and give it I would say 5 seconds and your tape will slide right off. I haven&#x27;t tried it with glue but it works gray with the tape.  It has a orange citrus scent that smells like pledge... I would suggest cleaning your skin after getting the glue/tape off because it really oily.</li>
            <li> it took my extensions off really fast and easy, its super greasy so wash your hair after of course. but it takes tape right off</li>
            <li> I like the citrus scent of this solvent but I found it to sting a little.  It does remove certain types of adhesive that it is meant to be used with.</li>
            <li> Please, please, please, do not use any wig/scalp adhesive or tape without some sort of scalp protectant for your skin and a solvent to safely remove it! This product is nicely scented and gentle on the skin. Along with this product I purchased the Walker Skin Protectant, Ultra Hold adhesive and a roll of supertape. It all arrived together, which was great because I wanted to practice before my lace front wig arrived. First, I cleaned the back of my hand with alcohol until the cotton ball was free of debris. I then spread 2 thin layers of protectant, letting the first layer dry before adding the second. When the protectant no longer felt tacky, I applied a thin layer of Ultra Hold. It goes on clear and dries clear. As an experiement, I added a layer of supertape to test the difference in the hold with and without the tape. I needed the solvent to remove the tape and glue. I believe the citrus base helps to remove the glues and soothe your skin. I can only imagine what it will be like to remove the glue and tape while under an attached lace front wig. If you are new to this, as I am, I would suggest you either go to your beautician for assistance or watch some of the instructional videos on YouTube. Type in \\&quot;how to apply a lace front wig\\&quot; and all sorts of results pop up. Videos in which the beauty expert applies the products on the model are helpful, but I prefer the ones where the model applies her own products as I will have to do. Overall, I highly recommend this product and the others I mentioned. Again, please do not use any wig/scalp adhesive on unprotected skin.</li>
            <li> This product was so easy to use and works like a charm.  I spray a little on my extension where the tape is at and within a minute or less the extensions come right off with a little tug.</li>
            <li> The start with the smell, it smell so good, helps with the removal of the strips without taking you hair out wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wigmaker and I&#x27;m working to put together a list of products that are gentle on skin and, whenever possible, water based.  Walker Lace Release is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found to detach a lace unit.  But C-22 worked fast enough and without so much drying alcohol getting onto the skin.  I use a paint brush to rub C-22 between the skin and the toupee tape. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but it does work well...</li>
            <li> great wig glue remover and all around great product to use,pleasant smelling, easy to use.Will purchase again in larger size,would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This removes all the yucky Ultra Hold glue and smells good too.  The smell can be a little overpowering, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t locate the brand new solvent to remove my tape-in hair extensions so I did some research on good substitutes.  Walker C-22 did the job!  I purchased two bottles, not knowing how much I would need.  One bottle was more than enough to remove all the tape-in extensions.  It has a nice citrus smell.  It&#x27;s oily, so you will need to wash your hair right after use.</li>
            <li> It smells chemical with a slight hint of citrus. Not all together unpleasent but strange. As for getting the extensions off it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> Removes all glue but it is a little messy and takes a little too long to remove all the glue</li>
            <li> I had my tape-in hair extensions in for about 3 weeks and decided to remove them using this product. Terrible! It didn&#x27;t work at all. It was so hard to remove them that my hair was really damaged in the process. Maybe it works for other kinds of extensions.... but if you are wearing TAPE-IN, do NOT purchase this product. You will be nothing but frustrated.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, and it saved my hair! When it&#x27;s time to remove that tape, this product does the job!</li>
            <li> I used C-22 Citrus Solvent to remove my Remy tape in hair extensions. It left a greasy residue even after shampooing them. Next, I used dish soap (just at the top of the extensions where the tape goes) and that worked well at removing the greasy residue. I applied new double sided tape to my hair extensions and have had no problems with them staying attached.</li>
            <li> I had tape extensions and was having a hard time getting an appointment to get them taken out - I work long hours and my hair stylist couldn&#x27;t get me in, so I ordered this product and took them out myself!!!  It was so easy!!  I sprayed each tape extension, let it set for a couple minutes then slid them out!  The smell is nice - it can be a little strong, but not bad.  Also, BE SURE TO PUT A TOWEL ON YOUR NECK AND DON&#x27;T GET IT ON YOUR SKIN - it left a chemical burn on my neck and shoulders, but that was my fault because I should&#x27;ve covered my skin.  I would order it again in a minute!  I did a lot of research about products similar to this - and this one wins hands down!!!  Don&#x27;t pay big bucks to take out your tape extensions ever again!!!</li>
            <li> Best thing to use to remove tape in extensions with no damage on your hair, love this stuff, and it smells good</li>
            <li> Gets my tape hair extensions right out!  Great price would recommend this product to get any tape extensions out. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product definately made it a lot less painful to take out my tape in extenstions. Once those strands are on, you better hope you have a bottle of this or plan on some serious hair pulling and possibly a bald spot. The solvent really loosens the grip on the tape, making it easier to just slip out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product.. I used it on tape residue after removing my lace front wig and if it gets in the hair it leaves a mess that won&#x27;t just wash out with a shampoo treatment. Cannot with good conscious recommend this product. I don&#x27;t know if it is because my wig is both human and synthetic but it is still yucky and I will not use it again..</li>
            <li> BEST WAY TO REMOVE LACE GLUE WITHOUT PULLING HAIR.</li>
            <li> CLEANS SKIN... AND REMOVES GLUE/TAPE FROM LACED FRONT WIGS... HAVE BROUGHT A FEW BOTTLES, i like it a lot. would say to get just to have, comes in useful</li>
            <li> The first product I used to removed tape in hair extensions was called Hair Extension Release and it smells like rubbing alcohol times 1000. I would literally be in the bathroom with the windows open, fan on, doors open. It was GROSSSSS!!!!! I felt lightheaded and faint with that one. But this was literally a breath of fresh air and works great! It&#x27;s oily and great for your hair and it smells like an orange grove! Big huge difference from the other crap that&#x27;s out there! I was worried about the disclaimer that they have that it might cause skin irritation but I think that&#x27;s only because of the citrus oils. I&#x27;m super sensitive and I had no issues. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great at removing tape in hair extensions! it made my job easier.  I will buy c-22 again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is by far the quickest way to remove the Walker&#x27;s Ultra Hold Adhesive Tape or glue. The C-22 Solvent will release any tape or glue used to secure a Lace Front or a Full Lace unit. It is a must have for those of us who wear Lace Units often. After trying out the 8 ounce bottle of the C-22 Solvent, I purchased the 12 ounce spray bottle. The C-22 allows you to remove your unit without pulling or tearing out your hair. Spray, let it sit for about 30 sec. or more and then gently lift the unit from the scalp when you are ready to remove your unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inevitable that you will still be left with residual oils on your skin even after alcohol.  I went back to the blue solvent.  However, it does what it&#x27;s intended to except the oil is defeating for reapplication.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove my extensions and it did just that very easily. But it left my extensions sticky from the glue and hard to get off as well as my hair and my extension hair so horribly greasy. I had to wash my hair about 6 times and I pretty much don&#x27;t even feel like tackling my extension hair. I may need to throw them away.  No happy. Maybe it might work for other things but my experience left me feeling very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE TO LET THIS PRODUCT SIT LIKE 5 MINS FOR THE TAPE TO FULLY RELEASE, THE BOTTLE LEAKS SO BAD I USED MOST OF IT ON LEAKAGE!</li>
            <li> This solvent worked perfectly and quickly for removing my wig adhesive. The sprayer on my bottle sticks frequently, which is kind of frustrating, but it&#x27;s possible mine is just not a great example. The product however is fantastic, and can be applied with a cotton pad in addition to the sprayer.</li>
            <li> Product works excellent! Removes glue super easy.  It may take up to one minute to completely remove glue. Pieces literally fell off my head, and I didn&#x27;t loose any hair.  I applied Morning Glory Pro Protectant to my hair before wefts, once the glue was removed the protectant rinsed away with ease. Remember if you don&#x27;t want to lose hair let the products do the work, do not try to comb the glue or protectant out. Also, the solvent does burn a little if it sits on the scalp too long. Put conditioner on the hair after shampooing, this cools the scalp.</li>
            <li> So I took out my tape in extensions today. They slipped out like butter. I had 50 wefts in my hair. I ordered 3 bottles seeing how small these were...you really only need one so don&#x27;t make my mistake. Everything slipped out lovely took me 15 minutes, however because of the oil I had to go to a salon and to a professional removal treatment. One treatment and 6 professional hair washes later and my hair is still oily):</li>
            <li> I love this product. It actually dissolves glue from my tape-in extensions in several seconds. I was able to remove one of the extensions, wipe the area and then shampoo without irritation and without having the surrounding extensions come out. The scent is pleasant too. I finally don&#x27;t dread having to remove my extensions. This product has made such a difference! I definitely will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this solvent for several years to remove my hair extensions.  I use gold bond glue which works very well for me, but it was very difficult to remove the wefts until I found citrus 22.  I spray it on where the weft is attached and leave it for a few seconds, and gently pull the weft free.  It only takes a few minutes to remove all wefts with little glue residue that is easily removed.  It is oily which although a little messy, makes it very easy to comb through and get all of the glue residue out of my hair easily.  With C-22 and gold bond glue, I no longer dread redoing my wefts and ending up with hair that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It removed the build-up around my hair line after I removed my front lace wig. It worked quickly and very well!!</li>
            <li> Great product - works well.  We have gone through at least 4 bottles of this and its a huge savings over the gouging Hair Club does to you.  Works just as well as any of HC&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Solvent works very good for removing bonding tape on hair extensions, its a must when using the double sided tape.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Effective&lt;br /&gt;-Smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- the spray bottle sucks and breaks down easily&lt;br /&gt;- if you travel a lot, you have to check it in and i suggest you place this in multiple ziplock bags, as this bottle spills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;For best results, let the solvent soak for a few minutes and use hot water when possible.</li>
            <li> I sprayed the bonded areas and let it soak for 20 minutes or so. They slid right out!</li>
            <li> Love it great for tape ins</li>
            <li> Smells good, works well</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for removing adhesive extensions.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how great this stuff worked to remove my taped in hair extensions!  Saved me about $80 plus tip to have them removed at the salon!!!  I sprayed a couple of wefts at a time, left on for about two minutes, they eased right on out, no snags or hair loss.  Easy!  It went way better than I expected.  Fast shipping, too.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I like this product  but gives the hair piece an oily feel</li>
            <li> I used this before and it is a harsh chemical! Do not use this in your hair. I wear Glam Seamless Extensions and use their organic coconut oil bond remover-100% natural and organic and my seamless extensions come right out with any damage and it nourishes my hair! Be careful of this, it is very harsh.</li>
            <li> Great Product will definitely buy from this vendor again&lt;br /&gt;love the smell</li>
            <li> thanks, great product</li>
            <li> This is a good useful product for sure.</li>
            <li> It works removed the messy glue the glue was awful</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help getting the adhesive off.&lt;br /&gt;Some how after wiping it off and putting the toupee on my skiin got a chemical burn ,. I took almost 2 weeks to heal ,Be careful&lt;br /&gt;Smells like an orange.</li>
            <li> works good! I have ordered it before, Great for taking out extensions. And it goes along ways! The scent isn&#x27;t to bad either.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Prompt delivery. Value for money.</li>
            <li> you spray this to the glue that you want to taken out.it give off a fruity smell fresh feeling sense.i like it.it work very good.love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use a year! Very good seller!</li>
            <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;A couple of sprays and your un-done.&lt;br /&gt;I was beyond impressed and can&#x27;t beat the price with a stick.</li>
            <li> Works great on tape extensions and toupee tape!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY recommend this product!  It does what it says and I agree with the other 4-5 star ratings!  Never been more happy and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Works well. Not too irritating on skin.</li>
            <li> great smell PLUS really works on skin and on hair system ....</li>
            <li> works like a charm, love the stuff. I use tape in extensions helped me so much getting them out</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  The smell was not pleasant and it was oily.  For me, it didn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> The reviews which stated that you need this product if you are using super tape or wig adhesive are absolutely correct. This product worked so well. Within minutes the tape came off effortlessly. It is a bit oily but some hand soap or shampoo removes that quite easily. Love the citrus smell. Will definately buy this again</li>
            <li> This product smelled and left a residue on my hair.  I purchased it with other items to  Walker Ultra Hold glue down my lace front.  Will not use Walker Ultra Hold glue on my hair again.  Glue pulled out the hair from my front hair line.  It whole process was a Hot Mess and created more problems.</li>
            <li> Got it really fast.  Was exactly as described. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Citrus spray is great stuff.  This is good for helping remove lace front wigs but it is also great for removing labels from almost anything - from mirrors to windows to bottles!  This smells amazing, too.  I will buy more of this product, for sure.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love how easy it helped my tape extensions slide right off without tearing out hair or leaving scalp irritated! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It works, does the job, short time to get it done, Recommends and worth it!! Unbelievable compared to others and outrageous prices on others, not here with C-22!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well to remove adhesive tape in extensions. Spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t clog. Good price for this product.</li>
            <li> C-22 works well. I have used it to remove the sticky glue residue that store tags left, off several household purchases. It works well on the lace too.</li>
            <li> Was able to remove 80 tape-in hair extensions in 40 minutes.  Requires a good shampooing after using to remove oils but still well worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this to remove my tape-in extensions. This solvent made them come right out, without any pain or pulling. There wasn&#x27;t any breakage. It is extremely oily, but nothing that can&#x27;t be shampooed away. Very satisfied, would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product for removing tape residue or stickers with adhesive backing. No irritation to hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb and smells good. Works on practically everything</li>
            <li> it really works to remove hair glue</li>
            <li> This is something that I must have to remove the residue from my scalp.  Very effective product when wearing lace wigs.</li>
            <li> I used this to remove my tape-in extensions.  This stuff made them come right out, without any breakage.  It is as gentle as baby oil.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the bottle gets clogged often during use.  It is extremely oily, so be sure to pick up a clarifying shampoo to get rid of the extra oil.  Great product, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This worded well on my tape in extensions.  it is very oily and hard to get off but works.  let is set for a min. or so before un peeling your tape in extensions</li>
            <li> I have tried other glue solvents and nothing and I mean nothing works like this siovent!!!! Anyone that has a glue or bond issue should use this and you will also have a great testamony!&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT...... YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is easy enough to use. Doesn&#x27;t make a mess. It washes right out. I like it! It does have a very strong citrus fragrance though. Might not be good for those with sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> this will dissolve the glue on your tape extensions in 30 seconds. Amazing stuff. Its very similar to goo gone, smells the same and looks the same. One bottle will last you forever. Shipping took about 8 days that was the only downside.</li>
            <li> Works great! A little goes a long ways! First time using taped in hair, I did it myself. Put them in myself &amp; took them out myself. This product works!</li>
            <li> I use this product to remove adhesive off my skin.  It is a hard working product and it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Great product and the scent is citrus not per-fumy!! :P  I recommend any one who use hair extension to us this product.</li>
            <li> Used to remove tape in extensions &amp; this worked very well getting out the adhesive.. Spray generously &amp; comb through hair to remove.</li>
            <li> Does not smell good...but works good! I would buy again most definitely! Just wish it smelled a whole lot better!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its suppose to do....only thing I dont like is that my hair still feels oily even after I wash wash it out</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li> I use this product once a month to remove my hair extensions.  It removes the adhesive pretty well and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I rather like it!  It smells like oranges.</li>
            <li> Works good. Pleased with my purchased. Thank u</li>
            <li> The solvent works well. You have to wash your hair with a deep clarifying shampoo to get all the residue out of your hair after removing the clue tape from hair but the solvent does disolve it enough so that it releases the tape form your hair without losing hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best solvents on the market today.  I&#x27;ve tried other solvents and always find myself coming back to this one.  Gotta&#x27; keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> It works average, it didnt remove all of the glue, has funny smell, I worked for a while, but if you can deal with the smell it works average, kind of gooey, once you spray it</li>
            <li> Smells great and does a good job at removing the tape.</li>
            <li> The citrus solvent works very well and it does clean the glue from your scalp.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Removes all kinds of glue and it washes away very very easy. I will continue to buy this product. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> omg im so glad i buy this... i wass thinking on not to buy believe is not necesary, but i make a mess on my hair with the glue and this thing save me :P</li>
            <li> I use this in my salon it is awesome! And doesn&#x27;t burn my clients scalp like other products ill continue to use it!</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF!  This gently removes wig tape and residue from expensive hairpieces.  Protect the investment you make in costly hairpieces with this!  Even cheap wigs are expensive-take good  care of them.  This solution also takes off too sticky price tags and TAKES BANDAGES OFF SKIN WITHOUT PULLING! (Wait till you are healed!)  So many uses for gluey sticky things that require gentle removal.</li>
            <li> Good product it does exactly what it suppose to... I love it.. I&#x27;m going to buy another I don&#x27;t want to run out</li>
            <li> This solvent works beautifully.  I pour a little on, wait about 20 minutes and the hair extensions usually slip right out.  The smell is pleasant and it washes out of my hair without any residue left behind.  This bottle goes a long way, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast and natural, kind of hurts my scalp but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Purchased seamless hair extensions. Used this product to take them out. Worked perfectly. Bought another one! Conditions your hair also!</li>
            <li> I so will order more..it works faster than the specific time and it works for me. I am very pleased with this item..</li>
            <li> Easiest way to remove tape-in extensions ever!</li>
            <li> Havent used the product yet, but the shipping was fast.  The scent is lemony...like house cleaner.</li>
            <li> stuff works great would def buy it again  reminds me of goof off lol but yes if you need to remove extentions this stuff workswell</li>
            <li> This (oil based) adhesive solvant works unbelivably well.  It is awesome especially if you are using SkinTac to keep something on your skin, this removes it with ease and no pain.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this product removed my cemented on wig in seconds! Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product! Does the trick and I&#x27;ll definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely does what it&#x27;s supposed to and the initial smell is like peeling a fresh orange .. But once that fades prepare to smell like jet engine fuel if you don&#x27;t wash it off thoroughly .</li>
            <li> It works, but takes more than you would expect. I went through the product quickly. It is very, very olily and greasy. It arrived fairly quickly</li>
