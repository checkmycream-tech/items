            <li>I have used this for years and get many, many compliments on how pleasant and captivating it is.  </li>
            <li>So happy Judy found this classic fragrance!</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and the price.</li>
            <li>Perfumes were authentic.</li>
            <li>I hope I am always able to find it.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I think though they discontinued making it, but love it and glad I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been my oldest fragrance love.</li>
            <li>So elegant.</li>
            <li>Sure, I love my celebrity fruity florals and hyper-clean body sprays...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so pleased that I tried it and that you did indeed have my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I know many people aren&#x27;t familar with it by</li>
            <li>I love it, and don&#x27;t want to be without it.  </li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance, have used it for years.</li>
            <li>She was greatly pleased to receive it as I was to smell it.</li>
            <li>RS is a true old-school Oriental: warm, spicy, and musky, it becomes one with the wearer&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I even prefer the Five Star version for work, as it&#x27;s more subdued and friendly to others&#x27; noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was informed of a formula change that made this once fine product suck.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a lovely warm oriental scent with a soft powder finish.</li>
            <li>Once it lures you in with its luscious myrrh and resinous spices, it moves quickly into more of a woodsy chypre direction, powdery and clean.</li>
            <li>Years ago I worked in the Cosmetic industry; specifically for Germaine Monteil ~ when I originally purchased this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I am now at the end of the original bottle and decided to look on line to see if I could find it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to my surprise; this fragrance is identical to the original item purchased.  </li>
            <li>that isn&#x27;t even close to the Germaine Monteil original...</li>
            <li>This review is for the product shown: the Five Star Fragrances relaunch of the discontinued original from Germaine Monteil.</li>
            <li>Does not smell anything like the original.</li>
            <li>The Product arrived in good condition and on time; however the fragrance IS NOT THE ORIGINAL BY ANY STANDARD.</li>
            <li>At that time and ever sense, no matter when I wear this people comment on how soft and lovely it smells.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can just tell from the dark-brown juice and the amber cap with its elegant scrolled cursive, that this is a powerful, rich fragrance.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years and never fail to get compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, it&#x27;s a natural match with my chemistry and never overpowers others.</li>
            <li>Just as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Beyond reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have been using Royal Secret for years and still get compliments from strangers about how great it smells.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just hoping that they are not getting ready to stop making it.</li>
            <li>So thank you so much for carrying it.  </li>
            <li>this is a fragrance that I really like and it happpens to be one that my wife likes a lot as well.</li>
            <li>A real treat for me.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for Royal Secret for many many months without any luck.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Royal Secret and hope I will be able to continue to get it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>I do have a bottle of the vintage Monteil original and find that one a bit deeper and more complex, but Five Star did a pretty good job of capturing the spirit of Royal Secret.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Amazon is one of the few places I can find my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly an attempted knock off</li>
            <li>I get comments from males, females, old, young, etc.</li>
            <li>I associate it closely with my mom, who wore it in the &#x27;70s as a young woman.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>It is never overwhelming and lasts all day a true classic.</li>
            <li>I know you&#x27;re saying I&#x27;m an old &amp;#34;stuck in the last century&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> This original is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this cologne as long as they keep selling it.</li>
            <li> Would like fragrance to last a little longer though, seems not as long lasting as years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royal Secret for at least 20-25 years with many complements.  </li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find it</li>
            <li> Was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> But when I smell RS I can&#x27;t help but think of a time and place where fragrances were carefully constructed masterpieces.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time with Orientals like Opium and Youth-Dew, as they smell downright fecal to me.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I thought that after having this in it&#x27;s original bottle all these years It might have gone bad.  </li>
            <li> The overall effect is earthy and subtle, yet sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have a previous purchase and they don&#x27;t come close.</li>
            <li> Royal Secret has been my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent for at least the last twenty years.</li>
            <li> Royal Secret has been my signature fragrance for over fifty years...</li>
            <li> what I received is NOT Royal Secret...</li>
            <li> I had ordered royal secret elsewhere</li>
            <li> The new fragrance is awful!!!  </li>

            <li> Every time I wear this perfume I get so many compliments like &amp;#34; you smell Wonderful what is it that you are wearing?&amp;#34; Well this time I  bought the fragrance to give to a friend of mine who wanted to give it as a gift to his mother. The fragrance is a lovely warm oriental scent with a soft powder finish. It is never overwhelming and lasts all day a true classic. It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> ...as I knew already. Great smell. I think though they discontinued making it, but love it and glad I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Royal Secret has been my signature fragrance for over fifty years...what I received is NOT Royal Secret...It is clearly an attempted knock off that isn&#x27;t even close to the Germaine Monteil original...I should have heeded the reviews that some others had posted...This product is an imposter...buyers beware.</li>
            <li> not as I remember it...</li>
            <li> Great parfum and was thrilled I was able to find this on Amazon - thank you:)</li>
            <li> Seemed like a knock off</li>

            <li> This was purchased as a gift to a wonderful woman. She was greatly pleased to receive it as I was to smell it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Royal Secret and hope I will be able to continue to get it thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> The formula was changed. We have a previous purchase and they don&#x27;t come close. Will NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
            <li> Does not seem quite the same scent but close enough. I had ordered royal secret elsewhere but it was not by germain monteil but the packaging  looked like it.</li>
