            <li>For the 4-5 times I used it, it worked great.</li>
            <li>I received this product as a sample and absolutely loved it.</li>

            <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t too strong either.</li>

            <li>Great dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I want to love this product, I really do.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it does work very well; HOWEVER - after two uses the nozzle clogged up and will no longer spray</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and feels in my hair, I love how easy it is to use, and it does exactly what a dry shampoo should.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Overall, I haven&#x27;t been super impressed with any dry shampoo, however, I probably wouldn&#x27;t pick this one because it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li>Many of the products that I have used in the past provide a similar result but this one was the best by far!</li>
            <li>and I run about 20 miles per week in the hot sweaty afternoons.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and clean again.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get enough of the smell - so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly oily hair, so it could be that this just wasn&#x27;t enough for my hair, so I could see how this product would be good for people with dry hair who wanted a little extra oomph between shampoos and blowouts.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried other cheaper brands that I&#x27;ve had better results with.</li>
            <li>Dry shampoo offers me a good alternative to daily washing.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised to see at the end of the day my hair still looked pretty</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is just as good as any other I&#x27;ve tried but goes on invisible, which I</li>
            <li>I love washing my hair but have been trying to improve the quality of my hair by washing it less.</li>
            <li>It smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel coated or weird.</li>
            <li>but I sprayed this stuff on after a long day of work and it really did give my hair a boost.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic because there is no &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; from the typical dry shampoo</li>
            <li>It was definitely better than the 2 other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands and found them effective enough but they always left behind a white residue that made it look like I had gray roots showing!</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve tried everything: hot water, alcohol, trying to pry dried product out of the nozzle.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually tried dry shampoo before</li>
            <li> I was not a big fan of dry shampoo until I tried this one.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be buying this personally, but could see how it could work for other hair types.</li>
            <li> Product adds body and volume while freshening up the day old hair do, but the can clogs up and I was not able to get all the product out.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave behind much residue, and left my hair feeling less limp than other dry shampoos have.</li>
            <li> My hair is not greasy, like other products have done to my hair.</li>
            <li> but I do like to tame the greasiness at the roots and dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I have to say it is a love hate relationship with this product.</li>
            <li> I typically have to wash my hair every day anyway</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel like it&#x27;s mediocre in the realm of dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, the aerosol runs out.</li>

            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Trying not to wash my hair everyday and I have been using this on my off days.</li>
            <li> Stopped working (spraying) after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Wasted probably 1/3 of the can as no product comes out now.</li>
            <li> Waste of money 😁</li>
            <li> usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> but I gave this a try one morning when I was running late</li>
            <li> The can failed after a few uses so now I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of trying a product that I had never heard of.</li>

            <li> I received this product from @influenster to sample along with the texturizer. I have long, straight and really thick hair- add to that I now live in the south and I run about 20 miles per week in the hot sweaty afternoons. Prior to trying this product my go to was LUSH dry shampoo which always left me with a white dusting on my dark auburn hair. This product is fantastic because there is no &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; from the typical dry shampoo and it smells fantastic. Last week I dared myself to go 7 days with no wash and no one was the wiser even when I ran a 1/2 marathon on day #3 of the 7 day self challenge.</li>
            <li> I have to say it is a love hate relationship with this product. It smells great, it does the job at the time, but I have noticed that it leaves a buildup of product on my scalp. I only use it when I know I will be washing my hair that day, it has been a day or so sine I have washed my hair. This product would be 5 stars if it did not leave the buildup.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. It has the best scent and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I want to love this product, I really do. For the 4-5 times I used it, it worked great. I love the way it smells and feels in my hair, I love how easy it is to use, and it does exactly what a dry shampoo should.&lt;br /&gt;However, this product is ultimately a disappointment. After just a few uses, the aerosol runs out. I&#x27;ve had 2 different cans of this (1 purchased from Target, and 1 purchased from Amazon), and both of them did the same thing. This leaves you with lots of product left in the can, and no way to use it. So disappointing. Don&#x27;t waste your money until Fekkai decides to correct this problem.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far, and I&#x27;ve tried many</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it does work very well; HOWEVER - after two uses the nozzle clogged up and will no longer spray - I&#x27;ve tried everything: hot water, alcohol, trying to pry dried product out of the nozzle. Nothing works. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I love washing my hair but have been trying to improve the quality of my hair by washing it less. Dry shampoo offers me a good alternative to daily washing. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and found them effective enough but they always left behind a white residue that made it look like I had gray roots showing! This dry shampoo is just as good as any other I&#x27;ve tried but goes on invisible, which I appreciate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product in a Influenster voxbox.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many dry shampoos over the years. I simply can&#x27;t wash my hair every day but I do like to tame the greasiness at the roots and dry shampoo usually does the trick. Many of the products that I have used in the past provide a similar result but this one was the best by far! It doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery residue and the smell is fantastic! I will definitely be recommending this product and stocking up for myself!!</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. I am not a hair person by any stretch of the imagination. I was skeptical of trying a product that I had never heard of. I typically have to wash my hair every day anyway but I sprayed this stuff on after a long day of work and it really did give my hair a boost. I think I would probably buy this product after giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample and absolutely loved it. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a shampoo that works as great as this! My hair is not greasy, like other products have done to my hair. Also the blowout is awesome when following the directions.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. Trying not to wash my hair everyday and I have been using this on my off days. It smells great, doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel coated or weird. I think I would definately use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this product about two weeks ago and have been using it since that time in between shampooing. Overall, I feel like it&#x27;s mediocre in the realm of dry shampoos. Overall, I haven&#x27;t been super impressed with any dry shampoo, however, I probably wouldn&#x27;t pick this one because it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair and I&#x27;ve tried other cheaper brands that I&#x27;ve had better results with. Two things I did like - the smell is absolutely wonderful (as all Fekkai products are!) and it also doesn&#x27;t have any powdery residue that is left over after you spray it on. I have fairly oily hair, so it could be that this just wasn&#x27;t enough for my hair, so I could see how this product would be good for people with dry hair who wanted a little extra oomph between shampoos and blowouts. Won&#x27;t be buying this personally, but could see how it could work for other hair types.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell!  I&#x27;ve never actually tried dry shampoo before but I received this product as a sample and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I just can&#x27;t get enough of the smell - so fresh and clean.  It absolutely made my hair smell wonderful and feel clean without shampooing, I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was not a big fan of dry shampoo until I tried this one. It was definitely better than the 2 other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the past. For one, the smell was way better - no baby powder scent - just a nice, light, refreshing clean scent which I appreciate. Also, it seemed to last throughout the day. I have fine, limp hair and usually need to shower daily to have the hair style I like - but I gave this a try one morning when I was running late and I was surprised to see at the end of the day my hair still looked pretty fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Great dry shampoo.  Makes my hair feel soft and clean again.</li>
            <li> Stopped working (spraying) after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Product adds body and volume while freshening up the day old hair do, but the can clogs up and I was not able to get all the product out.  Wasted probably 1/3 of the can as no product comes out now.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave behind much residue, and left my hair feeling less limp than other dry shampoos have. The scent wasn&#x27;t too strong either. My sample bottle clogged or ran out after only three uses though, so I wouldn&#x27;t give five stars.</li>
            <li> The can failed after a few uses so now I can&#x27;t use it anymore. Waste of money 😁</li>
