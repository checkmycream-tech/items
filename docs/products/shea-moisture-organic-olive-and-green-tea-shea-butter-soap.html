            <li>Product has a great smell and feel to it when applying.</li>
            <li>Love this soap!</li>
            <li>I like this soap more than I thought I would!</li>
            <li>This bar smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Big bar, great lather, feels luxurious and moisturizing and it smells really good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge too!</li>
            <li>More suds than the bathtub scene in Nightmare On Elm Street.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>and it was suuuuch a relief to me to find such a perfect soap.</li>
            <li>smooth and refreshing</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It is a great facial cleanser that leaves my skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this all natural soap, and it works great and my skin feels healthy and not dried out, I do wish I could find it in a liquid soap</li>
            <li>My girlfriend now comments favorably about how smooth my face feels, no longer scratchy.</li>
            <li>I have used virtually every shaving gel and cream and never got this smooth a shave without cuts and irritation.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of doing an exchange, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because it feels wonderful on my dry, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It is also great as a soap as well leaving my skin feeling smooth and soft without the harsh smell of strong perfumes.</li>
            <li>The soap is so gentle and makes my skin so smooth the shaver glides across my face removing all the stubble effortlessly WITHOUT any irritation.</li>
            <li>This soap did not give me the moisture that experienced with the plain  shea butter one.</li>
            <li>I shave wet and have found an excellent product to lubricate my face before I shave which doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this bar I knew I had found a keeper.</li>
            <li>I will say I am able to buy it in a local chain drugstore at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well, cleanses without being too strippy (as other SM bar soaps can be), moisturizers far better than i could say, and smells FANTASTIC -- no synthetic fragrance either.</li>
            <li>The bar lathers very well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care much for this soap.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and smooth after using and it&#x27;s gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>loyal SM user for years, I was blown away by the sheer quality of this bar soap!</li>
            <li>It smells 100% better than the Coconut Hibiscus bar and the Raw Shea Butter bar.</li>
            <li>The bar is pretty big and dense.</li>
            <li>The bar is large and will last a very long time so don&#x27;t let the price put you off, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never before found a soap that makes my skin soft and heals roughness.  </li>
            <li>Plus this is a really big bar, it will last a long time, you really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I was actually shocked that the soap could smell so refreshing and clean naturally.</li>
            <li>Nubian something or other, will be returning this bar because I found the real thing cheaper at target anyways.</li>
            <li>I have spent countless dollars on products that claimed they were gentle and would not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>Tea Shea Butter Soap does not dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li>In the shower or using the sink, I wet up my face and gently rub the bar directly over the areas I am going to shave, wet up the blade and just shave.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a facial cleanser that does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>Nubian Skin has an almost identical product (the only real difference is that their bar is a little bit smaller) which they sent me by accident.</li>

            <li> I ordered this once before and I loved it so much I wanted a back up. However when this one arrived it was the wrong brand. Nubian something or other, will be returning this bar because I found the real thing cheaper at target anyways.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It smells wonderful, and my skin feels so good after I shower.</li>
            <li> Sent the wrong bar! Nubian something or other brand. Not suitable for my skin but works as a hand soap bar.</li>

            <li> This bar smells amazing. It smells 100% better than the Coconut Hibiscus bar and the Raw Shea Butter bar. The bar lathers very well. You only need a small amount to wash your face. The bar is pretty big and dense. The bar does hydrate my skin a little more than other soap bars, but not much more.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to use it! I felt like buying this because of spicyeve&#x27;s review of it on Youtube.</li>
            <li> Nubian Skin has an almost identical product (the only real difference is that their bar is a little bit smaller) which they sent me by accident. I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of doing an exchange, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because it feels wonderful on my dry, acne-prone skin. A little bit creates a lot of lather, so I like to use it for shaving.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care much for this soap. I think I will stick with my Shea Moisture shea butter soap. This soap did not give me the moisture that experienced with the plain  shea butter one.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a facial cleanser that does not dry my skin out. The first time I used this bar I knew I had found a keeper. I have spent countless dollars on products that claimed they were gentle and would not dry my skin out. After using those products, my skin was always very tight, dry and ashy.&lt;br /&gt;Shea Moisture Organic Olive&amp;Green Tea Shea Butter Soap does not dry my skin out at all.

            <li> I have used three different varieties of the Shea Moisture soaps.  I love them.  I&#x27;ve never before found a soap that makes my skin soft and heals roughness.  This soap healed my rough, dry hands.  I will say I am able to buy it in a local chain drugstore at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I shave wet and have found an excellent product to lubricate my face before I shave which doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Shea Moisture Organic Olive&amp;Green Tea Shea Butter Soap. In the shower or using the sink, I wet up my face and gently rub the bar directly over the areas I am going to shave, wet up the blade and just shave. The soap is so gentle and makes my skin so smooth the shaver glides across my face removing all the stubble effortlessly WITHOUT any irritation. Afterwards, I rinse my face with cold water and the moisturizers in the soap actually make it feel softer. My girlfriend now comments favorably about how smooth my face feels, no longer scratchy. I have used virtually every shaving gel and cream and never got this smooth a shave without cuts and irritation. When I travel I just cut a piece of the bar off and keep it in my travel kit. The bar is large and will last a very long time so don&#x27;t let the price put you off, it is worth every penny. It is also great as a soap as well leaving my skin feeling smooth and soft without the harsh smell of strong perfumes. Great product!</li>
            <li> I purchase this regularly from Walgreens, so this review may not be a &amp;#34;verified purchase&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A loyal SM user for years, I was blown away by the sheer quality of this bar soap! It lathers very well, cleanses without being too strippy (as other SM bar soaps can be), moisturizers far better than i could say, and smells FANTASTIC -- no synthetic fragrance either. I was actually shocked that the soap could smell so refreshing and clean naturally. I&#x27;ve been using this all winter and it was suuuuch a relief to me to find such a perfect soap. It&#x27;s huge too!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed , ordered Shea moisture organic olive  and green tea bar soap but got Nubian olive and green tea bar soap</li>
