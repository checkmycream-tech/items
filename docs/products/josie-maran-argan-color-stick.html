            <li>It works great as cheek color too, and it is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>This is the full size and price is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>I love this as a lipstick!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love the color, and how good it feels on my lips.  </li>
            <li>The color is nice on my lips</li>
            <li>but for my lips it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Delivered on time and I am thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li>Great color &amp; good for your skin, very natural</li>
            <li>This is my favorite for year-round moisturizing lip and cheek color.</li>
            <li>Best universal blush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of these, and how moisturized my lips feel.</li>
            <li>Love the color,</li>
            <li>really love it.</li>
            <li>Its wonderful, feels so light on my skin and does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and the size is huge!  </li>
            <li>FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll put some on my fingertips though and lightly tap on just  cheekbones for glow.</li>
            <li>blends beautifully, stays til I take it off, and has never let me down.  </li>
            <li>With my older skin, putting powder on my face makes my face feel dryer, so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I gave it  4 out of 5 because of the smell, dreamy pink kind of smells like ginger/lemon</li>
            <li>I like the color for cheeks and good everyday lip cover.</li>
            <li>It blends very easily and leaves a healthy subtle glow on your cheek.</li>
            <li>Also it has a very naturalish taste and smell and at first it tasted like sage to me</li>
            <li>Dreamy pink is a lovely color.</li>
            <li>This dreamy pink seems to have more color pigment than the rosey color</li>
            <li>and I got to much.  </li>
            <li>Good shipping, arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I have been using this almost daily now for almost a year and probably still have months worth use - UNBELEIVABLE.  </li>
            <li>the color is great for my skin, but it&#x27;s a little hard to blend.</li>
            <li>It is a dewy, natural looking blush,</li>
            <li>They leave a natural looking blush on your cheeks too</li>
            <li>Color was natural.  </li>
            <li>apparently what I am tasting is Rosemary.  </li>

            <li> The color states Pink, however, I didn&#x27;t find it to be pink.</li>
            <li> I just used my hand to move some to other cheek.  </li>
            <li> I like other JM products</li>
            <li> I used previously.</li>
            <li> If you use as blush as well it will cut the life of the tube in half.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little sticky.</li>
            <li> it almost feels as if it&#x27;s partially dried out</li>
            <li> I prefer the sparkle in the small sticks and color GLOW.</li>
            <li> but this was too hard to use.</li>
            <li> If you pressed hard it would just leave dots.</li>
            <li> They were very dried out and difficult to use.</li>

            <li> Item arrived quickly and the size is huge!  The color applied richer than I thought it would.  I am a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Dreamy pink is a lovely color. This product is perfect for dry skin. It blends very easily and leaves a healthy subtle glow on your cheek. Perfect for &amp;#34;  I just went to the gym and i&#x27;m flushed&amp;#34; look. I gave it  4 out of 5 because of the smell, dreamy pink kind of smells like ginger/lemon and I did not expect that. Here&#x27;s a picture of the product and how it looked like blended vs unblended/indoor vs outdoor.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite for year-round moisturizing lip and cheek color.</li>
            <li> With my older skin, putting powder on my face makes my face feel dryer, so glad I found this product. Its wonderful, feels so light on my skin and does not dry it out. I use it on my lips too.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS.  Best universal blush I have ever used.  It is a dewy, natural looking blush, blends beautifully, stays til I take it off, and has never let me down.  AND it has the elixir of life from Josie Maran.  Her argan oil is miraculous and I use every product she makes.</li>
            <li> Good shipping, arrived earlier than expected. I&#x27;ve used these color sticks before, on my lips, and now can&#x27;t be without one! This dreamy pink seems to have more color pigment than the rosey color I used previously. I love the smell of these, and how moisturized my lips feel. I don&#x27;t use lipstick anymore...just these! They leave a natural looking blush on your cheeks too, I just happen to prefer a powder blush. Sometimes I&#x27;ll put some on my fingertips though and lightly tap on just  cheekbones for glow. This is the full size and price is amazing!!! I will buy here from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this as a lipstick!  I love the color, and how good it feels on my lips.  It works great as cheek color too, and it is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> The color is nice on my lips but I recommend you use a lip brush.  Please note that it has menthol in it if that is an issue with you.  It has Wheat germ oil in it too if that is an issue. Also it has a very naturalish taste and smell and at first it tasted like sage to me but I looked on the ingredients and apparently what I am tasting is Rosemary.  If you just used for a lipstick and used a brush this would last a LONG time.  If you use as blush as well it will cut the life of the tube in half.  I did put on my cheeks and it is to fat to just move it across your cheeks and I got to much.  I just used my hand to move some to other cheek.  Color was natural.  Took star off for Red dyes and menthol.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this almost daily now for almost a year and probably still have months worth use - UNBELEIVABLE.  Ordering my second tube.</li>
            <li> Love it! Creamy texture , great on aging skin!!</li>
            <li> the color is great for my skin, but it&#x27;s a little hard to blend. it almost feels as if it&#x27;s partially dried out so it&#x27;s a little sticky. I was hoping it would be creamier for my cheeks. but for my lips it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> Worked. Great.. Love the color,</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and I am thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> Ordered two of these...  They were very dried out and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I like other JM products but this was too hard to use. If you pressed hard it would just leave dots. It also made skin feel sticky. I would stick with Tarte blush. Totally worth the money and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I prefer the sparkle in the small sticks and color GLOW.</li>
            <li> Great color &amp; good for your skin, very natural</li>
            <li> This product looks great on both your cheeks &amp; lips....I use it so sparingly that I bet this stick will last a year...really love it. ( I also use Josie Maran Tinted Moisturizer Med 1 and they match beautifully).</li>
            <li> I like the color for cheeks and good everyday lip cover.</li>
            <li> The color states Pink, however, I didn&#x27;t find it to be pink. Color way off.</li>
