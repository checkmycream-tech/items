            <li>Great shampoo at a GREAT PRICE!  </li>
            <li>It must not happen to everyone since there are some good reviews but who would want to take the chance?!?</li>
            <li>I had also hoped that it might be good for my scalp, but I did not find it especially good in that regard either.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and it gives me volume</li>
            <li>Great Product ..</li>
            <li>Great product for aging hair</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, my hair was manageable and styled very nicely with plenty of lift at the root.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be buying this again once my review samples run out, it gives good results at a great price.</li>
            <li>I loved it and got great results; however, I was no fan of the overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used this shampoo yet but have read great review of the product...</li>
            <li>and I had heard it was good,</li>
            <li>you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck.  </li>
            <li>My wife used this product and has nothing but good to say about it.</li>
            <li>She has told everyone how good it is.</li>
            <li>It also does a good job removing product build-up.</li>
            <li>My hair loved it, and that means</li>
            <li>It is true, this stuff DOES make you lose hair!!!</li>
            <li>gave two stars because the shampoo does have a pleasant smell and a nice lather.</li>
            <li>I found this shampoo to be nice but nothing exceptional.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light and pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>They love it too!</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have to keep two bottles of shampoo in the house because I love it too!</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so good nor has it ever been this easy to manage!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own thing</li>
            <li>i love it smell good.</li>
            <li>I have to have a brush handy to keep it</li>
            <li>A couple do nothing for the body but smell really nice.  </li>
            <li>Upon application, I found that the lather was abundant.  </li>
            <li>I tried the shampoo on her, and found her hair kept the fragrance and had a nice shine and bounce to it.  </li>
            <li>While I liked the scentand the lather, the results on my hair were negligible.  </li>
            <li>I found this shampoo&#x27;s fragrance not to my liking but to each his own.  </li>
            <li>It is shiny and smooth and feels LIGHT !!!</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves your hair nice clean and bouncy</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing to apply , and doesn&#x27;t over-foam like SO many competitor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very strongly scented,  somewhere between fruity and floral.  </li>
            <li>It does clear out all my product build-up and any dandruff wonderfully!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and need a product that will give me volume without heaviness</li>
            <li>I bought the Volumizing version since I have very fine,</li>
            <li>hair is very fine and has thinned over the years.  </li>
            <li>this is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and very delighted with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I don&#x27;t especially love the smell.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like something more floral or citrusy.  </li>
            <li>I believe you will be pleasantly satisfied just like me.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say much more about it</li>
            <li>I love this volumizing shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I tried this and love the smell</li>
            <li>Shampoo leaks out of the top where the two pieces are combined and also leaks out the lid.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times I would rinse my hair</li>
            <li>this stuff is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and can&#x27;t find it in the stores</li>
            <li>Most make my hair feel waxy.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, rinses clean quickly, removes the tons of product I tend to lavish on my locks to cement them into place, and my hair looks really good all the time.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly better than many of the salon brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>so many shampoos have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be picking more up soon.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t notice any claims about a period of time for it to work) before one can be sure.  </li>
            <li>So, perhaps this shampoo works better on thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry, many like this shampoo, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and I saw results after one use and keep seeing healthy hair after each continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>so it is not suppose to be used as one make sure to read directions before you use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure this product makes my hair look any thicker, but it does appear to have more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle, I was pleased with the pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>But, my first hint that the product&#x27;s performance wouldn&#x27;t match its presentation occurred when the shampoo&#x27;s very nice scent dissipated quickly after I rinsed my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is thefirst time I have loved a shampoo and conditioner through the whole bottle...</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it has a horrendously strong perfumey chemical fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I bought it and the conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Once you get used to it, though, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>It also tends to get stringy and tangled throughout the day because it&#x27;s so fine.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice light scent and a pretty lavender color.  </li>
            <li>Not a lot is required for a full head of suds, but more importantly is the softness and shine it gives your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it as a quick pick and love it.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell but not heavy like some.</li>
            <li>I leave the shower feeling like my hair and my scalp are squeeky clean and it stays clean for more than a day.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about trying this shampoo, because it seemed too inexpensive to be very good, but it was on a great sale</li>
            <li>I color my hair which makes it equally important to have a shampoo that works well.</li>
            <li>but this is a great shampoo to alternate with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...</li>
            <li>It lathers easily and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li>Second, the design is great.</li>
            <li>All the buildup on my scalp is gone and my hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Their motto is &#x27;starting at the right end of the hair and nurishing the scalp for beautiful hair&#x27;..</li>
            <li>Which is probably a good thing since most volumizing shampoos actually dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>I used this CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner this week and am enjoying very light and bouncy</li>
            <li>Use the products you know work.. and stop looking for miracle cures at super cheap price...</li>
            <li>I like the clean smell</li>
            <li>and it does rinse out clean but the increase in volume wasn&#x27;t anything to run home about.  </li>
            <li>Rather invigorating and rinse clean.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean and refreshed after shampooing with this.</li>
            <li>, it does not have too strong a perfume smell, but a clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>My hair did feel clean afterwards except for a bit of buildup of scent and waxy</li>
            <li>Take it or leave it alone, nothing particularly special.</li>
            <li>I only use it on weekends to get a good clean.</li>
            <li>I was using this shampoo and conditioner for months and months pretty much since it came out, I actually really liked it</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the luxuriously thick lather.  </li>
            <li>it really works i love.</li>
            <li>This volumizing shampoo should probably be used with a conditioner from this CLEAR product line, but even without the separate conditioner, this is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>(Full disclosure</li>
            <li>I have truly been getting better results than I had been getting from a salon brand costing over three times as much.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my hair, but it makes my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li>Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>not bad smell in my hair.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to spill at first.  </li>
            <li>I would have like bold spots in my hair that I could cover my mom</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soft and very easy to style.</li>
            <li>I have now been using the shampoo daily for almost a week and am very pleased with the softness of my hair while still getting the volume I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this brand has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting new product.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance and my hair feels really clean and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t have much fullness.</li>
            <li>My hair is left feeling soft, full and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;) makes hair super soft and shiny</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the fragrant, but not overpowering, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the Clear Shampoo, Volumizing Root Boost</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed using Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It is overly fragrant with a girly teen kind of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself comes out in a goopy non clear form, so it looks more like a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>product is worth the money</li>
            <li>It does leave your hair feeling clean with no build up which seems to be a big problem with most shampoos.</li>
            <li>Happily, the fragrance in  this one is far less overwhelming, and the results as just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, silky, and clean and helps keep it tangle-free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always in the market for new product that will add volume without weight to my not-so-fine fine hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>I am very fussy about my shampoo as I have fine straight hair that loves to do</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s above average, for sure.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel very much like shampoo.</li>
            <li>shampoo worked fine to clean my hair, (medium length, very fine, very naturally curly), and it left my hair soft and as manageable as curly hair can be in a humid summer climate.  </li>
            <li>A huge amount of clear shampoo  Goes well with the moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li>thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li>It gave my hair a lift the first time around with my blow dryer</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have never written a review before</li>
            <li>bottle doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s safe for colour-treated hair, however I have highlighted hair and have been using this product for several weeks with no ill effects on my coloured hair.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks, and I can definitely say I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo and conditioner combo really works for me!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, everyone appeared satisfied and still enjoys this shampoo on the daily routine of life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, but I look forward to even better results as time goes by.</li>
            <li>It is my current favorite, and I intend to buy this well after my freebie runs</li>
            <li>First, it seems they like the over quality, fragrance, and all that stuff.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I did not buy this at first because I figured it was another gimmick</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair that looks greasy pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It is not particularly fragrant and that was cause for satisfaction from those that dislike strong smells emanating from a clean hair.</li>
            <li>It is heavily fragranced with that fruity floral beloved of pretty much all drugstore shampoos--why?</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference from my regular salon shampoo - not a bad product just hasn&#x27;t shown me anything special.</li>
            <li>Most egregiously, it makes my hair stringy and very flat--the opposite of the volumizing effects it claimed to offer.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that is very fine (but a lot of it) and am very prone to flyaways.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Clear&#x27;s Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo wasn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li>they used hacking spam software on some people&#x27;s Facebooks to leave positive comments/reviews on the brands Facebook page to promote their product, and they test this product on animals.</li>
            <li>Having turned the product over to the women-folk for their analysis, it received a positive review.</li>
            <li>My hair also gets oily pretty fast.</li>
            <li>the specific anti-dandruff formula does better with that, but since this shampoo claims to promote hair AND scalp health, I expected better.</li>
            <li>With these conclusions in mind this shampoo get a very decent 4 Stars rating from us.</li>
            <li>It lathers OK but not very much lather... and felt waxy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and wavy; it did a satisfactory job of volumizing, but I can easily see why other reviewers with straight and not-so-fine hair would be left dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say for really fine hair, it works well, but everyone&#x27;s hair is different!  </li>
            <li>I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one month my hair was falling out.</li>
            <li>The shampoo, used along with the conditioner, seems to actually increase fullness of my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants or needs volume for their hair.</li>
            <li>it helped so much</li>
            <li>I really hope my hair will improve with time after discontinuing using this.</li>
            <li>I lose SO much hair in the shower</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve very picky about what hair products I use.</li>
            <li>The container is solid and secure and no unwanted spills were reported when transportation was required.</li>
            <li>works on the whole family</li>
            <li>Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They said this was unusual...  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in my scalp</li>
            <li>But, there really wasn&#x27;t any difference in my scalp&#x27;s condition from before using Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days of using this shampoo (in combination with the matching conditioner), I noticed a nice shine to my hair and the flyaways weren&#x27;t as prevalent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite honestly the only \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; conditioner I have used that actually delivers on that promise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking as someone with fine, oily hair which must be washed everyday in the summer, this leaves my hair clean without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li>It suds up well with not much product and rinses to leave your hair fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better on other hair types, but this is not the stuff for me.</li>
            <li>The product left my hair looking greasy or oily even though it was clean.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair squeaky clean and is something I would buy again.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this one particularly did much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair definitely gets really clean with this shampoo/conditioner team</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a conditioner which helps keep my hair looking full and not flat.</li>
            <li>have a ton of very fine medium blonde hair that is to my lower back and</li>
            <li>A more conventional bottle would improve this product.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are a mix of healthy ingredients and conventional ones.  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo with the same type of conditioner, and my hair looks like its full of body and shiny.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman with menopause and thyroid issues.</li>
            <li>This is a decent shampoo.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo my scalp is not only clear and free of scaly build-up but my hair has never been healthier.</li>
            <li>I have a few that I really like, but I find that my hair is more manageable when I switch between two shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a change in volume, but so far the changes were positive, so I kept using it.  </li>
            <li>I did not have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I think even 3 stars might be a bit too high...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>shampoo smells fantastic and I like it better than Pantene and Herbal Essences and other more expensive salon brands that I&#x27;ve tried like</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice to see a bottle of shampoo that hasn&#x27;t been squeezed so hard</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely even with the hard water here.  </li>
            <li>This product made my (and after researching, many other women&#x27;s) hair fall out!!  </li>
            <li>This is great for someone with thin hair!  </li>
            <li>But for those of us with thinner hair, you&#x27;ll see a more fluffy look to your hair.</li>
            <li>I did like the bottle design, which makes it easy to store upside down</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or conditioner that helps with less tangling, but even before using the conditioner after shampooing my hair feels nice and smooth and soft and not</li>
            <li>I was a bit sceptical about trying a new shampoo again but thought why not?</li>
            <li>I use all high end shampoos but received a sample of Clear.  </li>
            <li>They might as well slap a Nair sticker on the front of it, the product is Clear alright, CLEARS your scalp of hair!</li>
            <li>WOW !</li>
            <li>I went to get my haircut last month and my Hair Dresser seemed pretty worried about the condition of my hair</li>
            <li>For the first time EVER I did not need to wash my hair the next day.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my hair felt a hundred times better...much softer and started to get its shine back.  </li>
            <li>At any rate, my hair, which is fairly short and color treated, washed thoroughly clean with only one lather.  </li>
            <li>After the careful consideration of a team of players, the general consensus was that the CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce works well for most types of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a product that will make your hair look shiny and healthy and still have lots of volume.  </li>
            <li>Clear Scalp does just that.  </li>
            <li>UNTIL Clear came along.</li>
            <li>but I tried Clear Shampoo, Volumizing Root Boost</li>
            <li>I typed \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo..\\&quot; into Google and up popped \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li>The Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty etc.</li>
            <li>I believe alot has to do with the volume properties of the Clear Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clear was on sale</li>
            <li>She said it brought real shine to her hair and left it as soft as can be.</li>
            <li>Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty volumizing root boost nourishing shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Clear Scalp And Hair</li>
            <li>Everyone in my family has tried it and all have remarked on how shiny, soft and bouncy their has looks after just one use.</li>
            <li>and I thought that it made my hair soft and managable at the time.</li>
            <li>I am also sensitive to alot of products.</li>
            <li>It lathers indifferently well, and as far as the scent goes ... meh.</li>
            <li>Naturally I had to try</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised (still am) that it works (in conjunction with the matching conditioner)</li>
            <li>This shampoo promises to add volume to your strands and it is clinically proven to aid  in restoring your scalp&#x27;s natural moisture balance.</li>
            <li>The flyaways are almost completely gone, my hair is shiny and soft, and it definitely has more bounce and volume to it now than it did a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li>This may be a package design that needs to be re-thought.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it comes out of the container feeling quite thick and goopy, rather more like a conditioner than a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know much about shampoo and usually just use the soap from the dispenser at the gym, so my level of expertise in this area is less than zero.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As such, I think this falls rather short of the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the shampoo is all right</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for people with oily, flat, and straight hair.</li>
            <li>After a few more uses, my hair was actually feeling silky and the shine was so apparent that people were commenting on it.</li>
            <li>This made me suspect it may not rinse out as cleanly as my usual brand (Pantene Fine Hair Solutions Volume Shampoo).</li>
            <li>First, I didn&#x27;t use the Clear conditioner, or any other conditioner, with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I shed throughout using it, and it seemed like my normal hair shed, but I didn&#x27;t realize how drastic it actually was.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley, I had a feeling my test results and blood panel would come back as normal, and they were.</li>
            <li>I had fine flat hair and a slight seborrheic dermatitis problem.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any extra \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; than normal, however.</li>
            <li>Everyday I scratch my scalp and get my fingernails full of gunky build-up but today....</li>
            <li>Clear Scalp and Hair  - leaves your hair clear of all products used since the last shampoo!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it necessarily volumizes hair, but it definitely cleans the hair and scalp really well.  </li>
            <li>After all is said and done, I&#x27;ll go back to my old shampoo once I&#x27;m done with this bottle of Clear.</li>
            <li>What a pleasure then to note on first use that it not only supplied more body but was helpful in controlling those unfortunate waves that develop with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is very tricky, because you&#x27;ll think that your hairis just shedding normal, but one day you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of hair you used to have is SIGNIFICANTLY less after continued use of this product.</li>
            <li>It has Nutrium 10 which is an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C &amp; E, sunflower, almond, soybean &amp; coconut oils &amp; aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>I will offer two caveats to my general observation.  </li>
            <li>read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....</li>
            <li>used the Clear shampoo both before and after I had a haircut, and the result was the same.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised that it actually did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>Finally, as ofther reviewers have mentioned, the product can get gloppy; the bottle gets blocked up pretty frequently, even though I&#x27;m careful not to leave it open or spill any shampoo around the opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I loved them both and will definitely buy these products in the future.  </li>
            <li>think this shampoo builds up over time; I get good results with occasional use, but regular use makes for a sorry, drowned-rat effect.</li>
            <li>In sum, this shampoo is okay but not great.</li>
            <li>Usually I prefer fragrance-free but this is not bad</li>
            <li>I was a bit frantic loosing so much hair with the other products</li>
            <li>With the first use, my hair, which is currently dry from daily swimming, was softer than it had been with a much more expensive salon brand.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands in my lifetime of over 60 years looking for the right shampoo for my hair but always was disappointed and had to settle for what ever worked for awhile.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think they studied the long term effects of this product and even though the ingredients list has the same as a lot of other shampoos, I&#x27;m now convinced that something else is in this shampoo.</li>

            <li> all shampoos guarantee they are the best thing for your hair etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great shampoo at a GREAT PRICE!  </li>
            <li> It must not happen to everyone since there are some good reviews but who would want to take the chance?!?</li>
            <li> I had also hoped that it might be good for my scalp, but I did not find it especially good in that regard either.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and it gives me volume</li>
            <li> Great Product ..</li>
            <li> Great product for aging hair</li>
            <li> Great stuff.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, my hair was manageable and styled very nicely with plenty of lift at the root.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be buying this again once my review samples run out, it gives good results at a great price.</li>
            <li> I loved it and got great results; however, I was no fan of the overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used this shampoo yet but have read great review of the product...</li>
            <li> and I had heard it was good,</li>
            <li> you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck.  </li>
            <li> My wife used this product and has nothing but good to say about it.</li>
            <li> She has told everyone how good it is.</li>
            <li> It also does a good job removing product build-up.</li>
            <li> My hair loved it, and that means</li>
            <li> It is true, this stuff DOES make you lose hair!!!</li>
            <li> gave two stars because the shampoo does have a pleasant smell and a nice lather.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo to be nice but nothing exceptional.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light and pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> They love it too!</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have to keep two bottles of shampoo in the house because I love it too!</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so good nor has it ever been this easy to manage!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own thing</li>
            <li> i love it smell good.</li>
            <li> I have to have a brush handy to keep it</li>
            <li> A couple do nothing for the body but smell really nice.  </li>
            <li> Upon application, I found that the lather was abundant.  </li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo on her, and found her hair kept the fragrance and had a nice shine and bounce to it.  </li>
            <li> While I liked the scentand the lather, the results on my hair were negligible.  </li>
            <li> I found this shampoo&#x27;s fragrance not to my liking but to each his own.  </li>
            <li> It is shiny and smooth and feels LIGHT !!!</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves your hair nice clean and bouncy</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing to apply , and doesn&#x27;t over-foam like SO many competitor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very strongly scented,  somewhere between fruity and floral.  </li>
            <li> It does clear out all my product build-up and any dandruff wonderfully!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and need a product that will give me volume without heaviness</li>
            <li> I bought the Volumizing version since I have very fine,</li>
            <li> hair is very fine and has thinned over the years.  </li>
            <li> this is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and very delighted with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I don&#x27;t especially love the smell.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like something more floral or citrusy.  </li>
            <li> I believe you will be pleasantly satisfied just like me.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say much more about it</li>
            <li> I love this volumizing shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I tried this and love the smell</li>
            <li> Shampoo leaks out of the top where the two pieces are combined and also leaks out the lid.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many times I would rinse my hair</li>
            <li> this stuff is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and can&#x27;t find it in the stores</li>
            <li> Most make my hair feel waxy.  </li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, rinses clean quickly, removes the tons of product I tend to lavish on my locks to cement them into place, and my hair looks really good all the time.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly better than many of the salon brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> so many shampoos have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be picking more up soon.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t notice any claims about a period of time for it to work) before one can be sure.  </li>
            <li> So, perhaps this shampoo works better on thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry, many like this shampoo, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I saw results after one use and keep seeing healthy hair after each continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> so it is not suppose to be used as one make sure to read directions before you use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure this product makes my hair look any thicker, but it does appear to have more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle, I was pleased with the pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> But, my first hint that the product&#x27;s performance wouldn&#x27;t match its presentation occurred when the shampoo&#x27;s very nice scent dissipated quickly after I rinsed my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is thefirst time I have loved a shampoo and conditioner through the whole bottle...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it has a horrendously strong perfumey chemical fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I bought it and the conditioner!  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to it, though, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> It also tends to get stringy and tangled throughout the day because it&#x27;s so fine.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice light scent and a pretty lavender color.  </li>
            <li> Not a lot is required for a full head of suds, but more importantly is the softness and shine it gives your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it as a quick pick and love it.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell but not heavy like some.</li>
            <li> I leave the shower feeling like my hair and my scalp are squeeky clean and it stays clean for more than a day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this shampoo, because it seemed too inexpensive to be very good, but it was on a great sale</li>
            <li> I color my hair which makes it equally important to have a shampoo that works well.</li>
            <li> but this is a great shampoo to alternate with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...</li>
            <li> It lathers easily and rinses cleanly.</li>
            <li> Second, the design is great.</li>
            <li> All the buildup on my scalp is gone and my hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Their motto is &#x27;starting at the right end of the hair and nurishing the scalp for beautiful hair&#x27;..</li>
            <li> Which is probably a good thing since most volumizing shampoos actually dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> I used this CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner this week and am enjoying very light and bouncy</li>
            <li> Use the products you know work.. and stop looking for miracle cures at super cheap price...</li>
            <li> I like the clean smell</li>
            <li> and it does rinse out clean but the increase in volume wasn&#x27;t anything to run home about.  </li>
            <li> Rather invigorating and rinse clean.</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean and refreshed after shampooing with this.</li>
            <li> , it does not have too strong a perfume smell, but a clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li> My hair did feel clean afterwards except for a bit of buildup of scent and waxy</li>
            <li> Take it or leave it alone, nothing particularly special.</li>
            <li> I only use it on weekends to get a good clean.</li>
            <li> I was using this shampoo and conditioner for months and months pretty much since it came out, I actually really liked it</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the luxuriously thick lather.  </li>
            <li> it really works i love.</li>
            <li> This volumizing shampoo should probably be used with a conditioner from this CLEAR product line, but even without the separate conditioner, this is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> (Full disclosure</li>
            <li> I have truly been getting better results than I had been getting from a salon brand costing over three times as much.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair, but it makes my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li> Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> not bad smell in my hair.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to spill at first.  </li>
            <li> I would have like bold spots in my hair that I could cover my mom</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also soft and very easy to style.</li>
            <li> I have now been using the shampoo daily for almost a week and am very pleased with the softness of my hair while still getting the volume I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this brand has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting new product.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance and my hair feels really clean and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t have much fullness.</li>
            <li> My hair is left feeling soft, full and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;) makes hair super soft and shiny</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the fragrant, but not overpowering, clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I love the Clear Shampoo, Volumizing Root Boost</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It is overly fragrant with a girly teen kind of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself comes out in a goopy non clear form, so it looks more like a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> product is worth the money</li>
            <li> It does leave your hair feeling clean with no build up which seems to be a big problem with most shampoos.</li>
            <li> Happily, the fragrance in  this one is far less overwhelming, and the results as just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, silky, and clean and helps keep it tangle-free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in the market for new product that will add volume without weight to my not-so-fine fine hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> I am very fussy about my shampoo as I have fine straight hair that loves to do</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s above average, for sure.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel very much like shampoo.</li>
            <li> shampoo worked fine to clean my hair, (medium length, very fine, very naturally curly), and it left my hair soft and as manageable as curly hair can be in a humid summer climate.  </li>
            <li> A huge amount of clear shampoo  Goes well with the moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a lift the first time around with my blow dryer</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have never written a review before</li>
            <li> bottle doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s safe for colour-treated hair, however I have highlighted hair and have been using this product for several weeks with no ill effects on my coloured hair.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks, and I can definitely say I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo and conditioner combo really works for me!</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, everyone appeared satisfied and still enjoys this shampoo on the daily routine of life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, but I look forward to even better results as time goes by.</li>
            <li> It is my current favorite, and I intend to buy this well after my freebie runs</li>
            <li> First, it seems they like the over quality, fragrance, and all that stuff.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this at first because I figured it was another gimmick</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair that looks greasy pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It is not particularly fragrant and that was cause for satisfaction from those that dislike strong smells emanating from a clean hair.</li>
            <li> It is heavily fragranced with that fruity floral beloved of pretty much all drugstore shampoos--why?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference from my regular salon shampoo - not a bad product just hasn&#x27;t shown me anything special.</li>
            <li> Most egregiously, it makes my hair stringy and very flat--the opposite of the volumizing effects it claimed to offer.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is very fine (but a lot of it) and am very prone to flyaways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Clear&#x27;s Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo wasn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li> they used hacking spam software on some people&#x27;s Facebooks to leave positive comments/reviews on the brands Facebook page to promote their product, and they test this product on animals.</li>
            <li> Having turned the product over to the women-folk for their analysis, it received a positive review.</li>
            <li> My hair also gets oily pretty fast.</li>
            <li> the specific anti-dandruff formula does better with that, but since this shampoo claims to promote hair AND scalp health, I expected better.</li>
            <li> With these conclusions in mind this shampoo get a very decent 4 Stars rating from us.</li>
            <li> It lathers OK but not very much lather... and felt waxy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and wavy; it did a satisfactory job of volumizing, but I can easily see why other reviewers with straight and not-so-fine hair would be left dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say for really fine hair, it works well, but everyone&#x27;s hair is different!  </li>
            <li> I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one month my hair was falling out.</li>
            <li> The shampoo, used along with the conditioner, seems to actually increase fullness of my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants or needs volume for their hair.</li>
            <li> it helped so much</li>
            <li> I really hope my hair will improve with time after discontinuing using this.</li>
            <li> I lose SO much hair in the shower</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve very picky about what hair products I use.</li>
            <li> The container is solid and secure and no unwanted spills were reported when transportation was required.</li>
            <li> works on the whole family</li>
            <li> Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They said this was unusual...  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in my scalp</li>
            <li> But, there really wasn&#x27;t any difference in my scalp&#x27;s condition from before using Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days of using this shampoo (in combination with the matching conditioner), I noticed a nice shine to my hair and the flyaways weren&#x27;t as prevalent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite honestly the only \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; conditioner I have used that actually delivers on that promise.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking as someone with fine, oily hair which must be washed everyday in the summer, this leaves my hair clean without feeling stripped.</li>
            <li> It suds up well with not much product and rinses to leave your hair fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better on other hair types, but this is not the stuff for me.</li>
            <li> The product left my hair looking greasy or oily even though it was clean.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair squeaky clean and is something I would buy again.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this one particularly did much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair definitely gets really clean with this shampoo/conditioner team</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a conditioner which helps keep my hair looking full and not flat.</li>
            <li> have a ton of very fine medium blonde hair that is to my lower back and</li>
            <li> A more conventional bottle would improve this product.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are a mix of healthy ingredients and conventional ones.  </li>
            <li> I use this shampoo with the same type of conditioner, and my hair looks like its full of body and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman with menopause and thyroid issues.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo my scalp is not only clear and free of scaly build-up but my hair has never been healthier.</li>
            <li> I have a few that I really like, but I find that my hair is more manageable when I switch between two shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a change in volume, but so far the changes were positive, so I kept using it.  </li>
            <li> I did not have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I think even 3 stars might be a bit too high...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> shampoo smells fantastic and I like it better than Pantene and Herbal Essences and other more expensive salon brands that I&#x27;ve tried like</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to see a bottle of shampoo that hasn&#x27;t been squeezed so hard</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely even with the hard water here.  </li>
            <li> This product made my (and after researching, many other women&#x27;s) hair fall out!!  </li>
            <li> This is great for someone with thin hair!  </li>
            <li> But for those of us with thinner hair, you&#x27;ll see a more fluffy look to your hair.</li>
            <li> I did like the bottle design, which makes it easy to store upside down</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or conditioner that helps with less tangling, but even before using the conditioner after shampooing my hair feels nice and smooth and soft and not</li>
            <li> I was a bit sceptical about trying a new shampoo again but thought why not?</li>
            <li> I use all high end shampoos but received a sample of Clear.  </li>
            <li> They might as well slap a Nair sticker on the front of it, the product is Clear alright, CLEARS your scalp of hair!</li>
            <li> WOW !</li>
            <li> I went to get my haircut last month and my Hair Dresser seemed pretty worried about the condition of my hair</li>
            <li> For the first time EVER I did not need to wash my hair the next day.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my hair felt a hundred times better...much softer and started to get its shine back.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, my hair, which is fairly short and color treated, washed thoroughly clean with only one lather.  </li>
            <li> After the careful consideration of a team of players, the general consensus was that the CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce works well for most types of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product that will make your hair look shiny and healthy and still have lots of volume.  </li>
            <li> Clear Scalp does just that.  </li>
            <li> UNTIL Clear came along.</li>
            <li> but I tried Clear Shampoo, Volumizing Root Boost</li>
            <li> I typed \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo..\\&quot; into Google and up popped \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty etc.</li>
            <li> I believe alot has to do with the volume properties of the Clear Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clear was on sale</li>
            <li> She said it brought real shine to her hair and left it as soft as can be.</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty volumizing root boost nourishing shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Clear Scalp And Hair</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family has tried it and all have remarked on how shiny, soft and bouncy their has looks after just one use.</li>
            <li> and I thought that it made my hair soft and managable at the time.</li>
            <li> I am also sensitive to alot of products.</li>
            <li> It lathers indifferently well, and as far as the scent goes ... meh.</li>
            <li> Naturally I had to try</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised (still am) that it works (in conjunction with the matching conditioner)</li>
            <li> This shampoo promises to add volume to your strands and it is clinically proven to aid  in restoring your scalp&#x27;s natural moisture balance.</li>
            <li> The flyaways are almost completely gone, my hair is shiny and soft, and it definitely has more bounce and volume to it now than it did a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li> This may be a package design that needs to be re-thought.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it comes out of the container feeling quite thick and goopy, rather more like a conditioner than a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know much about shampoo and usually just use the soap from the dispenser at the gym, so my level of expertise in this area is less than zero.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As such, I think this falls rather short of the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the shampoo is all right</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for people with oily, flat, and straight hair.</li>
            <li> After a few more uses, my hair was actually feeling silky and the shine was so apparent that people were commenting on it.</li>
            <li> This made me suspect it may not rinse out as cleanly as my usual brand (Pantene Fine Hair Solutions Volume Shampoo).</li>
            <li> First, I didn&#x27;t use the Clear conditioner, or any other conditioner, with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I shed throughout using it, and it seemed like my normal hair shed, but I didn&#x27;t realize how drastic it actually was.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley, I had a feeling my test results and blood panel would come back as normal, and they were.</li>
            <li> I had fine flat hair and a slight seborrheic dermatitis problem.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any extra \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; than normal, however.</li>
            <li> Everyday I scratch my scalp and get my fingernails full of gunky build-up but today....</li>
            <li> Clear Scalp and Hair  - leaves your hair clear of all products used since the last shampoo!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it necessarily volumizes hair, but it definitely cleans the hair and scalp really well.  </li>
            <li> After all is said and done, I&#x27;ll go back to my old shampoo once I&#x27;m done with this bottle of Clear.</li>
            <li> What a pleasure then to note on first use that it not only supplied more body but was helpful in controlling those unfortunate waves that develop with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is very tricky, because you&#x27;ll think that your hairis just shedding normal, but one day you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of hair you used to have is SIGNIFICANTLY less after continued use of this product.</li>
            <li> It has Nutrium 10 which is an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C &amp; E, sunflower, almond, soybean &amp; coconut oils &amp; aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> I will offer two caveats to my general observation.  </li>
            <li> read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....</li>
            <li> used the Clear shampoo both before and after I had a haircut, and the result was the same.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised that it actually did what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> Finally, as ofther reviewers have mentioned, the product can get gloppy; the bottle gets blocked up pretty frequently, even though I&#x27;m careful not to leave it open or spill any shampoo around the opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I loved them both and will definitely buy these products in the future.  </li>
            <li> think this shampoo builds up over time; I get good results with occasional use, but regular use makes for a sorry, drowned-rat effect.</li>
            <li> In sum, this shampoo is okay but not great.</li>
            <li> Usually I prefer fragrance-free but this is not bad</li>
            <li> I was a bit frantic loosing so much hair with the other products</li>
            <li> With the first use, my hair, which is currently dry from daily swimming, was softer than it had been with a much more expensive salon brand.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many brands in my lifetime of over 60 years looking for the right shampoo for my hair but always was disappointed and had to settle for what ever worked for awhile.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think they studied the long term effects of this product and even though the ingredients list has the same as a lot of other shampoos, I&#x27;m now convinced that something else is in this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me, didn&#x27;t give me volume at all and still leaves it extra flat.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product as a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoo (aka NOT Head and Shoulders) that would also mitigate symptoms of dry scalp (though this is not the dandruff formula, it does contain zinc pyrithione, which is the active ingredient in dandruff shampoos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always ended up with what looked like dry skin/dandruff but was actually shampoos left over.</li>
            <li> It has a flat end to stand it upright in shower or bath</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten extremely thinned out, so much to the point that I don&#x27;t even want to wear my hair down anymore.</li>
            <li> Now I am on the search for something that will help my flat and oily hair again!</li>
            <li> course, it&#x27;s stupid concept to begin with--the only way to \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; your hair or scalp is by eating good food.</li>
            <li> And...its been working for a long time now which is another problem, I start off and something works</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> However, it is not clear; it is milky.</li>
            <li> (opening end is down to enable use of that final last drop.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was running out of my usual shampoo and decided to try a new product.</li>
            <li> I typically use natural shampoos so am not used to strong artificial fragrances...</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a shampoo that will provide me with softness and manageability without the need for a daily conditioner since conditioner tends to weigh my hair down and make it appear flat.  </li>
            <li> I am now switched to a different shampoo and using It&#x27;s A 10 and some other hair repair products and hoping and praying my hair will recover and grow to how it was before.</li>
            <li> whatever is in here wrecks the scalp if you use this on a long term basis!</li>
            <li> The disappearing scent was matched by little, if any, volumizing, and no root boost, as evidenced by the number of fly-aways that I had after starting my use of the shampoo (equal to the number I had before using this shampoo).  </li>
            <li> I have not felt to oily, to dry or to anything.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance, but I didn&#x27;t notice it once my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li> I would buy this just for the fact it does rinse clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind!</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasing and lingers even after your hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> I will say that my scalp didn&#x27;t dry out from using the product.  </li>
            <li> Cleared my dry scalp problems in just three shampoos.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the smell of the shampoo isn&#x27;t good or bad, and it&#x27;s not strong either....</li>
            <li> I have tried pantene and aussies products but both have made me loose alot of hair.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and made a Doctors appointment and in the meantime I was trying to think of the reasons this could be happening.</li>
            <li> That said, my jaw-length hair is not weighed down and I didn&#x27;t use or need to use any extra conditioning product either.</li>
            <li> Nourishing - if your hair tends to be dry - you will want to try this shampoo!</li>
            <li> take a pass on this one and stick with something less obviously scented.</li>
            <li> If these results continue through to the end of the bottle, I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this again, especially since it&#x27;s way cheaper than the shampoos I usually buy.  </li>
            <li> Second, while I have slightly wavy hair with medium body, my six-year-old daughter has very thick straight hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having heard a lot about Clear&#x27;s products (and as the frequent sufferer of \\&quot;bad hair days\\&quot;), I was looking forward to trying Clear&#x27;s Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> As for the volumizing part, people who have heavy or thick hair might not notice much of a lift.</li>
            <li> Not really by choice , just kinda</li>
            <li> Despite being a volumizing shampoo, I actually found this to be a bit heavy for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I had thin hair, but a decent amount of it.</li>
            <li> Had long hair in the 70&#x27;s , and a little shorter every decade since.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t realize it was the other products until I stopped using them.</li>
            <li> As noted by some other reviewers, my sample of this product also leaked in transit.</li>
            <li> I shampoo my hair about every other day or</li>
            <li> So I end up rotating it out with my other lighter shampoos throughout the week.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get any volume as I do with other volume brands.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;d used a combination shampoo+conditioner--which is a scary thing to a person with fine, thin, limp, hair, such as might be expected to choose a volumizing root boost shampoo.</li>
            <li> Interesting though, while humidity (of which we have little here in Denver) is my hair&#x27;s worst enemy, rain on a Clear Scalp shampoo day did not raise that dreaded halo of frizz.</li>
            <li> The amount offered versus the pricing makes this product your average purchase.</li>
            <li> Some dry it out even worse than I thought possible.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out.  </li>
            <li> This has cleared my husbands dandruff problem without any of the harsh smells or chemicals that come with some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I have bought volumizing shampoos and they have left my hair feeling dull and heavy.</li>
            <li> I see less hair in the drain after using this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> but this isn&#x27;t a matter of taste or opinion, it is actually quite serious.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just odd.</li>
            <li> So yeah, odd, but</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels silky in use and leaves my hair the same way but with a subtle added body boost.  </li>
            <li> The bottle can be stored with the tab at the bottom so that you don&#x27;t have to shake the living daylights out of it when it gets half full.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used about half the bottle and threw the rest away.  </li>
            <li> As a few other people have mentioned on makeupalley.com, it seems to shrink the follicles of the hair or something!</li>
            <li> Not just a little, A LOT.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s basically just a sort of bland, fresh smell which isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got hair that on a bad day has the texture and attractiveness level of tiny feathers, completely uncontrollable and lacking in body and focus.  </li>
            <li> , I used with the conditioner and it was too heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> For someone who is plagued with thin hair this shampoo does, indeed, revitalize somewhat the hair and scalp, but the results are probably in prolonged use of the same</li>
            <li> is shiny and not weighed down by excessive product</li>
            <li> However, I noticed my hair and scalp felt slightly grungier than usual the day after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> It started after the first few uses and is dramatic- like handfuls!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what a five star shampoo would consist of, so I&#x27;m giving it just four stars.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase salon shampoos which range from $15 - $20 per bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is aromatic, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I usually get from fragranced products.  </li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews on this shampoo, I was a little worried that I was in for yet another disappointing, weighted-down hair experience.  </li>
            <li> so it is hard to give it volume because of the weight, but</li>
            <li> BUY IT -- or at least try it once.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Called the manufacturer and complained.  </li>
            <li> because:&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent to it - not that awful fake apple smell that</li>
            <li> This is a creamy and thick formulation that cleans styling products out of my hair without stripping it.  </li>
            <li> While the shampoo did look like thick milk, I wasn&#x27;t bothered by its appearance.  </li>
            <li> you are used to a thick coverage with your shampoo/conditioner (i.e lather and creamy conditioner)</li>
            <li> We find this fragrance truly awful (and overpowering), and it completely undermines any concept of \\&quot;clear\\&quot; or \\&quot;pure\\&quot; or \\&quot;less unhealthy\\&quot; in our minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well no more!!  </li>
            <li> and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse.</li>
            <li> However, the bottle is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s a bit thin</li>
            <li> and no (or way less) painful snags.</li>
            <li> To bad it is so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> would buy me expensive shampoos that always said it would make your hair grow of course</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just read review after review of hair loss and thinning hair from this shampoo on this site as well as Makeupalley.com- reviews of people who also went to the doctor and had blood work done to see if anything was wrong.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is scary.</li>
            <li> I think something is horribly wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I have gone through everything on the market and it gets quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of not brushing my hair sometimes, and struggle with brushing, I have noticed brushing my hair is like silk now</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I have been disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will help others before they have to suffer from a stupid mistake of using this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo and was very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I feel compelled to write a review on this product because of the damage it has done to my hair. I have fine, thin hair and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for a new product that will be the latest and greatest, this is not it!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TAKE CAUTION THIS PRODUCT CAN MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT AND IRRITATE YOUR SCALP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues with hair breakage to begin with and I just didnt connect the dots that this shampoo and conditioner was making it worse. But after reading the reviews I cannot believe that there are so many people that are having this issue and these products remain on the market. FYI... if you scalp burns like fire for a good 20 minutes after getting out of the shower, it&#x27;s not a good thing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a quick pick and love it. It smells great and leaves your hair nice clean and bouncy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product that will make your hair look shiny and healthy and still have lots of volume.  Clear Scalp does just that.  I was very impressed with the luxuriously thick lather.  It almost feels like whipped cream once you start scrunching it around in your hair.  I love it.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I don&#x27;t especially love the smell.  I think they were going for something that would appeal to men or women so it&#x27;s basically just a sort of bland, fresh smell which isn&#x27;t bad but I&#x27;d like something more floral or citrusy.  At any rate, my hair, which is fairly short and color treated, washed thoroughly clean with only one lather.  I went on to use the corresponding conditioner and that review is posted with the conditioner.  Needless to say, I loved them both and will definitely buy these products in the future.  Everyone in my family has tried it and all have remarked on how shiny, soft and bouncy their has looks after just one use.</li>
            <li> WOW ! I have Loooong hair, and am shocked to how this product has changed my life!! To bad it is so hard to find in stores. I have a bad habit of not brushing my hair sometimes, and struggle with brushing, I have noticed brushing my hair is like silk now and no (or way less) painful snags. It is shiny and smooth and feels LIGHT !!! I have not felt to oily, to dry or to anything. What a great product, please don&#x27;t change a thing!! This is thefirst time I have loved a shampoo and conditioner through the whole bottle... thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> I had never heard about this shampoo before I was asked to try it and write a review. I am very fussy about my shampoo as I have fine straight hair that loves to do it&#x27;s own thing no matter what you do. I color my hair which makes it equally important to have a shampoo that works well. I have tried so many brands in my lifetime of over 60 years looking for the right shampoo for my hair but always was disappointed and had to settle for what ever worked for awhile. UNTIL Clear came along. I was a bit sceptical about trying a new shampoo again but thought why not? So I did and I was really surprised that it actually did what it said it would do. It does give you volume. It does leave your hair feeling clean with no build up which seems to be a big problem with most shampoos. I have a skin alergy and this shampoo did not give me a problem at all. The big thhing is no build up of unrinsed shampoo left over. I leave the shower feeling like my hair and my scalp are squeeky clean and it stays clean for more than a day. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who wants or needs volume for their hair. It gave my hair a lift the first time around with my blow dryer and I did not have to go to the salon to get a salon look. Since I visit a salon every month for a cut, shape, and color that means something to me. BUY IT -- or at least try it once. I believe you will be pleasantly satisfied just like me.</li>
            <li> Love it I also bought one for each of my Daughters They love it too!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used this shampoo yet but have read great review of the product...can&#x27;t say much more about it</li>
            <li> Not bad.  A huge amount of clear shampoo  Goes well with the moisturizing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the Clear Shampoo, Volumizing Root Boost i&#x27;m a cancer survivor and my hair wasn&#x27;t growing back I would have like bold spots in my hair that I could cover my mom would buy me expensive shampoos that always said it would make your hair grow of course it didn&#x27;t work but I tried Clear Shampoo, Volumizing Root Boost it helped so much and I want to get the word out that this shampoo and conditioner should be recommend  to people who&#x27;ve had cancer it really works i love.</li>
            <li> I love this volumizing shampoo.  Cannot find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling stronger and cleaner.  I see less hair in the drain after using this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> This volumizing shampoo should probably be used with a conditioner from this CLEAR product line, but even without the separate conditioner, this is a nice product.  I&#x27;m not sure what a five star shampoo would consist of, so I&#x27;m giving it just four stars.  I think it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s above average, for sure.</li>
            <li> I was using this shampoo and conditioner for months and months pretty much since it came out, I actually really liked it and I thought that it made my hair soft and managable at the time. I went to get my haircut last month and my Hair Dresser seemed pretty worried about the condition of my hair, it was breaking. I was worried that maybe I had a health issue or maybe it was the generic birth control that I switched to recently instead of name brand. I finally broke down and made a Doctors appointment and in the meantime I was trying to think of the reasons this could be happening. I typed \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo..\\&quot; into Google and up popped \\&quot;Clear Scalp Shampoo Hair Loss\\&quot; in the suggestions box.. Panic immediatly set in. I&#x27;ve just read review after review of hair loss and thinning hair from this shampoo on this site as well as Makeupalley.com- reviews of people who also went to the doctor and had blood work done to see if anything was wrong. I had thin hair, but a decent amount of it. My hair has gotten extremely thinned out, so much to the point that I don&#x27;t even want to wear my hair down anymore. I shed throughout using it, and it seemed like my normal hair shed, but I didn&#x27;t realize how drastic it actually was. They might as well slap a Nair sticker on the front of it, the product is Clear alright, CLEARS your scalp of hair! I really don&#x27;t think they studied the long term effects of this product and even though the ingredients list has the same as a lot of other shampoos, I&#x27;m now convinced that something else is in this shampoo. As a few other people have mentioned on makeupalley.com, it seems to shrink the follicles of the hair or something! I really hope my hair will improve with time after discontinuing using this. I am now switched to a different shampoo and using It&#x27;s A 10 and some other hair repair products and hoping and praying my hair will recover and grow to how it was before. This shampoo and conditioner is very tricky, because you&#x27;ll think that your hairis just shedding normal, but one day you&#x27;ll notice that the amount of hair you used to have is SIGNIFICANTLY less after continued use of this product. Don&#x27;t let it fool you! Upon further investigation- they used hacking spam software on some people&#x27;s Facebooks to leave positive comments/reviews on the brands Facebook page to promote their product, and they test this product on animals. Their motto is &#x27;starting at the right end of the hair and nurishing the scalp for beautiful hair&#x27;.. whatever is in here wrecks the scalp if you use this on a long term basis! This shampoo and conditioner is scary. I think something is horribly wrong with this product. After reading all the reviews on Amazon and Makeup Alley, I had a feeling my test results and blood panel would come back as normal, and they were. Please write your review here and on makeupalley.com if you&#x27;ve had a similar experience! Hopefully it will help others before they have to suffer from a stupid mistake of using this product. I wish I would have found out sooner!</li>
            <li> It is true, this stuff DOES make you lose hair!!! I lose SO much hair in the shower and I thought it was just me but after reading these reviews, it&#x27;s actually the shampoo. This stuff smells great and it gives me volume but I will no longer be purchasing because of the hair loss.</li>
            <li> This produce did nothing for the condition of my hair.. Use the products you know work.. and stop looking for miracle cures at super cheap price...</li>
            <li> I am an older woman with menopause and thyroid issues. I am also sensitive to alot of products. I have tried pantene and aussies products but both have made me loose alot of hair.  I tried this and love the smell, I used with the conditioner and it was too heavy for my hair.  so I tried this shampoo along wit vo5 extra body conditioner, you don&#x27;t need alot and it works! And...its been working for a long time now which is another problem, I start off and something works and then it stops. I was a bit frantic loosing so much hair with the other products, I didn&#x27;t realize it was the other products until I stopped using them. so I just wanted to write this is hopes it might help some others out there too. I have gone through everything on the market and it gets quite expensive. hope this helps.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have never written a review before but this isn&#x27;t a matter of taste or opinion, it is actually quite serious. This product made my (and after researching, many other women&#x27;s) hair fall out!!  I am fascinated that they can keep selling it. It started after the first few uses and is dramatic- like handfuls!!  It must not happen to everyone since there are some good reviews but who would want to take the chance?!?</li>
            <li> i love it smell good.</li>
            <li> Great Product ..AAAAA ++++++</li>
            <li> This is a creamy and thick formulation that cleans styling products out of my hair without stripping it.  My hair is left feeling soft, full and smelling great.  I&#x27;m a big Pantene fan but this is a great shampoo to alternate with.  I didn&#x27;t need a conditioner which helps keep my hair looking full and not flat.</li>
            <li> As noted by some other reviewers, my sample of this product also leaked in transit. This may be a package design that needs to be re-thought.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it comes out of the container feeling quite thick and goopy, rather more like a conditioner than a shampoo. It didn&#x27;t feel very much like shampoo. It lathers indifferently well, and as far as the scent goes ... meh. Take it or leave it alone, nothing particularly special. My hair is very fine and wavy; it did a satisfactory job of volumizing, but I can easily see why other reviewers with straight and not-so-fine hair would be left dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty shampoo.  It has a pleasant fragrance and my hair feels really clean and not weighed down.  However, the bottle is poorly designed.  Shampoo leaks out of the top where the two pieces are combined and also leaks out the lid.  A more conventional bottle would improve this product.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and I&#x27;ve very picky about what hair products I use. It leaves my hair soft, silky, and clean and helps keep it tangle-free! (Full disclosure: I use this shampoo w/ the matching conditioner 99% of the time so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or conditioner that helps with less tangling, but even before using the conditioner after shampooing my hair feels nice and smooth and soft and not knotty.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells fantastic and I like it better than Pantene and Herbal Essences and other more expensive salon brands that I&#x27;ve tried like Paul Mitchell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s safe for colour-treated hair, however I have highlighted hair and have been using this product for several weeks with no ill effects on my coloured hair. Your mileage may vary of course.</li>
            <li> The selling point of this shampoo is that it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens so, theoretically, the target market for these is the health-conscious.  As such, I think this falls rather short of the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the shampoo is all right; it&#x27;s a bit thin so it&#x27;s easy to spill at first.  Once you get used to it, though, it&#x27;s fine.  It lathers well, and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it has a horrendously strong perfumey chemical fragrance.  We find this fragrance truly awful (and overpowering), and it completely undermines any concept of \\&quot;clear\\&quot; or \\&quot;pure\\&quot; or \\&quot;less unhealthy\\&quot; in our minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll take a pass on this one and stick with something less obviously scented.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying this shampoo, because it seemed too inexpensive to be very good, but it was on a great sale so I decided to go for it.  I have long hair that is very fine (but a lot of it) and am very prone to flyaways. My hair also gets oily pretty fast. It also tends to get stringy and tangled throughout the day because it&#x27;s so fine. I have to have a brush handy to keep it nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of using this shampoo (in combination with the matching conditioner), I noticed a nice shine to my hair and the flyaways weren&#x27;t as prevalent. I didn&#x27;t notice a change in volume, but so far the changes were positive, so I kept using it.  Now I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks, and I can definitely say I love this shampoo.  The flyaways are almost completely gone, my hair is shiny and soft, and it definitely has more bounce and volume to it now than it did a few weeks ago. My hair also isn&#x27;t ending up so stringy and tangled by the end of the day.  If these results continue through to the end of the bottle, I&#x27;ll definitely be getting this again, especially since it&#x27;s way cheaper than the shampoos I usually buy.  Plus it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews are varied on this shampoo, and hair type seems to be the biggest factor.  I&#x27;d say for really fine hair, it works well, but everyone&#x27;s hair is different!  Personally, it worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> The Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty etc. shampoo worked fine to clean my hair, (medium length, very fine, very naturally curly), and it left my hair soft and as manageable as curly hair can be in a humid summer climate.  However, I noticed my hair and scalp felt slightly grungier than usual the day after shampooing.  This made me suspect it may not rinse out as cleanly as my usual brand (Pantene Fine Hair Solutions Volume Shampoo). The shampoo is very strongly scented,  somewhere between fruity and floral.  I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance, but I didn&#x27;t notice it once my hair was dry.  Presumably it is being packed differently when shipped to retailers, as I, too, had shampoo all over the package when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I have baby-fine hair, but tons of it.  I usually purchase salon shampoos which range from $15 - $20 per bottle.  I am always looking for a shampoo that will provide me with softness and manageability without the need for a daily conditioner since conditioner tends to weigh my hair down and make it appear flat.  When I first opened the bottle, I was pleased with the pleasant scent.  It is aromatic, but not overwhelming.  With the first use, my hair, which is currently dry from daily swimming, was softer than it had been with a much more expensive salon brand.  I was worried that the softness might lead to a flatter appearance.  To my surprise, my hair was manageable and styled very nicely with plenty of lift at the root.  I have now been using the shampoo daily for almost a week and am very pleased with the softness of my hair while still getting the volume I am looking for.  I have truly been getting better results than I had been getting from a salon brand costing over three times as much.  I recommend you try this product!</li>
            <li> I used this CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner this week and am enjoying very light and bouncy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a ton of very fine medium blonde hair that is to my lower back and this shampoo and conditioner combo really works for me! I shampoo my hair about every other day or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again once my review samples run out, it gives good results at a great price.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo and was very disappointed.  The product left my hair looking greasy or oily even though it was clean.  This wasn&#x27;t later in the day, but as soon as I finished using it.  It also did not increase the volume of my hair.  I had also hoped that it might be good for my scalp, but I did not find it especially good in that regard either.</li>
            <li> I found this shampoo to be nice but nothing exceptional.  I like the clean smell and it does rinse out clean but the increase in volume wasn&#x27;t anything to run home about.  I would buy this just for the fact it does rinse clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind!</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo. However, it is not clear; it is milky. It is heavily fragranced with that fruity floral beloved of pretty much all drugstore shampoos--why? It left my hair feeling coated and silky--like I&#x27;d used a combination shampoo+conditioner--which is a scary thing to a person with fine, thin, limp, hair, such as might be expected to choose a volumizing root boost shampoo. I cannot imagine who would use the matching conditioner.That said, my jaw-length hair is not weighed down and I didn&#x27;t use or need to use any extra conditioning product either. It is overly fragrant with a girly teen kind of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it&#x27;s stupid concept to begin with--the only way to \\&quot;nourish\\&quot; your hair or scalp is by eating good food. You can condition it, which is what this does well enough. I might buy it again if it just weren&#x27;t so perfumed!! If I got a migraine, I&#x27;d need to wash my hair!</li>
            <li> After the careful consideration of a team of players, the general consensus was that the CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce works well for most types of hair. It is not particularly fragrant and that was cause for satisfaction from those that dislike strong smells emanating from a clean hair. The amount offered versus the pricing makes this product your average purchase. For someone who is plagued with thin hair this shampoo does, indeed, revitalize somewhat the hair and scalp, but the results are probably in prolonged use of the same product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, everyone appeared satisfied and still enjoys this shampoo on the daily routine of life. The container is solid and secure and no unwanted spills were reported when transportation was required. With these conclusions in mind this shampoo get a very decent 4 Stars rating from us.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was running out of my usual shampoo and decided to try a new product. I was pleasantly surprised and very delighted with this shampoo. It has a pleasant smell but not heavy like some. It suds up well with not much product and rinses to leave your hair fresh and clean. I have very fine hair and need a product that will give me volume without heaviness and I can say with confidence that this product does that. I will definately buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it again and have been using it for over 6 months and I can say that I will continue to use this product again and again. For years I have had a problem with soap residue on my scalp. No matter how many times I would rinse my hair I always ended up with what looked like dry skin/dandruff but was actually shampoos left over. After using this shampoo my scalp is not only clear and free of scaly build-up but my hair has never been healthier. Since I am in my 60&#x27;s this is very important to me. I have my hair colored every month and there is no sign of damage and my hair even is thicker. I believe alot has to do with the volume properties of the Clear Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will DEFINITELY BUY THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN</li>
            <li> this stuff is fabulous! works on the whole family &#x3D;) makes hair super soft and shiny</li>
            <li> This is great for someone with thin hair!  I use this shampoo with the same type of conditioner, and my hair looks like its full of body and shiny.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell a lot of difference from my regular salon shampoo - not a bad product just hasn&#x27;t shown me anything special.</li>
            <li> So, I had a gift card for Walgreens and I had just run out of shampoo. Clear was on sale and I had heard it was good, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a go. I bought the Volumizing version since I have very fine, African American hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the smell of the shampoo isn&#x27;t good or bad, and it&#x27;s not strong either.... it&#x27;s just odd. When I poured the shampoo into my hand, I immediately thought of Lay&#x27;s potato chips. The smell continued up until I used my conditioner, which is a different brand. So yeah, odd, but not bad smell in my hair. It definitely cleanses the hair which is what shampoo should do, which is always a plus. I&#x27;ll keep using it until the bottle runs out, but it hasn&#x27;t won me over quite yet.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair, but it makes my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li> I had seen the commercials on TV and thought since I have naturally fine un-treated blonde hair I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one month my hair was falling out. Not just a little, A LOT.  Hairbrush full, shower, or just falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought it might be Thryoid, hormones or something else.  Went to the doctor and had all blood work done.  Everything FINE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read comments for all brands of CLEAR on Amazon, found A LOT of people were having the same issues....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quit using the shampoo and went BACK to Pantene.  Within 2 weeks, my hair was slowing down in falling out.  Within 3 weeks, much to none was falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called the manufacturer and complained.  They said this was unusual...  I advised them to check customers comments on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They offered to send me coupons for free porducts...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to give this shampoo a try, good luck.  If your hair starts to fall out, remember this comment.  IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FALL OUT.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and can&#x27;t find it in the stores it&#x27;s great for fine thin hair. Makes it seem like you have good hair.. !!!</li>
            <li> My wife used this product and has nothing but good to say about it. She has told everyone how good it is. She said it brought real shine to her hair and left it as soft as can be. I as she would say it is the best. We will buy it.</li>
            <li> I had fine flat hair and a slight seborrheic dermatitis problem.  Well no more!!  I love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product for aging hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in the market for new product that will add volume without weight to my not-so-fine fine hair.  After reading multiple reviews on this shampoo, I was a little worried that I was in for yet another disappointing, weighted-down hair experience.  What a pleasure then to note on first use that it not only supplied more body but was helpful in controlling those unfortunate waves that develop with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this shampoo builds up over time; I get good results with occasional use, but regular use makes for a sorry, drowned-rat effect. Interesting though, while humidity (of which we have little here in Denver) is my hair&#x27;s worst enemy, rain on a Clear Scalp shampoo day did not raise that dreaded halo of frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got hair that on a bad day has the texture and attractiveness level of tiny feathers, completely uncontrollable and lacking in body and focus.  As a result, I&#x27;ve got a pile of shampoo and conditioner combos stacked on my tub shelf.  Most make my hair feel waxy.  Some dry it out even worse than I thought possible.  A couple do nothing for the body but smell really nice.  Naturally I had to try Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Beauty volumizing root boost nourishing shampoo.  I did not have high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised (still am) that it works (in conjunction with the matching conditioner) so well that I like my hair again.  The shampoo feels silky in use and leaves my hair the same way but with a subtle added body boost.  Nice fragrance, rinses clean quickly, removes the tons of product I tend to lavish on my locks to cement them into place, and my hair looks really good all the time.  Woo-HOO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, but I look forward to even better results as time goes by. Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I received &amp; reviewed the dandruff formula version of this shampoo prior to using this. I loved it and got great results; however, I was no fan of the overpowering scent. Happily, the fragrance in  this one is far less overwhelming, and the results as just as good if not better. I love this shampoo. It is my current favorite, and I intend to buy this well after my freebie runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking as someone with fine, oily hair which must be washed everyday in the summer, this leaves my hair clean without feeling stripped. It also does a good job removing product build-up. It&#x27;s truly better than many of the salon brands I have tried. Overall, a winner.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  I don&#x27;t know that it necessarily volumizes hair, but it definitely cleans the hair and scalp really well.  Also, this is the thickest lather that I&#x27;ve ever had with a shampoo, so I like that as well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo promises to add volume to your strands and it is clinically proven to aid  in restoring your scalp&#x27;s natural moisture balance. It has Nutrium 10 which is an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C &amp; E, sunflower, almond, soybean &amp; coconut oils &amp; aloe vera.  The scent is pleasing and lingers even after your hair is dry.  It lathers easily and rinses cleanly. I didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in my scalp but I did like the shine and bounce this formula gave me when I used it with the color protect conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for volumizing shampoos. I have a few that I really like, but I find that my hair is more manageable when I switch between two shampoos and conditioners. I had never seen this product before and decided to try it. My hair loved it, and that means so do I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because:&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice scent to it - not that awful fake apple smell that so many shampoos have.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does not weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;My hair seemed to be a bit fuller after blow-drying than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made a version of this for color-treated hair. That would be perfect for me! In any case, I like this shampoo enough that I am going to try the corresponding conditioner in hopes that it will deliver the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have tried the conditioner. It&#x27;s quite honestly the only \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; conditioner I have used that actually delivers on that promise.I have very fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t have much fullness. As a result, I have tried just about every volumizing hair product out there. My hair is definitely fuller after using this conditioner, no matter what shampoo I use with it, and it maintains the fullness between shampoos. It&#x27;s also soft and very easy to style. Without a doubt, this brand has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Having turned the product over to the women-folk for their analysis, it received a positive review. I honestly don&#x27;t know much about shampoo and usually just use the soap from the dispenser at the gym, so my level of expertise in this area is less than zero.&lt;br /&gt;However, they like it for several reasons. First, it seems they like the over quality, fragrance, and all that stuff. Second, the design is great. The bottle can be stored with the tab at the bottom so that you don&#x27;t have to shake the living daylights out of it when it gets half full.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to see a bottle of shampoo that hasn&#x27;t been squeezed so hard it looks like it&#x27;s been mangled by a bear.&lt;br /&gt;Points for quality and design. I&#x27;ll be picking more up soon.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting new product.  The shampoo, used along with the conditioner, seems to actually increase fullness of my fine hair.  It will probably take using it regularly for a month or two (I didn&#x27;t notice any claims about a period of time for it to work) before one can be sure.  It has a very light and pleasant fragrance.  Usually I prefer fragrance-free but this is not bad and I&#x27;ve not noticed any itching or burning I usually get from fragranced products.  It has a flat end to stand it upright in shower or bath (opening end is down to enable use of that final last drop.  It lathers nicely even with the hard water here.  Left my hair squeaky clean and is something I would buy again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  I didn&#x27;t try this shampoo myself.  However, my wife (and, as you will see, my daughter) did try it.  The following are my wife&#x27;s comments as transcribed by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having heard a lot about Clear&#x27;s products (and as the frequent sufferer of \\&quot;bad hair days\\&quot;), I was looking forward to trying Clear&#x27;s Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo.  Sadly, after two weeks of daily use, I can safely say that the product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the fragrant, but not overpowering, clean scent.  While the shampoo did look like thick milk, I wasn&#x27;t bothered by its appearance.  Upon application, I found that the lather was abundant.  But, my first hint that the product&#x27;s performance wouldn&#x27;t match its presentation occurred when the shampoo&#x27;s very nice scent dissipated quickly after I rinsed my hair.  The disappearing scent was matched by little, if any, volumizing, and no root boost, as evidenced by the number of fly-aways that I had after starting my use of the shampoo (equal to the number I had before using this shampoo).  I will say that my scalp didn&#x27;t dry out from using the product.  But, there really wasn&#x27;t any difference in my scalp&#x27;s condition from before using Clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Clear shampoo both before and after I had a haircut, and the result was the same.  I will offer two caveats to my general observation.  First, I didn&#x27;t use the Clear conditioner, or any other conditioner, with this shampoo.  It&#x27;s possible that using the conditioner would have helped the shampoo&#x27;s performance.  Second, while I have slightly wavy hair with medium body, my six-year-old daughter has very thick straight hair.  I tried the shampoo on her, and found her hair kept the fragrance and had a nice shine and bounce to it.  So, perhaps this shampoo works better on thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Clear&#x27;s Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Shampoo wasn&#x27;t anything special.  While I liked the scentand the lather, the results on my hair were negligible.  After all is said and done, I&#x27;ll go back to my old shampoo once I&#x27;m done with this bottle of Clear.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo at a local big box retailer. I had high hopes for this product as a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shampoo (aka NOT Head and Shoulders) that would also mitigate symptoms of dry scalp (though this is not the dandruff formula, it does contain zinc pyrithione, which is the active ingredient in dandruff shampoos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been disappointed in this product. Most egregiously, it makes my hair stringy and very flat--the opposite of the volumizing effects it claimed to offer. In addition, it only did a passable--not great--job at keeping my scalp moisturized. I suppose perhaps the specific anti-dandruff formula does better with that, but since this shampoo claims to promote hair AND scalp health, I expected better. Finally, as ofther reviewers have mentioned, the product can get gloppy; the bottle gets blocked up pretty frequently, even though I&#x27;m careful not to leave it open or spill any shampoo around the opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave two stars because the shampoo does have a pleasant smell and a nice lather. Maybe it works better on other hair types, but this is not the stuff for me.</li>
            <li> Had long hair in the 70&#x27;s , and a little shorter every decade since. Not really by choice , just kinda a \\&quot;gettin&#x27; older\\&quot; thing.&lt;br /&gt;So wanting to preserve what I have left , I look for products that nourish a depleting field. Clear Scalp And Hair Beauty\\&quot; does the job. It is very refreshing to apply , and doesn&#x27;t over-foam like SO many competitor&#x27;s. Rather invigorating and rinse clean.</li>
            <li> I got samples of this shampoo and conditioner so I tried it yesterday. For the first time EVER I did not need to wash my hair the next day. All the buildup on my scalp is gone and my hair feels silky smooth. Everyday I scratch my scalp and get my fingernails full of gunky build-up but today....NOTHING!! I only used this once so I will come back to update. Must buy.</li>
            <li> Every volumizing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever bought always made my hair feel like straw. Not this one! The first time I used it, my hair felt a hundred times better...much softer and started to get its shine back.  After a few more uses, my hair was actually feeling silky and the shine was so apparent that people were commenting on it. As for the volumizing part, people who have heavy or thick hair might not notice much of a lift. But for those of us with thinner hair, you&#x27;ll see a more fluffy look to your hair. The best part though, is the way your hair will feel and shine. I&#x27;m never buying another brand of shampoo again! This stuff is great!!</li>
            <li> This has cleared my husbands dandruff problem without any of the harsh smells or chemicals that come with some of the other brands. I love it too. We don&#x27;t have to keep two bottles of shampoo in the house because I love it too!</li>
            <li> I have bought volumizing shampoos and they have left my hair feeling dull and heavy. This one didn&#x27;t do that. My hair felt clean and refreshed after shampooing with this. I really like the scent, it does not have too strong a perfume smell, but a clean and fresh smell. I didn&#x27;t notice any extra \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; than normal, however.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for people with oily, flat, and straight hair. This did not work for me, didn&#x27;t give me volume at all and still leaves it extra flat. I think it might be making my hair oiler. Now I am on the search for something that will help my flat and oily hair again!</li>
            <li> I typically use natural shampoos so am not used to strong artificial fragrances... I found this shampoo&#x27;s fragrance not to my liking but to each his own.  The shampoo itself comes out in a goopy non clear form, so it looks more like a conditioner.  It lathers OK but not very much lather... and felt waxy.  My hair did feel clean afterwards except for a bit of buildup of scent and waxy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I write this review, I think even 3 stars might be a bit too high... I used about half the bottle and threw the rest away.  I did like the bottle design, which makes it easy to store upside down so you can get the product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, many like this shampoo, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The name says it all- Clear Scalp and Hair  - leaves your hair clear of all products used since the last shampoo! Volumizing - not only does it build up your hair at its roots, but also gives it volume to the end of your hair. Nourishing - if your hair tends to be dry - you will want to try this shampoo! My hair has never looked so good nor has it ever been this easy to manage!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice light scent and a pretty lavender color.  The ingredients are a mix of healthy ingredients and conventional ones.  I have long hair so it is hard to give it volume because of the weight, but I didn&#x27;t think this one particularly did much for my hair.  Towards the middle of the day I think mine started to get oily, which is a problem I have, but it was compounded by this shampoo I do believe.  In sum, this shampoo is okay but not great.</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair that looks greasy pretty fast. Despite being a volumizing shampoo, I actually found this to be a bit heavy for my scalp. Which is probably a good thing since most volumizing shampoos actually dry out your hair. It does clear out all my product build-up and any dandruff wonderfully! So I end up rotating it out with my other lighter shampoos throughout the week.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo at a GREAT PRICE!  I use all high end shampoos but received a sample of Clear.  I liked it so much that I bought it and the conditioner!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, even above expensive high-end brands.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this at first because I figured it was another gimmick all shampoos guarantee they are the best thing for your hair etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth the money and I saw results after one use and keep seeing healthy hair after each continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent that lasts&lt;br /&gt;Hair is shiny and not weighed down by excessive product&lt;br /&gt;Hair visibly looks healthier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-If you are used to a thick coverage with your shampoo/conditioner (i.e lather and creamy conditioner) this probably isn&#x27;t the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;-Small container size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember this is not a regular shampoo and conditioner so it is not suppose to be used as one make sure to read directions before you use so you can see maximum results.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  Not a lot is required for a full head of suds, but more importantly is the softness and shine it gives your hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine and has thinned over the years.  I&#x27;m not quite sure this product makes my hair look any thicker, but it does appear to have more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;MEF</li>
            <li> Cleared my dry scalp problems in just three shampoos. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair definitely gets really clean with this shampoo/conditioner team but I don&#x27;t get any volume as I do with other volume brands. I only use it on weekends to get a good clean. I won&#x27;t buy it again though.</li>
