            <li>Pleasant, light and clean.</li>

            <li>I love this hand soap.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased many liquid hand soaps.  </li>
            <li>I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products for a variety of reasons, including that I&#x27;m from Minnesota</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>

            <li>in the USA with many ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love love love this scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more when it runs out.  </li>
            <li>I love the outdoors and gardening.  </li>
            <li>I have it at my kitchen sink and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the Meyer&#x27;s hand soaps.  </li>
            <li>I love to smell my hands after I wash with this, I use parsley in the bathroom and honeysuckle in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given my impression with this product, I&#x27;ll probably try more Mrs. Meyer products.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent along with a lot of scents in the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s line, but I feel like the soaps just aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>i still love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a clean scent with a hint of sweetness.  </li>
            <li>I keep it by the kitchen sink, and it has a nice clean scent that combats garlic or onion odors admirably.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells good, feels great and washes well; does not leave your skin dry and there are no chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It is very clean, just like Parsley.</li>
            <li>This soap just feels very clean on skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Not like what I expected after hearing about how awesome mrs Meyers is.</li>
            <li>I would never in a million years have imagined parsley was a factor in creating this scent, but the smell continues to bring a smile to my face (and it has a nice texture as well).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my hands feel super clean, which I love!</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Nice large size kitchen sink soap, with a pleasant scent; especially useful when handling shellfish... makes short order of odor.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this soap would dry out my hands, but happily have found it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, this is a &#x27;green&#x27; product which is the primary reason I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>The one I have been using was no longer available, so I thought I would give this product a try.</li>
            <li>Cleaning, whether your home or yourself, is all about staying healthy and fresh, scent included.  </li>
            <li>Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Has a great scent and definitely beats the &amp;#34;Dial&amp;#34; soaps of the world.</li>
            <li>The scent is unique and clean and not too strong.</li>
            <li>All of the products are high quality and environmentally responsible (and the packaging looks great sitting on your sink).</li>
            <li>My husband likes this the best, and he is a frequent hand washer,as most soaps dry his hands from always having them in water.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Parsley and smells super strong</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products and was so happy to see the Parsley scent come out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean smell and not too feminine.  </li>
            <li>I have to use two pumps to feel like I&#x27;m getting my hands clean:</li>
            <li>My hands feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Liked this one better than the lemon of the same brand.</li>
            <li>I think it might be good to cycle through the different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, this stuff actually smells good.  </li>
            <li>I love it just as much.</li>
            <li>It has an incredibly fresh, lightly herbal scent.</li>
            <li>This is a good, solid hand soap.  </li>
            <li>It seems fairly concentrated, so a battle last quite a while.  </li>
            <li>we all loved the scent, will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I love all Mrs Meyer&#x27;s soaps, leaves a clean, fresh lingering scent after you wash your hands.. very uplifting.  </li>
            <li>It is clean and fresh, just like parsley.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, the 2 pack is great; super cheap, and still using them both after a month and a few.</li>
            <li>It has a super lathering effect</li>
            <li>Not sure  this smells like parsley per say, but it has a very nice scent that is not too sweet and smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Definitely my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li>This soap smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products and this was a really good deal for 2 bottles at less than $8!!</li>
            <li>Really I just needed to hit $25 to get my free super savers shipping and this did the trick...</li>
            <li>This soap is fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>The parsley scent is really clean and masculine smelling, without being too strong or cologne-y.</li>
            <li>I have been using a cucumber soap in the kitchen for several years, as I love the fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it&#x27;s organic/natural.</li>
            <li>the price is right, too.</li>
            <li>As a point of reference, I like the geranium and the lemon verbena scents, and really DISLIKE the basil scent as I think it smells too sweet and</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
            <li>Slightly drying, but good for use in the the summer months.</li>
            <li>I love the strong, clean scent of the Meyer&#x27;s brand Parsley liquid hand soap, and I think the packaging looks smart without having to transfer the soap into a decorative container (what a mess!).  </li>
            <li>So fresh, clean and natural smelling.  </li>
            <li>It is such a refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Mrs Meyers purchase</li>
            <li>I will not buy ANYTHING else, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This is the first Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I found that a little disapointing as it seems like creamy soap is a better moisturizer, but this works just fine</li>
            <li>If pleasant soaps are one of your small joys in life, then this scent is not for you.</li>
            <li>The Parsley smell is nice and clean, but not much better than the lavender scent.</li>
            <li>I like a certain type of other soap, but the cost and not knowing exactly what&#x27;s in it kind of bothered me.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this new fragrance from Mrs Meyers since we&#x27;ve used many of her other products.  </li>
            <li>Even though the two bottles cost a little more than the store brands, I figure it is worth it.</li>
            <li>is really value for money.</li>
            <li>The hand soap works very well and is not drying.</li>
            <li>It I like a cross between the freshness of parsley and the floral bouquet of honeysuckle with out being so flowery that a man can&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I really like this hand soap.  </li>
            <li>I expected this soap to smell more like parsley.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also gentle on the skin; doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or any type of irritation.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have too much of that fakey soap smell that some hand soaps seem to have.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and it isn&#x27;t an overly strong smell, (I hate strong smells)</li>
            <li>I wish they made this scent in more of their other products!</li>
            <li>To echo another reviewer, this soap made my hands very dry.&lt;br /&gt;And it really isn&#x27;t that natural.</li>
            <li>can only give it 3 stars because of the fact that it dries out my hands so quickly.</li>
            <li>Parsley is my least favorite of the Mrs. Meyers scents (I prefer honeysuckle and geranium), but it smells clean and masculine.</li>
            <li>Sort of like if I put lotion on my hands, but without any residue that lotions normally have.</li>
            <li>The other one works fine for now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new soap for the kitchen &amp; bathrooms.</li>
            <li>I do miss my foaming soap though I new that wasn&#x27;t what this one was offering.</li>
            <li>Shortly after my initial purchase, I bought several more batches for my home</li>
            <li>This soap feels better on my hands that any of the usual store brand I have bought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin, yet concentrated and the parsley scent is unique and fresh and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a great year, but I&#x27;ve grown tired of these smells and dry hands.</li>
            <li>The color of the soap is clear.</li>
            <li>Not too perfume-like and smells natural rather than chemically.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and wash my hands frequently throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use this scent in the kitchen where I cook frequently</li>
            <li>This is far thinner than the others -- by that</li>
            <li>-- the others seem okay, though it&#x27;s been a few months since I purchased -- but this just isn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
            <li>I mean that it doesn&#x27;t lather up very well, and thus needs more soap to develop a lather, and, accordingly, is more expensive per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bottle says that the product is an aromatherapy hand soap, but I don&#x27;t feel the scent is strong enough or last long enough for any sort of mood enhancement or stress relief.</li>
            <li>Unlike Basil that has a very slight, sweet perfume like scent, Parsley does not.  </li>
            <li>I love that the company is truly green, that they don&#x27;t use animal products, and that there is no harsh chemical smell because they don&#x27;t use harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I placed one in the guest bathroom and a second near the kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a strong sweetness, but that subtle kind that you would expect in something like...parsley?  </li>

            <li> interesting fragrance that isn&#x27;t overly floral but more herbaceous.&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li> I like the label color as well as it goes better with my decor.  </li>
            <li> I would love to see a hand lotion in this scent.</li>
            <li> I love all the Mrs.Meyer&#x27;s products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, light and clean.</li>
            <li> I will order more of this and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> For how much better this soap feels I don&#x27;t mind my annual hand soap budget going from $10 to $15</li>
            <li> I love this hand soap.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased many liquid hand soaps.  </li>
            <li> I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products for a variety of reasons, including that I&#x27;m from Minnesota</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this scent.</li>
            <li> Love this scent.</li>
            <li> in the USA with many ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more when it runs out.  </li>
            <li> I love the outdoors and gardening.  </li>
            <li> I have it at my kitchen sink and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the Meyer&#x27;s hand soaps.  </li>
            <li> I love to smell my hands after I wash with this, I use parsley in the bathroom and honeysuckle in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given my impression with this product, I&#x27;ll probably try more Mrs. Meyer products.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent along with a lot of scents in the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s line, but I feel like the soaps just aren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> i still love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a clean scent with a hint of sweetness.  </li>
            <li> I keep it by the kitchen sink, and it has a nice clean scent that combats garlic or onion odors admirably.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells good, feels great and washes well; does not leave your skin dry and there are no chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It is very clean, just like Parsley.</li>
            <li> This soap just feels very clean on skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> Not like what I expected after hearing about how awesome mrs Meyers is.</li>
            <li> I would never in a million years have imagined parsley was a factor in creating this scent, but the smell continues to bring a smile to my face (and it has a nice texture as well).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my hands feel super clean, which I love!</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Nice large size kitchen sink soap, with a pleasant scent; especially useful when handling shellfish... makes short order of odor.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this soap would dry out my hands, but happily have found it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, this is a &#x27;green&#x27; product which is the primary reason I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> The one I have been using was no longer available, so I thought I would give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Cleaning, whether your home or yourself, is all about staying healthy and fresh, scent included.  </li>
            <li> Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Has a great scent and definitely beats the &amp;#34;Dial&amp;#34; soaps of the world.</li>
            <li> The scent is unique and clean and not too strong.</li>
            <li> All of the products are high quality and environmentally responsible (and the packaging looks great sitting on your sink).</li>
            <li> My husband likes this the best, and he is a frequent hand washer,as most soaps dry his hands from always having them in water.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Parsley and smells super strong</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products and was so happy to see the Parsley scent come out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean smell and not too feminine.  </li>
            <li> I have to use two pumps to feel like I&#x27;m getting my hands clean:</li>
            <li> My hands feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Liked this one better than the lemon of the same brand.</li>
            <li> I think it might be good to cycle through the different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff actually smells good.  </li>
            <li> I love it just as much.</li>
            <li> It has an incredibly fresh, lightly herbal scent.</li>
            <li> This is a good, solid hand soap.  </li>
            <li> It seems fairly concentrated, so a battle last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> we all loved the scent, will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love all Mrs Meyer&#x27;s soaps, leaves a clean, fresh lingering scent after you wash your hands.. very uplifting.  </li>
            <li> It is clean and fresh, just like parsley.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the 2 pack is great; super cheap, and still using them both after a month and a few.</li>
            <li> It has a super lathering effect</li>
            <li> Not sure  this smells like parsley per say, but it has a very nice scent that is not too sweet and smells very fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Definitely my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li> This soap smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products and this was a really good deal for 2 bottles at less than $8!!</li>
            <li> Really I just needed to hit $25 to get my free super savers shipping and this did the trick...</li>
            <li> This soap is fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li> The parsley scent is really clean and masculine smelling, without being too strong or cologne-y.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cucumber soap in the kitchen for several years, as I love the fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it&#x27;s organic/natural.</li>
            <li> the price is right, too.</li>
            <li> As a point of reference, I like the geranium and the lemon verbena scents, and really DISLIKE the basil scent as I think it smells too sweet and</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
            <li> Slightly drying, but good for use in the the summer months.</li>
            <li> I love the strong, clean scent of the Meyer&#x27;s brand Parsley liquid hand soap, and I think the packaging looks smart without having to transfer the soap into a decorative container (what a mess!).  </li>
            <li> So fresh, clean and natural smelling.  </li>
            <li> It is such a refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Mrs Meyers purchase</li>
            <li> I will not buy ANYTHING else, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is the first Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I found that a little disapointing as it seems like creamy soap is a better moisturizer, but this works just fine</li>
            <li> If pleasant soaps are one of your small joys in life, then this scent is not for you.</li>
            <li> The Parsley smell is nice and clean, but not much better than the lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I like a certain type of other soap, but the cost and not knowing exactly what&#x27;s in it kind of bothered me.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new fragrance from Mrs Meyers since we&#x27;ve used many of her other products.  </li>
            <li> Even though the two bottles cost a little more than the store brands, I figure it is worth it.</li>
            <li> is really value for money.</li>
            <li> The hand soap works very well and is not drying.</li>
            <li> It I like a cross between the freshness of parsley and the floral bouquet of honeysuckle with out being so flowery that a man can&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I really like this hand soap.  </li>
            <li> I expected this soap to smell more like parsley.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gentle on the skin; doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or any type of irritation.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have too much of that fakey soap smell that some hand soaps seem to have.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and it isn&#x27;t an overly strong smell, (I hate strong smells)</li>
            <li> I wish they made this scent in more of their other products!</li>
            <li> To echo another reviewer, this soap made my hands very dry.&lt;br /&gt;And it really isn&#x27;t that natural.</li>
            <li> can only give it 3 stars because of the fact that it dries out my hands so quickly.</li>
            <li> Parsley is my least favorite of the Mrs. Meyers scents (I prefer honeysuckle and geranium), but it smells clean and masculine.</li>
            <li> Sort of like if I put lotion on my hands, but without any residue that lotions normally have.</li>
            <li> The other one works fine for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new soap for the kitchen &amp; bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I do miss my foaming soap though I new that wasn&#x27;t what this one was offering.</li>
            <li> Shortly after my initial purchase, I bought several more batches for my home</li>
            <li> This soap feels better on my hands that any of the usual store brand I have bought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin, yet concentrated and the parsley scent is unique and fresh and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a great year, but I&#x27;ve grown tired of these smells and dry hands.</li>
            <li> The color of the soap is clear.</li>
            <li> Not too perfume-like and smells natural rather than chemically.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wash my hands frequently throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this scent in the kitchen where I cook frequently</li>
            <li> This is far thinner than the others -- by that</li>
            <li> -- the others seem okay, though it&#x27;s been a few months since I purchased -- but this just isn&#x27;t the same.  </li>
            <li> I mean that it doesn&#x27;t lather up very well, and thus needs more soap to develop a lather, and, accordingly, is more expensive per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bottle says that the product is an aromatherapy hand soap, but I don&#x27;t feel the scent is strong enough or last long enough for any sort of mood enhancement or stress relief.</li>
            <li> Unlike Basil that has a very slight, sweet perfume like scent, Parsley does not.  </li>
            <li> I love that the company is truly green, that they don&#x27;t use animal products, and that there is no harsh chemical smell because they don&#x27;t use harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I placed one in the guest bathroom and a second near the kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong sweetness, but that subtle kind that you would expect in something like...parsley?  </li>
            <li> is pretty thick as well</li>
            <li> It is not overwelming, or linger long.</li>
            <li> I hope Mrs. Meyers keeps this around for the long haul.</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m not too picky when it comes to face soap as long as it doesn&#x27;t dry my face...</li>
            <li> I will be looking at other products before making the next bulk purchase.</li>
            <li> I like these products, but my biggest gripe about the hand soap is how dry it makes your hands.</li>
            <li> * Does not leave your hands dry after washing</li>
            <li> They leave my hands very dry.</li>
            <li> However I also am suffering from my hands starting to dry out, even after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I order a Pack of 2 every two months, and it seems to keep our six sinks well-stocked.</li>
            <li> Also just to let you know the soap is actually a clearish green color</li>
            <li> Would never have tried it, but reviews made me curious.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this new parsley scent smells more of an artificial honeydew perfume, muddled with something unpleasant that I haven&#x27;t been able to put my finger on.  </li>
            <li> I love the fragrance but unfortunately this brand doesn&#x27;t produce hardly any lather!</li>
            <li> Wish they used this scent in other products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anybody to buy it but prefer other frangance but</li>
            <li> bought this because I&#x27;d never seen \\&quot;parsley\\&quot; in the stores -- only the usual suspects (lavender; geranium; lemon verbena; and basil).  </li>
            <li> Usually after a few weeks they dry my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little watery but works well if you&#x27;re the type of person who soaps before wetting your hands.</li>
            <li> so I usually thin it with a little water to make it last</li>
            <li> A few people commented that it dries out their hands, but I decided to take my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But like with most aromatherapy soaps you can get tired or even sick of the smell after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the only bad thing is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long enough.</li>
            <li> one of the bottles nozzle failed immediately when i tried to open it.</li>
            <li> I got tired of messy bars of soap at the kitchen sink and figured this aroma would be the least intrusive in a kitchen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> I got bored with my usual soap</li>
            <li> I keep it in my kitchen and use it after cooking and gardening, and it neutralizes even tough food orders like garlic and onion on your hands.</li>
            <li> I try to limit the amount of unnecessary ingredients in my food and in my skin care products.  </li>
            <li> Worse yet is the viscosity -- or rather, the lack of it.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t flashy or exciting&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Basil and Parsley products are all I would use if they weren&#x27;t so darned expensive.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> It still contains some dangerous stuff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is very faint and doesn&#x27;t leave any freshness on your hands.  </li>
            <li> Try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Clean and refreshing.  I love this soap.  We have one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen. It is such a refreshing scent.  Not too perfume-like and smells natural rather than chemically.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from a parsley fragrance, but it is fresh and wonderful smelling. I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products and this was a really good deal for 2 bottles at less than $8!!</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of two 12.5 oz bottles for the office, and the more I lathered my hands up - the happier I got. I would never in a million years have imagined parsley was a factor in creating this scent, but the smell continues to bring a smile to my face (and it has a nice texture as well). Shortly after my initial purchase, I bought several more batches for my home and I purchased the lavender scented version (which is also quite pleasing to the nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently trying to convince my boyfriend to buy the same soap, so that when I visit him my hands can continue to be joyful in their cleanliness.</li>
            <li> So fresh, clean and natural smelling.  Absolutely perfect for the kitchen.  Love this hand soap, and the price is resaonable as well.</li>
            <li> Love the Parsley scent.  I have sensitive skin and wash my hands frequently throughout the day.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if this soap would dry out my hands, but happily have found it doesn&#x27;t.  My husband loves the smell and now we have this near all the sinks in the house. Wish they used this scent in other products.</li>
            <li> interesting fragrance that isn&#x27;t overly floral but more herbaceous.&lt;br /&gt;Soap is pretty thick as well so I usually thin it with a little water to make it last longer!&lt;br /&gt;The amazon deal you get for it is really value for money.</li>
            <li> I got a bulk deal about a year ago on several of these soaps and I&#x27;m finally starting to run out. The Parsley smell is nice and clean, but not much better than the lavender scent. I like these products, but my biggest gripe about the hand soap is how dry it makes your hands. It&#x27;s been a great year, but I&#x27;ve grown tired of these smells and dry hands. I will be looking at other products before making the next bulk purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells so good and good for the environment.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost all Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s scents.  Lemon Verbena and Basil have been my favorites.  I just received the new Parsley scented hand soap, and it is the best.  It is clean and fresh, just like parsley.  Unlike Basil that has a very slight, sweet perfume like scent, Parsley does not.  It is very clean, just like Parsley. It is not overwelming, or linger long. The soap itself is softening.  My husband likes this the best, and he is a frequent hand washer,as most soaps dry his hands from always having them in water.  I like the label color as well as it goes better with my decor.  Not that it is a big issue, but it is a plus.  The color of the soap is clear. I would love to see a hand lotion in this scent.</li>
            <li> I love all the Mrs.Meyer&#x27;s products that I have tried. The hand soap works very well and is not drying. The fragrance is not over powering for people with scent sensitivity, like myself.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this new fragrance from Mrs Meyers since we&#x27;ve used many of her other products.  Parsley?  I thought... what in the world does parsley smell like?  Not sure  this smells like parsley per say, but it has a very nice scent that is not too sweet and smells very fresh and clean.  As a point of reference, I like the geranium and the lemon verbena scents, and really DISLIKE the basil scent as I think it smells too sweet and \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great price for these and a really nice product... give it a try, tastes vary, but I like this soap a LOT!</li>
            <li> The soap does the job well; no chemically smell like from Softsoap, and not too overpowering, and anything I get on my hands in the kitchen doesn&#x27;t stand a chance... But like with most aromatherapy soaps you can get tired or even sick of the smell after a few weeks. I think it might be good to cycle through the different &amp;#34;flavors.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the 2 pack is great; super cheap, and still using them both after a month and a few.</li>
            <li> Meyers products are always good quality - they are especially good when the price is right.  The parsley soap smells great.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products and was so happy to see the Parsley scent come out.  It&#x27;s ideal for the kitchen.  So fresh and leaves the kitchen sink smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> I got bored with my usual soap so I ordered this based on good reviews. I agree. This scent is very nice. Pleasant, light and clean. I will order more of this and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love the strong, clean scent of the Meyer&#x27;s brand Parsley liquid hand soap, and I think the packaging looks smart without having to transfer the soap into a decorative container (what a mess!).  I order a Pack of 2 every two months, and it seems to keep our six sinks well-stocked.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and I love the scent.  This is my first Mrs Meyers purchase and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This soap feels better on my hands that any of the usual store brand I have bought. After using the soap my skin actually feel smoother and healthier than it did before. Sort of like if I put lotion on my hands, but without any residue that lotions normally have. The scent is nice, but not overbearing. The bottle says that the product is an aromatherapy hand soap, but I don&#x27;t feel the scent is strong enough or last long enough for any sort of mood enhancement or stress relief. Even though the two bottles cost a little more than the store brands, I figure it is worth it. For how much better this soap feels I don&#x27;t mind my annual hand soap budget going from $10 to $15 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars for a great product at a great price. I will buy again if the price remains the same.</li>
            <li> I love this hand soap.  It&#x27;s thin, yet concentrated and the parsley scent is unique and fresh and I really like it.  Best of all, this is a &#x27;green&#x27; product which is the primary reason I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good product and good price...I would recommend anybody to buy it but prefer other frangance but quality is good.</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff actually smells good.  It&#x27;s kind of a clean scent with a hint of sweetness.  It&#x27;s not a strong sweetness, but that subtle kind that you would expect in something like...parsley?  Try it out.  The radish scent is also great as well.</li>
            <li> This hand soap smells good and works well for both kitchen and bath use and the kids like it too!</li>
            <li> Mrs. Meyers is a regular in our home. The price is right and it&#x27;s organic/natural. Love the scents! My fav is the Parsley scent.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It washes cleanly away and smells great.  It&#x27;s a little watery but works well if you&#x27;re the type of person who soaps before wetting your hands.</li>
            <li> To echo another reviewer, this soap made my hands very dry.&lt;br /&gt;And it really isn&#x27;t that natural. There are a lot of chemicals in the ingredient list, such as sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, etc.</li>
            <li> Have purchased many liquid hand soaps.  Usually after a few weeks they dry my fingertips.  This soap does not do that.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice large size kitchen sink soap, with a pleasant scent; especially useful when handling shellfish... makes short order of odor.</li>
            <li> I love Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s products for a variety of reasons, including that I&#x27;m from Minnesota and they remind me of home.  I hadn&#x27;t smelled the parsley, but it&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s a clean smell and not too feminine.  Overall another great product from a great company.</li>
            <li> This is everything I want in a hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It isn&#x27;t flashy or exciting&lt;br /&gt;* No antibacterial anything&lt;br /&gt;* Has a pleasant fresh smell that is not perfumey&lt;br /&gt;* Does not leave your hands dry after washing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new soap for the kitchen &amp; bathrooms. I like a certain type of other soap, but the cost and not knowing exactly what&#x27;s in it kind of bothered me. I did some research and read about this soap. A few people commented that it dries out their hands, but I decided to take my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hands feel super clean, which I love! However I also am suffering from my hands starting to dry out, even after a few uses. It&#x27;s a great soap, but I have to use lotion each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only give it 3 stars because of the fact that it dries out my hands so quickly.</li>
            <li> This handsoap smells so fresh and so delicious I sometimes wash my hands just so I can smell it. It I like a cross between the freshness of parsley and the floral bouquet of honeysuckle with out being so flowery that a man can&#x27;t enjoy it. I should know, I&#x27;m a man.</li>
            <li> I really like this hand soap.  I keep it by the kitchen sink, and it has a nice clean scent that combats garlic or onion odors admirably.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  Really I just needed to hit $25 to get my free super savers shipping and this did the trick...it&#x27;s Parsley and smells super strong but I love it.  It has a super lathering effect and I even use it on my face...although I&#x27;m not too picky when it comes to face soap as long as it doesn&#x27;t dry my face...this doesn&#x27;t.  Also just to let you know the soap is actually a clearish green color not the white creamy color it looks to be...I found that a little disapointing as it seems like creamy soap is a better moisturizer, but this works just fine</li>
            <li> This smells good and seems to do the job.  I am going to buy this from now on.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Would never have tried it, but reviews made me curious. Love this scent. Will probably try others just for variety, but ordering from Amazon saved me money as this soap is pricy in stores. Will keep ordering as I run out. Try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cucumber soap in the kitchen for several years, as I love the fresh, clean scent. The one I have been using was no longer available, so I thought I would give this product a try. I love it just as much. Very clean scent, not overpowering and perfect for the kitchen. Not over drying. I would recommend...</li>
            <li> As a guy, I am not embarrassed to have this hand soap by the sink - it does its job and smells nice without smelling like a perfume.</li>
            <li> I love all Mrs Meyer&#x27;s soaps, leaves a clean, fresh lingering scent after you wash your hands.. very uplifting.  This is not overly sudsy and does the job.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands. It&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Definitely my new favorite brand. I&#x27;ll be buying their cleaning products for the home soon!</li>
            <li> This is a great organic brand, and the soap is good quality. The scent is unique and clean and not too strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff has the best scent of anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s Basil and Parsley products are all I would use if they weren&#x27;t so darned expensive.  I&#x27;m always looking for a deal to satisfy my fix!</li>
            <li> I bought this hand soap after discovering what a joy Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s housecleaning products are to use.  I love that the company is truly green, that they don&#x27;t use animal products, and that there is no harsh chemical smell because they don&#x27;t use harsh chemicals.  Cleaning, whether your home or yourself, is all about staying healthy and fresh, scent included.  Unfortunately, this new parsley scent smells more of an artificial honeydew perfume, muddled with something unpleasant that I haven&#x27;t been able to put my finger on.  If pleasant soaps are one of your small joys in life, then this scent is not for you.</li>
            <li> Reliable products always</li>
            <li> As advertised this soap smells nice. It is a good value for what you pay. I do miss my foaming soap though I new that wasn&#x27;t what this one was offering. Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a fairly simple product.  I try to limit the amount of unnecessary ingredients in my food and in my skin care products.  This product is rated a 4 (from a scale of 0-10) on the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database.  A 4 is considered to be a moderate hazard.  So, don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; appearance and the label.  It still contains some dangerous stuff.  I expected this soap to smell more like parsley.  It smells good and it isn&#x27;t an overly strong smell, (I hate strong smells) but it doesn&#x27;t smell like parsley at all.  I don&#x27;t plan on buying this soap again.  I&#x27;m looking for something that is safer for my family.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance but unfortunately this brand doesn&#x27;t produce hardly any lather! I have to use two pumps to feel like I&#x27;m getting my hands clean:P We have a water softener so there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with this.</li>
            <li> Parsley is my least favorite of the Mrs. Meyers scents (I prefer honeysuckle and geranium), but it smells clean and masculine. All of the products are high quality and environmentally responsible (and the packaging looks great sitting on your sink).</li>
            <li> Nothing objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice, maybe like parsley?&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a sturdy pump so far.&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA with many ingredients.</li>
            <li> It smells like chemical mutant flowers. Gross.  Stinky. Not good. Stinky soap smell. Not like what I expected after hearing about how awesome mrs Meyers is. Wrong.</li>
            <li> The parsley hand soap has a wonderful, fresh and clean scent. I keep it in my kitchen and use it after cooking and gardening, and it neutralizes even tough food orders like garlic and onion on your hands. I wish they made this scent in more of their other products!</li>
            <li> one of the bottles nozzle failed immediately when i tried to open it. It does not dispense at all. The other one works fine for now. I do like the pleasant smell of the product, but i believe a better packaging solution can be used.</li>
            <li> I use this scent in the kitchen where I cook frequently so I wash my hands 20 - 30 times a day.  This soap smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love this scent. I hope Mrs. Meyers keeps this around for the long haul. It has an incredibly fresh, lightly herbal scent. It smells like summer and a garden to me. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Minnesota native, so obviously I had to support my motherland by buying Meyer&#x27;s products. Has a great scent and definitely beats the &amp;#34;Dial&amp;#34; soaps of the world.</li>
            <li> This thing smells great. It&#x27;s also gentle on the skin; doesn&#x27;t cause dryness or any type of irritation. I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> I placed one in the guest bathroom and a second near the kitchen sink.  People seen to genuinely like how it smells and we are very happy with this purchase.  I plan to purchase more when it runs out.  Good choice.</li>
            <li> I love the outdoors and gardening.  This soap is fresh smelling.  I have it at my kitchen sink and love it.  My hands feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I love the Meyer&#x27;s hand soaps.  They do the job without harming the planet.  This parsley scent smells good, but my nose doesn&#x27;t think it smells like parsley.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  It doesn&#x27;t have too much of that fakey soap smell that some hand soaps seem to have.  It works well and it&#x27;s not overdone.  Practical soap for practical people...</li>
            <li> The parsley scent is really clean and masculine smelling, without being too strong or cologne-y. I love to smell my hands after I wash with this, I use parsley in the bathroom and honeysuckle in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I love the scent! This soap just feels very clean on skin. I will not buy ANYTHING else, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is a good, solid hand soap.  Nice smell and lather.  Will definitely buy again.  Unfortunately, the only bad thing is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long enough.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a liquid soap that is not antibacterial and came across this company. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, feels great and washes well; does not leave your skin dry and there are no chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;And the price is right, too. Stay away from antibacterial soaps, they do more harm then good!!</li>
            <li> This is the first Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve tried.  I got tired of messy bars of soap at the kitchen sink and figured this aroma would be the least intrusive in a kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap has a pleasant smell, is not drying, and rinses thoroughly.  It seems fairly concentrated, so a battle last quite a while.  Given my impression with this product, I&#x27;ll probably try more Mrs. Meyer products.</li>
            <li> This soap, unlike the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s I&#x27;d used before, just doesn&#x27;t lather up.  What&#x27;s up with that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I&#x27;d never seen \\&quot;parsley\\&quot; in the stores -- only the usual suspects (lavender; geranium; lemon verbena; and basil).  I won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very faint and doesn&#x27;t leave any freshness on your hands.  Worse yet is the viscosity -- or rather, the lack of it.  This is far thinner than the others -- by that I mean that it doesn&#x27;t lather up very well, and thus needs more soap to develop a lather, and, accordingly, is more expensive per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s has changed its formula across the board -- the others seem okay, though it&#x27;s been a few months since I purchased -- but this just isn&#x27;t the same.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent along with a lot of scents in the Mrs. Meyer&#x27;s line, but I feel like the soaps just aren&#x27;t that great. They leave my hands very dry.</li>
            <li> i still love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Slightly drying, but good for use in the the summer months. Liked this one better than the lemon of the same brand.</li>
            <li> nice product.  kept one for our house and gave one to my sister.  we all loved the scent, will definitely buy this product again.</li>
