    <ol>
            <li>It feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it.</li>
            <li>BTW if you&#x27;re looking for a really great eye mask, you should try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>as it has worked great.</li>
            <li>So I guess it made all of us happy</li>
            <li>Looks like it works great to me.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if I could have used it one night!</li>
            <li>Very nice, good color, but absolutly transparent</li>
            <li>so doesn&#x27;t work to block out the sun on a bright day, but</li>
            <li>This item look good online</li>
            <li>The fabric is extremely nice though, and it looked great.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect solution to needing to sleep during the day and keeping the light out.  </li>
            <li>I used sleep mask all the time and this one is a good one.  </li>
            <li>By no means the perfect sleep mask, but definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Lovely and on time!</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>This item is great for keeping the street lights at night and it helps me easily fall asleep.</li>
            <li>But this one is in a class of its own.</li>
            <li>This looked nice.....</li>
            <li>It was very cheap</li>
            <li>The side that covers the eyes is a very soft and cushy purple material.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this mask.</li>
            <li>This mask helped when I was awoken by the sun and needed more sleep.</li>
            <li>couple times the mask has fallen off my face, but for the most part, I wake up with it still on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love to give this 5 stars, but it doesn&#x27;t seem durable for long-term, every day use.</li>
            <li>In my case, the freebie mask from the airplane was a much better quality.</li>
            <li>love it use it every day</li>
            <li>A pillow over your head works better...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>Helps keep the light out so my husband can sleep when I watch TV!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cute otherwise...</li>
            <li>I love this eye mask.  </li>
            <li>Ok for the price.</li>
            <li>This helped keep out the light but felt kind of funky.</li>
            <li>Its very comfy, and had a very nice plush interior for over your eyes.    </li>
            <li>She loved it but the straps broke the first night.</li>
            <li>I like this mask, it is a nice large size so that it blocks light nice</li>
            <li>so I need something to block most of the light.    </li>
            <li>it is well made and comfortable blocks out all light!   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was cheap because I can&#x27;t use it smelling that way.</li>
            <li>But I honestly think It could be higher quality.</li>
            <li>I can see some light com through.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because my husband wakes up to go to work and ends up using a light on his phone that wakes me up every morning and</li>
            <li>If my husband is sleeping with one on, I can still read a book with the light on medium (we have a 3 way bulb for the light).</li>
            <li>This is a cheap product -- avoid it.  </li>
            <li>, it will not protect from sun and light at all.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>We used this many times and always fun.  </li>
            <li>does keep out the light.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, satiny mask, with some light, comfy padding, and it blocks light very well.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that the bands stayed on nice and it is very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I contacted Amazon and as usual they were excellent.</li>
            <li>I live in a part of the house that gets very light very quickly during the summer mornings.</li>
            <li>Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask]]</li>
            <li>Although the mask was cheap, it wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid for</li>
            <li>it is cool on the satin side</li>
            <li>in fact I woke up in the middle of the night to find it partly off, but after putting it back on in the AM, I found myself over sleeping and it was delightful :) It does block out the light completely!</li>
            <li>While the fabric on both sides (velvety on one side, satiny on the other) feel very nice</li>
            <li>Got this for my girlfriend who normally wakes up with the sun but is able to sleep in with this mask.</li>
            <li>Which is a shame, because otherwise it&#x27;s pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>Soft, very comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I love the soft feel of it.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and it is so soft on the inside.</li>
            <li>so thin doesnt block out light at all cheap ive seen better at the dollar tree after shipping cost i would have been better getting 4 or 5 at the dollar tree</li>
            <li>Both sides are that light purple color and while they are soft, it doesn&#x27;t really block light at all.  </li>
            <li>The mask does what it is supposed to and keeps out light and is nice and soft with two different materials to choose from to put over your eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is a very pretty product in purple, but it would work better for blocking the light if was black.</li>
            <li>If the elastic bands connected at the top and bottom of the mask, I think it would help displace some of the tightness, but this pulls right cross the eyeballs.</li>
            <li>In comparison to other sleep masks the quality was more on the cheap side.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It is soft, and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>It completely blocks out the light</li>
            <li>Descent at first.</li>
            <li>the band broke the first time I tried to put it on.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped it was satin on both sides but the other side is a cheap and rough synthetic velvet which isn&#x27;t great against your face or eyes.</li>
            <li>Nicely padded and a velvet on the other side</li>
            <li>i love to sleep in it , i get used so much that without it its impossible to sleep , very good quality</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s about the extent of the positive about this sleep mask.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a particularly large head</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an overly large</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sized for a rather large head, so you might have to tie it shorter, as needed.</li>
            <li>It is extremely comfortable and this double band ensures the mask doesn&#x27;t move around much during sleep.  </li>
            <li>the light from the door being open also wakes me up.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what possessed me to order this.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer to use a sleep mask I got for free from an airline on a 12-hour overseas flight five years ago.</li>
            <li>This was very snug on me.  </li>
            <li>Very comfy.</li>
            <li>If you have a very small head, it may be a good mask for you.</li>
            <li>at night with outside lights shinning in, or middle of the day with blinds closed, it works great.</li>
            <li>I love how when you put it on it gets almost completely dark.  </li>
            <li>Pretty and soft, with two different fabrics, perfect for hot or cold nights.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mask to others.</li>
            <li>It blocks out light if the blinds are closed on the windows.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m talking less than 10 feet away), and this mask really does block out the light from that.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a streetlight right outside my window</li>
            <li>Unlike other masks, it blocks out almost all light but doesn&#x27;t feel too constricting.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunatly, after about 3 days of usage, my pet rats pulled it into their cage and ripped it to shreds for a new snuggle toy.</li>
            <li>I just hope I don&#x27;t have to take another 12-hour flight to get a new mask when this one wears out.</li>
            <li>nice enough fabric, soft but the strap is really tight.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try it before installing black out curtains in my bedroom, but the curtains are going to be installed to see if they will help me sleep after finding out I am sensitive to light while trying to sleep now that I am older in age.</li>
            <li>I also washed it in the machine - in a lingerie bag and it came out just fine (air dried).</li>
            <li>This mask works just fine in blocking out light, but it&#x27;s extremely uncomfortable to me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>and I needed something less inexpensive to round out my $25 minimum for free super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that in the 10+++ years that I have slept with an eye mask I have used my fair share of some pretty bad ones.</li>
            <li>I once had a wonderful eyemask that looked similar to this, I can&#x27;t remember the name of the company that made it, but it was put out a few years ago for Breast Cancer Awareness, and I think I got confused because the AcquaBell mask looks similar.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not too tight, just right, and</li>
            <li>Also, it does NOT effectively block light.</li>
            <li>It still works, but is just barely holding on.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m a normal sized woman with a normal sized head, but this was kinda tight and pushed the mask into my eye sockets</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too light of a color/not thick enough to sufficiently block the morning sun that pours into my window.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks to buy a mask that works!</li>
            <li>It is thick enough to keep light out and the elastic band is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty petite actually), but this fits extremely tight.</li>
            <li>It hardly blocks any light (I can still see the light from my digital alarm clock with this on) and it is itchy and uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too light of a color/not thick enough to sufficiently block the morning sun that pours into my window.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks to buy a mask that works!</li>
            <li> It is thick enough to keep light out and the elastic band is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pretty petite actually), but this fits extremely tight.</li>
            <li> It hardly blocks any light (I can still see the light from my digital alarm clock with this on) and it is itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The only pluses were that both sides were soft and you get to choose between satiny and slightly fuzzy.  </li>
            <li> The straps are just way too long and there is almost no elestic in the second one.</li>
            <li> If i kept it loose enough for comfort I found it on the side of my head.</li>
            <li> The single strap pulls it tight in the middle and it sits loose on the outside, poorly blocking out light.  </li>
            <li> I actually have a pretty small head, so if this isn&#x27;t a common problem, then perhaps my mask is defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (at least, I&#x27;ve never had to look for large sizes in hats), but this felt like a tight rubber band around my head.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it gave me a headache from being too tight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t form fit to your face so your nose will feel awkward and</li>
            <li> By the way, this item is actually not fulfilled by Amazon but by AcquaBella; it&#x27;s a little confusing, but the only difference I have noticed is that you can leave AcquaBella feedback.</li>
            <li> The elastic pulls the mask so tightly around my eyes they dry out during the night and feel glued together when I get up in the morning.</li>
            <li> But stay away from the AquaBella, unless you like a limp, peice of nothing, pressing against your body all night long.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed that the elastic has become extremely stretched out within the past week or two.  </li>
            <li> It made everything almost completely dark.</li>
            <li> If it formed around the nose, it would be 100% dark.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it fits my head much too tightly.  </li>
            <li> , when I first took it out of the package it had an awful chemical smell and needed to be aired out for several days before I could use it.</li>
            <li> so when I work up my eyes felt slightly sore.      </li>
            <li> My wife used it for about half a year and then the strap broke.</li>
            <li> and I had no problems of it being to tight,</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for me.....way too tight.</li>
            <li> When they arrived I realized that the elastic was too tight around my head.  </li>
            <li> the rubber bands are so tight u can not use this product.....unless u r an infant.....</li>
            <li> Too tight around the head</li>
            <li> The strap is slightly tight for sleeping and does not have an adjustment.</li>
            <li> It is a little thinner</li>
            <li> money wasted.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this the strap started ripping it out.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is so tight that I can&#x27;t even wear it, and I am 110 lbs.!</li>
            <li> As a mom of six little kids I need a sleep mask!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not picky about sleep masks, so I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the poor reviews before I bought this.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m not impressed with this sleeping mask.  </li>
            <li> making the band across the back of the head useless.</li>
            <li> Also that fake satin just feels so odd and the other side feels like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I usually like the two bands to keep it on, but this one has one thick adjustable band.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have a small head, the strap is tight and it is of a poor design.  </li>
            <li> In fact, when I read some of the negative reviews, I must wonder if they know how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mask for a few years now, but I never use it because it&#x27;s way too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> As far as a sleep mask goes, this is worthless.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it was broken within two minutes of having it.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived with a broken elastic band.</li>
            <li> The fabrics are just too thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so poorly made that the band snapped when I tried it on</li>
            <li> The only problem is that is stinks really bad!  </li>
            <li> In fact, perhaps AquaBella should include instructions for those who do not know how to operate this OH SO complicated device.</li>
            <li> It may work for traveling like others have suggested but for sleeping it&#x27;s bordering useless.  </li>
            <li> Extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I wish I had.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a trip I had planned as sleeping on the plane is often difficult for me.</li>
            <li> what a disappointment to find out</li>
            <li> REALLY bad policy as I have often decided not to buy things because of the limit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as I wanted to give one of them as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is probably the very worst eye mask that I have ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I enjoyed this mask. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. Soft, very comfortable. In fact, when I read some of the negative reviews, I must wonder if they know how to use it correctly. In fact, perhaps AquaBella should include instructions for those who do not know how to operate this OH SO complicated device. Lovely and on time! thank you!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m not impressed with this sleeping mask.  It may work for traveling like others have suggested but for sleeping it&#x27;s bordering useless.  Both sides are that light purple color and while they are soft, it doesn&#x27;t really block light at all.  I work nights so I need something to block most of the light.    Also, I&#x27;m a normal sized woman with a normal sized head, but this was kinda tight and pushed the mask into my eye sockets so when I work up my eyes felt slightly sore.      The only pluses were that both sides were soft and you get to choose between satiny and slightly fuzzy.  It was very cheap so it has that going for it too.    Bottom Line: don&#x27;t buy for sleeping at night</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is in the discription. In comparison to other sleep masks the quality was more on the cheap side. I can see some light com through. Aside from that the bands stayed on nice and it is very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my husband wakes up to go to work and ends up using a light on his phone that wakes me up every morning and the light from the door being open also wakes me up. I just received this item yesterday. I used it last and I had no problems of it being to tight, in fact I woke up in the middle of the night to find it partly off, but after putting it back on in the AM, I found myself over sleeping and it was delightful :) It does block out the light completely!</li>
            <li> While the fabric on both sides (velvety on one side, satiny on the other) feel very nice, that&#x27;s about the extent of the positive about this sleep mask. It&#x27;s too light of a color/not thick enough to sufficiently block the morning sun that pours into my window. The elastic inside the straps broke within the strap casing (the way a ponytail holder would from extensive use) after about a week. That screams \\&quot;flimsy\\&quot; to me as I only use it in the wee hours of the morning.     Keep looking! It&#x27;s worth a few extra bucks to buy a mask that works!</li>
            <li> This is probably the very worst eye mask that I have ever used. Keep in mind that in the 10+++ years that I have slept with an eye mask I have used my fair share of some pretty bad ones. But this one is in a class of its own. The straps are just way too long and there is almost no elestic in the second one. Also that fake satin just feels so odd and the other side feels like sandpaper. I really don&#x27;t know what possessed me to order this. I once had a wonderful eyemask that looked similar to this, I can&#x27;t remember the name of the company that made it, but it was put out a few years ago for Breast Cancer Awareness, and I think I got confused because the AcquaBell mask looks similar. By the way, this item is actually not fulfilled by Amazon but by AcquaBella; it&#x27;s a little confusing, but the only difference I have noticed is that you can leave AcquaBella feedback. Anyway, I contacted Amazon and as usual they were excellent. They have given me a refund. BTW if you&#x27;re looking for a really great eye mask, you should try the [[ASIN:B0030V9MGE Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask]] as it has worked great. But stay away from the AquaBella, unless you like a limp, peice of nothing, pressing against your body all night long.</li>
            <li> I live in a part of the house that gets very light very quickly during the summer mornings. This mask helped when I was awoken by the sun and needed more sleep. Its very comfy, and had a very nice plush interior for over your eyes.    Unfortunatly, after about 3 days of usage, my pet rats pulled it into their cage and ripped it to shreds for a new snuggle toy. So I guess it made all of us happy (:    RatATatter  &lt;;\\&quot;3)~~~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sleep mask for about 3 months now in my college apartment.  There&#x27;s a streetlight right outside my window (I&#x27;m talking less than 10 feet away), and this mask really does block out the light from that.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed that the elastic has become extremely stretched out within the past week or two.  There&#x27;s marks all over the band that look like it&#x27;s being torn apart.  I actually have a pretty small head, so if this isn&#x27;t a common problem, then perhaps my mask is defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple times the mask has fallen off my face, but for the most part, I wake up with it still on.  And there have been mornings where I wake up before my alarm goes off, still thinking it&#x27;s night time because of the mask...what a disappointment to find out it&#x27;s actually morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to give this 5 stars, but it doesn&#x27;t seem durable for long-term, every day use.</li>
            <li> By no means the perfect sleep mask, but definitely worth the money. Pretty and soft, with two different fabrics, perfect for hot or cold nights.</li>
            <li> This item is great for keeping the street lights at night and it helps me easily fall asleep. It is a little thinner so doesn&#x27;t work to block out the sun on a bright day, but at night with outside lights shinning in, or middle of the day with blinds closed, it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mask for a few years now, but I never use it because it&#x27;s way too uncomfortable. I actually prefer to use a sleep mask I got for free from an airline on a 12-hour overseas flight five years ago. This mask works just fine in blocking out light, but it&#x27;s extremely uncomfortable to me. I, like another reviewer, never considered myself to have a big head (I&#x27;m pretty petite actually), but this fits extremely tight. If the elastic bands connected at the top and bottom of the mask, I think it would help displace some of the tightness, but this pulls right cross the eyeballs. Extremely uncomfortable. In my case, the freebie mask from the airplane was a much better quality. I just hope I don&#x27;t have to take another 12-hour flight to get a new mask when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> love it use it every day it is well made and comfortable blocks out all light!   [[ASIN:B001C26IH4 AquaBella Slumber Spa Sleep Eye Mask]]</li>
            <li> As far as a sleep mask goes, this is worthless. It hardly blocks any light (I can still see the light from my digital alarm clock with this on) and it is itchy and uncomfortable. Although the mask was cheap, it wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I first took it out of the package it had an awful chemical smell and needed to be aired out for several days before I could use it.</li>
            <li> I love how when you put it on it gets almost completely dark.  And it&#x27;s not too tight, just right, and that&#x27;s coming from someone with an XL head.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product! It exceeded my expectations.  The side that covers the eyes is a very soft and cushy purple material.  It feels wonderful.  Unlike other masks, it blocks out almost all light but doesn&#x27;t feel too constricting.  The elastic band is a double band.  It is extremely comfortable and this double band ensures the mask doesn&#x27;t move around much during sleep.  The exterior side is made of purple satin that slides effortlessly against a pillowcase or sheet so it doesn&#x27;t rip off the mask.  I would highly recommend this mask to others.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a small head, the strap is tight and it is of a poor design.  The single strap pulls it tight in the middle and it sits loose on the outside, poorly blocking out light.  A pillow over your head works better...</li>
            <li> nope. it doesn&#x27;t work for me.....way too tight. I thought I would try it before installing black out curtains in my bedroom, but the curtains are going to be installed to see if they will help me sleep after finding out I am sensitive to light while trying to sleep now that I am older in age.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because Amazon made me. It was cheaper than paying shipping and I needed something less inexpensive to round out my $25 minimum for free super saver shipping. REALLY bad policy as I have often decided not to buy things because of the limit. I gave the mask away and I don&#x27;t think they ever used it. Bit it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> This item look good online so I bought two of them.  When they arrived I realized that the elastic was too tight around my head.  When I started to stretch the elastic, one of the pieces snapped.  Therefore, it was broken within two minutes of having it.  I was very disappointed as I wanted to give one of them as a gift.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is so tight that I can&#x27;t even wear it, and I am 110 lbs.! It gives me a headache...money wasted.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend who normally wakes up with the sun but is able to sleep in with this mask. Looks like it works great to me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, satiny mask, with some light, comfy padding, and it blocks light very well.  Unfortunately, it fits my head much too tightly.  I don&#x27;t have a particularly large head (at least, I&#x27;ve never had to look for large sizes in hats), but this felt like a tight rubber band around my head.  If you have a very small head, it may be a good mask for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an overly large cranium-- I don&#x27;t think!  This was very snug on me.  The fabric is extremely nice though, and it looked great.  The only problem is that it gave me a headache from being too tight.</li>
            <li> Helps keep the light out so my husband can sleep when I watch TV! Seems to work. . .</li>
            <li> the rubber bands are so tight u can not use this product.....unless u r an infant.....might as well through your money away..i am sending this back</li>
            <li> Had to return. Completely uncomfortable although really cute in the picture and when it arrives. It also arrived with a broken elastic band. It doesn&#x27;t form fit to your face so your nose will feel awkward and maybe uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad cause it&#x27;s so cute otherwise...</li>
            <li> It blocks out light if the blinds are closed on the windows. If my husband is sleeping with one on, I can still read a book with the light on medium (we have a 3 way bulb for the light). It is soft, and comfortable to wear. It&#x27;s sized for a rather large head, so you might have to tie it shorter, as needed.</li>
            <li> Except for the fact that this made my eyes itch (maybe because I didnt wash before using it) I love this eye mask.  It completely blocks out the light and I love the soft feel of it.</li>
            <li> Too tight around the head</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using this the strap started ripping it out. It still works, but is just barely holding on. Which is a shame, because otherwise it&#x27;s pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> after about 4 times wearing it the string broke, I will be sending it back for a replacement..it is cool on the satin side and I like that</li>
            <li> The mask does what it is supposed to and keeps out light and is nice and soft with two different materials to choose from to put over your eyes.  The only problem is that is stinks really bad!  It came smelling like a mixture of burnt plastic and diesel.  I have washed it several times and nothing has taken the smell away.  I&#x27;m glad it was cheap because I can&#x27;t use it smelling that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally not picky about sleep masks, so I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the poor reviews before I bought this. Needless to say, I wish I had. The elastic pulls the mask so tightly around my eyes they dry out during the night and feel glued together when I get up in the morning. Also, it does NOT effectively block light. The fabrics are just too thin. Worst mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it. It made everything almost completely dark. If it formed around the nose, it would be 100% dark. Very happy with it. Very comfy.</li>
            <li> i love to sleep in it , i get used so much that without it its impossible to sleep , very good quality</li>
            <li> This is a cheap product -- avoid it.  It&#x27;s so poorly made that the band snapped when I tried it on</li>
            <li> My wife used it for about half a year and then the strap broke.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect solution to needing to sleep during the day and keeping the light out.  I love this product, and it is so soft on the inside.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty product in purple, but it would work better for blocking the light if was black. The strap is slightly tight for sleeping and does not have an adjustment. Ok for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these masks to help him sleep while I am still using the lights in our bedroom.  They are quite helpful to him.</li>
            <li> Descent at first. after a month the loop on the side of the eye mask started coming undone. making the band across the back of the head useless. and hanging, not attached anymore. I can probable sew it back.  But I honestly think It could be higher quality.</li>
            <li> This ripped/tore as soon as I took it out of the box when I put it on. I had hoped it was satin on both sides but the other side is a cheap and rough synthetic velvet which isn&#x27;t great against your face or eyes.</li>
            <li> Very nice, good color, but absolutly transparent, it will not protect from sun and light at all.</li>
            <li> I used sleep mask all the time and this one is a good one.  It is thick enough to keep light out and the elastic band is adjustable.  I have some that use velcro to close and some have one or two elastic bands to keep it on.  I usually like the two bands to keep it on, but this one has one thick adjustable band.  It is comfortable.  I will order another one to keep in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> As a mom of six little kids I need a sleep mask!  This looked nice..... the band broke the first time I tried to put it on.  It would have been nice if I could have used it one night!</li>
            <li> We used this many times and always fun.  Nicely padded and a velvet on the other side</li>
            <li> nice enough fabric, soft but the strap is really tight. does keep out the light. works well for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this mask, it is a nice large size so that it blocks light nice and it&#x27;s soft so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  The elastics are covered, so it didn&#x27;t tangle my hair. I also washed it in the machine - in a lingerie bag and it came out just fine (air dried).</li>
            <li> so thin doesnt block out light at all cheap ive seen better at the dollar tree after shipping cost i would have been better getting 4 or 5 at the dollar tree</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter as she has been borrowing mine for months.  She loved it but the straps broke the first night.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a trip I had planned as sleeping on the plane is often difficult for me. This helped keep out the light but felt kind of funky. If i kept it loose enough for comfort I found it on the side of my head.</li>
