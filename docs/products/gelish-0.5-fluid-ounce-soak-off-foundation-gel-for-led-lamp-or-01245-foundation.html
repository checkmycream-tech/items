            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>I also loved the fact that once I set the time on the lamp it automatically started when I placed my hand in to cure.</li>

            <li>WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    </li>
            <li>I got my first gel nail manicure this year and was so impressed that I decided to figure it out DIY.</li>
            <li>I love gel nail polish!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my moms UV light which was great</li>
            <li>Amazing product amazing price</li>
            <li>I can do my own shellac at home and saves money and time not having to go to a salon.</li>
            <li>There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures.</li>
            <li>It stay on for a good 2 weeks.great product love the brush on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>decided to try doing my own nails</li>
            <li>So, after three times doing your own nails, you have paid for the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li>so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li>I am so impressed with this product and my whole purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought this product, along with the topcoat polish to do my own gel nails and save some money.</li>
            <li>Really nice addition.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who likes doing their own nails..</li>
            <li>Adheres best to natural nail plate.</li>
            <li>Their products are worth every penny, or well many many dollars to get every amazing color Gelish makes!</li>
            <li>I managed a good result for my first effort!</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>have read recommendations that you wipe off most of product off brush in bottle neck and then&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li>Top It</li>
            <li>but I wish there were more.</li>
            <li>THEN apply your Gelish color polish, and the top coat according to the YOU TUBE video on HOW TO APPLY HARMONY GELISH POLISH and you have perfectly polished nails that last for weeks!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a must step and helps stay on better.  </li>
            <li>I love Gelish.  </li>
            <li>- I can do my nails when I want and enjoy the process!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love gelish.</li>
            <li>I love the entire Gelish line and this basecoat is one of the best .</li>
            <li>I love the Gelish brand of polish.</li>
            <li>Another important piece of information is to remember to get any product off your skin BEFORE curing using an orange stick!</li>
            <li>are some links to my favorite brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li>Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li>Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li>TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control</li>
            <li>They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li>Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li>I bought the Gelish Foundation, Gelish Nail Color in Passion, and Shellac Top Coat (a lot of reviews</li>
            <li>online say this top coat is easier to remove than the Gelish topcoat), and some 91% rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>I just bought 2 more colors.</li>
            <li>The foundation works better than the top coat.  </li>
            <li>After curing the Top Coat, make sure to finish your nails off with 70-99% alcohol or they will be tacky.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>My favorite gel polish brand.</li>
            <li>My aunt is a nail tech and sent me some Gelish colors and the top coat as a bridal shower gift.</li>
            <li>(today is the following Wednesday) and my mani still looks PERFECT.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd step in a 4 step process to perfect manicures.</li>
            <li>Once you figure all that out, this is a great product to use and you will really save some money going to the nail salon to get it done.</li>
            <li>Helps polish stay on much longer and works great.</li>
            <li>I have used the CND Shellac and love it.</li>
            <li>Like the Gelish color and top coat</li>
            <li>I use whatever color I like from my polish stash and then apply the top coat.</li>
            <li>I want to buy more</li>
            <li>It has a shorter brush which I love.  </li>
            <li>I wish the Top</li>
            <li>Another VERY, VERY important tidbit - it is all about a good brush for a good French!</li>
            <li>But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy a UV nail dryer if you are going to use this, gel polish does not set without UV or LED light curing.</li>
            <li>A good wattage lamp is imperative to set, (I bought a 36-watt for a good price here too), and as long as you cure well between coats, you&#x27;re all set!</li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>(As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and easy to remove(for</li>
            <li>This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also, this seller was very quick with shipping.</li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is</li>
            <li>I just wipe a strong alcohol (90%) on and that&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li>Have a super sparkly day, my fellow polish addicts!</li>
            <li>This bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li>The polish lasts about a week now which is a huge improvement for me</li>
            <li>&gt; cap the free edge (end) of the finger</li>
            <li>Cures in 1 minute with my UV light.</li>
            <li>This foundation is an important step in the gelish process so don&#x27;t skimp.  </li>
            <li>that I have never even gotten a free gift fro Harmony ???</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money and has the time and the talent to paint their own nails.</li>
            <li>An LED light is required to set the Harmony gel products.</li>
            <li>These lamps are available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>There are cards available from Sally&#x27;s that give you step by step instruction as well as here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remember you MUST have a UV or LED light to cure the product.</li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  </li>
            <li>Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  </li>
            <li>Curing Nail Dryer Light Timer[...]    </li>
            <li>[...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li>They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  </li>
            <li>The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li>Received my items quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I love this Foundation - it adds another layer to my Harmony Gelish products and really helps keep my nails growing and strong.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to try all of my colors</li>
            <li>I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li>works great , loved the product same as beauty shop used true to color worked well with my pink smoothie color then top coat applied</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s goes on smooth and cures quickly.</li>
            <li>Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li>Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li>Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li>this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased Gelish Foundation, Top Coat, and color polishes to start doing my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li>You really have to make sure to *lightly</li>
            <li>Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  </li>
            <li>The Gelish Foundation is much to thick...much thicker than the colors or top coat...</li>
            <li>I LOVED how my nails would last!</li>
            <li>This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li>When I was ready to remove the polish, I soaked my nails as instructed and the top coat</li>
            <li>It arrived in time and I love it except if you used to much it will run over  </li>
            <li>It gives a good french manicure</li>
            <li>The only downside is that you have to soak it off with acetone and cure it with uv light, neither of which are healthy practices!</li>
            <li>My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li>I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li>my polish was lucky to survive a day without chips.</li>
            <li>the shipping was also quick -3 days-</li>
            <li>Made my sensational gel polish last for over a month.</li>
            <li>First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li>First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li>color slid right off pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>Its so  easy to use and works really well.</li>
            <li>I would easily give this 5 stars, but it really dries out the nail beds.</li>
            <li>I love gelish products, they last long (2wks)and look great</li>
            <li>Love the thickness and the short bristles on the brush - makes it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I love it and the smaller brush makes it so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Large bottles (bigger than CND) and good prices.</li>
            <li>It seem to hold up really well too, because the nails stay chip/peel free for a week, MINIMUM.</li>
            <li>Just remember that thin is best..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m suprised considering the amount of free press &amp; $$$$$ I spend using only their gel products for myself and my celebrity clients ( who also love that their gel nails</li>
            <li>This goes on well, make sure you do not get any on the sides of your nails skin prior to putting under the light.</li>
            <li>I would like to say thanks to all who have commented, and I apologize for my prior review, which may have been misleading about a product that is in fact quite good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to wear nail polish often because it wasnt worth the effort.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use and only has to be cured for 1 minute under a 36watt lamp.</li>
            <li>It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li>but it turns out beautiful if you take the time to make sure the coat is very thin.</li>
            <li>Finally, I really like the short stubby brush and found that it helps the product go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not completely inept and can do my own nails and my daughter&#x27;s nails with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am even able to create the curve or smile on my French!</li>
            <li>Before the Foundation, make sure your nails are clean and DRY.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and came unharmed/no leaking.</li>
            <li>Works well and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I always buy this gelish product because it never fails me and I have been doing my nails for 7 years and this product lasts me 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had 2 nails chip through the many manicures I&#x27;ve done using the Gelish basecoat.     </li>
            <li>The topcoat (which I LOVE) is a different story.</li>
            <li>Foundation is the first application step in the Gelish soak off gel nail polish</li>
            <li>No one has mentioned that the first step should be applying the PH Bond</li>
            <li>We swim a lot in summer and regular polish doesn&#x27;t hold up more than a day or two.</li>
            <li>it will last better.  </li>
            <li>Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li>then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li>I ONLY bought the foundation and top coat.  </li>
            <li>I currently do my nails with mostly Gelish products about twice a month.  </li>
            <li>Also, make sure the dryer specifies that it will work with hybrid gel polish such as Gelish, not all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a brush like this but love it as it allows you to get just enough product.</li>
            <li>This is a really GREAT foundation and long lasting if done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes about 45min to complete my manicure with the cheap UV lamp.</li>
            <li>today is the first time i tried gelish at home...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more simple than what you see online..</li>
            <li>/&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;OK to save on Aceton (Sally&#x27;s $4) and Alcohol (Drugstore $2) but make sure to get good BASE and TOP Coat like Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>but since the polish lasts so long I have to wait! :)</li>
            <li>I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li>Fuji Finest 100% Pure Kolinsky Brushes, Size</li>
            <li>standard size ,not mini. works absolutely fine .</li>
            <li>I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li>when you get it right, wow!</li>
            <li>Not only do I have an amazing gel manicure that will last 14 days, but I don&#x27;t have to shell out the money anymore for one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I ordered and it came fast</li>
            <li>This is very comparible to CNDs Shellac</li>
            <li>the brush which is included gets clogged up really fast...</li>
            <li>After MUCH research, I bought this gel foundation.</li>
            <li>apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li>Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li>Not too much.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>All you really need is the foundation, polish, and top-it-off in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my current bottle for nearly 2 years and have not gone without gelling my nails for more than 2 weeks in that time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li>As far as the transaction with the seller, A-1 service!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting these products if you are pretty decent at doing nails.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the other Gelish products I received.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use my gel nail polish and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li>Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li>Lasts for a ridiculously long time and stays shiny and chip free.</li>
            <li>First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;good quality, easy to use, dry fast within expected time, can use with any uv light.</li>
            <li>Their most daring color is black.</li>
            <li>This is a great base coat, but be sure that you don&#x27;t get any on the skin around your nail.</li>
            <li>That is the main reason I wanted to teach myself</li>
            <li>(approx 6 diameters wide), Soak yours nails 5-7 mins making sure \\&quot;Entire\\&quot; nail of each finger is completely submerge under acetone</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li>, hopefully that will come off a little better.</li>
            <li>(top coat and little princess color)</li>
            <li>If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li>so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.  </li>
            <li>The colors act just like normal polishes.</li>
            <li>No chips, not too thick, nice and shiney....</li>
            <li>with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  </li>
            <li>The smaller brush ensures the right amount of product is applied to the nail.</li>
            <li>(if not, pour a little more acetone in your bowl to completely cover all nails).</li>
            <li>I end up giving myself a new manicure because I want to change colors, not because my polish has chips.  </li>
            <li>New    </li>
            <li>if was brand new..</li>
            <li>Just wondering if I should purchase a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li>Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really want to since this one is still half full.</li>
            <li>not sure which works better.</li>
            <li>Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try this base out, as it came highly recommended as one of the best.</li>
            <li>then thin layer of top it off , when cured with lamp  wiped off with rubbing alcohol.surprised myself !</li>
            <li>Try to get a thin good coverage on Base gel and then top colors with a very thin (staying just off the edges) top coat because by the time you get to the light, the top coat will try to spread.</li>
            <li>The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is clear and remains clear after curing treatment under UV lamp.</li>
            <li>Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li>you are ready to apply Gelish Structure if needed for extra strength or the color of your choice.</li>
            <li>If you are a nail tech like myself who was (or is) using CND Shellac, try this system, you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I really like the system although I only get about 10 days</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li>When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li>flick off old polish from</li>
            <li>Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  </li>
            <li>I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li>Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li>Since that time, I have purchased the Gelish Foundation at least two more times, and have had no problems whatsoever with either adhesion or removal.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li>I have nothing negative to say about this product :)</li>
            <li>When used by a professional you get professional results and longest wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried opi and gelish completely blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li>Best gel base I&#x27;ve used for gel polish.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to shake well, because this done come on thick.</li>
            <li>If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li>base is great!</li>
            <li>but kind of serious!</li>
            <li>Then, apply it super, super *thin*.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really long lasting, I HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the top coat tends to be a little runny causing run-over into the creases.</li>
            <li>This is a major bargain.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush is short and full, so it allows good application of the base gel.</li>
            <li>I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li>, this is full size bottle compare to MINI (half size) for the same price at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute necessity for a long lasting gel application.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>*Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li>recommend using Ph Bond especially if you are doing your natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure you used a thin layer</li>
            <li>Stays put until you are ready to take it off and works with other LED polished as well .</li>
            <li>Bought two large bottles, one for me and the other for my mom!</li>
            <li>It may very well last longer than 3 days if you buy the other products that work with it.  </li>
            <li>Initially with the foundation, top it off, and white or color, you will invest approximately $75-$100.</li>
            <li>Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li>I am new to gel nails, but not new to French manicures.</li>
            <li>thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li>(Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li>After 7 mins (maybe a little longer if you originally applied the foundation too thick), remove hand from the bowl, if you still see a little foundation on your nail, just take your thumb nail (or any finger) from OPPOSITE hand and slightly scrape off using a pushing motion (from top to bottom toward nail bed of nail being scrape)....</li>

            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    </li>
            <li> I got my first gel nail manicure this year and was so impressed that I decided to figure it out DIY.</li>
            <li> I love gel nail polish!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my moms UV light which was great</li>

            <li> I can do my own shellac at home and saves money and time not having to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures.</li>
            <li> It stay on for a good 2 weeks.great product love the brush on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> decided to try doing my own nails</li>
            <li> So, after three times doing your own nails, you have paid for the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for years ..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Nail Strengthener,  REALLY HANDY FOR ACETONE &amp; ALCHOHOL-</li>
            <li> so this was really nice.  </li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product and my whole purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, along with the topcoat polish to do my own gel nails and save some money.</li>
            <li> Really nice addition.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who likes doing their own nails..</li>
            <li> Adheres best to natural nail plate.</li>
            <li> Their products are worth every penny, or well many many dollars to get every amazing color Gelish makes!</li>
            <li> I managed a good result for my first effort!</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> have read recommendations that you wipe off most of product off brush in bottle neck and then&lt;br /&gt;apply</li>
            <li> Top It</li>
            <li> but I wish there were more.</li>
            <li> THEN apply your Gelish color polish, and the top coat according to the YOU TUBE video on HOW TO APPLY HARMONY GELISH POLISH and you have perfectly polished nails that last for weeks!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a must step and helps stay on better.  </li>
            <li> I love Gelish.  </li>
            <li> - I can do my nails when I want and enjoy the process!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love gelish.</li>
            <li> I love the entire Gelish line and this basecoat is one of the best .</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish brand of polish.</li>
            <li> Another important piece of information is to remember to get any product off your skin BEFORE curing using an orange stick!</li>
            <li> are some links to my favorite brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  </li>
            <li> Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.)</li>
            <li> Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER).</li>
            <li> TOP LED Nail Gel Polish Cure Lamp Harmony Shellac UV Dryer Timer Control</li>
            <li> They are taking the top layer of keratin off.</li>
            <li> Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top</li>
            <li> I bought the Gelish Foundation, Gelish Nail Color in Passion, and Shellac Top Coat (a lot of reviews</li>
            <li> online say this top coat is easier to remove than the Gelish topcoat), and some 91% rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I just bought 2 more colors.</li>
            <li> The foundation works better than the top coat.  </li>
            <li> After curing the Top Coat, make sure to finish your nails off with 70-99% alcohol or they will be tacky.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My favorite gel polish brand.</li>
            <li> My aunt is a nail tech and sent me some Gelish colors and the top coat as a bridal shower gift.</li>
            <li> (today is the following Wednesday) and my mani still looks PERFECT.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd step in a 4 step process to perfect manicures.</li>
            <li> Once you figure all that out, this is a great product to use and you will really save some money going to the nail salon to get it done.</li>
            <li> Helps polish stay on much longer and works great.</li>
            <li> I have used the CND Shellac and love it.</li>
            <li> Like the Gelish color and top coat</li>
            <li> I use whatever color I like from my polish stash and then apply the top coat.</li>
            <li> I want to buy more</li>
            <li> It has a shorter brush which I love.  </li>
            <li> I wish the Top</li>
            <li> Another VERY, VERY important tidbit - it is all about a good brush for a good French!</li>
            <li> But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy a UV nail dryer if you are going to use this, gel polish does not set without UV or LED light curing.</li>
            <li> A good wattage lamp is imperative to set, (I bought a 36-watt for a good price here too), and as long as you cure well between coats, you&#x27;re all set!</li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li> (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and easy to remove(for</li>
            <li> This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also, this seller was very quick with shipping.</li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is</li>
            <li> I just wipe a strong alcohol (90%) on and that&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li> Have a super sparkly day, my fellow polish addicts!</li>
            <li> This bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> The polish lasts about a week now which is a huge improvement for me</li>
            <li> &gt; cap the free edge (end) of the finger</li>
            <li> Cures in 1 minute with my UV light.</li>
            <li> This foundation is an important step in the gelish process so don&#x27;t skimp.  </li>
            <li> that I have never even gotten a free gift fro Harmony ???</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money and has the time and the talent to paint their own nails.</li>
            <li> An LED light is required to set the Harmony gel products.</li>
            <li> These lamps are available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> There are cards available from Sally&#x27;s that give you step by step instruction as well as here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember you MUST have a UV or LED light to cure the product.</li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  </li>
            <li> Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  </li>
            <li> Curing Nail Dryer Light Timer[...]    </li>
            <li> [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  </li>
            <li> They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  </li>
            <li> The end result is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely</li>
            <li> Received my items quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I love this Foundation - it adds another layer to my Harmony Gelish products and really helps keep my nails growing and strong.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to try all of my colors</li>
            <li> I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> works great , loved the product same as beauty shop used true to color worked well with my pink smoothie color then top coat applied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goes on smooth and cures quickly.</li>
            <li> Clean up as needed.  </li>
            <li> Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  </li>
            <li> Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol.</li>
            <li> this is called a clean up brush.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Gelish Foundation, Top Coat, and color polishes to start doing my own gel nails at home.</li>
            <li> You really have to make sure to *lightly</li>
            <li> Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  </li>
            <li> The Gelish Foundation is much to thick...much thicker than the colors or top coat...</li>
            <li> I LOVED how my nails would last!</li>
            <li> This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape.</li>
            <li> When I was ready to remove the polish, I soaked my nails as instructed and the top coat</li>
            <li> It arrived in time and I love it except if you used to much it will run over  </li>
            <li> It gives a good french manicure</li>
            <li> The only downside is that you have to soak it off with acetone and cure it with uv light, neither of which are healthy practices!</li>
            <li> My nails grow quickly</li>
            <li> I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light ..</li>
            <li> my polish was lucky to survive a day without chips.</li>
            <li> the shipping was also quick -3 days-</li>
            <li> Made my sensational gel polish last for over a month.</li>
            <li> First, seal the free edge of the nail.</li>
            <li> First seal the free edge.</li>
            <li> color slid right off pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> Its so  easy to use and works really well.</li>
            <li> I would easily give this 5 stars, but it really dries out the nail beds.</li>
            <li> I love gelish products, they last long (2wks)and look great</li>
            <li> Love the thickness and the short bristles on the brush - makes it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I love it and the smaller brush makes it so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Large bottles (bigger than CND) and good prices.</li>
            <li> It seem to hold up really well too, because the nails stay chip/peel free for a week, MINIMUM.</li>
            <li> Just remember that thin is best..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suprised considering the amount of free press &amp; $$$$$ I spend using only their gel products for myself and my celebrity clients ( who also love that their gel nails</li>
            <li> This goes on well, make sure you do not get any on the sides of your nails skin prior to putting under the light.</li>
            <li> I would like to say thanks to all who have commented, and I apologize for my prior review, which may have been misleading about a product that is in fact quite good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to wear nail polish often because it wasnt worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and only has to be cured for 1 minute under a 36watt lamp.</li>
            <li> It will even up your French manicure very easily.</li>
            <li> but it turns out beautiful if you take the time to make sure the coat is very thin.</li>
            <li> Finally, I really like the short stubby brush and found that it helps the product go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely inept and can do my own nails and my daughter&#x27;s nails with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am even able to create the curve or smile on my French!</li>
            <li> Before the Foundation, make sure your nails are clean and DRY.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and came unharmed/no leaking.</li>
            <li> Works well and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I always buy this gelish product because it never fails me and I have been doing my nails for 7 years and this product lasts me 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had 2 nails chip through the many manicures I&#x27;ve done using the Gelish basecoat.     </li>
            <li> The topcoat (which I LOVE) is a different story.</li>
            <li> Foundation is the first application step in the Gelish soak off gel nail polish</li>
            <li> No one has mentioned that the first step should be applying the PH Bond</li>
            <li> We swim a lot in summer and regular polish doesn&#x27;t hold up more than a day or two.</li>
            <li> it will last better.  </li>
            <li> Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail.</li>
            <li> then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  </li>
            <li> I ONLY bought the foundation and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I currently do my nails with mostly Gelish products about twice a month.  </li>
            <li> Also, make sure the dryer specifies that it will work with hybrid gel polish such as Gelish, not all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a brush like this but love it as it allows you to get just enough product.</li>
            <li> This is a really GREAT foundation and long lasting if done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes about 45min to complete my manicure with the cheap UV lamp.</li>
            <li> today is the first time i tried gelish at home...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more simple than what you see online..</li>
            <li> /&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;OK to save on Aceton (Sally&#x27;s $4) and Alcohol (Drugstore $2) but make sure to get good BASE and TOP Coat like Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but since the polish lasts so long I have to wait! :)</li>
            <li> I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks ..</li>
            <li> Fuji Finest 100% Pure Kolinsky Brushes, Size</li>
            <li> standard size ,not mini. works absolutely fine .</li>
            <li> I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li> when you get it right, wow!</li>
            <li> Not only do I have an amazing gel manicure that will last 14 days, but I don&#x27;t have to shell out the money anymore for one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered and it came fast</li>
            <li> This is very comparible to CNDs Shellac</li>
            <li> the brush which is included gets clogged up really fast...</li>
            <li> After MUCH research, I bought this gel foundation.</li>
            <li> apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  </li>
            <li> Various helpful supplies I got from Amazon.com:  magnifying glasses, lint free cloth, brush for Structure Gel,  </li>
            <li> Not too much.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> All you really need is the foundation, polish, and top-it-off in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my current bottle for nearly 2 years and have not gone without gelling my nails for more than 2 weeks in that time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  </li>
            <li> As far as the transaction with the seller, A-1 service!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting these products if you are pretty decent at doing nails.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the other Gelish products I received.</li>
            <li> I am excited to use my gel nail polish and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li> Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  </li>
            <li> Lasts for a ridiculously long time and stays shiny and chip free.</li>
            <li> First remove old gel polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;good quality, easy to use, dry fast within expected time, can use with any uv light.</li>
            <li> Their most daring color is black.</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat, but be sure that you don&#x27;t get any on the skin around your nail.</li>
            <li> That is the main reason I wanted to teach myself</li>
            <li> (approx 6 diameters wide), Soak yours nails 5-7 mins making sure \\&quot;Entire\\&quot; nail of each finger is completely submerge under acetone</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly recommend.    </li>
            <li> , hopefully that will come off a little better.</li>
            <li> (top coat and little princess color)</li>
            <li> If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  </li>
            <li> so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.  </li>
            <li> The colors act just like normal polishes.</li>
            <li> No chips, not too thick, nice and shiney....</li>
            <li> with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  </li>
            <li> The smaller brush ensures the right amount of product is applied to the nail.</li>
            <li> (if not, pour a little more acetone in your bowl to completely cover all nails).</li>
            <li> I end up giving myself a new manicure because I want to change colors, not because my polish has chips.  </li>
            <li> New    </li>
            <li> if was brand new..</li>
            <li> Just wondering if I should purchase a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  </li>
            <li> Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really want to since this one is still half full.</li>
            <li> not sure which works better.</li>
            <li> Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first,</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try this base out, as it came highly recommended as one of the best.</li>
            <li> then thin layer of top it off , when cured with lamp  wiped off with rubbing alcohol.surprised myself !</li>
            <li> Try to get a thin good coverage on Base gel and then top colors with a very thin (staying just off the edges) top coat because by the time you get to the light, the top coat will try to spread.</li>
            <li> The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is clear and remains clear after curing treatment under UV lamp.</li>
            <li> Clear Pump Dispenser Bottle  </li>
            <li> you are ready to apply Gelish Structure if needed for extra strength or the color of your choice.</li>
            <li> If you are a nail tech like myself who was (or is) using CND Shellac, try this system, you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I really like the system although I only get about 10 days</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. .</li>
            <li> flick off old polish from</li>
            <li> Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  </li>
            <li> I find I must do this nearly every day ..</li>
            <li> Debra Lynn Professional 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Since that time, I have purchased the Gelish Foundation at least two more times, and have had no problems whatsoever with either adhesion or removal.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I still developed an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product :)</li>
            <li> When used by a professional you get professional results and longest wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried opi and gelish completely blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li> Best gel base I&#x27;ve used for gel polish.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to shake well, because this done come on thick.</li>
            <li> If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color ..</li>
            <li> base is great!</li>
            <li> but kind of serious!</li>
            <li> Then, apply it super, super *thin*.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really long lasting, I HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the top coat tends to be a little runny causing run-over into the creases.</li>
            <li> This is a major bargain.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is short and full, so it allows good application of the base gel.</li>
            <li> I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel.</li>
            <li> , this is full size bottle compare to MINI (half size) for the same price at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute necessity for a long lasting gel application.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> *Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  </li>
            <li> recommend using Ph Bond especially if you are doing your natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> make sure you used a thin layer</li>
            <li> Stays put until you are ready to take it off and works with other LED polished as well .</li>
            <li> Bought two large bottles, one for me and the other for my mom!</li>
            <li> It may very well last longer than 3 days if you buy the other products that work with it.  </li>
            <li> Initially with the foundation, top it off, and white or color, you will invest approximately $75-$100.</li>
            <li> Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  </li>
            <li> I am new to gel nails, but not new to French manicures.</li>
            <li> thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    </li>
            <li> (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  </li>
            <li> After 7 mins (maybe a little longer if you originally applied the foundation too thick), remove hand from the bowl, if you still see a little foundation on your nail, just take your thumb nail (or any finger) from OPPOSITE hand and slightly scrape off using a pushing motion (from top to bottom toward nail bed of nail being scrape)....</li>
            <li> You want to make sure you cover the entire nail with a very thin coat and cure for the proper amount of time given the uv/led light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After manicuring your cuticles, shaping your nails, LIGHTLY buffing your nail bed, and wiping off each nail with a little rubbling alcohol for better adhesion, THEN apply a THIN coat of the foundation base gel and place your hands under the UV light (36 watt is what I have) for only 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application.</li>
            <li> The pedicures have been extremely long lasting, without any peeling or chipping.  </li>
            <li> This last a long time.</li>
            <li> i will update in 2-3 weeks if it actually last that long..</li>
            <li> Will last a long time!</li>
            <li> The old adage \\&quot;less is more\\</li>
            <li> I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed.</li>
            <li> Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be applied THIN (super super thin) and cured for 1 minute before applying Gelish color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> when I heard how long gel nails lasted ..</li>
            <li> I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed ..</li>
            <li> Pink Smoothie and Red Roses.</li>
            <li> It provides a good base for the color.  </li>
            <li> I have read on other places that consumers are having some trouble with the wear or soak off of gelish foundation and that is because it is a professional grade product requiring you to be trained in proper nail care and application or the product.</li>
            <li> Larger than expected!</li>
            <li> so your nails don&#x27;t dry out.    </li>
            <li> this is a DRY cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The manicure will last until you have too much growth or are totally tired of the color.</li>
            <li> I have done my own gel manicures at home for quite a few years, and had said in my prior review that this product was impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> This brush made even this amateur try look professional.</li>
            <li> - what did I have to loose.</li>
            <li> No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out.</li>
            <li> Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  </li>
            <li> the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)  </li>
            <li> (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need each product to complete the manicure, which will be instantly dry and hard when done.</li>
            <li> Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps, Debra Lynn Black 240/320 Grit Nail File ,  Professional 100/100 grit Nail files zebra file emery board,  Harmony Gelish Vitagel - Strength- green bottle  </li>
            <li> Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  </li>
            <li> After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand,flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands (OPI, IBD, Red Carpet) and I always go back to Gelish, The brush has very short bristles, which seemed weird at first, but it does help to get a thin coat.</li>
            <li> Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I am always painting my nails and now I only have to do it every few weeks</li>
            <li> Rough up nails</li>
            <li> I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet ..</li>
            <li> just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  </li>
            <li> As expected- zero</li>
            <li> left such a thick coat it just peeled off.</li>
            <li> any other comments?</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to spread up to just short of the cuticle line (never touching the cuticle to avoid lifting) and&lt;br /</li>
            <li> With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  </li>
            <li> TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  </li>
            <li> When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it makes gel polish hold up for up to 5 weeks...seriously.</li>
            <li> I bought this in combination with some other gelish products, so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep paying $30ish</li>
            <li> so I was very careful in applying the product.</li>
            <li> with the pad slightly off center.  </li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails</li>
            <li> On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip.</li>
            <li> i have not tried any other base gel coat, do they sell any other :)</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with the gelish top coat and base.</li>
            <li> you do happen to put the foundation on too thick, you will double your removal time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this base gel to go with the top coat and color that I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> Works better than the IBD Base Coat</li>
            <li> I love my nails but hate nail salons</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base coat,for gel nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 2 pedicures using the Gelish foundation base gel (along with the Gelish color and top coat).  </li>
            <li> At one point I tried using just the Sally hansen base coat and the Gelish color and top coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the base and top coats that are tricky.</li>
            <li> Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  </li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> Graham Hands Down</li>
            <li> Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is tiny and it takes a very small amount</li>
            <li> (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  </li>
            <li> Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    </li>
            <li> (less harmful to cuticles and surrounding skin than UV lamps)  </li>
            <li> but this is a bottle of gooey mess.  </li>
            <li> but the foundation is a gloppy mess that made my nails look lumpy.</li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube videos, (gotta love YouTube), and found out the only things I needed were the base, the topcoat, and the lamp!</li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    </li>
            <li> The Gelish base gel is easy to work with and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> but for a few bucks less.</li>
            <li> Also, this polish has a tendency to spread as it cures, so I like to leave a little space between my nail and the skin beside the nail.</li>
            <li> If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  </li>
            <li> it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping.</li>
            <li> AND FOUNDATION WILL BE GONE IN LITTLE TO</li>
            <li> The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.  </li>
            <li> This base coat is fabulous.</li>
            <li> What a waste.  </li>
            <li> But lately it has been peeling easily :(  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price!</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply in a thin layer, and as this gel is extremely thick it is near impossible to do, but it is necessary in order to ensure a proper manicure.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, do not just plop this on your nail as you would a regular base coat.  </li>
            <li> Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips.</li>
            <li> not sure what the problem with this one was...</li>
            <li> small toenails</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the small one that comes in the kit from Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Pour 100% Acetone (approx 1/4 cup) in small glass bowl</li>
            <li> I even do my families and friends nails for a small fee.</li>
            <li> Gelish has small tricks to application</li>
            <li> This definitely works to make my gel manicures last a long time - but I have been having tons of problems getting the base coat off!</li>
            <li> Other brands are worse though.</li>
            <li> I can not live with out the perfection of Gelish Foundation (UV GEL base coat) because no other Gel company compares to Harmony...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s bad; it&#x27;s just that there are other similar quality basecoats for sale that function just as well as this one.</li>
            <li> * buff the nail with an emery block first to give it some traction for the base coat.</li>
            <li> The base is pretty thick</li>
            <li> It must have been a bottle either from a bad batch, or was old or damaged in some way.  </li>
            <li> one way says to remove the sticky surface of the base coat (after drying in lamp) and at the salon, they don&#x27;t not remove the sticky layer until the very end of the manicure.</li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.</li>
            <li> If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  </li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen stuff is just WAY too thick, and by comparison, doesn&#x27;t stay on your nails as well.</li>
            <li> It is so thick it comes out in globs</li>
            <li> kept base layer thin ,used standard opi nail varnish, did 2 layers ,let dry in air.</li>
            <li> the small brush applicator helps you apply it thinly.</li>
            <li> If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  </li>
            <li> I had previously given this product a very poor review.  </li>
            <li> but it tends to be goopy making it hard to get a thin layer.</li>
            <li> remember that you do not want it thick!</li>
            <li> One thing though is dont get it too thick!</li>
            <li> This foundation is very thick.  </li>
            <li> It shrinks no matter what I do to prep my nails, or how thin I apply it.</li>
            <li> i have seen in the instructions on how to apply the base coat different ways.</li>
            <li> You have to put on a thin layer and</li>
            <li> I am addicted to always having my nails done.  </li>
            <li> If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  </li>
            <li> Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application.</li>
            <li> I think I might try OPI&#x27;s base for my next manicure</li>
            <li> Other than that, just try your hand at doing this - you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> you use a thin coat, you will not go wrong.</li>
            <li> With that said, I feel the consistency and ease of removal is about average for a base gel.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so&lt;br /&gt;old</li>
            <li> (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS</li>
            <li> This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  </li>
            <li> In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails ..</li>
            <li> The base gel has a very short brush, which also helps with keeping the base layer thin.</li>
            <li> This is sort of a necessary evil when using Gelish colors.</li>
            <li> but they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Then, apply a VERY THIN coat of Foundation.</li>
            <li> dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush.</li>
            <li> work as advertised ,can&#x27;t go wrong with it! ...</li>
            <li> (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  </li>
            <li> Just remember to keep the base layer very very thin.  </li>
            <li> IMPOSSIBLE after the LED</li>
            <li> SO BADLY TO AMAZON</li>
            <li> Maybe I was shipped a bad bottle</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> does it go bad???</li>
            <li> It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> This base works well.</li>
            <li> Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions:</li>
            <li> If you use the shellac you have to have the base gel.</li>
            <li> However, the base coat was stuck like glue, even after repeated soakings in the Gelish remover.</li>
            <li> Harmony Gelish FOUNDATION / Base Gel&lt;br /&gt;by</li>
            <li> You have to use a Gelish base coat</li>
            <li> I hate making appts for salons and don&#x27;t like the cost</li>
            <li> Also, the PH base is rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> My nails look absolutely terrible now.</li>
            <li> Should always use a base gel when using gel polishes!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is great MUST HAVE for gel nail wearers! Its so  easy to use and works really well. Will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Works well and is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I always buy this gelish product because it never fails me and I have been doing my nails for 7 years and this product lasts me 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula. It shrinks no matter what I do to prep my nails, or how thin I apply it.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and only has to be cured for 1 minute under a 36watt lamp. Just remember that thin is best..no need to pile it on. That applies to all of their products. Simple system to use and i love it.</li>
            <li> i have seen in the instructions on how to apply the base coat different ways. one way says to remove the sticky surface of the base coat (after drying in lamp) and at the salon, they don&#x27;t not remove the sticky layer until the very end of the manicure. any other comments? not sure which works better.</li>
            <li> The Gelish base gel is easy to work with and long-lasting. I&#x27;ve only had 2 nails chip through the many manicures I&#x27;ve done using the Gelish basecoat.     With that said, I feel the consistency and ease of removal is about average for a base gel. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s bad; it&#x27;s just that there are other similar quality basecoats for sale that function just as well as this one. The topcoat (which I LOVE) is a different story.</li>
            <li> This base works well. You have to put on a thin layer and the small brush applicator helps you apply it thinly.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with the gelish top coat and base. They work like a charm! They give enough strenght for my nails to actually grow out. Awesome stuff!  I have been using 2 min intervals in each step under a 36 watt UV lamp and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute necessity for a long lasting gel application.&lt;br /&gt;Just remember that you do not want it thick! The old adage \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; will prove to be your best friend with this product. You want to make sure you cover the entire nail with a very thin coat and cure for the proper amount of time given the uv/led light.&lt;br /&gt;If you do happen to put the foundation on too thick, you will double your removal time. This will also allow the gel to peel up quicker and decrease the wear time of your manicure.&lt;br /&gt;But when you get it right, wow! The manicure will last until you have too much growth or are totally tired of the color. Just don&#x27;t forget the top coat!</li>
            <li> work as advertised ,can&#x27;t go wrong with it! ...Easy to apply and easy to remove(for an uv polish).If i can use this product without problems, anyone can...</li>
            <li> Foundation is the first application step in the Gelish soak off gel nail polish application.&lt;br /&gt;It is clear and remains clear after curing treatment under UV lamp. It is applied to cleansed&lt;br /&gt; and prepped nails and the bottle comes with a short kinda stubby brush. I have read it is&lt;br /&gt;meant to be enough to do 1,000 nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be applied THIN (super super thin) and cured for 1 minute before applying Gelish color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read recommendations that you wipe off most of product off brush in bottle neck and then&lt;br /&gt;apply a dot to each of your fingers with what remains on the brush. Then use a scrubbing motion&lt;br /&gt;to spread up to just short of the cuticle line (never touching the cuticle to avoid lifting) and&lt;br /&gt; cap the free edge (end) of the finger nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure for 1 minute under a UV lamp (36 watt or better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you are ready to apply Gelish Structure if needed for extra strength or the color of your choice.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not a professional nail tech.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an artist who&#x27;s been painting her nails&lt;br /&gt;for quite some time, though. If this happens to&lt;br /&gt;be the case for someone buying the Gelish set,&lt;br /&gt;it takes a lot of practice to get used to this&lt;br /&gt;procedure, especially for a French.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to save money and do it myself.  I bought the:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Foundation&lt;br /&gt;2. Ph Bond&lt;br /&gt;3. Sleek White&lt;br /&gt;4. Top It Off&lt;br /&gt;5. Nourish - which smells AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my moms UV light which was great&lt;br /&gt;that I didn&#x27;t have to buy. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s so&lt;br /&gt;old that I don&#x27;t know how strong the bulb is so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty much guessing on cure times.&lt;br /&gt;There are just a cople French Gelish Manicure videos&lt;br /&gt;on YouTube but I wish there were more. I am having such&lt;br /&gt;a hard time making the white perfect on myself. I even&lt;br /&gt;recently bought self-adhesive reinforcement circles&lt;br /&gt;to help make the line more perfect. We&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gelish Polishes now for 3 months and LOVE LOVE them!! This Foundation is a piece of the puzzle you must have in order to make the polishes work and last.  After manicuring your cuticles, shaping your nails, LIGHTLY buffing your nail bed, and wiping off each nail with a little rubbling alcohol for better adhesion, THEN apply a THIN coat of the foundation base gel and place your hands under the UV light (36 watt is what I have) for only 10 seconds. THEN apply your Gelish color polish, and the top coat according to the YOU TUBE video on HOW TO APPLY HARMONY GELISH POLISH and you have perfectly polished nails that last for weeks!!</li>
            <li> I love this Foundation - it adds another layer to my Harmony Gelish products and really helps keep my nails growing and strong.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing Harmony Gelish nails yourself, this is step 3. You&#x27;ll need each product to complete the manicure, which will be instantly dry and hard when done.</li>
            <li> I purchased this base gel to go with the top coat and color that I was purchasing. After paying $45 for Gelish manicures at the local nail salon, I decided to save money by doing them myself. This item works just like I thought it would.   Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation I have used. I have tried several other brands (OPI, IBD, Red Carpet) and I always go back to Gelish, The brush has very short bristles, which seemed weird at first, but it does help to get a thin coat. And this is the big bottle, almost twice the size that you get at Sallys.</li>
            <li> standard size ,not mini. works absolutely fine . I managed a good result for my first effort! kept base layer thin ,used standard opi nail varnish, did 2 layers ,let dry in air. then thin layer of top it off , when cured with lamp  wiped off with rubbing alcohol.surprised myself !</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous color… Almost bullet proof…probably the best, most durable brand in the world! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is needed in doing gel polish it helps polish Adhesive and stay on the nail bed..it&#x27;s a must step and helps stay on better.  I ordered and it came fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in love with these products after just one try!  I am always painting my nails and now I only have to do it every few weeks, they look wonderful even days after I painted them.</li>
            <li> This foundation base gel for gelish soak of gel polish is great. The smaller brush ensures the right amount of product is applied to the nail. Cures in 1 minute with my UV light. If you are a nail tech like myself who was (or is) using CND Shellac, try this system, you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is very comparible to CNDs Shellac but for a few bucks less. I really like the system although I only get about 10 days wear out of them. I think that will increase with practice. The base is pretty thick but it turns out beautiful if you take the time to make sure the coat is very thin. All in all, a great product.</li>
            <li> No one has mentioned that the first step should be applying the PH Bond so your nails don&#x27;t dry out.    Also, the darker the color the longer I cure my nails in the lamp.  I love Gelish.  I am addicted to always having my nails done.  I end up giving myself a new manicure because I want to change colors, not because my polish has chips.  I get compliments every day on my nails.</li>
            <li> Works better than the IBD Base Coat</li>
            <li> Best gel base I&#x27;ve used for gel polish.  Love the thickness and the short bristles on the brush - makes it easy to apply.  It&#x27;s really long lasting, I HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> These are great. I can do my own shellac at home and saves money and time not having to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> The Gelish Foundation is much to thick...much thicker than the colors or top coat...the brush which is included gets clogged up really fast...not sure what the problem with this one was...I&#x27;m wondering if I got a bottle from a defective batch...usable, but aggravating..</li>
            <li> This foundation is an important step in the gelish process so don&#x27;t skimp.  The foundation brush is tiny and it takes a very small amount so it lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve been doing my own nails for about 6 months now and the gelish process is easy and the results are great!  I love my nails but hate nail salons and this is the perfect answer - I can do my nails when I want and enjoy the process!</li>
            <li> I can not live with out the perfection of Gelish Foundation (UV GEL base coat) because no other Gel company compares to Harmony...Period!!!! I&#x27;m suprised considering the amount of free press &amp; $$$$$ I spend using only their gel products for myself and my celebrity clients ( who also love that their gel nails that last 3 weeks and never clip) that I have never even gotten a free gift fro Harmony ??? LOL....but kind of serious! Their products are worth every penny, or well many many dollars to get every amazing color Gelish makes!</li>
            <li> This base coat is fabulous. I use one coat, set it for 30 seconds under my mini LED light, then apply 2 coats of gel polish for a perfect gel manicure. A friend of mine bought another brand of gel foundation and experienced peeling. I do not have that problem with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to save money and has the time and the talent to paint their own nails. An LED light is required to set the Harmony gel products. These lamps are available on Amazon. There are lots of YouTube videos to show you how to use this product and do your own gel manicures. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> After MUCH research, I bought this gel foundation. I&#x27;m so glad I did. The bottle was a LOT bigger than I thought it would be! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months now, doing nails 3-4 times a week, and it&#x27;s not gone yet!! You can&#x27;t beat the Gelish brand, either. It&#x27;s goes on smooth and cures quickly. It seem to hold up really well too, because the nails stay chip/peel free for a week, MINIMUM. I wasn&#x27;t going to buy the Gelish brand since I was trying to save money where I could, but after using it, I wont be changing brands any time soon!</li>
            <li> Perfect for do it yourself nails</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base coat,for gel nails i have not tried any other base gel coat, do they sell any other :)</li>
            <li> This is the best gel nail foundation I have ever tried.  It is the only one that will make my polish last over a week.  I will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This foundation is very thick.  It provides a good base for the color.  Gelish is my preferred nail polish brand.</li>
            <li> Good price and you definitely want to use this foundation for any gel polish!</li>
            <li> This goes on well, make sure you do not get any on the sides of your nails skin prior to putting under the light.</li>
            <li> Love gelish. It stay on for a good 2 weeks.great product love the brush on the bottle.  Like like like</li>
            <li> Great addition to my nail kit. I love the entire Gelish line and this basecoat is one of the best . Stays put until you are ready to take it off and works with other LED polished as well .</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish brand of polish. This is a great base coat, but be sure that you don&#x27;t get any on the skin around your nail. If you do, your manicure will lift. Also, this polish has a tendency to spread as it cures, so I like to leave a little space between my nail and the skin beside the nail. Be sure to shake well, because this done come on thick. Finally, I really like the short stubby brush and found that it helps the product go on more smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am new to gel nails, but not new to French manicures. I taught myself how to do a French manicure over a year ago. However, the problem was regular nail polish would never last. That is the main reason I wanted to teach myself so I could do my nails on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I was introduced to Gel Nails at my local WalMart. I LOVED how my nails would last! However, the products they were using would chip and crack. So, I would go back within two weeks to get them done again - until I discovered gelish products through a salon I just tried out of frustration.  She uses gelish products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try doing my own nails - what did I have to loose. If it were unsuccessful, I would give the products to my tech since she used it anyway. My nails are georgous! My tech did not believe I did them myself! I am even able to create the curve or smile on my French! There are cards available from Sally&#x27;s that give you step by step instruction as well as here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a thin coat, you will not go wrong. Remember you MUST have a UV or LED light to cure the product. Another important piece of information is to remember to get any product off your skin BEFORE curing using an orange stick! Another VERY, VERY important tidbit - it is all about a good brush for a good French! The best brushes, I have found, are Osaka and Kolinsky available here on Amazon! Other than that, just try your hand at doing this - you will not be disappointed. Initially with the foundation, top it off, and white or color, you will invest approximately $75-$100. but that is the cost of 2-3 manicures. So, after three times doing your own nails, you have paid for the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some links to my favorite brushes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004Q8IYE6 Osaka French Gel Nail Brush + Dotting Tool (Acrylic Purple Handle) Size # 14, Japan]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004QDQYDO Osaka French Gel Nail Brush + Dotting Tool (White Blue Marble Handle) Size # 6, Japan]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0045W2UXO Fuji Finest 100% Pure Kolinsky Brushes, Size # 8]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> I like my Gelish system as an alternative to acrylic nails. I&#x27;m not completely inept and can do my own nails and my daughter&#x27;s nails with this stuff. We swim a lot in summer and regular polish doesn&#x27;t hold up more than a day or two. This stuff is indestructible.</li>
            <li> WAITED TO WRITE THIS REVIEW UNTIL AFTER READING MANY REVIEWERS, WEBSITES AND MONTHS OF TRIAL AND ERROR!    I waited to write this review until I had tried MANY of the tips from MANY of the wonderful reviewers on Amazon.com!  Below is what has finally worked for me the best.  I have been doing my own nails for years .. when I heard how long gel nails lasted .. I was hooked!  I find my pedicure will last easily 4 weeks .. my manicure very nicely 2 weeks .. then I must start to \\&quot;tip\\&quot; the ends with a matching regular nail polish.  If I am not in a hurry .. the best way is to use an OPI base coat plus the color .. it will last better.  My nails grow quickly so I really can&#x27;t last much longer than 3 weeks without a LOT of regrowth along the cuticle.  Hope the below is helpful .. thanks to all the other Reviewers who helped me get started on gel nails!    AUGUST 2013  (SORRY IN ADVANCE THAT MY \\&quot;WORD\\&quot; DOCUMENT CONVERTS SO BADLY TO AMAZON VIA THE SENTENCE STRUCTURES!)     The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones!    Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application    AUGUST 2013  The motto for GEL is \\&quot;thin to win\\&quot; - several very thin layers, no thick ones.  Manicure &amp; Pedicure Gelish Application  [...]  1. First remove old gel polish. Rough up nails well so acetone can get through. Then starting with the little finger and work to the thumb.  Soak pad of Hands Down with acetone.  Start with the short end of Hands Down ..  with the pad slightly off center.  Pull it tightly over the nail bed, it will settle to the center of the nail bed, keeping full contact with the nail as it soaks the gel off.  When 5 fingers complete .. put on a disposable glove. . This helps keep the pads moist longer.  Do the second hand.  Put a glove on the second hand and set the timer for 20 minutes after completing 2nd hand. With the gloves on, can do other tasks.  After 20 minutes, remove the glove and pull off the pads, one at a time .. starting with little finger-1st hand,flipping the polish off each nail with an orange stick as you go. If some sticks on the tips, a little pressure with an orange stick coated with acetone ought to make it release.  Pads can reused a couple of times before throwing away .. flick off old polish from pad/flatten/let dry/store separated in paper sheets they came in.  (Using: Graham Hands Down Soak Off Gel Nail Wraps-works GREAT! -for small toenails the pad can be cut in half for double usage!)  2.  Apply cuticle remover .. push back the cuticle.  3.  Remove cuticle from nail plate.  Clean up as needed.  4.  Shape the natural nail using your 240 grit file of choice.  5.  Gently remove the shine using the 100 grit side of a 100/180 Buffer until very smooth.  6.  Remove the dust and clean the nail.  .  (IF POSSIBLE:  apply vitamin E oil to your nails and fingers after this process because the acetone is very drying.  Leave on overnight if possible. Then:  wash with soap and water and polish using the proper steps.  7.  Wipe the nail with NAIL PREP (or70/91% alcohol) using a lint free wipe (can even use small cuts of lint free paper towel).  Use an orange stick to fully clean around cuticles with the alcohol. You don&#x27;t want any kind of oil on the nails.  8. Apply  PH Bond to the nail plate. (or skip if you used alcohol if you choose) APPLY SPARINGLY - i.e. very thin coat!  (Use a dry brush and pull more product OFF the nail to ensure it&#x27;s thin enough.) .  9. SKIP TO #12 IF nails are not peeling/brittle/weak/damaged.  If you have normal nails just using Foundation Gel  as your base.  **Apply Gelish NAIL STRENGHENER STRENGTH-green bottle ..  (instead of GELISH FOUNDATION GEL) - first seal the edges of the nail. If needed apply 2 thin layers of the Gelish strengthener.  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  10.  Apply  NAIL STRENGHTENER RECOVERY-gold bottle for added strength and that takes care of most problems.) Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds.  (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails!)  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in the LED Light for 10 seconds.  10b NEXT  .. \\&quot;STRUCTURE GEL.  NOTE:  dot a small amount of base coat on each nail with the brush. Then, wipe the rest of the gel off of the brush. Use the mostly dry brush to spread the small amount of product on your nail. I even wipe the brush off between each nail. This ensures a thin layer OR WILL PEEL!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds. (This xtra step is only necessary for poor nails but Structure Gel is a wonderful strong product!.)  11. If you choose you can  emove some of the tacky surface residue with clean dry brush.  DO NOT USE CLEANSER... this is a DRY cleaning.  12.  Apply Gelish Color Coat of Choice. First, seal the free edge of the nail. Then, apply to the nail plate in a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION from cuticle to free edge.  If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer. APPLICATION SHOULD BE ALMOST SEE-THROUGH ON 1st COAT!  Place hand in the LED Light for 30 seconds (30 seconds for light colors).  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  13.  Repeat Step 11, 12 &amp; 13 for 2nd color coat.  14.  Apply Gelish Top Coat (GELISH TOP IT OFF GEL SEALER). First seal the free edge. Then, apply from cuticle to free edge using a THIN LIGHT APPLICATION. If you apply too thick a coat, your results will suffer.  Place hand in LED Light for 20 seconds.  (As with ALL UV products, cure thumbs very carefully OR separately for best results.  15.  Wipe off the tacky surface residue with NAIL PREP (or alcohol) using a lint free wipe.  16.  Use cuticle oil nightly  as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking.    TIPS:  a.  I find it better to complete one step .. including the LED light .. with one hand at a time because the gel  does not dry at all .. causing smudges if I attempt to do the step on the 2nd hand without the LED light.  b.  I use a narrow orange stick and an old cleaned polish bottle filled with acetone to remove any gel touching  a cuticle or skin.  I do this as I go as it is easier to do while wet .. IMPOSSIBLE after the LED light!c.  Peeling: If you have tried thinner layers, and upping your cure time (try 1 min extra for UV, 30 sec extra  for LED) isn&#x27;t working, consider blaming your foundation coat formula, this was the culprit in my second  Gelish kit.  d.  By searching and finally finding a regular nail polish (Sally Hansen \\&quot;#350 Heart to Heart\\&quot; Diamond Strength No Chip Nail Color) close to my gel polish (gelish \\&quot;Tiger Blossum-Item #01334) I have been able to make my nails last up to nearly 4 weeks!  Not looking great toward the end but tolerable!  In the beginning it is merely \\&quot;tipping\\&quot; the nails .. ie using the #350 to color the tip of the nails after they wear off.  I find I must do this nearly every day .. just do this as I put on my make up .. being careful of the finger tips as I apply my make up.  Then as the gel gets to be 2-3 to 4 weeks old my nail beds have grown out at least 1/4\\&quot;.  I then carefully add the #350 around the upper nail bed .. then add a regular top coat to make it all shiny.  I get another week out of it .. YEAH!  e.

I was always using my Iphone as a timer backup for the UV lamp so this was really nice.  I found that the replacement bulbs for the UV lamp were almost $30, and the LED lamp is supposed to last 35,000 hours - so not only is it better to not have the UV exposure but cheaper in the long run.  TECH TIPS:  [...]  Gelish recommended cure times are based on using a Gelish Harmony LED Curing Light.  For best performance follow recommended cure times.  **I think the soaking the Gel polish off in Acetone every time they come in weakens the nail bed as well. I make my client only wear it ever third time they get a manicure. I don&#x27;t care what they say...it does make the nail a little weaker because of the soaking and scrapping. [...]**clients who like to peel the product off, I believe this may be why subsequent applications are not working. They are taking the top layer of keratin off. I always caution my clients not do to this and if they do, they cannot expect the product to perform the way it&#x27;s designed to do. **Do buy a bottle of cuticle oil and use it over your Shellac every day (I keep mine next to my bed and put it on at night when I set my alarm) as this helps keep the product flexible and less prone to cracking. **there&#x27;s a huge influx of similar uv gel polish products right now. Gelish, Geleration, Axxium, Gelicure... lots of them. They are great products, and similar to Shellac in their wearing, but all of the others come in a pot and are applied with a gel brush.  **Some women I apply an extra topcoat, some protein bond, some a layer or two of structure first, some, all of the above.  **  [...]    TIPS I PICKED UP FROM OTHER REVIEWERS:  *****GELISH STRUCTURE GEL  **I used a #6 flat gel brush to apply it very thinly, and it leveled nicely, cured thoroughly in 90 seconds to a high shine. I highly recommend this, as it is easy to apply and definitely adds strength to the nail.  .. Purpose: Used to strengthen weak nails OR to equalize the level differences between the natural nail plate and applied false nail tips. Use this product after the Gelish Foundation (BASE) step has been completed  Directions: Apply 1-3 thin coats depending upon nail strength desired; curing between each application. When applying, I use a small flat brush and place a dot of gel into the center of my nail. Using a gentle swirling motion I cover the entire nail. You want to minimize the times you lift the brush from the product so as not to incorporate air bubbles. Once the nail is covered with the sculpting gel, turn your hand over keeping it level for 1 minute. This helps the applied gel to self level in a nicely rounded and natural shape. Cure as directed between each application. See requirements for the cure time needed  Requirements: Gelish structure must be cured with an LED lamp or UV lamp system. LED cure time 30 seconds. 36W UV Lamp - 2 minutes  Note: For me this is a must have product. I use it on the natural nail plate up to my false nail tip on the first and second application. This helps to equal out the level differences between the two. On the third application I cover the entire nail including the false tip. Polish as desired followed by the Gelish Top If Off as the final step .  **.  **Apply with a nail art brush.  **I first applied the foundation coat, then dry brushed it, then applied the Structure Gel. I dry brushed that layer as well and finished applying layers as directed. The end result is fantastic.  **The next time, I bought some pure acetone nail polish remover and it cleaned the brush like a dream  **Debra Lynn Professional French Manicure Clean-Up Brush (Misc.)  **Notice this is called a clean up brush. That is what it does. It will even up your French manicure very easily. Don&#x27;t know how anyone can do a French manicure without one. I wanted to try the French tip look with the CND Shellac process I do at home and purchased this brush for that specific purpose. This brush made even this amateur try look professional. This brush is well made and an easy weight in the hand. No bristles were loose nor have any fallen out. Would recommend highly recommend.    BEAUTY~NAILS~GEL-JULY 2012  **VIDEO:  [...]</li>
            <li> If you use the shellac you have to have the base gel. It helps protect your nails and helps the polish last longer. Great deal for a great price.</li>
            <li> This bottle is HUGE. It&#x27;s not the small one that comes in the kit from Sally&#x27;s and it&#x27;s half the price!</li>
            <li> Got to love Gelish, great product and a must for your Gel manicure/pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using Ph Bond especially if you are doing your natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK to save on Aceton (Sally&#x27;s $4) and Alcohol (Drugstore $2) but make sure to get good BASE and TOP Coat like Gelish.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is full size bottle compare to MINI (half size) for the same price at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product on Amazon and had to get the supplies and give it a try. I bought the Gelish Foundation, Gelish Nail Color in Passion, and Shellac Top Coat (a lot of reviews online say this top coat is easier to remove than the Gelish topcoat), and some 91% rubbing alcohol. I also bought a 9 watt lamp instead of initially shelling out over $100 for the 36w and above. I am so impressed with this product and my whole purchase. Not only do I have an amazing gel manicure that will last 14 days, but I don&#x27;t have to shell out the money anymore for one. I highly recommend getting these products if you are pretty decent at doing nails. I clip my cuticles, file the nail, buff away the calluses on my feet, and then start the Gelish process. The only difference is that since I have the 9w lamp so I do 10 minutes instead of the 2 they suggest. It turns out perfect. I just bought 2 more colors. Pink Smoothie and Red Roses.</li>
            <li> The foundation works better than the top coat.  BUT I have a disclaimer here....I ONLY bought the foundation and top coat.  It may very well last longer than 3 days if you buy the other products that work with it.  I am going to try the product that preps the nail, etc.  So I am not giving up on the product.  As far as the transaction with the seller, A-1 service!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product and it is comparable to what is used in the salons.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Lasts for a ridiculously long time and stays shiny and chip free. The only downside is that you have to soak it off with acetone and cure it with uv light, neither of which are healthy practices!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done 2 pedicures using the Gelish foundation base gel (along with the Gelish color and top coat).  The pedicures have been extremely long lasting, without any peeling or chipping.  Gelish is awesome!  Just remember to keep the base layer very very thin.  The base gel has a very short brush, which also helps with keeping the base layer thin.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Gelish Foundation, Top Coat, and color polishes to start doing my own gel nails at home. I could not be more happy! To save money, I did not purchase the pH bond or the finishing cleanser. Before the Foundation, make sure your nails are clean and DRY. Then, apply a VERY THIN coat of Foundation. After curing the Top Coat, make sure to finish your nails off with 70-99% alcohol or they will be tacky. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  Gelish basecoat is awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s defenetly the product except im not so shure if was brand new.. Butt works great better price then at sallys</li>
            <li> Received my items quick and easy. I love gelish products, they last long (2wks)and look great (various colors to choose from!. Can&#x27;t use the nail polish with out the foundation coat. Bought two large bottles, one for me and the other for my mom!</li>
            <li> As expected- zero complaints- will order again</li>
            <li> My favorite gel polish brand.</li>
            <li> This definitely works to make my gel manicures last a long time - but I have been having tons of problems getting the base coat off! When I was ready to remove the polish, I soaked my nails as instructed and the top coat + color slid right off pretty easily.  However, the base coat was stuck like glue, even after repeated soakings in the Gelish remover. I tried using a nail stick to scratch it off, but I think I scratched my nails in some spots, and missed the gel in others. My nails look absolutely terrible now. I think I might try OPI&#x27;s base for my next manicure, hopefully that will come off a little better.</li>
            <li> I bought the gel system to do at home. I bought all of the items on-line including the top/base gels and the colors and the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This base is great! It is so easy to use. I priced buying everything in the store and let me save you some time - do not buy these from Sally&#x27;s. They are the mini&#x27;s and so over priced. This is the full size bottle and is a great price and a great product! I am so excited to try all of my colors but since the polish lasts so long I have to wait! :)</li>
            <li> I had previously given this product a very poor review.  I am not a nail tech, but rather a nail enthusiast. I have done my own gel manicures at home for quite a few years, and had said in my prior review that this product was impossible to remove.  It must have been a bottle either from a bad batch, or was old or damaged in some way.  Since that time, I have purchased the Gelish Foundation at least two more times, and have had no problems whatsoever with either adhesion or removal.  I currently do my nails with mostly Gelish products about twice a month.  I would like to say thanks to all who have commented, and I apologize for my prior review, which may have been misleading about a product that is in fact quite good.  Have a super sparkly day, my fellow polish addicts! :-D</li>
            <li> My aunt is a nail tech and sent me some Gelish colors and the top coat as a bridal shower gift. I had been using the Sally Hansen Gel Nail system. At one point I tried using just the Sally hansen base coat and the Gelish color and top coat. The Sally Hansen stuff is just WAY too thick, and by comparison, doesn&#x27;t stay on your nails as well. I finally bit the bullet and bought this stuff. I did my nails last Thursday (today is the following Wednesday) and my mani still looks PERFECT. No chips, not too thick, nice and shiney.... I am OFFICIALLY a Gelish girl!!!! Which is great because they have a ton of AWESOME colors, come out with a new line every season, while Sally Hansen is just stuck to the basics. Their most daring color is black. No greens, blues, oranges. They only do pinks, reds, and one or two purples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so in love with Gelish now!!! it feels like there is nothing on my nails &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd step in a 4 step process to perfect manicures. Must have if you are going gelish.</li>
            <li> Came in great time and works amazingly!</li>
            <li> Maybe I was shipped a bad bottle but this is a bottle of gooey mess.  It is so thick it comes out in globs and I have to wipe the globs off the brush. What a waste.  I absolutely LOVE the other Gelish products I received. (top coat and little princess color)</li>
            <li> I bought this product, along with the topcoat polish to do my own gel nails and save some money. Make sure you buy a UV nail dryer if you are going to use this, gel polish does not set without UV or LED light curing. Also, make sure the dryer specifies that it will work with hybrid gel polish such as Gelish, not all gel polishes are the same. Once you figure all that out, this is a great product to use and you will really save some money going to the nail salon to get it done.</li>
            <li> Large bottles (bigger than CND) and good prices. The foundation brush is short and full, so it allows good application of the base gel. I&#x27;ve never seen a brush like this but love it as it allows you to get just enough product. Not too much. Really nice addition.</li>
            <li> Harmony Gelish FOUNDATION / Base Gel&lt;br /&gt;by Gelish&lt;br /&gt;good quality, easy to use, dry fast within expected time, can use with any uv light.</li>
            <li> Great product, I do my nails all the time at home, and use gelish harmony.  This last a long time.</li>
            <li> Helps polish stay on much longer and works great. Should always use a base gel when using gel polishes!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I was very careful in applying the product. I followed the directions precisely and I still developed an allergy to the product. It took 5 month before the painful blisters showed up under my fingernails.  I tried giving my nails 2months off but the blisters came back faster that before. But before the blister I LOVED this stuff I can not say enough good about it. I am posting this review so that people know that even if you follow the directions and fully cure the product you can develop an allergy (though it appears to be rare); it did not even occur to me that this could happen!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. The shipping was fast. I am excited to use my gel nail polish and save money at the same time.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers. I have used the CND Shellac and love it. Like the Gelish color and top coat but the foundation is a gloppy mess that made my nails look lumpy. Too bad. I guess I will have to go back to Shellac . . .</li>
            <li> I got my first gel nail manicure this year and was so impressed that I decided to figure it out DIY. I watched a few YouTube videos, (gotta love YouTube), and found out the only things I needed were the base, the topcoat, and the lamp! I don&#x27;t have oily nails so the pH prep stuff wasn&#x27;t necessary for me. I just wipe a strong alcohol (90%) on and that&#x27;s sufficient. You really have to make sure to *lightly* buff the nail with an emery block first to give it some traction for the base coat. Then, apply it super, super *thin*. The blunted brush helps out a lot with that. I use whatever color I like from my polish stash and then apply the top coat. A good wattage lamp is imperative to set, (I bought a 36-watt for a good price here too), and as long as you cure well between coats, you&#x27;re all set!</li>
            <li> This is a really GREAT foundation and long lasting if done right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMOVAL: Pour 100% Acetone (approx 1/4 cup) in small glass bowl (approx 6 diameters wide), Soak yours nails 5-7 mins making sure \\&quot;Entire\\&quot; nail of each finger is completely submerge under acetone (if not, pour a little more acetone in your bowl to completely cover all nails). After 7 mins (maybe a little longer if you originally applied the foundation too thick), remove hand from the bowl, if you still see a little foundation on your nail, just take your thumb nail (or any finger) from OPPOSITE hand and slightly scrape off using a pushing motion (from top to bottom toward nail bed of nail being scrape).... AND FOUNDATION WILL BE GONE IN LITTLE TO NO TIME!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It is definitely necessary to put on before you put your color on. One thing though is dont get it too thick!</li>
            <li> This is sort of a necessary evil when using Gelish colors. Other brands are worse though. You have to use a Gelish base coat but it tends to be goopy making it hard to get a thin layer. BUT, it can be done. On the other hand, the top coat tends to be a little runny causing run-over into the creases. Try to get a thin good coverage on Base gel and then top colors with a very thin (staying just off the edges) top coat because by the time you get to the light, the top coat will try to spread. The colors act just like normal polishes. It&#x27;s the base and top coats that are tricky.</li>
            <li> This is very nice product if you know how to use it, it will work love it I want to buy more but they are expensive.</li>
            <li> Amazing product amazing price</li>
            <li> All the greatness of a salon manicure at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Because I use my hands a lot...swimming, painting, gardening...my polish was lucky to survive a day without chips. I&#x27;ve never been one to wear nail polish often because it wasnt worth the effort. I hate making appts for salons and don&#x27;t like the cost so I decided to try gel polish almost 3 months ago. The polish lasts about a week now which is a huge improvement for me so I am very happy. I&#x27;ve never had to use the removal system because I can simply \\&quot;peel\\&quot; them off similar to pulling scotch-tape off of your nails so I won&#x27;t need to purchase the removal liquid. Also, the PH base is rubbing alcohol so I won&#x27;t buy that in the future either. All you really need is the foundation, polish, and top-it-off in my opinion. I bought an inexpensive 9v UV battery-operated portable lamp but plan to upgrade to an LED because I don&#x27;t like the drying time. It takes about 45min to complete my manicure with the cheap UV lamp. There is a $50 LED lamp that I am going to try.</li>
            <li> Gelish makes a great product.</li>
            <li> works great , loved the product same as beauty shop used true to color worked well with my pink smoothie color then top coat applied</li>
            <li> If you use gelish polish this is a must have. I love it and the smaller brush makes it so easy to apply. You can tell you get every spot of the nail covered with this. I have nothing negative to say about this product :)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these items.  I t is saving me bunches of money/  I even do my families and friends nails for a small fee.</li>
            <li> It has a shorter brush which I love.  I wish the Top it Off did too.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Larger than expected! Very happy with my purchase. Can buy the same item, smaller for the same price at my local beauty supply store</li>
            <li> It arrived in time and I love it except if you used to much it will run over  make sure you used a thin layer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my current bottle for nearly 2 years and have not gone without gelling my nails for more than 2 weeks in that time. This is a major bargain.</li>
            <li> left such a thick coat it just peeled off.</li>
            <li> Adheres best to natural nail plate. More difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Love it!! But lately it has been peeling easily :(  I purchased my foundation 8 mo. ago....does it go bad??? Just wondering if I should purchase a new bottle.  don&#x27;t really want to since this one is still half full.</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply in a thin layer, and as this gel is extremely thick it is near impossible to do, but it is necessary in order to ensure a proper manicure.  I say if the nail appears a bit shiny and doesn&#x27;t look like anything is on it, then you have just enough to proceed.  Seriously, do not just plop this on your nail as you would a regular base coat.  If you do, the polish doesn&#x27;t bond to your nail and you&#x27;ll have to start all over.</li>
            <li> I use gelish foundation for all my soak off gel polish services. When used by a professional you get professional results and longest wear. Gelish has small tricks to application so you do not get chipping or peeling during your 2 week wear time. I have read on other places that consumers are having some trouble with the wear or soak off of gelish foundation and that is because it is a professional grade product requiring you to be trained in proper nail care and application or the product.</li>
            <li> I like the short bristles of the brush..it makes the application easier..the shipping was also quick -3 days- today is the first time i tried gelish at home...and it&#x27;s more simple than what you see online..would recommend this to anyone who likes doing their own nails..i will update in 2-3 weeks if it actually last that long..</li>
            <li> I would easily give this 5 stars, but it really dries out the nail beds. Other than that, it makes gel polish hold up for up to 5 weeks...seriously.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and came unharmed/no leaking. Can&#x27;t wait to try this base out, as it came highly recommended as one of the best.</li>
            <li> I love gel nail polish! I bought this in combination with some other gelish products, so that I didn&#x27;t have to keep paying $30ish everytime I wanted my nails to look great for 3 or so weeks at a time. Also, this seller was very quick with shipping. I was on a bit of a time crunch to get this, but I went with the regular shipping anyway - and I still got it in time! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use the foundation when applying Kiss Nail strips.  It gives a good french manicure but I cannot get it to work for a solid nail polish color.  Every time I apply this foundation, it makes the nail polish coat all wavy.</li>
            <li> Made my sensational gel polish last for over a month. Soaked off but took a while.  If u want to change ur polish also this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Best foundation gel ever.. I&#x27;ve tried opi and gelish completely blows it out of the water. You won&#x27;t regret this one!</li>
