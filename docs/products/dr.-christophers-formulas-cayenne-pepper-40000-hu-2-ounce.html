            <li>Putting it on food to create bite alters the taste of the food significantly and not in a good way, and doesn&#x27;t even give bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Either way she likes it and asked me to order more, she said it also is helpful in keeping her warmer in the winter.</li>

            <li>Even goes OK in water in emergency situations.</li>
            <li>Great very spicy though.</li>
            <li>as long as you know what your getting its a good product and good for circulation.</li>
            <li>I found it to be good for high blood pressure, arthritis/joint pain and even itchy scalp!</li>
            <li>It has a strong alcohol smell which dissipates after it&#x27;s diluted in water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times when I was feeling tightness or pain in my chest, and a full dropperful under the tongue (have some bread to chew on afterward to ease the burn)...</li>
            <li>For the absolute best I would have to give 5 stars to Dr. Richard Schulze&#x27;s liquid cayenne but be prepared to pay double the price.</li>
            <li>Cayenne is amazing for the blood and particularly the heart.</li>
            <li>Good to have on hand for emergencies too, especially to help staunch bleeding.</li>
            <li>High quality, easy to use and pretty fast shipping :)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it, at 67, 0% plaque in arteries.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>it still says this right now</li>
            <li>It came right on time</li>
            <li>This is just the right volume to use in my arnica ointment I make for muscle relief.  </li>
            <li>eases it right up within minutes.</li>
            <li>It is very strong, so I only do what is directed.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as my previous bottle of Cayenne Extract</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that hot.</li>
            <li>but that is way too hot</li>
            <li>I have used Dr. Christopher&#x27;s cayenne extract for years but recently discovered its many uses and benefits.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is an acquired taste, but you&#x27;ll love it after a while, especially in your morning coffee or juice.  </li>
            <li>Makes them feel better, now lets see how it works long term.</li>
            <li>its just cayenne extract in 50% pure grain alcohol and distilled water.</li>
            <li>As described fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It was just as advertised and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This combination really cleans out my arteries.</li>
            <li>Potent effect, not too hot but delightfully long lasting warming sensation.</li>
            <li>The cayenne content in the liquid is so small as to be able to take a single cayenne pill and get more out of it.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I expected but does the job</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can find any hot sauce for the same price or less than the cost of this bottle that provides more cayenne per drop than the contents of this.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to add heat or bite to food in a way that regular hot sauce didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I used it on my scalp three times so far to stimulate growth.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>If used regularly in your various drinks, it will clear out the gook!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This does tingle I used it on my scalp three times so far to stimulate growth.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that hot. I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> Love it. High quality, easy to use and pretty fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> Good product.  Friends mentioned this is great if you start to get a sore throat, sinus infection or feeling ill.  A couple drops on back of throat twice a day for up to 3 knocks it out before whatever takes hold.  Has helped husband too.</li>
            <li> it is not an ointment. when i bought this the product description said:  Cayenne Ointment contains: Olive Oil, Cayenne, Oil of Wintergreen, pure distilled Mint Crystals and other herb oils, in a beeswax base. A synergistic blend of herbs, pure essential oils and other natural ingredients for stiff necks, sore muscles and joints.  it still says this right now but hopefully they change that. its just cayenne extract in 50% pure grain alcohol and distilled water. they say to take a dropperful but that is way too hot and i&#x27;m used to spicy food. but thats why i like it. as long as you know what your getting its a good product and good for circulation.</li>
            <li> As described fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased Dr&#x27; Christopher&#x27;s Cayenne extract for my mom because she has poor circulation problems caused by dvt. It came right on time but she noted it was not the 90,000 units of cayenne as I thought I had ordered. Either way she likes it and asked me to order more, she said it also is helpful in keeping her warmer in the winter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and value!!</li>
            <li> This is just the right volume to use in my arnica ointment I make for muscle relief.  It gives the warmth to sooth the muscle pain.</li>
            <li> I think cayenne extract great kick-starter to get nutrients from supplement in my system fast.  On a cold day I could use cayenne extract in food or drink for a quick body-warmer.  I have used Dr. Christopher&#x27;s cayenne extract for years but recently discovered its many uses and benefits.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my previous bottle of Cayenne Extract but I can&#x27;t remember the brand name of my last bottle.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Use this in m water pick and take for cardiac overt.  Works amazing for boy. Product ad described.</li>
            <li> I ordered four bottles of this product.  I found it to be good for high blood pressure, arthritis/joint pain and even itchy scalp!</li>
            <li> delivered as promised</li>
            <li> I love using this cayenne tincture. If I feel like I might be getting a cold, I put some in my tea to help boost circulation and stimulate my immunity. It&#x27;s great for staying warm too! Good to have on hand for emergencies too, especially to help staunch bleeding. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it, and this is a great place to get it! Super fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Since I have purchased this I have used almost daily. I like it a lot. It has a strong alcohol smell which dissipates after it&#x27;s diluted in water. I will be order more soon.</li>
            <li> The product works well.</li>
            <li> Cayenne is amazing for the blood and particularly the heart. I&#x27;ve heard it can even stop heart attacks...so I always keep some on hand. I&#x27;ve used it many times when I was feeling tightness or pain in my chest, and a full dropperful under the tongue (have some bread to chew on afterward to ease the burn)...eases it right up within minutes. Really wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> I admittedly did not buy this in an effort to occasionally drip cayenne on something to add flavor, I actually wanted it for effect. I wanted it to add heat or bite to food in a way that regular hot sauce didn&#x27;t. This product does not do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, with the quality of the product in mind, this product appears to have no purpose. I can find any hot sauce for the same price or less than the cost of this bottle that provides more cayenne per drop than the contents of this. The alcohol does not stop the cayenne from being hot, the alcohol mixes with the cayenne oils and makes direct ingestion of this disgusting. The cayenne content in the liquid is so small as to be able to take a single cayenne pill and get more out of it. Putting it on food to create bite alters the taste of the food significantly and not in a good way, and doesn&#x27;t even give bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking into account all aspects of this product, I don&#x27;t understand what it is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> If used regularly in your various drinks, it will clear out the gook! and plaque in your body.  Helps so many things in the body systems, circulation, sugar metabolism. . . Yes, it is an acquired taste, but you&#x27;ll love it after a while, especially in your morning coffee or juice.  Even goes OK in water in emergency situations. Definitely worth it, at 67, 0% plaque in arteries. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> ITS NOT SPICY AT ALL. TERRIBLE</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted.  It was just as advertised and reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For price &amp; quality Christopher&#x27;s cayenne can&#x27;t be beat. For the absolute best I would have to give 5 stars to Dr. Richard Schulze&#x27;s liquid cayenne but be prepared to pay double the price. It is what it is. You pay for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.V.</li>
            <li> Product is not too hot and not too weak. I always mix it with a Hawthorn berry tincture. This combination really cleans out my arteries.</li>
            <li> I thought this was great, i couldnt put powder cayenne in my drink but this worked out great. I would reccomend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great very spicy though.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this daily, we have ordered this before and will order again.</li>
            <li> Potent effect, not too hot but delightfully long lasting warming sensation. I use it daily, helps with my chronic sinusitis.</li>
            <li> Now that I found out the great wonders of what Cayenne Extract can do, I have been using it every morning.  I take two drops to help lower my blood pressure, and I give it to my husband to help with his congestion.  It is very strong, so I only do what is directed.  Cayenne is great for a lot of things, and I have seen reviews where it has helped people who had a heart attack by adding a tsp. of extract in their mouth.  I pray this never happens in my family, but I will keep it on stock as long as they sell the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I was looking for.  Good quality!</li>
            <li> combined with goldenseal and myrrh for gum disease. Makes them feel better, now lets see how it works long term.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I expected but does the job</li>
            <li> Good product will buy again.</li>
