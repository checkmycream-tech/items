            <li>This is a wonderful product I am enjoying it</li>
            <li>This unit would be perfect but for the fact that if it stays on the highest heat setting for more than 15-20 minutes, it shuts off.  </li>
            <li>However, I have not been successful with roller sets.  </li>
            <li>perfect for me, i love it</li>

            <li>I thought this dryer would be perfect; compact, not clunky, and easy to travel with.</li>

            <li>it was a good decision.</li>
            <li>so good</li>
            <li>Good luck to anyone else who buys it.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but good review of this product.</li>
            <li>Perfect for home, dorm or travel (will easily fit into a suitcase).</li>
            <li>It looks good but there are alot of flaws in the design.</li>
            <li>Loved this.  </li>
            <li>Delivered in good quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always torn when I feel like a product is a good deal for its price, but is still lacking.</li>
            <li>A longer hose would have been good.</li>
            <li>This Hair Dryer works good taks</li>
            <li>Its not as good as the ones in the hair salons</li>
            <li>Works great and it is nice and compact.</li>
            <li>if you move it falls out, although the dryer itself is good.</li>
            <li>but it works really good</li>
            <li>It has done a good job for me.</li>
            <li>I found a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Good while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>Invest in a nicer dryer if you want your hair to look right!!!!  </li>
            <li>The item came quickly and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I was happy I was able to find someone that still sells this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it and love using it.</li>
            <li>Good, Handy.</li>
            <li>It has surely put some smiles on my face!</li>
            <li>I love this compact hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!  </li>
            <li>Love the portability when traveling!</li>
            <li>Just love it , freedom from the hooded dryer !</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and they are mostly very good products.</li>
            <li>A great lightweight product, easily stored on a shelf.  </li>
            <li>It worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>Had great hopes that this dryer would fit the bill for my kids.  </li>
            <li>It works amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I wanted it to travel with me - my own problem - it was meant to be stable</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thrilled I got this.</li>
            <li>It just kind of sagged on my head...</li>
            <li>It never shut off, in fact it was a bit warm.</li>
            <li>I put the hose away while it&#x27;s still warm</li>
            <li>It is a nice unit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting this kind of hairdryer for months and Conair and Amazon came through for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can order good products like this through an online website since I no longer have a car.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it has a brush attachment as well, like that a lot.</li>
            <li>She liked the settings for heat control.  </li>
            <li>This unit was exactly what we wanted with a very good price.  </li>
            <li>When I had the bonnet on, dare I move an inch and that hose would fly right off!</li>
            <li>This would be a great product if the bonnet attached to the hose more securely.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well, although the bonnet hose twists too easily.</li>
            <li>It is a good compact devise that is easy to travel with, you can put it under your seat or just hold it in your lap.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very easy to store.</li>
            <li>appliance is great, however, customer should be able to purchase a bonnet to replace original bonnet when damaged.  </li>
            <li>It worked beautifully for this the first two times I used it</li>
            <li>really nice product my wife love it</li>
            <li>Mom is 90 years old and this unit is perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li>What I loved most was how compact and easy it was to use.  </li>
            <li>light weight, easy to manage does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I needed a bonnet dryer to set my daughter&#x27;s hair for graduation this worked wonderfully, the gently heat did not disturb the curls and was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>so I could give my hair hot oil treatments and it has been great.</li>
            <li>Unit VERY cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li>It works well and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use; drys and curls her hair nicely.</li>
            <li>and she loves it :)</li>
            <li>I wanted more mobility - like multitacking</li>
            <li>i was expecting more from it</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>After the tear, the air would not flow to the top of the bonnet.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>For the price and for the convenience, love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok feels like a toy and the bonnet won&#x27;t stay connected to dryer</li>
            <li>Still not 100% sure</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It will overheat if you do not make sure the air vent is not blocked by anything.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>then that love it</li>
            <li>I had to wait more than 5 minutes before I could start it again and still ended up sleeping with damp hair.  </li>
            <li>This has happened too many times.  </li>
            <li>I think I could generate more drying power if I could find someone to blow through a straw.</li>
            <li>I love my hairdryer thank you</li>
            <li>I love being able to move around.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to get replacement bonnets.</li>
            <li>Have used the product before and am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of not sitting in one spot.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m nor 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love its compact size.</li>
            <li>this is a cheap product--make the investment!</li>
            <li>I can set my hair and fall asleep while drying with this hair dryer, It&#x27;s everything I was looking for and more.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is great and compare to the price I have seen for the same make and model it is good.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love this Hair dryer and been using for 3 month and had no problem with it.</li>
            <li>I have used this model for many years.</li>
            <li>I have not yet used the product although i love the size of it</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If she holds her head perfectly still, we can get through the drying but that just isn&#x27;t possible for someone who has to change positions once in a while.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer</li>
            <li>Love the hair dryer because I can sleep with it.</li>
            <li>I will try once more for a roller set.</li>
            <li>I  love this dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight plastic and noisy, but they all seem to be more noisy.</li>
            <li>THIS DRYER IS OK.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; bonnet hair dryers around anymore.</li>
            <li>My fault for waiting more than a year to check.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to be sure that you snap the bonnet seal to the tube so that it locks before putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I Love it</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this dryer is not even as powerful as my handheld blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love it, just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find one of these type hair dryers again.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is okay.</li>
            <li>Good cost, I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li>it is an okay blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product by conair.</li>
            <li>Also, not noisy and comfortable while using !</li>
            <li>It fits well and the settings are for the most part, O.K.</li>
            <li>mom will love this one.</li>
            <li>They sure don&#x27;t make em like they used to</li>
            <li>This dryer does make quite a bit of noise, but not a lot more than a hand held dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I had to buy a stepdown transformer wich made it more expansive.</li>
            <li>I like most Conair products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay,</li>
            <li>Its ok and would tell friends about it.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to have a salon quality style from home.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend discovering if another product has a better quality hose before purchasing.</li>
            <li>love it love the arrival time as well.</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair!!!</li>
            <li>I love this as it never gets too hot and of course it&#x27;s fairly portable.  </li>
            <li>Great, would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and easy to maneuver to multitask.</li>
            <li>Heat is good and dries good but just too short on hose.</li>
            <li>I love to wash my hair and to be able to pop the couch and just relax instead of holding the dryer up great product next time</li>
            <li>This Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is a great product and purchasing</li>
            <li>Others in my retirement center building were also impressed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable</li>
            <li>I enjoy being able to sit on my bed, use my smartphone while my hair is drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the value; but bonnet pulls with the weight of the hose and drying time is not as fast as with an upright dryer.</li>
            <li>loved it so much, bought another one</li>
            <li>everything i expected ...works great superior hair dryer for the price,the bonnet inflates properly and has great drying speeds</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Snapping the hose to the bonnet isn&#x27;t as easy as it should be&lt;</li>
            <li>This is a must buy and plus its easy for travel.</li>
            <li>Heat distributes throughout cap and it&#x27;s easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to use</li>
            <li>It was so easy to put together and take apart.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to store and travel with.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>EASY TO CARRY ON VACATION OR</li>
            <li>medium to low heat is the best and anything that can honestly dry my hair without damage is a great thing.  </li>
            <li>Easy to store or  take on a trip.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to hold with hand and easy to carry around the country and abroad</li>
            <li>It packs up easily and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It stores easily and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like the price, the compactness of it --  and it is easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer will work better and you will have a full head of curley hair.</li>
            <li>One of the settings is much to hot for the warm setting.</li>
            <li>Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works fine, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do,</li>
            <li>Perfect for get sets and tight curls.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the cool setting perfect for women transitioning to natural hair or that are already natural.</li>
            <li>Perfect little dyer.........</li>
            <li>This little hair dryer works a treat to bring out the best curl.  </li>
            <li>Nice,  very portable, compact, light weight hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise she told me she liked this one better than her old one.</li>
            <li>it removes the restrictions from your neck, you can sit our slouch comfortably while drying your hair.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is light weigh and stores all accessories inside the case.</li>
            <li>And it dried my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Dryer works as intended and is more useful than a salon style dryer in that it&#x27;s portable.  </li>
            <li>I can now move freely and don&#x27;t have to keep still thinking the hose will fall out, cause it won&#x27;t....</li>
            <li>processed hair benefits GREATLY from salon deep conditioning</li>
            <li>Its great, I can sit in any room of my house and still use as a sit under dryer or use as just a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>The dryer does actually work, it has a inside setting to automatically shut itself off to prevent overheating, worked great from me without shutting off</li>
            <li>This product was cheaply made and without any thought put into it.</li>
            <li>Great product I read reviews so kept my unit on low!</li>
            <li>It may permanently attach the tow so you can no longer use the brush or detach them, but it will keep the two secure.  </li>
            <li>has about 1/8&amp;#34; of sliding area after &amp;#34;nodules&amp;#34; on hose fit into hose, but no way to lock it &amp; no way to make it stay.</li>
            <li>cheap and misleading.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t fit over my rollers.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made and the motor burned up in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I had an old one that I loved</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved soft bonnet Hair dryers, the flexibility and convenience is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I love it come right on time for my hair</li>
            <li>This is very handy for deep hair conditioning.</li>
            <li>The bonnet finally tore but I have had 8 yrs of good use and the dryer unit is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased when I first received this dryer.  </li>
            <li>it was hard to find a nice great working portable hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is great I can dry my hair while I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li>Best of all, It&#x27;s so compact that I don&#x27;t even notice it when stored in the back of the closet, unlike the old hooded style.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is nice and large and the air flow is just right for my hair.  </li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t too many of the soft bonnet hairdryers available, so this is the one that I&#x27;ve had the most success with.</li>
            <li>It works great and is not very noisy.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it available!</li>
            <li>I use it at least three times a week and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I even attempted to use it on cool and not even that worked.</li>
            <li>However, I cannot style my hair without this machine any more because this one works very well and save time.</li>
            <li>they are all true.  </li>
            <li>much any more so this works for her hair needs.</li>
            <li>The brush attachment serves no purpose though, but it did feel good on my scalp when used as a regular brush.</li>
            <li>Good hair dryer for use with the big curlers.</li>
            <li>but I got it figured it out good enough for me.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to travel with, and it seems pretty well made.  </li>
            <li>the \\&quot;high\\&quot; choice of hot air does not give off extremely hot air as many dryers do, and this is a plus for me.</li>
            <li>No, you&#x27;re not going to be one of the lucky ones...</li>
            <li>and it dries her hair quickly on the medium setting.  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>and I had to hold it up so that the air can circulate, plus it didn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>The medium setting tended to be very hot.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t allow for much mobility, but it&#x27;s way more effective at actually drying.</li>
            <li>Love that the hair dryer and attachments all fit in a small case - light and easy to store !  </li>
            <li>This dryer has the perfect temperature settings and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this dryer, I can easily move when my hair is drying.  </li>
            <li>My kids have long hair, no longer torture drying their hair, now they shower more often, be sure to supervise them using this, a must.</li>
            <li>Her mother was thrilled to have one exactly like her old one.</li>
            <li>and it would take me up to 2 hours or more sitting in one position while being very conscious to not slouch.</li>
            <li>I almost bought the hood attachment (different brand), but opted for this one instead as it is the better value... blow dryer, hood and brush attachment in one box!</li>
            <li>The warm air seems to circulate better in this bonnet than the previous dryer&#x27;s bonnet.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer a slightly larger case that would accomodate everything more easily.</li>
            <li>The temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it on high for more than 10 minutes because it gets so hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super light weight and doesn&#x27;t take up much room&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I thought it worked great the few times I used it</li>
            <li>one of the few stuff i have bought online with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily as a heat source for conditioning my hair and it works very well.</li>
            <li>nothing more because I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li>If it had a longer hose and if the storage compartment had instructions on how to place it back inside it would be spectacular.  </li>
            <li>The benefits though were worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Nots as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li>it gets warm enough for conditioning treatments, but not for setting/drying a style in place.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the only thing this dryer is good for, to travel with.</li>
            <li>yes,very useful for the family.</li>
            <li>Well worth my money.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been trying vintage hair styles and a bonnet hair dryer was required for many of those old styles.</li>
            <li>nice unit but not enough room to store everything in side compartment.  </li>
            <li>This is worth the money you pay for it.</li>
            <li>gets super hot if you need it, also allows home hair coloring that requires heat.  </li>
            <li>Bonnet works fine as long as you are satisfied with the low/moderate heat.</li>
            <li>I have tendonitis in my right hand</li>
            <li>This was the right price.</li>
            <li>this software bonnet puts the heat in all the right areas of your head.</li>
            <li>Dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot, only gets warm.</li>
            <li>Easy to use dry your hair fast easy to carried is light weight.  </li>
            <li>Too small for rollers, but great for conditioning, gloss, semi-permanent color, etc.  </li>
            <li>Hold nice volume all day long.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer hoping I could just sit in front of my computer, TV, or book and just let it dry my hair on its own.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure your hair is damp not real wet before putting it in rollers.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise I found that the Conair SB1X Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer was still being made, and available from Amazon !  </li>
            <li>this dryer is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t put out very hot air</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, it will be fine!</li>
            <li>It works very very</li>
            <li>My wife likes it very much.</li>
            <li>Conair could do better - my last two Conair dryers have not lasted.  </li>
            <li>gets HOT</li>
            <li>Used it yesterday for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be smaller and more compact.  </li>
            <li>I was better of with a simple blow dryer.</li>
            <li>This product does not blow (hot air)</li>
            <li>Never again will I attempt to purchase another conair product without reading the reviews first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that I will enjoy my Soft Bonnet Hair Bonnet Dryer for years to come.  </li>
            <li>it gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>At first I was with everyone else on the thing not staying in place and repeatedly falling out.</li>
            <li>It is very efficient, and, packable!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get so hot it burns your ears or scalp.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCTS FIRST...</li>
            <li>FIRST TIME</li>
            <li>I purchased it during the Christmas holiday, and was only able to use it 3 times before it started having problems.  </li>
            <li>The first just wore out.  </li>
            <li>The dryer cuts off as soon as it starts to get hot.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw this dryer I thought it was a toy.  </li>
            <li>product is pretty lightweight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the last one she has that got too hot.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li>My hair dryer came exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>I think it got too hot.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li>This one works so fast!  </li>
            <li>Consider spending more if planning regular use.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and is quite powerful for such a compact size.</li>
            <li>I have had Conair soft bonnet hair dryers in the past with great success.</li>
            <li>Nice light and portable, beats using a hard bonnet .</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s only good if you are deep conditioning your hair.</li>
            <li>If your a natural, you definitely should own this product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its great for deep conditioning and hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I thought buying this product would be a good idea because it was small compact</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>It is a good product if you&#x27;re using small or medium rollers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to using the cap that you attach to a hand held hair dryer, it&#x27;s much larger and the cap is able to fit a large set of rollers underneath of it.</li>
            <li>Needs to tone that warm setting down.</li>
            <li>I love that it is portable, and I can pretty much sit anywhere to dry my hair, which takes about an hour to do.</li>
            <li>The Conair SB1 Bonnet Hair Dryer allows me to be more flexible with where I can dry my hair.</li>
            <li>so it scrunches up easily and fits back in the unit.</li>
            <li>If you have hair of any length and expect this to dry your hair completly, you better have an hour.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well especially when you use rollers to curl your hair like I do.</li>
            <li>the only thing I dont like is the hose keeps falling off easily from the cap  </li>
            <li>YOU JUST HAVE TO TURN THE HOSE AROUND TO DRY THE TOP OF YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li>I admit that I love washing my hair because when I dry it, I just put my bonnet on, cover up in a blanket, and relax with the heat on my head.  </li>
            <li>The reason that I got the bonnet hair dryer was so that I can dry my hair and have a little more flexibility to do more things while I was drying my hair and also dry my hair more quickly than sitting under a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>to use&lt;br /&gt;Bonnet is large so will accommodate all size rollers</li>
            <li>and I use large rollers.</li>
            <li>But, to be fair, I have long thick hair, so it might work ok on somebody else.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that after you get the bonnet and tubing out of the case, you just can&#x27;t fit it back in easily.  </li>
            <li>The alternate brand worked fine.</li>
            <li>The bonnet connection to the hose doesn&#x27;t fit securely so it is a juggling act to get the too tight bonnet on without disconnecting from the hose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, she may be happier when our good old Wisconsin winter setles in and the house is a little cooler.</li>
            <li>The locking mechanism on the hose is not stable enough to hold the hose securely.</li>
            <li>that I just put the whole hair dryer in and be done with it.</li>
            <li>It work very well and never turn off.  </li>
            <li>The dryer does not look very sturdy (inferior plastic)</li>
            <li>The price seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li>I purchased this bonnet hair dryer at a fabulous price and overall, it meets my needs.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Conair hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This product works very well with me</li>
            <li>but I used it so much</li>
            <li>, then I set it, put on the bonnet, turn it on hi, put on make-up and the hairs ready.   </li>
            <li>Just what I needed for travel and days I need a fast set.</li>
            <li>Instead or purchasing a whole hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and I could put away with out taking to much room.  </li>
            <li>STILL SHUTS OFF...GETTING READY TO ORDER ANOTHER DRYER BY CONAIR, BUT IT DOES HAVE 4 1/2 STARS...</li>
            <li>This item is packed and ready to travel the world with my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient hair dryer</li>
            <li>Very convenient and portable.</li>
            <li>Need to be careful to make sure the tubing is not crunched up, but otherwise have had no problem with it.  </li>
            <li>H-O-T, (real)  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy too</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t worry to much about the shut off feature.</li>
            <li>does not turn on - very dissapointed</li>
            <li>Works well and is very portable.</li>
            <li>had a bonnet that would not have fit the head of a tiny baby....</li>
            <li>Bonnet is comfortable however the air hose is too short</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking.</li>
            <li>The wattage doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough to completely fill the bonnett and circulate hot air evenly.</li>
            <li>I was not too sure about this with all the other reviews, but I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>hair dryer is compact.you are able to do other task</li>
            <li>When the hot air was blowing into the bonnet it only blew up the bonnet within the first couple of inches from where it entered the bonnet, the hot air did not go into the rest of the bonnet.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have noticed her hair looking more full lately.  </li>
            <li>My sister and I got a big laugh out of it when she asked for it, but what Mom wants Mom gets!</li>
            <li>I expected to be able to actually use this bonnet dryer to &amp;#34;Set&amp;#34; my hair for quick styling.</li>
            <li>This one performs ok with the one exception that the bonnet is not as large as in previous products.</li>
            <li>but it is sufficient to dry your hair (just takes a little longer) and the price was great.</li>
            <li>will drying your hair.gets hot fast and able to dry  your hair in a short period of time</li>
            <li>only negative comment was that she wishes the unit had one more lower heat option; she gets pretty warm even at low heat.</li>
            <li>, I just hooked it up to use for the third time and it worked for about 15 seconds (I started on the cool setting) then shut off...</li>
            <li>The Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is exactly what I was looking.  </li>
            <li>I can truly say, this soft bonnet hair dyer makes my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li>I thought I had found the exact item I needed to fix my 87 year old mother-in-law&#x27;s hair at home since she can&#x27;t get out to go to the salon.  </li>
            <li>The hose may fall off sometimes depending on the way you lay down with it but other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li>Your new hairdo will be a blast!</li>
            <li>Other wise your hair really won&#x27;t dry or curl.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find instructions on how to open the darn thing, had to pry open the lid and wasn&#x27;t sure if I was just breaking it before I used it.  </li>
            <li>Second unit super and works well.  </li>
            <li>the air intake is in the back, which allows the unit to be ok when sitting on a bed or chair (not possible with bottom intake models).  </li>
            <li>it would be better if it twisted on like a jar top</li>
            <li>I wanted this particular Conair hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>We are using it for adding heat to conditioning treatments and vibrant hair color.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this small portable hair dryer for my roller sets, but I could not even put the cap on with large and medium sized rollers.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing another Hot Tools Dryer, a little more money but worth the price in the long run.</li>
            <li>It is good but a bit weak</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why i gave it the high mark</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried three times: twice on high and once on medium setting.  </li>
            <li>small and not very powerful but for deep conditioning, its perfect!!!</li>
            <li>The hair dryer works fine as expected.  </li>
            <li>though so this might just be the best of a bad bunch.</li>
            <li>The unit is much easier to store away than the old one.</li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T REALLY GET HOT ENOUGH FOR ETHNIC HAIR.</li>
            <li>My folks dried my hair like this when I was a kid (okay 35 years ago).    </li>
            <li>I love this product from the small size to how fast it dries my hair.  </li>
            <li>Better than wearing curlers for a few hours.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth the 10-20 extra dollars.</li>
            <li>Good idea, poor execution.  </li>
            <li>One should not use high heat for long periods of time for that will cause more hair damage then curling or flat irons do.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the other people got defective ones, but mine works just fine.</li>
            <li>The bonnet isn&#x27;t the easiest to get on and off for that, but it only takes about 25 minutes to dry most of the hair that is 3&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sending this back right away.  </li>
            <li>The dryer would turn off on everything but the low setting right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Not enough heat , take long time for long hair drying, have to buy  another one which is more powerful</li>
            <li>And it leaves my hands free to do other things.  </li>
            <li>, I had to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>The reason I saw the reviews is because I am already looking for a new dryer 4 months after purchasing this model.</li>
            <li>It was requested by one of our senior residents that live in the residential facility I work at.</li>
            <li>The different heat settings help, although the high gets too hot to lay down with, there is a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>also when using dryer the cap became very soft and felt like it was melting.</li>
            <li>I have started to use my old hair dryer although the bonnet is torn and the high setting no longer works.</li>
            <li>Had a very old bonnet hair dryer that is about shot.</li>
            <li>Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer&#x27;s are over heating when it is set on medium or high.</li>
            <li>I should have paid attention to the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is adequate in size but the drawstring on the bonnet is so short that you can&#x27;t expand the bonnet to a reasonable size to fit over curlers.  </li>
            <li>(yes, I&#x27;m old, I still use rollers!)</li>
            <li>This dryer quit mid drying--the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I run it for a half hour at a time and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Well every time I have used it and it&#x27;s not many, I put the hair dryer on medium heat and it will be okay for a couple of minutes, 5 minutes and automatically shut off.</li>
            <li>Second time buying this item because I wore the first one out.</li>
            <li>I have no problems with the hose falling out or it not getting hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it shuts off after only 5 minutes if not \\&quot;warmed up\\&quot; first on a lower setting.  </li>
            <li>will have to go shopping and find a dryer comparable to the Hot Tools unit that I have had for several yrs.  </li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t get hot enough after using it for an hour I had to get under my sit under dryer to finish drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I was excited to finally use this a year or so after purchase only to discover the bonnet wasn&#x27;t in the box</li>
            <li>I had my first one for years till it finally died......</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Low gets really hot</li>
            <li>and it still works the same way as when I first took it out of the box.</li>
            <li>and I use pretty big hair rollers.</li>
            <li>The only weakness of this product is the hot air has a hard time to flow to the top of my hair.</li>
            <li>Bonnet was very cheaply made and hard to connect.  </li>
            <li>I recently ordered 3 for the dryer that I already had, but the bonnets have been on &amp;#34;back order&amp;#34; for months, so I had to buy a whole new dryer.</li>
            <li>I occasionally had issues with it shutting off automatically like others have noted, but my primary issue was that it didn&#x27;t dry my hair well at all.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet is very cheap and became unusable after only a few times of use.</li>
            <li>i can set it and use this fantastic little dryer for her  </li>
            <li>the hard blowdryer glad i didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say though is that it&#x27;s kind of hard to squish all the stuff back inside the carrying case ...</li>
            <li>How could conair continue selling this garbage when it is clearly a defective item.</li>
            <li>I thought that I misread the instructions and dug them out to read again - instructions were clear on how to connect the hose so the unit was defective .  </li>
            <li>Not too loud.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to buy a big hair dryer.</li>
            <li>B0002G214U Conair SB1X Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer]]    </li>
            <li>No problems are noted so far.</li>
            <li>MY WIFE LOVES THE SOFT BONNET HAIR DRYER.</li>
            <li>So far...</li>
            <li>It does speed up the regular drying but not as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>The Conair Soft Bonnet just shut off without warning which woke me up.  </li>
            <li>I should have read some reviews first which would have helped my damp locks and saved me some money in the long run.</li>
            <li>Much too big for travel.  </li>
            <li>This is going straight back to the store.</li>
            <li>THe plus is the bonnet was soft...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional hairdresser</li>
            <li>but I do not have the time nor the money to buy a professional hooded salon dryer for use maybe 4-5 times a month.</li>
            <li>We ran our of finding old units at rummage sales etc.</li>
            <li>My 86 year old mom can&#x27;t get to the salon</li>
            <li>Loud and inconsistent, but inexpensive.</li>
            <li>clarify -- the unit occasionally screeches or whines, and that is very NOISY.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT THE SOFT BONNET</li>
            <li>wife really likes the compact size, relatively low noise, comfort of the product and storage of the tube and bonnet inside the unit&#x27;s case.</li>
            <li>I like a soft bonnet hair drier, because it drys my hair softly not harshly as hand held dryers do.  </li>
            <li>let alone an adult with curlers in her hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it does the job so far</li>
            <li>This dryer has a defect that needs to be fixed.</li>
            <li>The item is described as a \\&quot;soft bonnet\\&quot; hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The dryer works, but the bonnet is not at all soft.  </li>
            <li>The soft bonnet does work as suppose to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old fashioned and like my bonnet hairdrier.</li>
            <li>Well as the old saying goes you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>My friend told me her mother&#x27;s old hair dryer broke.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my 90 year old Mother.  </li>
            <li>My 90 year old mother likes it the dryer for she doesn&#x27;t have to hold it like she had to do with a hand dryer</li>
            <li>but this will do for the price I suppose... very retro feel , zooms me back to the fifties and sixties watching the girls in the family do their hair..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kinda loud, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I do not need any more lately.  </li>
            <li>BUT the hose has ripped and torn in three places so far.  </li>
            <li>Besides that, I have had no problems with mine so far.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has long hair drying times and would like to be able to sit at their PC or watch TV or just have their hair dry while they take a nap or go to bed at night.</li>
            <li>Hot enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>I also think using a bonnet as opposed to salon style dryer is more efficient in drying the hair due to creating a closed hair-drying environment.  </li>
            <li>there are other things i don&#x27;t like about it, such as the hose doesn&#x27;t fasten to the cap, just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything, which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose doesn&#x27;t fall out of the cap; or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time.</li>
            <li>It barely lasted outside the warranty period; spend the extra $; it&#x27;s worth it it</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is fine but the bonnet is too small</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for deep conditioning and to speed up the drying process of twist outs.</li>
            <li>A bit concerned that I can only use the dryer on low setting because it seems to get too hot.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that I had jumbo rollers in and the bonnet&#x27;s opening was not large enough to easily get my head in without loosening the rollers in the process.  </li>
            <li>this hair dryer does nothing to your hair but leave it frizzy and not completely dry!!!!  </li>
            <li>I used both high and low settings.</li>
            <li>but the last 2 dryers that I&#x27;ve purchased has giving me problems if I put the settings on medium or high.</li>
            <li>the control button (high, med, low) is not working.  </li>
            <li>The bonnet is also made of tissue thin plastic and if the unit would work correctly, the bonnet would most likely not even last a year&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li>Not many hair dryers available out there.</li>
            <li>I patched the hose on my 23 year old general electric hair</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s small and light weight</li>
            <li>and I really like the long hose.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my mom and her hair is on the long side of &amp;#34;short,&amp;#34; and it dries in a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it ripped around the hose attachement to the bonnet, and it would not stay attached when clicked closed to the bonnet.</li>
            <li>The bonnet is not quite big enough for large rollers, so the heat does not circulate well.  </li>
            <li>While awkward to keep the hair dryer upright and pretty (very) cheaply made, it does exactly what it is intended to do - dry my hair in rollers.</li>
            <li>It does not last supper long, but works well for me at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The dryer overheats and shuts off and cannot be reset (You have to wait until it cools down on its own or only use it on a low heat setting); the tube that connects the bonnet is not very durable.  </li>
            <li>However I tried my mother&#x27;s new Bonnet hair dryer (different brand), which cost her 40 Dollars</li>
            <li>i got this for my mother, her old one is going bad, she was so happy when i got it for her birthday.</li>
            <li>If you intend to dry your hair, get a real hooded dryer.</li>
            <li>Puts out a gentle heat to slowly dry the hair, no need to worry about burns etc.</li>
            <li>Very loud and only dries one section of your head.</li>
            <li>Well......there is a major flaw with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this product without reading other reviews first.  </li>
            <li>It works but the hose is very tricky to snap in &amp; the bonnet is for a small head without large rollers.</li>
            <li>The ONLY time I have had this unit shut off on me is when I use on high heat or if air hose is blocked/not flowing properly.</li>
            <li>Before I would have to be seated near a table only.</li>
            <li>Hence my initial description as loud and inconsistent.</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought this was because I could no longer get bonnets for my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one I could find with a soft bonnet.</li>
            <li>I barely got it on over my hair rollers</li>
            <li>Also it kind of smells weird when on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer to everyone who likes to relax while getting their hair dry.</li>
            <li>a Lazy Boy love seat to dry my hair &amp; there&#x27;s always a damp spot on the left side of my head even after 45&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>have used my unit for over a several years now need a new bonnet only but can&#x27;t find just a replacement bonnet.  </li>
            <li>Not exactly salon quality, but didn&#x27;t really expect it to be for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The very first thing I noticed was how small and crammed the case was.</li>
            <li>and when I get out my hair is still not dry.</li>
            <li>I have to pull the bonnet up high on my head to the upper hair to dry.</li>
            <li>so normally it takes one hour to dry it and with this piece of junk shutting off constantly</li>
            <li>The temperatures can get too hot; low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting.</li>
            <li>Like the fact that it is compact and seems powerful but did not like the fact that the space provided to store the power cord, bonnet and hose is so small it is cramped in there.  </li>
            <li>The dryer has the tendency to shut off after a few minutes of use because it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for a small and powerful hair dryer that would do the job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, sleek and powerful.  </li>
            <li>I get dried so much faster too!</li>
            <li>Well, I use the product twice a week--once on high for a deep conditioning, and then immediately after for a wet set on a lower setting--and it shuts off twice a week.  </li>
            <li>so you have to move the hose around to get the whole head done, not powerful enough, hose pops out.  </li>
            <li>The negative comments about the dryer shutting down after 10 - 20 minutes on medium or high is true.</li>
            <li>Only other bonnet I liked in the past was the Lazy Dazy and the old fashion nail care and hair dryer</li>
            <li>One thing I can say is that my old one last a very long time.  </li>
            <li>PROBABLY WOULD WORK FINE FOR SOMEONE WITH REALLY THIN HAIR</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a wonderful product I am enjoying it</li>
            <li> This unit would be perfect but for the fact that if it stays on the highest heat setting for more than 15-20 minutes, it shuts off.  </li>

            <li> Delivered in good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always torn when I feel like a product is a good deal for its price, but is still lacking.</li>
            <li> A longer hose would have been good.</li>
            <li> This Hair Dryer works good taks</li>
            <li> Its not as good as the ones in the hair salons</li>
            <li> Works great and it is nice and compact.</li>
            <li> if you move it falls out, although the dryer itself is good.</li>
            <li> but it works really good</li>
            <li> It has done a good job for me.</li>
            <li> I found a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Good while it lasted.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> Invest in a nicer dryer if you want your hair to look right!!!!  </li>
            <li> The item came quickly and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was happy I was able to find someone that still sells this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it and love using it.</li>
            <li> Good, Handy.</li>
            <li> It has surely put some smiles on my face!</li>
            <li> I love this compact hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!  </li>
            <li> Love the portability when traveling!</li>
            <li> Just love it , freedom from the hooded dryer !</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and they are mostly very good products.</li>
            <li> A great lightweight product, easily stored on a shelf.  </li>
            <li> It worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> Had great hopes that this dryer would fit the bill for my kids.  </li>
            <li> It works amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I wanted it to travel with me - my own problem - it was meant to be stable</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thrilled I got this.</li>
            <li> It just kind of sagged on my head...</li>
            <li> It never shut off, in fact it was a bit warm.</li>
            <li> I put the hose away while it&#x27;s still warm</li>
            <li> It is a nice unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this kind of hairdryer for months and Conair and Amazon came through for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can order good products like this through an online website since I no longer have a car.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it has a brush attachment as well, like that a lot.</li>
            <li> She liked the settings for heat control.  </li>
            <li> This unit was exactly what we wanted with a very good price.  </li>
            <li> When I had the bonnet on, dare I move an inch and that hose would fly right off!</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if the bonnet attached to the hose more securely.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well, although the bonnet hose twists too easily.</li>
            <li> It is a good compact devise that is easy to travel with, you can put it under your seat or just hold it in your lap.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very easy to store.</li>
            <li> appliance is great, however, customer should be able to purchase a bonnet to replace original bonnet when damaged.  </li>
            <li> It worked beautifully for this the first two times I used it</li>
            <li> really nice product my wife love it</li>
            <li> Mom is 90 years old and this unit is perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li> What I loved most was how compact and easy it was to use.  </li>
            <li> light weight, easy to manage does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I needed a bonnet dryer to set my daughter&#x27;s hair for graduation this worked wonderfully, the gently heat did not disturb the curls and was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> so I could give my hair hot oil treatments and it has been great.</li>
            <li> Unit VERY cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li> It works well and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use; drys and curls her hair nicely.</li>
            <li> and she loves it :)</li>
            <li> I wanted more mobility - like multitacking</li>
            <li> i was expecting more from it</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> After the tear, the air would not flow to the top of the bonnet.  </li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> For the price and for the convenience, love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok feels like a toy and the bonnet won&#x27;t stay connected to dryer</li>
            <li> Still not 100% sure</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It will overheat if you do not make sure the air vent is not blocked by anything.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> then that love it</li>
            <li> I had to wait more than 5 minutes before I could start it again and still ended up sleeping with damp hair.  </li>
            <li> This has happened too many times.  </li>
            <li> I think I could generate more drying power if I could find someone to blow through a straw.</li>
            <li> I love my hairdryer thank you</li>
            <li> I love being able to move around.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to get replacement bonnets.</li>
            <li> Have used the product before and am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of not sitting in one spot.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m nor 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love its compact size.</li>
            <li> this is a cheap product--make the investment!</li>
            <li> I can set my hair and fall asleep while drying with this hair dryer, It&#x27;s everything I was looking for and more.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is great and compare to the price I have seen for the same make and model it is good.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love this Hair dryer and been using for 3 month and had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> I have used this model for many years.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used the product although i love the size of it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> If she holds her head perfectly still, we can get through the drying but that just isn&#x27;t possible for someone who has to change positions once in a while.  </li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer</li>
            <li> Love the hair dryer because I can sleep with it.</li>
            <li> I will try once more for a roller set.</li>
            <li> I  love this dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight plastic and noisy, but they all seem to be more noisy.</li>
            <li> THIS DRYER IS OK.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; bonnet hair dryers around anymore.</li>
            <li> My fault for waiting more than a year to check.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to be sure that you snap the bonnet seal to the tube so that it locks before putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I Love it</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this dryer is not even as powerful as my handheld blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Love it, just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find one of these type hair dryers again.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is okay.</li>
            <li> Good cost, I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> it is an okay blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product by conair.</li>
            <li> Also, not noisy and comfortable while using !</li>
            <li> It fits well and the settings are for the most part, O.K.</li>
            <li> mom will love this one.</li>
            <li> They sure don&#x27;t make em like they used to</li>
            <li> This dryer does make quite a bit of noise, but not a lot more than a hand held dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I had to buy a stepdown transformer wich made it more expansive.</li>
            <li> I like most Conair products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay,</li>
            <li> Its ok and would tell friends about it.  </li>
            <li> I love being able to have a salon quality style from home.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend discovering if another product has a better quality hose before purchasing.</li>
            <li> love it love the arrival time as well.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair!!!</li>
            <li> I love this as it never gets too hot and of course it&#x27;s fairly portable.  </li>
            <li> Great, would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and easy to maneuver to multitask.</li>
            <li> Heat is good and dries good but just too short on hose.</li>
            <li> I love to wash my hair and to be able to pop the couch and just relax instead of holding the dryer up great product next time</li>
            <li> This Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is a great product and purchasing</li>
            <li> Others in my retirement center building were also impressed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more comfortable</li>
            <li> I enjoy being able to sit on my bed, use my smartphone while my hair is drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the value; but bonnet pulls with the weight of the hose and drying time is not as fast as with an upright dryer.</li>
            <li> loved it so much, bought another one</li>
            <li> everything i expected ...works great superior hair dryer for the price,the bonnet inflates properly and has great drying speeds</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Snapping the hose to the bonnet isn&#x27;t as easy as it should be&lt;</li>
            <li> This is a must buy and plus its easy for travel.</li>
            <li> Heat distributes throughout cap and it&#x27;s easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to use</li>
            <li> It was so easy to put together and take apart.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to store and travel with.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> EASY TO CARRY ON VACATION OR</li>
            <li> medium to low heat is the best and anything that can honestly dry my hair without damage is a great thing.  </li>
            <li> Easy to store or  take on a trip.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to hold with hand and easy to carry around the country and abroad</li>
            <li> It packs up easily and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It stores easily and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the price, the compactness of it --  and it is easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> The hair dryer will work better and you will have a full head of curley hair.</li>
            <li> One of the settings is much to hot for the warm setting.</li>
            <li> Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works fine, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do,</li>
            <li> Perfect for get sets and tight curls.</li>
            <li> I love that it has the cool setting perfect for women transitioning to natural hair or that are already natural.</li>
            <li> Perfect little dyer.........</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer works a treat to bring out the best curl.  </li>
            <li> Nice,  very portable, compact, light weight hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise she told me she liked this one better than her old one.</li>
            <li> it removes the restrictions from your neck, you can sit our slouch comfortably while drying your hair.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is light weigh and stores all accessories inside the case.</li>
            <li> And it dried my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Dryer works as intended and is more useful than a salon style dryer in that it&#x27;s portable.  </li>
            <li> I can now move freely and don&#x27;t have to keep still thinking the hose will fall out, cause it won&#x27;t....</li>
            <li> processed hair benefits GREATLY from salon deep conditioning</li>
            <li> Its great, I can sit in any room of my house and still use as a sit under dryer or use as just a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> The dryer does actually work, it has a inside setting to automatically shut itself off to prevent overheating, worked great from me without shutting off</li>
            <li> This product was cheaply made and without any thought put into it.</li>
            <li> Great product I read reviews so kept my unit on low!</li>
            <li> It may permanently attach the tow so you can no longer use the brush or detach them, but it will keep the two secure.  </li>
            <li> has about 1/8&amp;#34; of sliding area after &amp;#34;nodules&amp;#34; on hose fit into hose, but no way to lock it &amp; no way to make it stay.</li>
            <li> cheap and misleading.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t fit over my rollers.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made and the motor burned up in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I had an old one that I loved</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved soft bonnet Hair dryers, the flexibility and convenience is fantastic.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love it come right on time for my hair</li>
            <li> This is very handy for deep hair conditioning.</li>
            <li> The bonnet finally tore but I have had 8 yrs of good use and the dryer unit is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased when I first received this dryer.  </li>
            <li> it was hard to find a nice great working portable hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is great I can dry my hair while I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Best of all, It&#x27;s so compact that I don&#x27;t even notice it when stored in the back of the closet, unlike the old hooded style.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is nice and large and the air flow is just right for my hair.  </li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t too many of the soft bonnet hairdryers available, so this is the one that I&#x27;ve had the most success with.</li>
            <li> It works great and is not very noisy.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having it available!</li>
            <li> I use it at least three times a week and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I even attempted to use it on cool and not even that worked.</li>
            <li> However, I cannot style my hair without this machine any more because this one works very well and save time.</li>
            <li> they are all true.  </li>
            <li> much any more so this works for her hair needs.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment serves no purpose though, but it did feel good on my scalp when used as a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer for use with the big curlers.</li>
            <li> but I got it figured it out good enough for me.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to travel with, and it seems pretty well made.  </li>
            <li> the \\&quot;high\\&quot; choice of hot air does not give off extremely hot air as many dryers do, and this is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> No, you&#x27;re not going to be one of the lucky ones...</li>
            <li> and it dries her hair quickly on the medium setting.  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> and I had to hold it up so that the air can circulate, plus it didn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li> The medium setting tended to be very hot.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t allow for much mobility, but it&#x27;s way more effective at actually drying.</li>
            <li> Love that the hair dryer and attachments all fit in a small case - light and easy to store !  </li>
            <li> This dryer has the perfect temperature settings and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this dryer, I can easily move when my hair is drying.  </li>
            <li> My kids have long hair, no longer torture drying their hair, now they shower more often, be sure to supervise them using this, a must.</li>
            <li> Her mother was thrilled to have one exactly like her old one.</li>
            <li> and it would take me up to 2 hours or more sitting in one position while being very conscious to not slouch.</li>
            <li> I almost bought the hood attachment (different brand), but opted for this one instead as it is the better value... blow dryer, hood and brush attachment in one box!</li>
            <li> The warm air seems to circulate better in this bonnet than the previous dryer&#x27;s bonnet.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer a slightly larger case that would accomodate everything more easily.</li>
            <li> The temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it on high for more than 10 minutes because it gets so hot</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super light weight and doesn&#x27;t take up much room&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I thought it worked great the few times I used it</li>
            <li> one of the few stuff i have bought online with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily as a heat source for conditioning my hair and it works very well.</li>
            <li> nothing more because I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li> If it had a longer hose and if the storage compartment had instructions on how to place it back inside it would be spectacular.  </li>
            <li> The benefits though were worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Nots as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> it gets warm enough for conditioning treatments, but not for setting/drying a style in place.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only thing this dryer is good for, to travel with.</li>
            <li> yes,very useful for the family.</li>
            <li> Well worth my money.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been trying vintage hair styles and a bonnet hair dryer was required for many of those old styles.</li>
            <li> nice unit but not enough room to store everything in side compartment.  </li>
            <li> This is worth the money you pay for it.</li>
            <li> gets super hot if you need it, also allows home hair coloring that requires heat.  </li>
            <li> Bonnet works fine as long as you are satisfied with the low/moderate heat.</li>
            <li> I have tendonitis in my right hand</li>
            <li> This was the right price.</li>
            <li> this software bonnet puts the heat in all the right areas of your head.</li>
            <li> Dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot, only gets warm.</li>
            <li> Easy to use dry your hair fast easy to carried is light weight.  </li>
            <li> Too small for rollers, but great for conditioning, gloss, semi-permanent color, etc.  </li>
            <li> Hold nice volume all day long.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer hoping I could just sit in front of my computer, TV, or book and just let it dry my hair on its own.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure your hair is damp not real wet before putting it in rollers.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise I found that the Conair SB1X Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer was still being made, and available from Amazon !  </li>
            <li> this dryer is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t put out very hot air</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, it will be fine!</li>
            <li> It works very very</li>
            <li> My wife likes it very much.</li>
            <li> Conair could do better - my last two Conair dryers have not lasted.  </li>
            <li> gets HOT</li>
            <li> Used it yesterday for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be smaller and more compact.  </li>
            <li> I was better of with a simple blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This product does not blow (hot air)</li>
            <li> Never again will I attempt to purchase another conair product without reading the reviews first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that I will enjoy my Soft Bonnet Hair Bonnet Dryer for years to come.  </li>
            <li> it gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li> At first I was with everyone else on the thing not staying in place and repeatedly falling out.</li>
            <li> It is very efficient, and, packable!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get so hot it burns your ears or scalp.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCTS FIRST...</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME</li>
            <li> I purchased it during the Christmas holiday, and was only able to use it 3 times before it started having problems.  </li>
            <li> The first just wore out.  </li>
            <li> The dryer cuts off as soon as it starts to get hot.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw this dryer I thought it was a toy.  </li>
            <li> product is pretty lightweight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the last one she has that got too hot.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> My hair dryer came exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> I think it got too hot.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li> This one works so fast!  </li>
            <li> Consider spending more if planning regular use.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and is quite powerful for such a compact size.</li>
            <li> I have had Conair soft bonnet hair dryers in the past with great success.</li>
            <li> Nice light and portable, beats using a hard bonnet .</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s only good if you are deep conditioning your hair.</li>
            <li> If your a natural, you definitely should own this product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its great for deep conditioning and hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I thought buying this product would be a good idea because it was small compact</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> It is a good product if you&#x27;re using small or medium rollers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to using the cap that you attach to a hand held hair dryer, it&#x27;s much larger and the cap is able to fit a large set of rollers underneath of it.</li>
            <li> Needs to tone that warm setting down.</li>
            <li> I love that it is portable, and I can pretty much sit anywhere to dry my hair, which takes about an hour to do.</li>
            <li> The Conair SB1 Bonnet Hair Dryer allows me to be more flexible with where I can dry my hair.</li>
            <li> so it scrunches up easily and fits back in the unit.</li>
            <li> If you have hair of any length and expect this to dry your hair completly, you better have an hour.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well especially when you use rollers to curl your hair like I do.</li>
            <li> the only thing I dont like is the hose keeps falling off easily from the cap  </li>
            <li> YOU JUST HAVE TO TURN THE HOSE AROUND TO DRY THE TOP OF YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> I admit that I love washing my hair because when I dry it, I just put my bonnet on, cover up in a blanket, and relax with the heat on my head.  </li>
            <li> The reason that I got the bonnet hair dryer was so that I can dry my hair and have a little more flexibility to do more things while I was drying my hair and also dry my hair more quickly than sitting under a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> to use&lt;br /&gt;Bonnet is large so will accommodate all size rollers</li>
            <li> and I use large rollers.</li>
            <li> But, to be fair, I have long thick hair, so it might work ok on somebody else.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that after you get the bonnet and tubing out of the case, you just can&#x27;t fit it back in easily.  </li>
            <li> The alternate brand worked fine.</li>
            <li> The bonnet connection to the hose doesn&#x27;t fit securely so it is a juggling act to get the too tight bonnet on without disconnecting from the hose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, she may be happier when our good old Wisconsin winter setles in and the house is a little cooler.</li>
            <li> The locking mechanism on the hose is not stable enough to hold the hose securely.</li>
            <li> that I just put the whole hair dryer in and be done with it.</li>
            <li> It work very well and never turn off.  </li>
            <li> The dryer does not look very sturdy (inferior plastic)</li>
            <li> The price seemed reasonable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bonnet hair dryer at a fabulous price and overall, it meets my needs.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Conair hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with me</li>
            <li> but I used it so much</li>
            <li> , then I set it, put on the bonnet, turn it on hi, put on make-up and the hairs ready.   </li>
            <li> Just what I needed for travel and days I need a fast set.</li>
            <li> Instead or purchasing a whole hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and I could put away with out taking to much room.  </li>
            <li> STILL SHUTS OFF...GETTING READY TO ORDER ANOTHER DRYER BY CONAIR, BUT IT DOES HAVE 4 1/2 STARS...</li>
            <li> This item is packed and ready to travel the world with my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient hair dryer</li>
            <li> Very convenient and portable.</li>
            <li> Need to be careful to make sure the tubing is not crunched up, but otherwise have had no problem with it.  </li>
            <li> H-O-T, (real)  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy too</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t worry to much about the shut off feature.</li>
            <li> does not turn on - very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Works well and is very portable.</li>
            <li> had a bonnet that would not have fit the head of a tiny baby....</li>
            <li> Bonnet is comfortable however the air hose is too short</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> The wattage doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough to completely fill the bonnett and circulate hot air evenly.</li>
            <li> I was not too sure about this with all the other reviews, but I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> hair dryer is compact.you are able to do other task</li>
            <li> When the hot air was blowing into the bonnet it only blew up the bonnet within the first couple of inches from where it entered the bonnet, the hot air did not go into the rest of the bonnet.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have noticed her hair looking more full lately.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I got a big laugh out of it when she asked for it, but what Mom wants Mom gets!</li>
            <li> I expected to be able to actually use this bonnet dryer to &amp;#34;Set&amp;#34; my hair for quick styling.</li>
            <li> This one performs ok with the one exception that the bonnet is not as large as in previous products.</li>
            <li> but it is sufficient to dry your hair (just takes a little longer) and the price was great.</li>
            <li> will drying your hair.gets hot fast and able to dry  your hair in a short period of time</li>
            <li> only negative comment was that she wishes the unit had one more lower heat option; she gets pretty warm even at low heat.</li>
            <li> , I just hooked it up to use for the third time and it worked for about 15 seconds (I started on the cool setting) then shut off...</li>
            <li> The Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is exactly what I was looking.  </li>
            <li> I can truly say, this soft bonnet hair dyer makes my life so much easier!  </li>
            <li> I thought I had found the exact item I needed to fix my 87 year old mother-in-law&#x27;s hair at home since she can&#x27;t get out to go to the salon.  </li>
            <li> The hose may fall off sometimes depending on the way you lay down with it but other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> Your new hairdo will be a blast!</li>
            <li> Other wise your hair really won&#x27;t dry or curl.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find instructions on how to open the darn thing, had to pry open the lid and wasn&#x27;t sure if I was just breaking it before I used it.  </li>
            <li> Second unit super and works well.  </li>
            <li> the air intake is in the back, which allows the unit to be ok when sitting on a bed or chair (not possible with bottom intake models).  </li>
            <li> it would be better if it twisted on like a jar top</li>
            <li> I wanted this particular Conair hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> We are using it for adding heat to conditioning treatments and vibrant hair color.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this small portable hair dryer for my roller sets, but I could not even put the cap on with large and medium sized rollers.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing another Hot Tools Dryer, a little more money but worth the price in the long run.</li>
            <li> It is good but a bit weak</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why i gave it the high mark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three times: twice on high and once on medium setting.  </li>
            <li> small and not very powerful but for deep conditioning, its perfect!!!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works fine as expected.  </li>
            <li> though so this might just be the best of a bad bunch.</li>
            <li> The unit is much easier to store away than the old one.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T REALLY GET HOT ENOUGH FOR ETHNIC HAIR.</li>
            <li> My folks dried my hair like this when I was a kid (okay 35 years ago).    </li>
            <li> I love this product from the small size to how fast it dries my hair.  </li>
            <li> Better than wearing curlers for a few hours.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally worth the 10-20 extra dollars.</li>
            <li> Good idea, poor execution.  </li>
            <li> One should not use high heat for long periods of time for that will cause more hair damage then curling or flat irons do.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the other people got defective ones, but mine works just fine.</li>
            <li> The bonnet isn&#x27;t the easiest to get on and off for that, but it only takes about 25 minutes to dry most of the hair that is 3&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending this back right away.  </li>
            <li> The dryer would turn off on everything but the low setting right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Not enough heat , take long time for long hair drying, have to buy  another one which is more powerful</li>
            <li> And it leaves my hands free to do other things.  </li>
            <li> , I had to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> The reason I saw the reviews is because I am already looking for a new dryer 4 months after purchasing this model.</li>
            <li> It was requested by one of our senior residents that live in the residential facility I work at.</li>
            <li> The different heat settings help, although the high gets too hot to lay down with, there is a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> also when using dryer the cap became very soft and felt like it was melting.</li>
            <li> I have started to use my old hair dryer although the bonnet is torn and the high setting no longer works.</li>
            <li> Had a very old bonnet hair dryer that is about shot.</li>
            <li> Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer&#x27;s are over heating when it is set on medium or high.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is adequate in size but the drawstring on the bonnet is so short that you can&#x27;t expand the bonnet to a reasonable size to fit over curlers.  </li>
            <li> (yes, I&#x27;m old, I still use rollers!)</li>
            <li> This dryer quit mid drying--the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I run it for a half hour at a time and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Well every time I have used it and it&#x27;s not many, I put the hair dryer on medium heat and it will be okay for a couple of minutes, 5 minutes and automatically shut off.</li>
            <li> Second time buying this item because I wore the first one out.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with the hose falling out or it not getting hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it shuts off after only 5 minutes if not \\&quot;warmed up\\&quot; first on a lower setting.  </li>
            <li> will have to go shopping and find a dryer comparable to the Hot Tools unit that I have had for several yrs.  </li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t get hot enough after using it for an hour I had to get under my sit under dryer to finish drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited to finally use this a year or so after purchase only to discover the bonnet wasn&#x27;t in the box</li>
            <li> I had my first one for years till it finally died......</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Low gets really hot</li>
            <li> and it still works the same way as when I first took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> and I use pretty big hair rollers.</li>
            <li> The only weakness of this product is the hot air has a hard time to flow to the top of my hair.</li>
            <li> Bonnet was very cheaply made and hard to connect.  </li>
            <li> I recently ordered 3 for the dryer that I already had, but the bonnets have been on &amp;#34;back order&amp;#34; for months, so I had to buy a whole new dryer.</li>
            <li> I occasionally had issues with it shutting off automatically like others have noted, but my primary issue was that it didn&#x27;t dry my hair well at all.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet is very cheap and became unusable after only a few times of use.</li>
            <li> i can set it and use this fantastic little dryer for her  </li>
            <li> the hard blowdryer glad i didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say though is that it&#x27;s kind of hard to squish all the stuff back inside the carrying case ...</li>
            <li> How could conair continue selling this garbage when it is clearly a defective item.</li>
            <li> I thought that I misread the instructions and dug them out to read again - instructions were clear on how to connect the hose so the unit was defective .  </li>
            <li> Not too loud.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to buy a big hair dryer.</li>
            <li> B0002G214U Conair SB1X Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer]]    </li>
            <li> No problems are noted so far.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES THE SOFT BONNET HAIR DRYER.</li>
            <li> So far...</li>
            <li> It does speed up the regular drying but not as much as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> The Conair Soft Bonnet just shut off without warning which woke me up.  </li>
            <li> I should have read some reviews first which would have helped my damp locks and saved me some money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Much too big for travel.  </li>
            <li> This is going straight back to the store.</li>
            <li> THe plus is the bonnet was soft...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairdresser</li>
            <li> but I do not have the time nor the money to buy a professional hooded salon dryer for use maybe 4-5 times a month.</li>
            <li> We ran our of finding old units at rummage sales etc.</li>
            <li> My 86 year old mom can&#x27;t get to the salon</li>
            <li> Loud and inconsistent, but inexpensive.</li>
            <li> clarify -- the unit occasionally screeches or whines, and that is very NOISY.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT THE SOFT BONNET</li>
            <li> wife really likes the compact size, relatively low noise, comfort of the product and storage of the tube and bonnet inside the unit&#x27;s case.</li>
            <li> I like a soft bonnet hair drier, because it drys my hair softly not harshly as hand held dryers do.  </li>
            <li> let alone an adult with curlers in her hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it does the job so far</li>
            <li> This dryer has a defect that needs to be fixed.</li>
            <li> The item is described as a \\&quot;soft bonnet\\&quot; hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The dryer works, but the bonnet is not at all soft.  </li>
            <li> The soft bonnet does work as suppose to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old fashioned and like my bonnet hairdrier.</li>
            <li> Well as the old saying goes you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My friend told me her mother&#x27;s old hair dryer broke.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 90 year old Mother.  </li>
            <li> My 90 year old mother likes it the dryer for she doesn&#x27;t have to hold it like she had to do with a hand dryer</li>
            <li> but this will do for the price I suppose... very retro feel , zooms me back to the fifties and sixties watching the girls in the family do their hair..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda loud, but it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I do not need any more lately.  </li>
            <li> BUT the hose has ripped and torn in three places so far.  </li>
            <li> Besides that, I have had no problems with mine so far.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has long hair drying times and would like to be able to sit at their PC or watch TV or just have their hair dry while they take a nap or go to bed at night.</li>
            <li> Hot enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> I also think using a bonnet as opposed to salon style dryer is more efficient in drying the hair due to creating a closed hair-drying environment.  </li>
            <li> there are other things i don&#x27;t like about it, such as the hose doesn&#x27;t fasten to the cap, just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything, which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose doesn&#x27;t fall out of the cap; or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time.</li>
            <li> It barely lasted outside the warranty period; spend the extra $; it&#x27;s worth it it</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is fine but the bonnet is too small</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for deep conditioning and to speed up the drying process of twist outs.</li>
            <li> A bit concerned that I can only use the dryer on low setting because it seems to get too hot.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that I had jumbo rollers in and the bonnet&#x27;s opening was not large enough to easily get my head in without loosening the rollers in the process.  </li>
            <li> this hair dryer does nothing to your hair but leave it frizzy and not completely dry!!!!  </li>
            <li> I used both high and low settings.</li>
            <li> but the last 2 dryers that I&#x27;ve purchased has giving me problems if I put the settings on medium or high.</li>
            <li> the control button (high, med, low) is not working.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet is also made of tissue thin plastic and if the unit would work correctly, the bonnet would most likely not even last a year&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li> Not many hair dryers available out there.</li>
            <li> I patched the hose on my 23 year old general electric hair</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s small and light weight</li>
            <li> and I really like the long hose.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom and her hair is on the long side of &amp;#34;short,&amp;#34; and it dries in a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it ripped around the hose attachement to the bonnet, and it would not stay attached when clicked closed to the bonnet.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is not quite big enough for large rollers, so the heat does not circulate well.  </li>
            <li> While awkward to keep the hair dryer upright and pretty (very) cheaply made, it does exactly what it is intended to do - dry my hair in rollers.</li>
            <li> It does not last supper long, but works well for me at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The dryer overheats and shuts off and cannot be reset (You have to wait until it cools down on its own or only use it on a low heat setting); the tube that connects the bonnet is not very durable.  </li>
            <li> However I tried my mother&#x27;s new Bonnet hair dryer (different brand), which cost her 40 Dollars</li>
            <li> i got this for my mother, her old one is going bad, she was so happy when i got it for her birthday.</li>
            <li> If you intend to dry your hair, get a real hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> Puts out a gentle heat to slowly dry the hair, no need to worry about burns etc.</li>
            <li> Very loud and only dries one section of your head.</li>
            <li> Well......there is a major flaw with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this product without reading other reviews first.  </li>
            <li> It works but the hose is very tricky to snap in &amp; the bonnet is for a small head without large rollers.</li>
            <li> The ONLY time I have had this unit shut off on me is when I use on high heat or if air hose is blocked/not flowing properly.</li>
            <li> Before I would have to be seated near a table only.</li>
            <li> Hence my initial description as loud and inconsistent.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought this was because I could no longer get bonnets for my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one I could find with a soft bonnet.</li>
            <li> I barely got it on over my hair rollers</li>
            <li> Also it kind of smells weird when on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair dryer to everyone who likes to relax while getting their hair dry.</li>
            <li> a Lazy Boy love seat to dry my hair &amp; there&#x27;s always a damp spot on the left side of my head even after 45&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> have used my unit for over a several years now need a new bonnet only but can&#x27;t find just a replacement bonnet.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly salon quality, but didn&#x27;t really expect it to be for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed was how small and crammed the case was.</li>
            <li> and when I get out my hair is still not dry.</li>
            <li> I have to pull the bonnet up high on my head to the upper hair to dry.</li>
            <li> so normally it takes one hour to dry it and with this piece of junk shutting off constantly</li>
            <li> The temperatures can get too hot; low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that it is compact and seems powerful but did not like the fact that the space provided to store the power cord, bonnet and hose is so small it is cramped in there.  </li>
            <li> The dryer has the tendency to shut off after a few minutes of use because it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a small and powerful hair dryer that would do the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, sleek and powerful.  </li>
            <li> I get dried so much faster too!</li>
            <li> Well, I use the product twice a week--once on high for a deep conditioning, and then immediately after for a wet set on a lower setting--and it shuts off twice a week.  </li>
            <li> so you have to move the hose around to get the whole head done, not powerful enough, hose pops out.  </li>
            <li> The negative comments about the dryer shutting down after 10 - 20 minutes on medium or high is true.</li>
            <li> Only other bonnet I liked in the past was the Lazy Dazy and the old fashion nail care and hair dryer</li>
            <li> One thing I can say is that my old one last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> PROBABLY WOULD WORK FINE FOR SOMEONE WITH REALLY THIN HAIR</li>
            <li> After few minutes on , shut off , and it seen not to blow enough hot air to dry the hair.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair in no time flat with the bonnet and when I used the dryer wand brush attachment it made my hair very silky.  </li>
            <li> I only use medium to low heat, no major troubles and my hair</li>
            <li> This particular one is compact and when everything is packed away, takes up little shelf space.  </li>
            <li> although the dryer is too loud for hearing the TV, I put the closed captions on!</li>
            <li> i put it on and then take my sweet time putting on makeup so that this thing has plenty of time to do its thing, but my hair comes out about as wet as if i&#x27;d wrapped it in a microfiber towel for a few minutes (which is to say, maybe 10 percent dry--not dripping, but definitely wet and not damp).</li>
            <li> The hose is only 2 ft long and the bonnet is tiny.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet is too small for Large or Jumbo rollers</li>
            <li> Only good for short thin hair maybe!!!</li>
            <li> The bonnet refused to completely fill with air and the hose is stiff and not long enough.</li>
            <li> Contrarily,  the product last as long as I want.</li>
            <li> I am not generally a complainer, but I can&#x27;t believe Conair put their name on this piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> I will say that I have fine, thin hair and use a smaller roller and with hair wet, it takes about 45 minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> No doubt the &amp;#34;string&amp;#34; inside the hose won&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> 20 minutes is enough to get my hair dry.</li>
            <li> But, still, I even left this thing on my head overnight and my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dry in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I bougth this one the last year, and yet I can&#x27;t dry my hair one time.</li>
            <li> Wanted to dry their hair without deafening them with the noise from a regular \\&quot;gun\\&quot; style hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> First off, my hair is long and thick</li>
            <li> This one replaces a decades old GE unit that developed severe rattles and then terminal switch failure.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed, the only good thing about this product is the size, other than that it did not expand while I had it on</li>
            <li> I also have to put a towel around the back of my neck to avoid excessive heat near the hose connection.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this a long time.</li>
            <li> This item was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> We had looked for this device for a long time.  </li>
            <li> If it hadn&#x27;t been for struggling with some surgery I would have returned this long ago.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> My hair is wet and set, and I&#x27;m left without a dryer.  </li>
            <li> long.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, It also doesn&#x27;t have a long cord for mobility but grab a book and sit a spell.</li>
            <li> I bought it to dry my hair while I applied make-up, kill two birds with one stone, but my hair is still wet and requires a regular blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is that its very loud.</li>
            <li> This bonnet dryer is not very powerful and probably should only be considered when doing conditioner treatments to your hair.</li>
            <li> but it takes a long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The hose barely connects to the bonnet and any slight movement will cause it to detach so</li>
            <li> I think this product would probably dry your curls if your hair isn&#x27;t too long.</li>
            <li> Fitting them in is a little bit difficult and It takes me a really long time to get dry because of this reason.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> After reading all the other reviews, several times, I decided to go with the Conair.  </li>
            <li> however the attachment piece from the bonnet to the machine falls out from time to time and you have to plug it back in other</li>
            <li> I find that getting the bonnet over these rollers is a little more difficult.</li>
            <li> I have very long here</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It also takes a longer time to dry my hair than when I was using my hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I found the trick is to dry my hair with a blow dryer till just damp, roll it in my velcro rollers, then use the bonnet dryer while putting on my make-up (about 10 minutes).</li>
            <li> I have tried this dryer 3 times and never gotten my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I dry with my handheld blow dryer till my hairs just damp</li>
            <li> Have not used it to dry my hair, but I think it would get that job done also.</li>
            <li> It holds you hostage while you dry.</li>
            <li> aboud  45 min to dry your Hair</li>
            <li> I can do things in the kitchen as I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I can dry my curls and read a book in ease.</li>
            <li> Takes quite some time to dry longer hair.</li>
            <li> the biggest thing is that it just doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> It took me almost 2 hours to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> So I pop on the bonnet pull out a book, relax and dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have to keep moving the cap all around my head just to get each section to dry.</li>
            <li> When I dry my hair</li>
            <li> I use foam rollers to style my hair overnight; and sometimes they&#x27;re not quite dry in the morning.  </li>
            <li> who does not need a blow dryer to dry ones hair.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be trying to push and shove and push and shove to get it back in, so I just use a big heavy plastic zip up case that I have from another product bought years ago</li>
            <li> This dryer is a total waste of time and money; it shuts off constantly, so it takes forever to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> got tired of holding the hot hose as I tried to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to use the bonnet from my old Lazy Dazy dryer.</li>
            <li> First unit shipped had its case broken.  </li>
            <li> Motor overheats after several minutes and shuts down.  </li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to use because the hose is so short and the unit is so light weight.  </li>
            <li> and it dries it in half the time as the hood dryer that I currently got rid of.  </li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s the old school type, but the bonnet is way to thin, it didn&#x27;t last long..</li>
            <li> It was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something.</li>
            <li> so maybe it was just that my hair was too thick for it to dry completely.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer I was using by Hot Tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers.  </li>
            <li> The bonnet on this is shameful -- it is too thin, inflexible, easily torn and cannot be replaced when it inevitable tears.</li>
            <li> I painfully sat there with the bonnet on and putting the hose back on about a million times, to only come out with 30% dry hair after 30 minutes worth of sitting.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see that it is hard to put away in case</li>
            <li> Only drawback I see is it&#x27;s hard getting everything back into the case</li>
            <li> The only negative that I have relative to bonnet style dryer is -- from experience -- the bonnet wears/tears up before the dryer breaks</li>
            <li> I found that the bonnet in the dryer didn&#x27;t inflate as much as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> so be careful if wearing a tank or drape a towel over your back&lt;</li>
            <li> I had owned the unit for only a few months</li>
            <li> Not much heat.</li>
            <li> Not much power.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair with no problem, but the cords are on the short side.</li>
            <li> Signed wet hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have enough watts waste of time to curl hair</li>
            <li> its a total waste of money.....</li>
            <li> only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> It kept slipping off.</li>
            <li> Also hose and or bonnet do not fit back into side of dryer as it would appear.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to dry thick hair!!!</li>
            <li> Never got a chance to dry my hair completly because the dryer stops abruptly within 5 min of usage and continues to abruptly stop every 10- 15 min.  </li>
            <li> older style Sunbeam and General Electric models that were around years ago as Bonnet Hairdryers, were vastly superior to this horrible cheap and nasty Version!</li>
            <li> the bonnet is too small doesn&#x27;t fit over my hair with rollers in my hair thus, useless.</li>
            <li> I do find it a little hard to get the tubing and such back in the carrier though that detracts nothing from it</li>
            <li> Dryer is not very powerful, so the brush it pretty much useless for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I too found it difficult to get my shoulder length hair dry in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I tried other outlets in case that was the issue.  </li>
            <li> Believe  the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It can be a bit uncomfortable since the hose gets hot after sometime and will touch your skin, so it does require some adjustment there.</li>
            <li> Apparently Amazon requires at least one star.  </li>
            <li> The other problem is the hose.  </li>
            <li> You just sit and get your hair dryed and device is small enough to walk around with.</li>
            <li> So convenient for me to do other things while drying my hair without having to lug one of the self standing one around</li>
            <li> And it gets so hot it is difficult to hold.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to put in suitcase when traveling.</li>
            <li> will get a bit more expensive one this time.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with products sad that it didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> I recommend this dryer to other customers.</li>
            <li> its small &amp; the hood is really big to put rollers .</li>
            <li> money well spent !</li>
            <li> AND the highest heat settings was not hot at all.</li>
            <li> I even dry my dog with it !!!</li>
            <li> Keeping it anyway  for it is quick drying on a chilly night.</li>
            <li> The Bonnet is extremely small for a large bonnet and it is very hard to attach the hose to the bonnet.    </li>
            <li> I can do other things like read, or use my computer because the heat isn&#x27;t coming down on my neck and my ears.</li>
            <li> Save yourself frustation and buy a more expensive model!!</li>
            <li> It was hard to get the all the attachments back in to the storage area.</li>
            <li> If you twist it hard enough, it locks in place.</li>
            <li> Finally had to buy a hard bonnet type.</li>
            <li> it sucks big time.</li>
            <li> At the price it was not worth returning..</li>
            <li> I can still do their usual wet sets weekly without having to drag them to the salon.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and when using curlers this means several hours under the dryer.</li>
            <li> I thought it  would get easier to use after a few tries but it is hopeless.  </li>
            <li> The poor reviews for this product really surprised me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have that problem with the dryer shutting down  after 10 - 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It stopped running...broke down...</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it only draws 400 watts, and still puts out a decent quantity of air, but the terrible bonnet means I will be looking elsewhere when it&#x27;s time to replace this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually watch tv while my hair is getting dry. ❤</li>
            <li> Had to return after the first time I used the Product, the hose burned off the bonnet connection was impossible to dry my hair with this product.</li>
            <li> After sitting there for one and a half hours of it turning on for only perhaps only 2 minutes at a time I finally gave up, frustrated and with my hair still wet.                                                 </li>
            <li> I wish I had read the other reviews before I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is the bonnet would not fit over my rollers, no matter what I did to adjust it.  </li>
            <li> that the one one I previously had.</li>
            <li> i would rather subject my hair to heat damage by blow drying than to use this again</li>
            <li> Half</li>
            <li> All the main functions, useless.</li>
            <li> Nothing yet seems to dry my long thin hair in curlers.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick</li>
            <li> and I have long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> It ended up overheating and shutting down for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews after the purchased, and was disappointed because most of them were negative.</li>
            <li> I hate sitting under the traditional dryer especially since I have back problems, but since I bought this dyer it has allowed me to have that flexibility of moving around and not staying in one position for two long!!!!</li>
            <li> try to make one a little quieted</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little flimsy but you can make it work if you are in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I even rigged it to a little belt, so I could iron a shirt while my hair was drying.  </li>
            <li> The connection of the hose to the dryer was a little tricky</li>
            <li> My little one has noise sensory issues.  </li>
            <li> The hose needs to be a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> It is a dead dryer.  </li>
            <li> These days their making junk products that are simply a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because I did not enjoy sitting under my overhead dryer.</li>
            <li> I have put this on and taken a nap while it dried my hair.</li>
            <li> and it dried my hair with curlers.</li>
            <li> I totally wasted my money.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money .</li>
            <li> it works but it&#x27;s not particularly comfortable and could be a lot quieter.  </li>
            <li> Not much available in the way of alternatives (hooded dryer)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> but once I learned you need to push the hose firmly and twist it snapped on and stayed on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Conair for years, and although I don&#x27;t use it often, I have never had any trouble with it at all.</li>
            <li> Wish I had because these ladies are dead on.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but I have trouble keeping the bonnet attached to the hose.</li>
            <li> stated this dryer will shut off after a few minutes...</li>
            <li> but this product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I used it a few times and threw it away....</li>
            <li> Uneven heating</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time on this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> What a waste...</li>
            <li> This conair dryer was a Waste of money.</li>
            <li> i wasted my money on this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Makes for a very frustrating time when I finally give up and my curly hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> Horrible, cheap, low air thrusting power and extremely small cap.</li>
            <li> The flexible tube fits into the bonnet with such a tiny turn that it is impossible to keep the tube there.  </li>
            <li> At least I can lay down.</li>
            <li> I can sit in my bed and dry my hair, but it&#x27;s a little (just a little) uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was.  </li>
            <li> The least little movement of my head caused the hose to fall out again.</li>
            <li> Takes up very little space when storing..</li>
            <li> I went to several beauty supply stores and they were mucho expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to get it restarted.</li>
            <li> The space was too small to accomodate everything.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied</li>
            <li> I adapted this unit to a homemade dryer cabinet for small parts.</li>
            <li> Had only used this dryer on 3-4 occasions when the power switch failed to turn the dryer on anymore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to get back in the</li>
            <li> You may have to practice a few times to know how to lock it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible hair dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Bought for using on small rolled curlers.  </li>
            <li> Ordered it for my wife, but the bonnet was too small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3, almost 4 years</li>
            <li> 7 weeks after I bought it....and couldn&#x27;t return it because it was past the one month period...</li>
            <li> Difficult to open the plastic cover.</li>
            <li> its past the date.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4-star for it is difficult for her to get it back in the case and sometimes the hose slips off of the bonnet.</li>
            <li> I do however prefer the Carel dryer that I had in the past.</li>
            <li> Cap is too small to put over my rollers.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is way too small.</li>
            <li> It works for me well because I have thin hair, if you have thick hair or very long hair, you will spend five hours with it.</li>
            <li> The bonnnet was difficult to get on, mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place, and kept pulling the bonnet off my head.</li>
            <li> It works well except the hose is hard to attach to the bonnet</li>
            <li> BUT THE HARD COLLASPABLE BONNET WELL SEE WHAT HAPPENS</li>
            <li> The hose is hard to get to stay on the cap.</li>
            <li> Had a hard hood dryer for over 10 year.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD A HARD TIME LOCKING THE HOSE ON THE BONNET.</li>
            <li> clumsy apparatis -</li>
            <li> At least their&#x27;s restarted.</li>
            <li> so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Used it for 30 mins and it fell off at least 5 times.</li>
            <li> have waist length extremely thick hair...</li>
            <li> She uses a hair dryer about once a week, so that&#x27;s pretty darn bad!  </li>
            <li> It was very difficult to open the plastic case that housed the bonnet and hose.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It was very difficult to put back into its case.  </li>
            <li> I seriously wish I had not</li>
            <li> And, the attachments are not good quality.</li>
            <li> The item is working well, but the quality is not good.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy...</li>
            <li> wet and mad</li>
            <li> Hair dryers like this hard to find!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to replace everything that needs to go in the storage area.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> And she absolutely loves the stupid thing!  </li>
            <li> It did not work well from the beginning and the motor got worse with each use.</li>
            <li> Extremely frustrating.</li>
            <li> Not happy that of course it lasted through the return policy and now I&#x27;m stuck with a broken hair dryer......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having to shop for another hair dryer since this one is so poorly made.  </li>
            <li> The poorly designed hose attachment to the bonnet often comes undone in spite of repeated attempts to seat and fasten it.  </li>
            <li> and my arms get tired.</li>
            <li> Not happy about that</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the false advertising.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick that it takes forever to dry and having to sit in one spot under a hooded dryer was painful!  </li>
            <li> Its a little noisy, but not too bad and the compact style of the dryer makes up for any noisiness.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Difficult to place on head.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that was not the case.  </li>
            <li> The hose is also a bit difficult to wind up and store in the unit.</li>
            <li> if you want to get something for the missus...this is it, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> The motor cycles at seemingly random moments, but has never overheated or shut off, even after 2 hours.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY!!</li>
            <li> UNABLE TO FIND REPLACEMENT BONNET WHEN NO LONGER SERVICABLE</li>
            <li> sorry I made this purchase and wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> This is so unfortunate.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, after turning it on for 3 minutes the dryer shut off,and did not come back on.</li>
            <li> Unit VERY poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> it really sucks!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really depressing to see the junk that is now for sale in our country...and depressing to see Amazon force this</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed, after waiting weeks for it to arrive and then finding it to be absolutely useless.....</li>
            <li> I am soo disappointed and angry</li>
            <li> The hose cinching feature is so badly designed that I ended up just cutting the thing out, so that it didn&#x27;t interfere with airflow.</li>
            <li> The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use.</li>
            <li> There was a mention of the product shutting off, but it was caviated with the point that this was a very unlikely possibility.  </li>
            <li> Very sorry that I bought this.  </li>
            <li> Bad, bad.</li>
            <li> If I was to get a call and get a refund, I am concerned about the bad reviews that I have seen for this product.</li>
            <li> Read all the bad reviews on this product...</li>
            <li> Too bad we can&#x27;t just buy the replacement bonnets.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the Bonnet and the way it connects to the hose.  </li>
            <li> you will certainly be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was Sooo disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Seller&#x27;s fault for not delivering as promised. :(</li>
            <li> Quality very poor, and when I tried it was worst.  </li>
            <li> It is so annoying.  </li>
            <li> But, this stupid hair bonnet dryer is the worst thing yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>
            <li> Its terrible.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is terrible, it shuts off continually.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is the worst dryer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Worst for me: the bonnet does NOT lock onto the air hose.</li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve bought through Amazon in...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used mine yet but my girlfriend has one and she loves it :)</li>
            <li> clumsy apparatis - I wanted more mobility - like multitacking and this is not set up to run with the flow - hose waned to stay on box and I wanted it to travel with me - my own problem - it was meant to be stable</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product I am enjoying it</li>
            <li> It is good but a bit weak i was expecting more from it</li>
            <li> I was happy I was able to find someone that still sells this hair dryer. I use to get it at JCPenneys but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. Thanks for having it available!</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t too many of the soft bonnet hairdryers available, so this is the one that I&#x27;ve had the most success with. I just wish it were easier to get replacement bonnets. I recently ordered 3 for the dryer that I already had, but the bonnets have been on &amp;#34;back order&amp;#34; for months, so I had to buy a whole new dryer.</li>
            <li> The locking mechanism on the hose is not stable enough to hold the hose securely. If I make a sudden move the hose pops off</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Not too loud. Works great! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The bonnet tore after three uses so that air flow was impeded.  After the tear, the air would not flow to the top of the bonnet.  I could not find a replacement bonnet when I searched online.</li>
            <li> It is great I can dry my hair while I put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Difficult to place on head.  Could use a waist strap for heating unit so it doesn&#x27;t keep falling off the table while putting on bonnet</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer strictly to use for deep conditioning my hair after reading the reviews that it didn&#x27;t work well for drying hair.  It worked beautifully for this the first two times I used it, I just hooked it up to use for the third time and it worked for about 15 seconds (I started on the cool setting) then shut off...I tried other outlets in case that was the issue.  It is a dead dryer.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Works great!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works fine as expected.  The only issue I have is that after you get the bonnet and tubing out of the case, you just can&#x27;t fit it back in easily.  I have tendonitis in my right hand so I can&#x27;t be trying to push and shove and push and shove to get it back in, so I just use a big heavy plastic zip up case that I have from another product bought years ago that I just put the whole hair dryer in and be done with it.</li>
            <li> Bonnet size is perfect. 20 minutes is enough to get my hair dry. It&#x27;s not noisy. It work very well and never turn off.  Bought it was a good decision. I use it while I watch TV or read.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it ripped around the hose attachement to the bonnet, and it would not stay attached when clicked closed to the bonnet. Terrible product!</li>
            <li> The dryer does not look very sturdy (inferior plastic) also when using dryer the cap became very soft and felt like it was melting.</li>
            <li> While awkward to keep the hair dryer upright and pretty (very) cheaply made, it does exactly what it is intended to do - dry my hair in rollers. I was torturing myself sleeping in rollers (yes, I&#x27;m old, I still use rollers!) so with this dryer, I wash, I roll, and 45 minutes under the dryer, bingo. Done. I sit and watch TV and although the dryer is too loud for hearing the TV, I put the closed captions on! How perfect is that? I almost bought the one that you sit under but I&#x27;m thrilled I got this. Portable enough to take anywhere. For the price and for the convenience, love it.</li>
            <li> Great, would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Had to return after the first time I used the Product, the hose burned off the bonnet connection was impossible to dry my hair with this product. Very loud and only dries one section of your head.</li>
            <li> I thought buying this product would be a good idea because it was small compact and I believed it would do the job. I was extremely disappointed, the only good thing about this product is the size, other than that it did not expand while I had it on and I had to hold it up so that the air can circulate, plus it didn&#x27;t get very hot. A complete waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> The reason that I got the bonnet hair dryer was so that I can dry my hair and have a little more flexibility to do more things while I was drying my hair and also dry my hair more quickly than sitting under a hooded dryer. I found that the bonnet in the dryer didn&#x27;t inflate as much as I expected it to. It just kind of sagged on my head...especially the front part. It also takes a longer time to dry my hair than when I was using my hooded dryer. I was a little disappointed. I&#x27;m conteplating returning it if I still can.</li>
            <li> The dryer overheats and shuts off and cannot be reset (You have to wait until it cools down on its own or only use it on a low heat setting); the tube that connects the bonnet is not very durable.  Conair could do better - my last two Conair dryers have not lasted.  I can&#x27;t recommend this item.   (And note - I bought this unit from a store, not Amazon, so Conair cannot blame their lack of quality on Amazon)</li>
            <li> This would be a great product if the bonnet attached to the hose more securely.</li>
            <li> Not exactly salon quality, but didn&#x27;t really expect it to be for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super light weight and doesn&#x27;t take up much room&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Bonnet is large so will accommodate all size rollers&lt;br /&gt;The hose can be extended and/or retracted to the length desired and then locked into place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Snapping the hose to the bonnet isn&#x27;t as easy as it should be&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t heat the front of your hair like the back and middle&lt;br /&gt;Hose gets HOT so be careful if wearing a tank or drape a towel over your back&lt;br /&gt;LOUD! But was great for pretending I couldn&#x27;t hear the hubby</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to buy a big hair dryer. All I use it for is when I deep condition my hair nothing more because I&#x27;m natural. This is a must buy and plus its easy for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer hoping I could just sit in front of my computer, TV, or book and just let it dry my hair on its own.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  First off, my hair is long and thick so maybe it was just that my hair was too thick for it to dry completely.  But, still, I even left this thing on my head overnight and my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dry in the morning.  I occasionally had issues with it shutting off automatically like others have noted, but my primary issue was that it didn&#x27;t dry my hair well at all.  Good idea, poor execution.  I would look to another hair bonnet for your hair drying needs.</li>
            <li> Hair dyer works great for it&#x27;s size. It doesnt over heat like some customers say it does. Works great for condisioning and dying hair. Only drawback I see is it&#x27;s hard getting everything back into the case</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the Bonnet and the way it connects to the hose.  The Bonnet is extremely small for a large bonnet and it is very hard to attach the hose to the bonnet.    I have started to use my old hair dryer although the bonnet is torn and the high setting no longer works.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this a long time. I was grateful to find one.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002G214U Conair SB1X Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer]]    Believe  the other reviews.  This dryer quit mid drying--the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I like that I can sit in my bed and dry my hair, but it&#x27;s a little (just a little) uncomfortable.  If it had a longer hose and if the storage compartment had instructions on how to place it back inside it would be spectacular.  Also, I shopped around for this product. I went to several beauty supply stores and they were mucho expensive.  This was the right price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it so I could give my hair hot oil treatments and it has been great. Heat distributes throughout cap and it&#x27;s easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> I like the bonnet for the compact convenience. But it&#x27;s only good if you are deep conditioning your hair. If you intend to dry your hair, get a real hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I have always had these type of dryers I perfer them. But this one the bonnet is not big enough and this one does not get the heat out as well. If I could I would send it back.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time. No problems are noted so far. I mainly use it for deep conditioning and to speed up the drying process of twist outs. Recently I used the brush attachment to blow out my hair. I used both high and low settings. It worked amazingly. If your a natural, you definitely should own this product. It has surely put some smiles on my face!</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES THE SOFT BONNET HAIR DRYER. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. RICHARD</li>
            <li> This dryer shuts off constantly.  It is so annoying.  Years ago when I bought hair dryers I never had this problem.  These days their making junk products that are simply a waste of money.  Do not buy this product you will certainly be disappointed.  I have very long here so normally it takes one hour to dry it and with this piece of junk shutting off constantly, it takes even longer.  The cost to ship it back makes no sense so I just have to take the lose.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my elderly mother.&lt;br /&gt;She and others have tried to use it but&lt;br /&gt;the hose keeps coming detached from the&lt;br /&gt;bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this product again&lt;br /&gt;or recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because I did not enjoy sitting under my overhead dryer. I have very thick hair and it would take me up to 2 hours or more sitting in one position while being very conscious to not slouch. The Conair SB1 Bonnet Hair Dryer allows me to be more flexible with where I can dry my hair. Before I would have to be seated near a table only. Now I can sit on the couch or even lay on the bed. I have put this on and taken a nap while it dried my hair. It can be a bit uncomfortable since the hose gets hot after sometime and will touch your skin, so it does require some adjustment there. The benefits though were worth it to me. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has long hair drying times and would like to be able to sit at their PC or watch TV or just have their hair dry while they take a nap or go to bed at night.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for my mother for a Christmas present (in &#x27;09) and it quit working in January!  She uses a hair dryer about once a week, so that&#x27;s pretty darn bad!  I want my money back!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer recently and was totally dissatisfied. It was very difficult to open the plastic case that housed the bonnet and hose. The dryer turned itself off periodically throughout operation. Save yourself frustation and buy a more expensive model!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a few months ago because I wanted a soft bonnet dryer to replace my old dryer. The price seemed reasonable. I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting.  At least their&#x27;s restarted. My unit just died on me while drying my hair. I was never able to get it restarted. I had owned the unit for only a few months so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return. The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use. The space was too small to accomodate everything. The medium setting tended to be very hot. I wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing. I am now stuck without a hair dryer at home. This item was a complete waste of money. Please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bonnet hair dryer at a fabulous price and overall, it meets my needs.  It heats up very quickly and is quite powerful for such a compact size. Mine does not shut off automatically, as some have stated. The only complaint that I have is the bonnet would not fit over my rollers, no matter what I did to adjust it.  I ended up having to use the bonnet from my old Lazy Dazy dryer. The hose is also a bit difficult to wind up and store in the unit. By the way, Conair is very good at replacing defective products if you contact a customer service supervisor by phone.  I love this compact hair dryer!</li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed was how small and crammed the case was. It was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something. &lt;br /&gt;The other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was.  The bonnnet was difficult to get on, mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place, and kept pulling the bonnet off my head. &lt;br /&gt;After a couple of trys and reading the instructions, I knew I would never use it, simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head. &lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this product should be demoted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok feels like a toy and the bonnet won&#x27;t stay connected to dryer</li>
            <li> Used it yesterday for the first time.  Like the fact that it is compact and seems powerful but did not like the fact that the space provided to store the power cord, bonnet and hose is so small it is cramped in there.  Also, when the hose and power cord are out while using, the door of the cubby stays open as no concessions were made for the hose and cord to stay out and the door to close.  Still not 100% sure but we&#x27;ll see.  Not many hair dryers available out there.</li>
            <li> everything i expected ...works great superior hair dryer for the price,the bonnet inflates properly and has great drying speeds i would recomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> After reading all the other reviews, several times, I decided to go with the Conair.  I use it at least three times a week and it works perfectly.  To be of help to someone else here I will say that I have fine, thin hair and use a smaller roller and with hair wet, it takes about 45 minutes to dry.  So far...so good but it&#x27;s only been about a month and in this throw away, made in China society, time will tell.</li>
            <li> Nots as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it to condition my hair. Light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice light and portable, beats using a hard bonnet . it removes the restrictions from your neck, you can sit our slouch comfortably while drying your hair.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my Mom for Christmas...it&#x27;s what she wanted!  Anyway, I have noticed her hair looking more full lately.  And she absolutely loves the stupid thing!  My sister and I got a big laugh out of it when she asked for it, but what Mom wants Mom gets!</li>
            <li> I was not too sure about this with all the other reviews, but I bought it anyway. Well I&#x27;m so glad I did, this works great for me. I have medium hair about shoulder length. I put it on medium and it dried my hair with curlers. It never shut off, in fact it was a bit warm. I don&#x27;t know if the other people got defective ones, but mine works just fine. Good luck to anyone else who buys it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about 8 months and use it almost every day. I absolutely love it. I too found it difficult to get my shoulder length hair dry in a reasonable amount of time. I found the trick is to dry my hair with a blow dryer till just damp, roll it in my velcro rollers, then use the bonnet dryer while putting on my make-up (about 10 minutes). I put the hose away while it&#x27;s still warm so it scrunches up easily and fits back in the unit. I wait just a minute or two til my hair cools then pull the rollers out and style. Hold nice volume all day long. I&#x27;ve never had it overheat or turn off on me (knock on wood). I&#x27;ll by another one when this one dies!</li>
            <li> I use this to straighten my hair. I love that it is portable, and I can pretty much sit anywhere to dry my hair, which takes about an hour to do. It will overheat if you do not make sure the air vent is not blocked by anything. I have had this for years and use it weekly. I definitely will buy it again if I it ever breaks.</li>
            <li> love it i was gonna get the hard blowdryer glad i didn&#x27;t I&#x27;m lockn my boyfriends hair and when im done blowdrying it he looks awesome. however the attachment piece from the bonnet to the machine falls out from time to time and you have to plug it back in other then that love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the value; but bonnet pulls with the weight of the hose and drying time is not as fast as with an upright dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought it to dry my hair while I applied make-up, kill two birds with one stone, but my hair is still wet and requires a regular blow dryer.  It does speed up the regular drying but not as much as I hoped.  If you have hair of any length and expect this to dry your hair completly, you better have an hour.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good review of this product. &lt;br /&gt;Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I really like the Conair hair dryer. It doesn&#x27;t limit my movements when I have the bonnet on. I can do other things like read, or use my computer because the heat isn&#x27;t coming down on my neck and my ears. I do with that the bonnet was larger though, because I use big rollers and it is a hassle putting on the bonnet.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a neighborhood power outage.  I like to set my hair after shampooing and go to sleep.   My hair is long and thick so I set the temp on \\&quot;High\\&quot;.  The Conair Soft Bonnet just shut off without warning which woke me up.  I had to wait more than 5 minutes before I could start it again and still ended up sleeping with damp hair.  This has happened too many times.  I should have read some reviews first which would have helped my damp locks and saved me some money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I love it come right on time for my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m frustating too. I bougth this one the last year, and yet I can&#x27;t dry my hair one time. Its terrible. Bad, bad. Dont have power.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be smaller and more compact.  Much too big for travel.  I was better of with a simple blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Had a very old bonnet hair dryer that is about shot. Had to find a replacement and this Conair is it.  Great for vacations and home use. Easy to use and works well especially when you use rollers to curl your hair like I do.</li>
            <li> This product does not blow (hot air) it sucks big time. Never again will I attempt to purchase another conair product without reading the reviews first.How could conair continue selling this garbage when it is clearly a defective item. I even attempted to use it on cool and not even that worked. After sitting there for one and a half hours of it turning on for only perhaps only 2 minutes at a time I finally gave up, frustrated and with my hair still wet.                                                 wet and mad</li>
            <li> I hope that I do not have to give this item a star; it does not deserve even one.  Apparently Amazon requires at least one star.  Please ignore the star. I found it very difficult to use because the hose is so short and the unit is so light weight.  I think I could generate more drying power if I could find someone to blow through a straw.</li>
            <li> It is a nice unit. Compact and easy to use but it takes a long time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with me especially I have short hair. The only weakness of this product is the hot air has a hard time to flow to the top of my hair.I have to pull the bonnet up high on my head to the upper hair to dry. However, I cannot style my hair without this machine any more because this one works very well and save time.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer only works for 10 minutes before it shuts off, and you have to wait 20 minutes before it will start up again. Conair says they have had no such problems with the dryer and blamed the source that Amazon obtained them from.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;They said I could return it for a refund but will have to pay the cost myself of shipping it back.</li>
            <li> I love to wash my hair and to be able to pop the couch and just relax instead of holding the dryer up great product next time try to make one a little quieted</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purhcased this dryer. It still stops in the middle of drying my hair. I refused to return it again.</li>
            <li> This dryer is like a toy. Not much heat. Not much power. I wanted it to use it for heat conditioning. I was not satisfied</li>
            <li> I love my hairdryer thank you</li>
            <li> Great for home hair do</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer I was using by Hot Tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers.  After using about 5 times it stopped working.  I will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable.  The temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint. I ended up purchasing another Hot Tools Dryer, a little more money but worth the price in the long run.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair with no problem, but the cords are on the short side.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked great the few times I used it but I should have heeded what others wrote here.  The bonnet is very cheap and became unusable after only a few times of use.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find instructions on how to open the darn thing, had to pry open the lid and wasn&#x27;t sure if I was just breaking it before I used it.  And forget about poking everything back in afterward.  I have tried this dryer 3 times and never gotten my hair dry.  The wattage doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough to completely fill the bonnett and circulate hot air evenly. I am not generally a complainer, but I can&#x27;t believe Conair put their name on this piece of junk.  I would send it back if I hadn&#x27;t tried to use it.  But, to be fair, I have long thick hair, so it might work ok on somebody else.  I totally wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is terrible, it shuts off continually. I have thick hair and when using curlers this means several hours under the dryer. Makes for a very frustrating time when I finally give up and my curly hair is still wet. I have tried everything to keep the darn thing going; different plugs, elevation, putting it on a baking rack to keep air space under it in case it is over-heating. I wish I had kept all my bits of paper, I&#x27;d send the dryer back to get a refund. Conair ought to be ashamed of themselves!</li>
            <li> Nice,  very portable, compact, light weight hair dryer.  Perfect for home, dorm or travel (will easily fit into a suitcase).</li>
            <li> I adapted this unit to a homemade dryer cabinet for small parts. I run it for a half hour at a time and it works just fine. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is light weigh and stores all accessories inside the case. It works well except the hose is hard to attach to the bonnet</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM&lt;br /&gt;SHE SEARCHED ON-LINE AND FOUND THIS ONE&lt;br /&gt;IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING FOR&lt;br /&gt;WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> i got this for my mother, her old one is going bad, she was so happy when i got it for her birthday. she&#x27;s very happy with the product. thank you</li>
            <li> The dryer has the tendency to shut off after a few minutes of use because it gets too hot.  The other problem is the hose.  You have to force the hose back inside the case after use and what happened to mine the coils inside the hose broke which made the hose collapse preventing the air from flowing through properly.  It looks good but there are alot of flaws in the design.</li>
            <li> great buy. i am happy with it. Thank Jesus. it works great. one of the few stuff i have bought online with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Loved this.  Big enough for the rollers and I have long, thick hair.  Hot enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!  My hair is so thick that it takes forever to dry and having to sit in one spot under a hooded dryer was painful!  But not with this one!  I love being able to move around.  And it dried my hair perfectly.  It was so easy to put together and take apart. Best of all, It&#x27;s so compact that I don&#x27;t even notice it when stored in the back of the closet, unlike the old hooded style.</li>
            <li> I had been looking all over the internet for a hair dryer like this one. All I could find were caps with a hose to attach to my hand held dryer. Thank Goodness Amazon had what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It came apart from the hose and bonnet. It&#x27;s a little flimsy but you can make it work if you are in a pinch.</li>
            <li> This dryer is a total waste of time and money; it shuts off constantly, so it takes forever to dry your hair. I wish I had read the other reviews before I wasted the money. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I needed a bonnet dryer to set my daughter&#x27;s hair for graduation this worked wonderfully, the gently heat did not disturb the curls and was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I almost bought the hood attachment (different brand), but opted for this one instead as it is the better value... blow dryer, hood and brush attachment in one box! I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the device shutting off, so no complaints there! Maybe try using it on a counter?</li>
            <li> The Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is exactly what I was looking.  I had an old one that I loved but I used it so much, I had to get a new one.  One thing I can say is that my old one last a very long time.  I know that I will enjoy my Soft Bonnet Hair Bonnet Dryer for years to come.  I highly recommend this hair dryer to everyone who likes to relax while getting their hair dry.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well, although the bonnet hose twists too easily. It ended up overheating and shutting down for a few minutes.  Finally started again and finished the job.</li>
            <li> I had wanted a hair dryer for xmas which I got. I was so happy that way I didn&#x27;t have to be under a hooded hair dryer. Well every time I have used it and it&#x27;s not many, I put the hair dryer on medium heat and it will be okay for a couple of minutes, 5 minutes and automatically shut off. What the hell. Now I have curlers in my hair and this thing decides to shut off when it feels like. This is going straight back to the store. This is the worst hair dryer.  &lt;br /&gt;                    Signed wet hair.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks and the motor made tons of noise and then stopped.  It did not work well from the beginning and the motor got worse with each use. I used it about 10 times. I was Sooo disappointed.  At the price it was not worth returning..I dumped it.... what a waste of money . I am so upset with this conair product.. You get what you pay for. THe plus is the bonnet was soft...I kept the bonnet and threw out the dryer.</li>
            <li> Second time buying this item because I wore the first one out. Love it.</li>
            <li> The best. doesn&#x27;t burn ur ears dries effectivly if it ever stops working im coming back to u for anotherone.. I luvv it I luvv it</li>
            <li> Never got a chance to dry my hair completly because the dryer stops abruptly within 5 min of usage and continues to abruptly stop every 10- 15 min.  It cuts back on in about 10 min after it cools. Such an inconvience.</li>
            <li> Dryer works as intended and is more useful than a salon style dryer in that it&#x27;s portable.  I also think using a bonnet as opposed to salon style dryer is more efficient in drying the hair due to creating a closed hair-drying environment.  However, that&#x27;s just my opinion; I don&#x27;t have anything to prove that.  The only negative that I have relative to bonnet style dryer is -- from experience -- the bonnet wears/tears up before the dryer breaks and I haven&#x27;t been able to get replacement bonnets.</li>
            <li> Perfect little dyer.........I dry with my handheld blow dryer till my hairs just damp, then I set it, put on the bonnet, turn it on hi, put on make-up and the hairs ready.   I even rigged it to a little belt, so I could iron a shirt while my hair was drying.  It worked.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T REALLY GET HOT ENOUGH FOR ETHNIC HAIR. PROBABLY WOULD WORK FINE FOR SOMEONE WITH REALLY THIN HAIR</li>
            <li> Used this to bleach my roots at home. I&#x27;m a professional hairdresser but I do not have the time nor the money to buy a professional hooded salon dryer for use maybe 4-5 times a month. Perfect for my clients that can&#x27;t come to the salon anymore. (I only have 2 that can&#x27;t make it up stairs anymore) I can still do their usual wet sets weekly without having to drag them to the salon. So far it&#x27;s not bad. I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews. It&#x27;s 20$!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read some reviews stating this dryer had issues...but, I bought it anyway.  I have no problems with the hose falling out or it not getting hot enough.  Works great.  My only problem is that I had jumbo rollers in and the bonnet&#x27;s opening was not large enough to easily get my head in without loosening the rollers in the process.  Next time, I&#x27;ll just use smaller ones.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is not quite big enough for large rollers, so the heat does not circulate well.  I&#x27;m still looking for the old-fashioned hat box dryers that I had in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> First unit shipped had its case broken.  Second unit super and works well.  We had looked for this device for a long time.  We ran our of finding old units at rummage sales etc.</li>
            <li> Great service, shipped and arrived on time. Have used the product before and am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> works well. Delivered in good quality. Helpful for people with disability, or trying to heat hair or head for longer period of time. Several temperature control.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair!!! I love that it has the cool setting perfect for women transitioning to natural hair or that are already natural.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of not sitting in one spot. But the front part of my hair never dries but the back and sides dries in no time at all.</li>
            <li> my wife remembers her teenage days when this was all the rave ...now she uses it after shampooing and is extremely happy ...she swears this was the best product for the job and at a great price ...if you want to get something for the missus...this is it, you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> The hose and bonnet  does not  stay connected  . It needs to have  way to lock it in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be under there forever and when I get out my hair is still not dry. Maybe it&#x27;s my hair but I&#x27;m nor 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> This dryer is great for travel and plus to be light-weight it gets pretty hot. I love its compact size. The only thing I did not like about the dryer was the storage department. It was hard to get the all the attachments back in to the storage area.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to see that it is hard to put away in case and I would like a way to talk to someone on the shipping for $19.99 and it took almost 5 days to get, I WON&#x27;T BE ORDERING AGAIN. If I was to get a call and get a refund, I am concerned about the bad reviews that I have seen for this product.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer does nothing to your hair but leave it frizzy and not completely dry!!!!  And it constantly cuts off - this started on the second use so the vent could not have been clogged enough to cause this.  Invest in a nicer dryer if you want your hair to look right!!!!  I am definitely going to try to return mine to the store...it really sucks!!!</li>
            <li> Read all the bad reviews on this product...they are all true.  Conair should be sued!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great. My 86 year old mom can&#x27;t get to the salon much any more so this works for her hair needs.</li>
            <li> This Bonnet does the job.</li>
            <li> At first I was with everyone else on the thing not staying in place and repeatedly falling out. I figured out that it has to be locked. If you twist it hard enough, it locks in place. I can now move freely and don&#x27;t have to keep still thinking the hose will fall out, cause it won&#x27;t....So this is a great product. Used it to deep condition my hair and I have no complaints. The brush attachment serves no purpose though, but it did feel good on my scalp when used as a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I think this is great for travel and at home.  You just sit and get your hair dryed and device is small enough to walk around with.</li>
            <li> This unit would be perfect but for the fact that if it stays on the highest heat setting for more than 15-20 minutes, it shuts off.  Sometimes it shuts off after only 5 minutes if not \\&quot;warmed up\\&quot; first on a lower setting.  I read the product instructions backwards and forwards, and none of this was mentioned.  There was a mention of the product shutting off, but it was caviated with the point that this was a very unlikely possibility.  Well, I use the product twice a week--once on high for a deep conditioning, and then immediately after for a wet set on a lower setting--and it shuts off twice a week.  It just elongates an already lengthy process.  Extremely frustrating.</li>
            <li> This product is a nightmare! The bonnet refused to completely fill with air and the hose is stiff and not long enough. The bonnet is also made of tissue thin plastic and if the unit would work correctly, the bonnet would most likely not even last a year&#x27;s worth of use. I patched the hose on my 23 year old general electric hair dryer{which is still working} and decided to deep six the piece of junk!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> An excellent product. It is very efficient, and, packable! Just what I needed for travel and days I need a fast set. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer, but i don&#x27;t like the fact that the bonnet doesn&#x27;t stay puffed up with air as it dries your hair. the \\&quot;high\\&quot; choice of hot air does not give off extremely hot air as many dryers do, and this is a plus for me. i don&#x27;t like to get scalded while i&#x27;m drying my hair.</li>
            <li> would give it a 0 if i could&lt;br /&gt;bonnet had a hole in it, and the air just doesnt seem to get through. this is a cheap product--make the investment!</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for. It barely lasted outside the warranty period; spend the extra $; it&#x27;s worth it it</li>
            <li> it works but it&#x27;s not particularly comfortable and could be a lot quieter.  Not much available in the way of alternatives (hooded dryer) though so this might just be the best of a bad bunch.</li>
            <li> Loud and inconsistent, but inexpensive. I&#x27;m always torn when I feel like a product is a good deal for its price, but is still lacking. The bonnet on this is shameful -- it is too thin, inflexible, easily torn and cannot be replaced when it inevitable tears. The hose cinching feature is so badly designed that I ended up just cutting the thing out, so that it didn&#x27;t interfere with airflow. The motor cycles at seemingly random moments, but has never overheated or shut off, even after 2 hours. the air intake is in the back, which allows the unit to be ok when sitting on a bed or chair (not possible with bottom intake models).  I really like the fact that it only draws 400 watts, and still puts out a decent quantity of air, but the terrible bonnet means I will be looking elsewhere when it&#x27;s time to replace this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clarify -- the unit occasionally screeches or whines, and that is very NOISY. You never know when it,s gonna happen, or when it will seem to just get warmer despite the heat setting being unchanged. Hence my initial description as loud and inconsistent.</li>
            <li> I can set my hair and fall asleep while drying with this hair dryer, It&#x27;s everything I was looking for and more. Perfect for get sets and tight curls.</li>
            <li> This bonnet hair dryer fills the bill.  It dried my hair in no time flat with the bonnet and when I used the dryer wand brush attachment it made my hair very silky.  The one thing I wish is that the bonnet were a bit larger, but all in all it exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> A great lightweight product, easily stored on a shelf.  I bought it to heat process my hair color, and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> processed hair benefits GREATLY from salon deep conditioning and this is a great home alternative. gets super hot if you need it, also allows home hair coloring that requires heat.  love it.</li>
            <li> my mom is 99 and after i do her hair i can set it and use this fantastic little dryer for her  the only thing I dont like is the hose keeps falling off easily from the cap  it would be better if it twisted on like a jar top</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have enough watts waste of time to curl hair</li>
            <li> So convenient for me to do other things while drying my hair without having to lug one of the self standing one around</li>
            <li> appliance is great, however, customer should be able to purchase a bonnet to replace original bonnet when damaged.  Instead or purchasing a whole hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I first received this dryer.  But after struggling with it I now realize it is a bust.  The flexible tube fits into the bonnet with such a tiny turn that it is impossible to keep the tube there.  You must hold onto the tube or it falls out.  And it gets so hot it is difficult to hold.  I thought it  would get easier to use after a few tries but it is hopeless.  I hope no one else gets conned into buying this.  If it hadn&#x27;t been for struggling with some surgery I would have returned this long ago.</li>
            <li> Good, Handy. Easy to use. Small enough to put in suitcase when traveling. Takes up very little space when storing..</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet. The packaging is great and compare to the price I have seen for the same make and model it is good.</li>
            <li> I have sister locs, I used the dyer to rod my hair and it worked great. It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is very handy for deep hair conditioning. I do find it a little hard to get the tubing and such back in the carrier though that detracts nothing from it usefulness. I like that it doesn&#x27;t get so hot it burns your ears or scalp.</li>
            <li> I can truly say, this soft bonnet hair dyer makes my life so much easier!  I hate sitting under the traditional dryer especially since I have back problems, but since I bought this dyer it has allowed me to have that flexibility of moving around and not staying in one position for two long!!!!</li>
            <li> Its great, I can sit in any room of my house and still use as a sit under dryer or use as just a regular blow dryer. I love it</li>
            <li> This Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is a great product and purchasing this will save you money from going to the salon. This is a great Birthday, Mother day &amp; Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily as a heat source for conditioning my hair and it works very well. Have not used it to dry my hair, but I think it would get that job done also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this kind of hairdryer for months and Conair and Amazon came through for me.  Others in my retirement center building were also impressed.  I&#x27;m glad I can order good products like this through an online website since I no longer have a car.</li>
            <li> When you don&#x27;t feel like itting under a dryer or blw drying your hair this is what you need. I can carry it around the house whille it drys your hair.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer for use with the big curlers. A longer hose would have been good. It holds you hostage while you dry.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This Hair Dryer works good taks aboud  45 min to dry your Hair Perfect</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a small and powerful hair dryer that would do the job and I could put away with out taking to much room.  In this Conair Bonnet Hair Dryer I found it. It&#x27;s small, sleek and powerful.  Love this Hair dryer and been using for 3 month and had no problem with it. Plus could not beat the great price I got it here!</li>
            <li> I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCTS FIRST...I KNOW NOW....  THE SHUTTING OFF, I PURCHASED IN JULY, FIRST TIME USED WAS YESTERDAY OH WAS TICKED OFF...      4-13-11 I STILL HAVE IT....STILL SHUTS OFF...GETTING READY TO ORDER ANOTHER DRYER BY CONAIR, BUT IT DOES HAVE 4 1/2 STARS...IT&#x27;S NOT THE SOFT BONNET BUT THE HARD COLLASPABLE BONNET WELL SEE WHAT HAPPENS, WILL LET YOU KNOW....</li>
            <li> I used this dryer maybe 10 times tops.&lt;br /&gt;It burned out on me.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for the price. will get a bit more expensive one this time.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with products sad that it didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s the old school type, but the bonnet is way to thin, it didn&#x27;t last long.. so I still can&#x27;t use it now.</li>
            <li> The article was defective.  The air tube is supposed to snap into the unit and lock but it did not do this.  I had to tape it.</li>
            <li> I have used this model for many years. When one wares out I buy another. It does not last supper long, but works well for me at a very reasonable price. From experience, it works as well as anything else in this style and price range. I hope they never stop making this model.</li>
            <li> I love this as it never gets too hot and of course it&#x27;s fairly portable.  I can do things in the kitchen as I dry my hair.  It&#x27;s nice that it has a brush attachment as well, like that a lot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer, but not through Amazon so it cannot be blamed on the company that supplies Amazon as one review indicated the company claimed. It is the worst dryer I have ever owned.  I purchased it during the Christmas holiday, and was only able to use it 3 times before it started having problems.  Once it would not start at all.  The next time it heated for about 10 minutes then shut off.  It&#x27;s very hard to replace everything that needs to go in the storage area.  Very sorry that I bought this.  The reason I saw the reviews is because I am already looking for a new dryer 4 months after purchasing this model.</li>
            <li> I have not yet used the product although i love the size of it so that&#x27;s why i gave it the high mark</li>
            <li> The head set is cord area already worn out</li>
            <li> Its not as good as the ones in the hair salons but it does the job. I have long curly hair and I&#x27;m under the dryer for about 70 minutes. Only negative is that its very loud. I get banished to another room when drying my hair as to not disturb the rest of my family.</li>
            <li> The item came quickly and worked perfectly. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> The bonnet hair dryer is fabulous💐.  It&#x27;s so lightweight.  I can dry my curls and read a book in ease. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> hair dryer is compact.you are able to do other task will drying your hair.gets hot fast and able to dry  your hair in a short period of time</li>
            <li> The hose falls off the cap a lot. It is easy to store and travel with. The hose is hard to get to stay on the cap. It keeps falling off.  Took about 5-7 minutes to get it to the point where it stays on the cap. Hose is short too.</li>
            <li> The bonnet provides the options for deep conditioning.  This item is packed and ready to travel the world with my daughter.  Lightweight and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s more comfortable that the one one I previously had. Easy to use. At least I can lay down.</li>
            <li> Takes quite some time to dry longer hair.</li>
            <li> I should have paid attention to the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The bonnet is adequate in size but the drawstring on the bonnet is so short that you can&#x27;t expand the bonnet to a reasonable size to fit over curlers.  The bonnet connection to the hose doesn&#x27;t fit securely so it is a juggling act to get the too tight bonnet on without disconnecting from the hose.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to go shopping and find a dryer comparable to the Hot Tools unit that I have had for several yrs.  The bonnet finally tore but I have had 8 yrs of good use and the dryer unit is still going strong.  Too bad we can&#x27;t just buy the replacement bonnets.</li>
            <li> Had this item for 3 months and have only used it 5 times and it broke.  Not happy that of course it lasted through the return policy and now I&#x27;m stuck with a broken hair dryer......NOT HAPPY!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Had great hopes that this dryer would fit the bill for my kids.  Wanted to dry their hair without deafening them with the noise from a regular \\&quot;gun\\&quot; style hairdryer.  My folks dried my hair like this when I was a kid (okay 35 years ago).    Had only used this dryer on 3-4 occasions when the power switch failed to turn the dryer on anymore.  Have fiddled with the switch a bit, jiggled it a bit, all with no luck.  Will need to see if there&#x27;s some way I can return it.  Haven&#x27;t had it for a year yet.    On the plus side, I&#x27;m saving the earth by not using electricity I suppose.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer worked for all of about 5 minutes before blowing out.  even when it did work i had to unplug all the appliances in the room just to get it to run for 15 minutes.  the drying is inconsistent because the air flow through the bonnet is  crappy. i would rather subject my hair to heat damage by blow drying than to use this again</li>
            <li> Very convenient hair dryer</li>
            <li> I thought I had found the exact item I needed to fix my 87 year old mother-in-law&#x27;s hair at home since she can&#x27;t get out to go to the salon.  Well......there is a major flaw with this hair dryer.  The hose will not stay connected to the bonnet.  If she holds her head perfectly still, we can get through the drying but that just isn&#x27;t possible for someone who has to change positions once in a while.  I would not purchase this item again.  Wish I had the paperwork where I could return it.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer I remember my mom had one lol</li>
            <li> Love the hair dryer because I can sleep with it. The different heat settings help, although the high gets too hot to lay down with, there is a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting and it works just fine. The hose may fall off sometimes depending on the way you lay down with it but other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> I heard about this type of product through word of mouth. I was speaking to a co-worker about hair care. She told me she uses this type of product for deep conditioning. I didn&#x27;t know this type of product existed prior to our conversation. I compared prices between this product and the Leila Ali version. I purchased this version because it was the cheapest of the two. I read the reviews after the purchased, and was disappointed because most of them were negative. People were saying that it only lasted for ten minutes. Contrarily,  the product last as long as I want. However, I have not been successful with roller sets.  I just realized that it has a drawstring on my third use. My roller sets might not have came out the way I wanted because I did not adjust the drawstring and because I need smaller rollers. Other than that, its great for deep conditioning and hot oil treatments. I will try once more for a roller set. I will be content with this product even if my next roller set is unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> I  love this dryer. I recommend this dryer to other customers. This is my second Conair my bonnet worn out.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Downfall is the bonnet connection keeps popping off so you must keep reattaching it.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and portable. This dryer has the perfect temperature settings and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t. the biggest thing is that it just doesn&#x27;t dry. i put it on and then take my sweet time putting on makeup so that this thing has plenty of time to do its thing, but my hair comes out about as wet as if i&#x27;d wrapped it in a microfiber towel for a few minutes (which is to say, maybe 10 percent dry--not dripping, but definitely wet and not damp). there are other things i don&#x27;t like about it, such as the hose doesn&#x27;t fasten to the cap, just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything, which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose doesn&#x27;t fall out of the cap; or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time. for now, i&#x27;ll stick with my hard-bonnet dryer on a floor stand. doesn&#x27;t allow for much mobility, but it&#x27;s way more effective at actually drying.</li>
            <li> I expected to be able to actually use this bonnet dryer to &amp;#34;Set&amp;#34; my hair for quick styling. This bonnet dryer is not very powerful and probably should only be considered when doing conditioner treatments to your hair. it gets warm enough for conditioning treatments, but not for setting/drying a style in place.</li>
            <li> Was for my mother who has always used one.  It worked wonderfully for her.  She liked the settings for heat control.  That was a big concern for her.</li>
            <li> UNABLE TO FIND REPLACEMENT BONNET WHEN NO LONGER SERVICABLE</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful dryer. It gets very hot and dries my hair quickly. The connection of the hose to the dryer was a little tricky but once I learned you need to push the hose firmly and twist it snapped on and stayed on. Like anything you buy it never goes back in the box like it comes out but I got it figured it out good enough for me. I would recommend it to any one.</li>
            <li> one of the best products on the market. Conair has been one of my go to products for my styling needs over the years</li>
            <li> ALL WOMEN SHOULD HAVE ONE. EASY TO CARRY ON VACATION OR JUST FOR AN OVERNIGHT VISIT. WORKS GREAT :)</li>
            <li> After few minutes on , shut off , and it seen not to blow enough hot air to dry the hair. And, the attachments are not good quality.</li>
            <li> The poor reviews for this product really surprised me. I&#x27;ve had my Conair for years, and although I don&#x27;t use it often, I have never had any trouble with it at all. The biggest problem I&#x27;ve had is getting the bonnet over some larger rollers. My unit heats up and dries hair beautifully.  Also, it&#x27;s small and light weight so it&#x27;s very easy to store.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t get hot enough after using it for an hour I had to get under my sit under dryer to finish drying my hair.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is fine but the bonnet is too small it knocks the rollers off your head when trying to put it on.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  The first just wore out.  Need to be careful to make sure the tubing is not crunched up, but otherwise have had no problem with it.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I have had Conair soft bonnet hair dryers in the past with great success. This one performs ok with the one exception that the bonnet is not as large as in previous products. I have long hair and I use large rollers. I find that getting the bonnet over these rollers is a little more difficult. I also have to put a towel around the back of my neck to avoid excessive heat near the hose connection.</li>
            <li> For mom and it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having to shop for another hair dryer since this one is so poorly made.  The hose barely connects to the bonnet and any slight movement will cause it to detach so you basically can&#x27;t  move your head while using it.  It&#x27;s also difficult to get back in the case.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry I made this purchase and wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Had a hard hood dryer for over 10 year. Yes it worked great..donated it to my neighbor.. this software bonnet puts the heat in all the right areas of your head. Light weight. go too the Landry room and fold clothes while on my head.&lt;br /&gt;Lol..Yes I do plug it in there</li>
            <li> The item is working well, but the quality is not good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight plastic and noisy, but they all seem to be more noisy.</li>
            <li> All of the settings are the same .....H-O-T, (real)  HOT?!!!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use it as a bonnet dryer because it burns my head....its a total waste of money.....I am so disappointed, after waiting weeks for it to arrive and then finding it to be absolutely useless.....I seriously wish I had not bothered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older style Sunbeam and General Electric models that were around years ago as Bonnet Hairdryers, were vastly superior to this horrible cheap and nasty Version!</li>
            <li> Works great and it is nice and compact.</li>
            <li> THIS DRYER IS OK. YOU JUST HAVE TO TURN THE HOSE AROUND TO DRY THE TOP OF YOUR HAIR. I HAVE HAD A HARD TIME LOCKING THE HOSE ON THE BONNET.</li>
            <li> the hose does not stay attached to the bonnet well. if you move it falls out, although the dryer itself is good.</li>
            <li> The poorly designed hose attachment to the bonnet often comes undone in spite of repeated attempts to seat and fasten it.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I could have read reviews on this product before I bought it.  &lt;br /&gt;It was very difficult to put back into its case.  &lt;br /&gt;I only used it a few times. The last time it just shut off and never would start again. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received the product in very good time. Price was quite attractive. There aren&#x27;t many \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; bonnet hair dryers around anymore. This one replaces a decades old GE unit that developed severe rattles and then terminal switch failure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My wife really likes the compact size, relatively low noise, comfort of the product and storage of the tube and bonnet inside the unit&#x27;s case. I&#x27;d give the style designer a big \\&quot;attaboy\\&quot;. The unit is much easier to store away than the old one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment was that she wishes the unit had one more lower heat option; she gets pretty warm even at low heat. However, she may be happier when our good old Wisconsin winter setles in and the house is a little cooler.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product without reading other reviews first.  Wish I had because these ladies are dead on.  The dryer cuts off as soon as it starts to get hot.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  It&#x27;s Saturday.  My hair is wet and set, and I&#x27;m left without a dryer.  I&#x27;ve tried three times: twice on high and once on medium setting.  I&#x27;m sending this back right away.  Amazon don&#x27;t let Conair blame this on you.  This model is DEFECTIVE!</li>
            <li> I like a soft bonnet hair drier, because it drys my hair softly not harshly as hand held dryers do.  And it leaves my hands free to do other things.  This particular one is compact and when everything is packed away, takes up little shelf space.  It is very sturdy too and I really like the long hose.</li>
            <li> I was excited to finally use this a year or so after purchase only to discover the bonnet wasn&#x27;t in the box and I can&#x27;t find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse,  I didn&#x27;t keep the paperwork to complain. My fault for waiting more than a year to check. Seller&#x27;s fault for not delivering as promised. :(</li>
            <li> I like it, but I have trouble keeping the bonnet attached to the hose.</li>
            <li> The dryer does actually work, it has a inside setting to automatically shut itself off to prevent overheating, worked great from me without shutting off</li>
            <li> Excellent product.....</li>
            <li> When I first saw this dryer I thought it was a toy.  Quality very poor, and when I tried it was worst.  It took me almost 2 hours to dry my hair.  I do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews for this dryer.  I have this dryer am planning on purchasing it yet again.&lt;br /&gt;As stated this dryer will shut off after a few minutes... what is NOT said is that it is a overheating shut off safety to protect both user and unit from harm and is explained in the manual. The ONLY time I have had this unit shut off on me is when I use on high heat or if air hose is blocked/not flowing properly. I only use medium to low heat, no major troubles and my hair still dries.&lt;br /&gt;I have used my unit for over a several years now need a new bonnet only but can&#x27;t find just a replacement bonnet.  So I will replace unit.&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length extremely thick hair... I use bonnet without curlers.  I find it easier then a hand held model which with my hair can take hours and my arms get tired. So I pop on the bonnet pull out a book, relax and dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t worry to much about the shut off feature. One should not use high heat for long periods of time for that will cause more hair damage then curling or flat irons do.  medium to low heat is the best and anything that can honestly dry my hair without damage is a great thing.  Only other bonnet I liked in the past was the Lazy Dazy and the old fashion nail care and hair dryer my grandmother had and I inherited.</li>
            <li> does not turn on - very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Motor overheats after several minutes and shuts down.  Will restart after a period of time. Then shortly overheats again.  Unit VERY poorly designed.  Unit VERY cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this hair dryer. Its easy to use; drys and curls her hair nicely. Just make sure your hair is damp not real wet before putting it in rollers. Other wise your hair really won&#x27;t dry or curl. The hair dryer will work better and you will have a full head of curley hair.</li>
            <li> really nice product my wife love it, i recommended it to anyone ............. ,,,!!!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!! !! !!</li>
            <li> This works great and does the job I need it to do.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars instead of five because of the storage issue.  I don&#x27;t like having to cram the cord and extention to the hood back inside the case each time.  I would prefer a slightly larger case that would accomodate everything more easily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it here but I still feel the need to write a review. I like Conair but this product was a waste of money. The hose doesn&#x27;t stay on the cap so while it&#x27;s supposed to be drying your hair, it&#x27;s falling out at the same time. Then.. it concentrates on only the section that the hose is connected to. I have to keep moving the cap all around my head just to get each section to dry. It was also HELL just to get everything back into the compartment. I could go on and on but I think that&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me..Easy to store or  take on a trip. Would recommend it to anyone, who travels  and still rolls her hair.</li>
            <li> Works well and is very portable.</li>
            <li> i bought this item and got it today and i did my rollers and all and i just loveeee the way it works! its small &amp; the hood is really big to put rollers . i feel like i just came out of the salon. money well spent !</li>
            <li> The glitch was I ended up with 2 because your system wouldn&#x27;t readjust the address info and I am stuck with the 2nd one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit when the more expensive hair dryer I had purchased from Staples online had a bonnet that would not have fit the head of a tiny baby....let alone an adult with curlers in her hair!&lt;br /&gt;  this dryer is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t put out very hot air but it is sufficient to dry your hair (just takes a little longer) and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Has everything I need. It does just what it says.Now that&#x27;s what I call &amp;#34;spending your money wisely&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it was hard to find a nice great working portable hair dryer.  Thank you for selling this one. itr fits my need and works well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for travel and it has proved to be a very good choice!  Would definitely recommend to others</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She had one similar to this for many,many years and needed it replaced. To my surprise she told me she liked this one better than her old one.</li>
            <li> this is my second purchase....I had my first one for years till it finally died......loved it so much, bought another one</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to condition our hair. It works great and is not very noisy. My little one has noise sensory issues.  the adjusting bonnet works well for adults as well as children,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it all the time but it works really good is practical and I like how is compact</li>
            <li> This dryer allows me to move around while my hair is drying, have conversation and  watch my favorit television programs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be sure that you snap the bonnet seal to the tube so that it locks before putting it on.  You may have to practice a few times to know how to lock it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I thought this dryer would be perfect; compact, not clunky, and easy to travel with. That&#x27;s really the only thing this dryer is good for, to travel with. All the main functions, useless.When I had the bonnet on, dare I move an inch and that hose would fly right off! AND the highest heat settings was not hot at all. I painfully sat there with the bonnet on and putting the hose back on about a million times, to only come out with 30% dry hair after 30 minutes worth of sitting. This product was cheaply made and without any thought put into it. I will be returning..</li>
            <li> My wife had one of these for years and it finaly quit&lt;br /&gt;Bought this one and She loves it. She loves it I Love it</li>
            <li> Compact and conveniently portable.  Dryer is not very powerful, so the brush it pretty much useless for my hair.  Surprisingly this dryer is not even as powerful as my handheld blow dryer.  Bonnet works fine as long as you are satisfied with the low/moderate heat.</li>
            <li> I only gave this a 2 star because i have medium to short hair and after 3/4 of an hour it did&#x27;nt dryit. i would not recomend this.</li>
            <li> Bought this about a year ago and have been using it. Works great. The only problem is the plastic bonnet tore, and I can&#x27;t fix it or find a replacement for it. I even tried duct tape!</li>
            <li> yes,very useful for the family.</li>
            <li> Great product I read reviews so kept my unit on low! Wow!  Low gets really hot so it does the job so far woo hoo!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great item my college age daughter loves it</li>
            <li> It is a good product if you&#x27;re using small or medium rollers.  The bonnet is too small for Large or Jumbo rollers so I only used once and packed it in my closet for whenever I decide to cut my hair shorter and can use smaller rollers.  It only came with one attachment, not two like the picture shows.  I like how you can store the hose, bonnet, and power cord inside the case.</li>
            <li> Love it, just what I wanted.  Great attachments and storage.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find one of these type hair dryers again.  It was requested by one of our senior residents that live in the residential facility I work at.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible hair dryer I have ever owned. The hose would not stay connected to the bonnet. It kept slipping off. I have only used the dryer one time. Will not use it again. If the dryer was more expensive, I would have sent it back.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and use it a lot. Probably not for the younger generation that have never seen one.</li>
            <li> It works for me well because I have thin hair, if you have thick hair or very long hair, you will spend five hours with it. It works well and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love this product from the small size to how fast it dries my hair.  I have very long hair and it dries it in half the time as the hood dryer that I currently got rid of.  I am gonna order another one just to have a backup</li>
            <li> I also wished that I had read the reviews before I purchased this hair dryer.  My unit&#x27;s hose would not stay attached to the bonnet.  I thought that I misread the instructions and dug them out to read again - instructions were clear on how to connect the hose so the unit was defective .  I should have returned it but I used it a few times and threw it away....got tired of holding the hot hose as I tried to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The negative comments about the dryer shutting down after 10 - 20 minutes on medium or high is true. I didn&#x27;t buy my dryer from Amazon but it&#x27;s the same dryer. I purchased my last 2 dryers from JCPenney. Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer&#x27;s are over heating when it is set on medium or high. When I dry my hair I put the setting on low and I don&#x27;t have that problem with the dryer shutting down  after 10 - 20 minutes. Conair needs to recheck the settings on the dryer. This dryer has a defect that needs to be fixed. I&#x27;ve been using these dryers for years but the last 2 dryers that I&#x27;ve purchased has giving me problems if I put the settings on medium or high. Conair please check into this problem.</li>
            <li> As a dryer its serves it purpose, but the spiral cord does tends to overheat and you must use a towel over your shoulders.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe you would send me an appliance that uses 110V. I cannot use this hairdryer as I cannot plug it in. Australia has 240V. Do you have an adaptor that converts 240V to110V?</li>
            <li> My sister had one and I did too.  The dryer would turn off on everything but the low setting right out of the box. Both units did this. Do not buy. No, you&#x27;re not going to be one of the lucky ones...don&#x27;t buy this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the hose to stay attached (locked) to the bonnet. Used it for 30 mins and it fell off at least 5 times. That was enough for me to return it.</li>
            <li> Works great. No shut off like others have said. Well worth my money.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this dryer, I can easily move when my hair is drying.  it also easees my deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, it will be fine!</li>
            <li> Uneven heating so you have to move the hose around to get the whole head done, not powerful enough, hose pops out.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is okay. Bonnet is comfortable however the air hose is too short so you almost need to hold it on your lap when using it. Also hose and or bonnet do not fit back into side of dryer as it would appear. A bit concerned that I can only use the dryer on low setting because it seems to get too hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved soft bonnet Hair dryers, the flexibility and convenience is fantastic. I enjoy being able to sit on my bed, use my smartphone while my hair is drying. It&#x27;s really great and awesome engineering.</li>
            <li> My kids have long hair, no longer torture drying their hair, now they shower more often, be sure to supervise them using this, a must.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews on this dryer before buying it. I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times. The dryer stopped working after having it on my head for about 5 minutes. I can&#x27;t believe it actually stopping working in the middle of me drying my hair. This is so unfortunate. Buyer beware!!!!</li>
            <li> It dries my hair, but it takes longer. Dryer doesn&#x27;t get hot, only gets warm. Good cost, I got my moneys worth.</li>
            <li> I use foam rollers to style my hair overnight; and sometimes they&#x27;re not quite dry in the morning.  So I pop on the bonnet of this hair dryer and voila!  Half an hour later my hair is all dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pretty lightweight so it&#x27;s easy to travel with, and it seems pretty well made.  I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;ll say though is that it&#x27;s kind of hard to squish all the stuff back inside the carrying case ...</li>
            <li> who does not need a blow dryer to dry ones hair. it is an okay blow dryer. it will suffice for now.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is nice and large and the air flow is just right for my hair.  It has done a good job for me.</li>
            <li> The item is described as a \\&quot;soft bonnet\\&quot; hair dryer.  The dryer works, but the bonnet is not at all soft.  It occasionally irritates the neck because of stiffness where the hose joins the bonnet.  The temperatures can get too hot; low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting. Watch out!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, after turning it on for 3 minutes the dryer shut off,and did not come back on. Dont waste your time on this product.</li>
            <li> The hose needs to be a little bit longer. Heat is good and dries good but just too short on hose.</li>
            <li> I purchased a dryer.  It works very very we&#x27;ll.  have not had any problems like what I read here.  It has never stopped working at all.  Maybe the reason I am not having these issues is because I bought my product from Walgreens... It works amazing.  I absolutely love this product by conair. Just not through Amazon, I guess... The soft bonnet does work as suppose to.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it very much. It&#x27;s better than the last one she has that got too hot.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> I had one of these as a teenager and loved it ! But times changed and blow dryers came in fashion....but blow dryers cannot deep condition your hair nor process color when done at home ! Much to my surprise I found that the Conair SB1X Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer was still being made, and available from Amazon !  I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it and love using it. Love that the hair dryer and attachments all fit in a small case - light and easy to store !  Also, not noisy and comfortable while using ! Great price !  P.S. I even dry my dog with it !!!</li>
            <li> My hair dryer came exactly as pictured.  I had looked for this one in stores and couldn&#x27;t find it.  I admit that I love washing my hair because when I dry it, I just put my bonnet on, cover up in a blanket, and relax with the heat on my head.  It feels like I&#x27;m pampering myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old fashioned and like my bonnet hairdrier. It fits well and the settings are for the most part, O.K. One of the settings is much to hot for the warm setting. Needs to tone that warm setting down.</li>
            <li> Bought for using on small rolled curlers.  The bonnet isn&#x27;t the easiest to get on and off for that, but it only takes about 25 minutes to dry most of the hair that is 3&amp;#34; long.  Sometimes the hose unhooks from the bonnet.  Need to stay still.  Better than wearing curlers for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I think this product would probably dry your curls if your hair isn&#x27;t too long. Nothing yet seems to dry my long thin hair in curlers.</li>
            <li> The dryer works great. The only problem is the hose won&#x27;t stay on, it falls off when using it on my clients.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift.  Hair dryer cratered after two months of once-per-week use.  Would never buy this product again!</li>
            <li> perfect for me, i love it</li>
            <li> Well as the old saying goes you get what you pay for. The dyer bag tore after one use. Do not buy this product</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my wife, but the bonnet was too small so she had to return it. The alternate brand worked fine.</li>
            <li> the bonnet is too small doesn&#x27;t fit over my hair with rollers in my hair thus, useless.</li>
            <li> mom will love this one. Don&#x27;t need to hold with hand and easy to carry around the country and abroad</li>
            <li> It shut off and will not come back on.  I only used it about five times.  I think it got too hot.  I have another product that will do that but if you let it sit, it will come back on.  After two days, I threw it in the trash.  Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Hood needed some modifications before it could lock into hose. Even the replacement hood had the same problem and needed the same modifications.</li>
            <li> Another successful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3, almost 4 years and it still works the same way as when I first took it out of the box.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> No.I didn&#x27;t know it is a 110 Volts device.</li>
            <li> Hair dryers like this hard to find! Love the portability when traveling!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to. A noted design flaw... the hose connector to the bonnet does not couple well, or rather stay connected. I suggest that you shove the male hose part into the female bonnet part, without using the notches. It may permanently attach the tow so you can no longer use the brush or detach them, but it will keep the two secure.  Also it kind of smells weird when on.</li>
            <li> I only used it once but so far so good. Very comfortable and easy to maneuver to multitask. Great product.</li>
            <li> It stopped running...broke down...7 weeks after I bought it....and couldn&#x27;t return it because it was past the one month period...Grrrr.  It&#x27;s a piece of junk....it&#x27;s really depressing to see the junk that is now for sale in our country...and depressing to see Amazon force this on it&#x27;s customers...I have been such a big Amazon fan...but no longer......this  was NOT spelled out when I bought it.  What a waste...</li>
            <li> My friend told me her mother&#x27;s old hair dryer broke.  She said I can&#x27;t find one anywhere, they probably don&#x27;t make it anymore.  I went to Amazon and found this one for her.  Her mother was thrilled to have one exactly like her old one.</li>
            <li> Not enough heat , take long time for long hair drying, have to buy  another one which is more powerful</li>
            <li> This did a great job.  What I loved most was how compact and easy it was to use.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It works but the hose is very tricky to snap in &amp; the bonnet is for a small head without large rollers. Keeping it anyway  for it is quick drying on a chilly night.</li>
            <li> light weight, easy to manage does a great job.  Mom is 90 years old and this unit is perfect for her needs.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; daughter. She&#x27;s been trying vintage hair styles and a bonnet hair dryer was required for many of those old styles. She loves it! It packs up easily and is easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot so it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair, It also doesn&#x27;t have a long cord for mobility but grab a book and sit a spell. Your new hairdo will be a blast!</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews! Difficult to open the plastic cover. No doubt the &amp;#34;string&amp;#34; inside the hose won&#x27;t last long! Worst for me: the bonnet does NOT lock onto the air hose. The least little movement of my head caused the hose to fall out again. I tried with all my strength to turn the hose until it locks - has about 1/8&amp;#34; of sliding area after &amp;#34;nodules&amp;#34; on hose fit into hose, but no way to lock it &amp; no way to make it stay. Thinking about trying duct tape. Worst product I&#x27;ve bought through Amazon in...like, maybe, FOREVER!</li>
            <li> small and not very powerful but for deep conditioning, its perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 90 year old Mother.  She used it for _ONE_month and it stopped working.  I cannot send it back because its past the date.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought this was because I could no longer get bonnets for my old dryer.  This one works so fast!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it. The warm air seems to circulate better in this bonnet than the previous dryer&#x27;s bonnet.  I found a good deal.  Thanks for asking. v</li>
            <li> This unit was exactly what we wanted with a very good price.  We would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight, portable dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my mother. This is the only one I could find with a soft bonnet. My mom is very happy with it</li>
            <li> nice unit but not enough room to store everything in side compartment.  You can put items in, but unit will not close</li>
            <li> Good while it lasted.  I used it (at best) 5 times before it just stopped working.</li>
            <li> My 90 year old mother likes it the dryer for she doesn&#x27;t have to hold it like she had to do with a hand dryer and it dries her hair quickly on the medium setting.  I gave it a 4-star for it is difficult for her to get it back in the case and sometimes the hose slips off of the bonnet.</li>
            <li> They sure don&#x27;t make em like they used to but this will do for the price I suppose... very retro feel , zooms me back to the fifties and sixties watching the girls in the family do their hair.. It was a big deal with the curlers etc.  Puts out a gentle heat to slowly dry the hair, no need to worry about burns etc. Just put it on, turn it on and read the newspaper.</li>
            <li> I wanted this particular Conair hair dryer.  The last one lasted about 10 years.  This dryer does make quite a bit of noise, but not a lot more than a hand held dryer.  This one was purchased because the last one worked well.</li>
            <li> Is a shame that we have 240 Volt in Australia and I had to buy a stepdown transformer wich made it more expansive.</li>
            <li> Easy to use dry your hair fast easy to carried is light weight.  you can take it anywhere in that house I usually watch tv while my hair is getting dry. ❤</li>
            <li> Too small for rollers, but great for conditioning, gloss, semi-permanent color, etc.  bonnet is the size of 3-layer cake.  Short hose, but that saves fan power and weight.  Consider spending more if planning regular use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who always used this type of hair dryer and sets their hair in rollers on some occasions. It stores easily and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like most Conair products. They heat up quickly and they are mostly very good products. But, this stupid hair bonnet dryer is the worst thing yet. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it because it did not have an UL Listed cord on it</li>
            <li> This dryer works well. We are using it for adding heat to conditioning treatments and vibrant hair color. Its a little noisy, but not too bad and the compact style of the dryer makes up for any noisiness. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Horrible, cheap, low air thrusting power and extremely small cap. I really wanted to love this small portable hair dryer for my roller sets, but I could not even put the cap on with large and medium sized rollers. I&#x27;m back to using the cap that you attach to a hand held hair dryer, it&#x27;s much larger and the cap is able to fit a large set of rollers underneath of it. This conair dryer was a Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like the price, the compactness of it --  and it is easy to travel with.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother.  Bonnet was very cheaply made and hard to connect.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone. Finally had to buy a hard bonnet type.</li>
            <li> Works fine, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do,</li>
            <li> Just love it , freedom from the hooded dryer !</li>
            <li> Not a good buy... Nothing like the ion brand!! Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to dry thick hair!!! Only good for short thin hair maybe!!!</li>
            <li> great product I recommend everyone get one. It is a good compact devise that is easy to travel with, you can put it under your seat or just hold it in your lap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay, it&#x27;s kinda loud, but it gets the job done.  I do however prefer the Carel dryer that I had in the past.</li>
            <li> the control button (high, med, low) is not working.  I will have to return it.  Not happy about that but it looks like a manufacture malfunction.</li>
            <li> This dryer is a good value for the money.  Bought it for my mom and her hair is on the long side of &amp;#34;short,&amp;#34; and it dries in a reasonable amount of time</li>
            <li> Cap is too small to put over my rollers.</li>
            <li> The bonnet is way too small. I barely got it on over my hair rollers and I was using only medium size rollers. When the hot air was blowing into the bonnet it only blew up the bonnet within the first couple of inches from where it entered the bonnet, the hot air did not go into the rest of the bonnet. I returned the bonnet hair dryer.</li>
            <li> cheap and misleading.  Can&#x27;t believe Conair puts their name on this product.  The hose is only 2 ft long and the bonnet is tiny.  Won&#x27;t fit over my rollers.  In addition, the hose will not stay connected to the bonnet.  If you move at all, it falls off!  I am soo disappointed and angry i wasted my money on this purchase.  Don&#x27;t fall for the false advertising.</li>
            <li> Very pleased works excellent with hair in rollers and even without enrollers it just gives a good body that way</li>
            <li> Its ok and would tell friends about it.  I do not need any more lately.  I have nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> I love being able to have a salon quality style from home.  This little hair dryer works a treat to bring out the best curl.  BUT the hose has ripped and torn in three places so far.  I have had to duct tape the hose together.  I would recommend discovering if another product has a better quality hose before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last 5 months. Cheaply made and the motor burned up in no time at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money you pay for it. I have ethnic hair and I use pretty big hair rollers. Fitting them in is a little bit difficult and It takes me a really long time to get dry because of this reason. Besides that, I have had no problems with mine so far. However I tried my mother&#x27;s new Bonnet hair dryer (different brand), which cost her 40 Dollars and it&#x27;s totally worth the 10-20 extra dollars. I get dried so much faster too!</li>
            <li> love it love the arrival time as well.</li>
            <li> I sit @ a Lazy Boy love seat to dry my hair &amp; there&#x27;s always a damp spot on the left side of my head even after 45&amp;#34;.  I can&#x27;t use it on high for more than 10 minutes because it gets so hot I can&#x27;t tolerate it &amp; must push it back one notch.</li>
