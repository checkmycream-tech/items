            <li> Great smelling. very clean and subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;smells good and not too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;But my wife says it was too small for the price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume by Coty. Shania spray is perfect and a nice, light scent. It&#x27;s a small bottle but you don&#x27;t have to use but a little at a time. Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells very nice. I like it more every time I put it on. Rather small bottle though.. three more words required..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d ordered the 1 oz. size before(not too expensive), but now price had tripled, so ordered the smaller, comparable price, however, product that came was NOT as pix showed. Frangance seemed strong also, as if old.</li>
            <li> I have LOTS of perfumes that range from cheap knock offs to expensive brands.  The day I wore this after receiving it, my husband gave me a big ole bear hug when I had just gotten home from work and said &amp;#34;dang you smell SO good&amp;#34; I blushed like a school girl who had just seen her crush.  I sprayed a little on before I went to work that morning and after 8 hours it still had that much kick, how can you not give it 5 stars?  Well done Coty!</li>
