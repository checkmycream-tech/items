            <li>It&#x27;s a good value too, for</li>

            <li>I am delighted and will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li>Feels so good after using it.</li>
            <li>A good friend of mine turned me on to this product.</li>
            <li>have read that hyaluronic products are good to use for aging skin.  </li>
            <li>It looks a good product.</li>
            <li>good it is.</li>
            <li>This is so GOOD to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;‚Äã</li>
            <li>It is a product that is good to mix with others.</li>
            <li>and I feel fairly optimistic about it.  </li>
            <li>I do have good skin</li>
            <li>I asked my dermatologist if she felt the product was a good one</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and in good shape with no damage to the package.</li>
            <li>I do take good care of my  skin</li>
            <li>good price and good seller</li>
            <li>am happy with this product make s my face feel really nice</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>so It think its a damn good product.</li>
            <li>I did venture out and use another product from another manufacturer and it was not as good and caused some break outs.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and on the sides of my neck (just under jaw on each side)</li>
            <li>The quality of the packaging and design is exceptionally good.  </li>
            <li>I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I knew I needed a good vitamin C serum to do the job.</li>
            <li>The eye gel feels somewhat of a hot/cooling sensation and tightens up as it dries - good sign.</li>
            <li>Since i didnt get good results I researched again and found Serumtologie.</li>
            <li>I hope it does as good a job as that did1&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.....</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and hope that if you order a bottle your results are as good as mine.</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>The product goes on smoothly and my skin absorbs it wonderfully.</li>
            <li>As a guy I bought this because I wanted something that would be good for my skin but was not pore clogging.</li>
            <li>but this product is so good</li>
            <li>and they assured me that it would be a good combination as the serum would act as a &amp;#34;delivery device&amp;#34; for the retinol cream.  </li>
            <li>this is a good idea</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of compliments already on how good my skin looks (and I am 60.</li>
            <li>Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always - good luck.days.</li>
            <li>Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always - good luck.</li>
            <li>The price seems quite good for this C product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s good about this product?</li>
            <li>this is every bit as good as the $100 stuff.</li>
            <li>It may well be that all the products combined contribute to keeping my skin in good shape.</li>
            <li>Good serum, keep upright.</li>
            <li>I loved this serum.</li>
            <li>Yes,  you  do  have a  good product.  </li>
            <li>The product is still good</li>
            <li>Good value for the money .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I tried the product and it&#x27;s a really good product, it made my skin feel cleaner and firmer.</li>
            <li>A man approached me at the grocery store and told me I was a beautiful lady and that my husband is very lucky!</li>
            <li>if any of them have helped me significantly, but they feel great on my face!</li>
            <li>Great packaging and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I spend 2 months researching the top notch Serums - best known, best rated - but, all with a very high price tag.  </li>

            <li>I tested this product for I love to review and loved it.</li>
            <li>The delivery is interesting (an eye dropper), and the serum seems to do a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is perfect this way for all skin types and has never broken me out and in fact has helped my acne.</li>
            <li>Will give honest star rating once I have used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li>The delivery was agreed days I feel satisfied with the good product entrega..muy</li>
            <li>It feels more even - skin tone and texture wise.</li>
            <li>So I received this product as a promotion for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I could get another at a reduced rate as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback.</li>

            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion in return for candid feedback.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it has made all the difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In return for my candid assessment expressed in this review, I did receive the product at discounted price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>I value my appearance but I don‚Äôt have that kind of money.</li>
            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion in return for your candid feedback.  </li>
            <li>Continuing to use serumtolgie as I have now for a couple of weeks, I can honestly say that this will now be part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>so I was using a powder form popular at Sephora.</li>
            <li>Been using this for about 2 weeks and honestly don&#x27;t see a bit of difference.</li>
            <li>Using it for about 2 months and loving it.  </li>
            <li>It does hydrate my skin and it smooths my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all and soaks in nicely on my 50 plus (age) skin.  </li>
            <li>Felt nice but saw no difference.</li>
            <li>Honestly, were in not for the fact that my skin gets so oily in this humidity</li>
            <li>you can then use your favorite spf moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>product I find is packaged well and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I wanted spectacular</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!  </li>
            <li>Loving this product and will keep buying again and again.  </li>
            <li>received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>To be honest I have not seen any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>received the product as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback.</li>
            <li>Using it for about 1 months and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>it kind of clumps up</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s a kind of &#x27;graininess&#x27; to the feel of my skin just after the serum dries.</li>
            <li>The review of this item was received as a part of a promotion in return for candid feedback of this</li>
            <li>I liked the product.</li>
            <li>but I liked it.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well and has a lovely consistency at a good price.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the eye dropper, would have liked a pump for the applicator</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it is a vegan product and organic.</li>
            <li>After two months, the skin on my face is smoother than it has been for years and still has that really nice glow to it.</li>
            <li>Really liked the feel of this on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed quite a nice difference after using the serum.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to wear under foundation or alone.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this serum!!</li>
            <li>This serum has been WONDERFUL and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an enhanced glow as it has greatly helped my skin!  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and easy to use application too</li>
            <li>Great Product,  pleasant - fresh, feels like it tightens and skin seems to love it</li>
            <li>This company is new and the customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li>Has a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been blessed with a good complexion, thanks to great genes.  </li>
            <li>advice is not to give up if it doesn&#x27;t work immediately, as some lucky people have experienced, but give it time to work with your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used Obagi Vitamin C serum, La Mer serums and others and upon switching to this product, I can honestly say this is FAR superior to ANY serum on the market!!!</li>
            <li>Because of this it takes more to cover one&#x27;s face and neck, but that&#x27;s okay if it&#x27;s doing a good collagen building job.</li>
            <li>the serum is easy to use - and so good for the skin...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more confident going without makeup!</li>
            <li>I look forward to more products by Serumtologie.&lt;br /&gt;God bless!  :)</li>
            <li>Awesome for even sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Pretty good feeling when you try it in the night and pleasant results in the morning.</li>
            <li>Everything is even, no dry spots and no oily spots, just perfectly even, for which I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>A nice, very light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re doing something right!!!  </li>
            <li>I read about her on the Serumtologie website and she is not only a beautiful reflection of her own product but a very nice lady as well.</li>
            <li>The consistency and feel of the serum is very nice, and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful serum, it go&#x27;s on very easily &amp; makes my skin feel so soft, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 wks now</li>
            <li>In my personal opinion the product is very very honest (good value for the money too!)</li>
            <li>The Ann Webb serum goes on like a very light oil and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell there is no substitute to Botox, but this serum is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best serum I have tried to date.  </li>
            <li>This is the best thing I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product and feel the price was more than fair and reasonable.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no miracle like Botox and fillers, but as far as a serum goes, this has been the best.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m very impressed!!</li>
            <li>I just turned 60, which I was not overly thrilled about, but I have to say that my face sure doesn&#x27;t show my age.  </li>
            <li>I was not overly thrilled about, but I have to say that my face sure doesn&#x27;t show my age.  </li>
            <li>This and the Rejuvelle serum were the 2 that were most effective for me...on par with Skinceuticals...at a lower price.</li>
            <li>So far I am impressed.</li>
            <li>Using it in combination with a derma-roller is even more effective.</li>
            <li>Like a nice refreshing drink for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>About a week after using it, people started telling me how bright and smooth my skin looked.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!!</li>
            <li>First, it is simply &amp; beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft an bright!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this Vitamin C product In April, I have used Paulas Choice at 45.00, I have used Timeless, which does not stay well in the bottle, I have used  Peter Thomas Roth, Dr Denese, This Product is by far the very best I have used to date.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my best so far.</li>
            <li>On top of that the company (Serumtologie) is as amazing as their product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Serumtologie is cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li>This one is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>but I read in an article that for my age (I&#x27;m in my early 30s), the best thing would be a Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Out of kindness I am receiving more of C22 on a promotion for giving an honest opinion of this product.</li>
            <li>it is much more cost effective than you would think.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for about a week now and seems nice but need to give it more time to see results.</li>
            <li>I am 60 and have many comments on how nice my skin is.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best as it seems to penetrate and work on the deeper layers of skin, not just the surface.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of the C serum after I finish this bottle to maintain the kind of skin this product has helped me obtain.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, i can already see an increased smoothness in eye creases, frown lines and laugh lines</li>
            <li>So far I am really impressed by this product!</li>
            <li>This product is the right balance for me because I get my kick of vitamin C without having experienced the rash that has followed with drug store products and some makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can see the changes in your skin very quickly!  </li>
            <li>and  is a very  fine product.</li>
            <li>, wasn&#x27;t sure if there was a noticeable difference, but people have been commenting how wonderful and young I look!</li>
            <li>WOW, does she love it!!!  </li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite and a great cheaper alternative!</li>
            <li>The packaging is very nice, and serum itself makes my skin feel very smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>Some products with mild fragrance don&#x27;t bother me but there are some which are not so pleasant to my sense of smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not kidding, it felt wonderful to receive such a nice compliment.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and great customer service.  </li>
            <li>going to re-order more right now!!!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I loved it right away‚Ä¶such a nice product.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>The serum works beautifully, dries quickly, and leaves the skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Great product I used it for month first before I rated</li>
            <li>Smells great and sooo much product!</li>
            <li>Works great after first day.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any others because after the first bottle, I turned from a skeptic into happy customer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moreover, it feels great on your skin, not slimy or too oily which I really like!</li>
            <li>My skin texture has changed drastically , it looks more smooth and healthy, I am delighted  and planing to continue using it .thank</li>
            <li>My skin tone and fine lines have improved!</li>
            <li>I have ordered twice now and my wrinkles and fine lines are disappearing!</li>
            <li>It has softened fine lines and even gotten rid of blemishes!</li>
            <li>Very light, absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Worse to try.</li>
            <li>Makes my face very smooth.</li>
            <li>The staff is very attentive and accommodating.</li>
            <li>The product is very light weight.</li>
            <li>but I have liked this one the best and intend to keep it as part of my long term skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>Worked great at first, but haven&#x27;t seen any progress since then, but no regression either :)</li>
            <li>Soaks into skin quickly with a good results.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t look feel oily and it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>With some very good ingredients, no alcohol or perfume, this serum dries fast and results are seen very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to leave a positive review on all accounts of this serum :)</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use I can honestly say that my skin has a more even tone, the fine lines are easing up and to my surprise</li>
            <li>The products are priced very fairly and have a nice feel to them - the added Vitamin C was a big motivator for me.  </li>
            <li>did brighten my face a lot which I loved and felt great, love this product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a wonderful product for us.</li>

            <li>As a hairstylest and a Nutrition Consultant I am confident to recommend this product.</li>

            <li>, I am in love with this.</li>
            <li>Taking away the rosea I have had for more than 10 years.</li>

            <li>my face has a youthful glow to it, even skin tone, I got on top of age spots before using this product, but I can say while using this product the age spots have not returned.&amp;#34; I will continue to use this product I am 47 and will buy it as a gift for my sister who is 54.</li>
            <li>I love how it works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and you would need a moisturizer on top of it.</li>

            <li>My face is more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My niece has remarked that my skin looks better than hers</li>
            <li>I&#x60;ve been using Skincelticals C E Ferulic about 3 years, but I decided to try another product with more vitamin C, so I researched and found Serumtologie.  </li>
            <li>I really love this serum</li>

            <li>I received email that inquire if the items arrive safely.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this serum.</li>
            <li>I could immediately tell my skin felt better--plumper, softer, more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used SPF30 for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Everybody looks better with a tan, but there&#x27;s a price to pay.</li>
            <li>Excellent product to heal blemishes, brighten skin, refresh facial coloration.  </li>

            <li>Cheaper and better than a differnt vitamin C I was using before.</li>
            <li>I really love the feel of this item on my face.  </li>
            <li>Although Vitamin C can be an irritant, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is considered safe and stable.</li>
            <li>My skin color is much better as well as reduced signs of wrinkles..  </li>
            <li>and I was able to wear it under my makeup this morning as well.</li>
            <li>I love this product -</li>
            <li>You have a winning product.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>My favorite out of all my serums.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels firmer and has a much more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>so I was worried that it would make my skin even more oily, but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before.</li>
            <li>I am so confident to go without makeup .</li>
            <li>My wife love this vitamin C</li>
            <li>I bought some for my sister and my best friend and can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough!  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this product since November 2014.  </li>
            <li>so you have to use a moisturiser on top of it.</li>
            <li>just love it.</li>
            <li>Simply the best!</li>
            <li>Liquid doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; like an oil, mostly water.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff - really has helped my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li>Received this yesterday and saw the plastic seal around the top.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My face appears more youthful with the use of this serum.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel smooth!</li>
            <li>, I love the way both products work together.</li>
            <li>and woooow you see the difference unlike most serums/creams.</li>
            <li>I also love that it has Vitamin C, Hyluronic acid and vitamin E.</li>
            <li>I use this as a serum and my retinol moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>I am about to purchase this item, I am so hopeful that I will see results : )</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident in saying that Cserum has done what it says it does.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin firmer and more hydrated when used in conjunction with a moisturizer on top of this product.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but the product is ok.</li>
            <li>She is pleased with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started to see the benefits of more hydrated and even skin tone and hope that with continued use it will get even better.</li>
            <li>and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and will continue using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will be reordering hoping that by keeping it going it will help get rid or tighten more.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and healthier and the color is more even.  </li>
            <li>Partly because of the packaging, in that the dropper style versus is the pump is much more user-friendly, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Also, the serum itself had the most smoothing and moisturizing results.</li>
            <li>I will post more when I have used the serum more.</li>
            <li>Totally in love of this products.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am a self-confessed skin care junkie, must have tried it all, and this delightful product will definitely stay in my arsenal...forever!</li>
            <li>LOVE the results it provides.</li>
            <li>Just ok, didn&#x27;t see a difference so</li>
            <li>and I love it ...</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>if you like the scent or not :-)</li>
            <li>I do love the way it goes on and feels.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see more results the longer</li>
            <li>Yes, I love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>What more can I ask for??</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Good product an well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I look fantastic !  </li>
            <li>I have used many Vitamin C serums</li>
            <li>Completely in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>The hydrating qualities are more noticeable when the weather is warmer or more humid.  </li>
            <li>And also better when the serum is used both day and night - twice a day without skipping days nor applications.  </li>
            <li>I find I get better results that way.  </li>
            <li>however, this product produces better results, in a fraction of the time, for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>give my opinion since I don&#x27;t know&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it on the backs of my hands and they do look improved - better texture.  </li>
            <li>I love the feeling of my skin after using the C serum.</li>
            <li>Love this porduct.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>My wedding was probably the most stressed I have ever been, and no break</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>many did not.:-(&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love the way my face feels when I put it on</li>
            <li>and I love the results I have seen in my face over time.  </li>
            <li>one of my favorite websides I checked and found serumologie which I tried and found</li>
            <li>the contents is okay.</li>
            <li>I had a good laugh and knew that it was because of your product.</li>
            <li>I thought I needed more than 7 drops</li>
            <li>I still use more than 7 drops to cover my face</li>
            <li>love the feeling of tightening of my skin</li>
            <li>love your product and my skin is getting already all the benefits you described.</li>
            <li>I do see a visible glow and healthy look when I apply makeup.</li>
            <li>My slim is more even tone</li>
            <li>I have noticed softer, more supple, skin that is regaining some of that youthful glow</li>
            <li>I am a skincare junkie and have tried many high-end serums - Prevage, Obagi, Skinceuticals, etc.</li>
            <li>To top it off, my hubby even noticed a change- now that means of course</li>
            <li>I will be a regular customer and happily buy monthly!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I  am a  bit  more of a  critic  </li>
            <li>and  also  more  cautious.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this product</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love anything that is age defying.</li>
            <li>I found this Serum to be just OK.  </li>
            <li>this product is okay.  </li>
            <li>Love the combination of ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>Lovely</li>
            <li>My skin feels more nourished.</li>
            <li>After 1 day, my lines under my eyes were more noticeable.</li>
            <li>After the 1st week, there is no difference, except the more prominent under eye lines.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I like this serum but don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>However, I think the 15% formula produced better results on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t care for the thicker, more sticky feeling of this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the plus side, this serum was more stable and didn&#x27;t oxidize.  </li>
            <li>Love the product we purchase again</li>
            <li>After 3 days of usage I already notice a difference: my skin is radiant and looks more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results, so I order another one.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I ordered and love the results.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I allowed myself to run out of this &amp; have to wait for more to arrive, I&#x27;m ordering it today</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that won&#x27;t be the case.</li>
            <li>I would say the product is OK.</li>
            <li>I have already purchased more of serumtologie C serum 22.</li>
            <li>Combine with a Vita &#x27;C&#x27; serum for outstanding results</li>
            <li>I do look forward in the weeks to come to see greater results.</li>
            <li>I love the glow I get from this.</li>
            <li>Can get better product for the price.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and definitely more youthful.</li>
            <li>Product was obtained Through I love reviews in order to review this product.</li>
            <li>I believe if something is as good as they say you should see results right away.</li>
            <li>Good product, it seemed to work right away.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it great for my skin it is easy on my wallet as well!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE the feel of this product‚Ä¶it&#x27;s both cool and refreshing!</li>
            <li>It only gets better with use!!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>She kindly offered me tips on how best to use C serum 22, recommendations on a good moisturizer and a reduction on my next purchase (which I have just ordered), simply for sharing a candid review.</li>
            <li>Great product - highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is great and i am highly recomende</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes and mouth are gone, my forehead isn&#x27;t furrowed - there is one noticeable very FINE</li>
            <li>These folks show genuine care about you and really want you to love your product , and go over and beyond to keep you happy for return business.</li>
            <li>my husband says how great I looked and especially that my face was more youthful than ever!  </li>
            <li>This is the first C Serum that I have tried and I really loved it.</li>
            <li>The top was able to be unscrewed without taking off the wrapper that is supposed to secure the top.</li>
            <li>My experience with customer service has been superior, being contacted for feedback by the founder of the company within the first month of using the product.</li>
            <li>this serum is pretty good, I can see my skin has been brighten</li>
            <li>this is so good and for the first time I threw out all the stuff Ii have on my shelf...been using about a month...</li>
            <li>I plan to be a life long user of this wonderful serum.</li>
            <li>I then had to buy another bottle for me because she loved it so much!</li>
            <li>so my skin was already in pretty good condition.  </li>
            <li>If my skin doesn&#x27;t improve anymore than it has to this point using this amazing serum, I will be SUPER happy, however, I can only imagine with continued use I will see even more improvements!</li>
            <li>First let me say that I NEVER take the time to give reviews on Amazon, but I must tell you guys what an awesome company this is and their high commitment to customer service.</li>
            <li>IT IS WORTH IT!!</li>
            <li>The sun/aging spots that I have, significantly diminished during this time period!</li>
            <li>but my skin reacts to products that contain too many ingredients or are too strong.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am extremely pleased with the consistency as the semi thickness of the serum allows for an easy application.</li>
            <li>so I find it applies more evenly and easily on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Love the way it easily absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li>nice serum, smooths in quickly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if this is good or not, but I haven&#x27;t been washing my face in the morning since I&#x27;ve started using this because when I wake up, my skin is nice and soft and glowy, but not greasy like it used to be.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and the texture is more smooth with a more even skin</li>
            <li>on to the most important part, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>What better testimonial than your husband saying how young and great you are looking...  </li>
            <li>Great product so far!  </li>
            <li>And hopefully it&#x27;ll keep those fine lines and wrinkles at bay :)</li>
            <li>:) I will recomend this to everyone that is looking for a glowing skin and to reduce fine lines</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use the product, my face looks a bit drier and the fine lines around my eyes are more visible.  </li>
            <li>With continued use, twice a day, my skin did start to look better with a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and age spots.</li>
            <li>I am over 50, and have many hormonal skin changes,combination skin, and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>In 3 days I was able to see a reduction in the fine lines I have around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a gel like consistency which makes it more user friendly for me.  </li>
            <li>Also love how easy it is to use and how there isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li>My mother has always had very full cheeks</li>
            <li>Even though I will be part of a promotion as part of my candid feedback, I can honestly say, as a person who has researched and used every type of product on the market, both high priced and drugstore quality, that this serum is what I will stay with.</li>
            <li>Amazing in reducing wrinkles, crows feet, smile lines, and even acne.</li>
            <li>You will love how it goes on smoothly, without an oily feel.</li>
            <li>but when I first received it I used it as directed and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>My skin is more elastic and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am really happy so far.</li>
            <li>I am rating these products a 5 primarily because of the company&#x27;s outstanding customer service.  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing to deal with a company that genuinely cares about their customers.</li>
            <li>and I have to admit no cream has had such brilliant results.</li>
            <li>Hoping to not look like a 50 year old bride, lol.</li>
            <li>I am glad this product has been made available for amazon customers.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best $30 spent this year.  </li>
            <li>Was received sooner than expected and package in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>but I am happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin so smooth, and I love the wrinkle-fighting powers.</li>
            <li>There are so many cheap serums out there compared to this one</li>
            <li>I love the packaging of the product - the tinted bottle is important to protect the ingredients from degrading.  </li>
            <li>and that is always an important factor to consider for me :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 66 years old &amp; have complements on how great I look.</li>
            <li>It has smooth out my wrinkles will try it for one more</li>
            <li>Thank you for your sincere service and fantastic products.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and more smooth.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did,  Vitamin C 22 is  absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the most important things for me in a skincare product.</li>
            <li>Most important</li>
            <li>This product was supplied to me for free with the understanding that I made a true review how I liked the product.</li>
            <li>I am happy so far with this item.</li>
            <li>After a good deal of research I came across serumtologie C serum 22, and the reviews really sold me.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and surprisingly hydrating.</li>
            <li>You will not find the fountain of youth in any product, but  vitamin C and a warm smile does wonders.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using all 3 in conjunction with my retin-a at night, I have noticed my skin smoother, brighter and surprisingly, I have NOT broken out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to have that kind of response in companies now a days.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely believe these kind of reviews.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and is well absorbed.</li>
            <li>It is a really good product and at a ver reasonable cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although her best description of what it&#x27;s done for her is, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s AWESOME!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;it works!&amp;#34;, I can confidently say that she definitely looks and is now carrying around a new energy that makes her amazingly seem to be aging in reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the right ingredients &amp; the price is unbeatable!!</li>
            <li>The price is right, and the customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it seems like a great value for high potency Vit. C with clean, non-toxic carrier ingredients.</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter, who has been blessed with beautiful skin and is very particular about her own skin care, told me that I was looking &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li>, I paid full price and just want to share my discovery of a affordable vitamin C serum that works!</li>
            <li>I know it was the Serumtologie C Serum that attributed to this wonderful experience as I have been using the other products for months and months</li>
            <li>I ordered the serumtologie C serum for 1) to make my face smoother, shine, reduce tinkles,2) from the excellent reviews from other customers.</li>
            <li>First off, I love this product and it&#x27;s become my holy grail!</li>
            <li>I am really excited to continue using this and seeing my skin improve even more.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try more of this line.</li>
            <li>It is packaged easy to handle and to use.  </li>
            <li>goes on easily, haven&#x27;t seen a change yet</li>
            <li>I love this serum and only paying for shipping is a great bonus.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, however I do use it in addition to an added 5 percent hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product goes on easily and does not make skin oily of irritated.</li>
            <li>found out that you can easily pay over $100 for one ounce of this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the best Serum EVER-I am in my late 50&#x27;s, since I have been using this my skin looks amazing-</li>
            <li>The company is very quick to respond to questions/problems.  </li>
            <li>The serum is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It seems to work even better when the face is damp &amp; moist after you clean it.</li>
            <li>I believe that the natural way to maintain beauty is always the best way, and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I like the way this is easy to apply and not too runny.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>I love this product - helps keep my skin wrinkle free and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but after trying so many of the most popular skin care lines and seeing no results, it is really good to purchase a product that really does help my mature skin.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and makes my skin feel hydrated.</li>
            <li>It is so incredibly easy to use</li>
            <li>Soaks in very quickly and I can already see progress with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My skin not only looks better but it feels great.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy not greasy.  </li>
            <li>The serum texture is perfect for smooth application and my skin absorbs it immediately - no sticky or wet residue.</li>
            <li>Good stuff - make this old guy look a lot better than he should.</li>
            <li>Be sure when using this product to always use sun protection so that you are not destroying your good deed with UV</li>
            <li>strongly recommend it</li>
            <li>and he said I still looked beautiful and also 40 yrs old not bad considering I&#x27; m</li>
            <li>I will strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so I took a while to post a review because I wanted to give my honest good opinion and with facial things you cant see it in one day.</li>
            <li>The 22% is considered quite strong btw, so you may need to start with a lower strength.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as those high end products...</li>
            <li>Many skin care regimens require a special formula for around the eyes</li>
            <li>Very light smell that goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>the serum is very light and absorbs quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li>22% of vitamin C in a skin product is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>This is the first time to ever use any kind of C serum.</li>
            <li>have not seen any lightening of a dark spot on my cheek, but am impressed that is NOT darkening during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>First off, I received this product as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback</li>
            <li>You only get one chance to have beautiful skin and taking care of it</li>
            <li>You only get one chance to have beautiful skin and taking care of it</li>
            <li>I purchased the first bottle to try and was thrilled when I found out</li>
            <li>and I have recommended it to all my clients who are looking for that extra edge in having beautiful supple, summer skin.</li>
            <li>My overall tone if much better, Its really is just all you need , the bottle and dropper are perfect to keep the product stable, and it works!</li>
            <li>use this product for many weeks to see a true difference.</li>
            <li>I am an aesthetician at one of the finest spas in Newport Beach and can say without hesitation that is hands down the BEST serum you can buy to beautify your face at this price.  </li>
            <li>Particularly my face is more hydrated with a nice glow to it.</li>
            <li>Obagi is the best hands down.</li>
            <li>I had no irritation, and have very fair and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be purchasing more from serumtologie!</li>
            <li>It did, however, take about 3 months to start to see some of the fine lines going away.</li>
            <li>Over time, I did notice fewer fine lines.</li>
            <li>After a scant 3.5 weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t seen reduction in fine lines or crepe areas.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles and fine lines did not diminish at all.&lt;br /&gt;Am</li>
            <li>I think I may have noticed my fine lines fade a bit</li>
            <li>I really thought the reviews were too good to be true, but now I know they are valid.</li>
            <li>i have not noticed any difference in fine line wrinkles yet.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines have soften and skin</li>
            <li>my skin felt refreshed and hydrated immediately, and within days I saw a visible difference as fine lines began smoothing out and my skin tone brightened.</li>
            <li>It also feels fine and does not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>Which is fine.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and the serum seems to have helped with the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also reduced the visible appearance of some fine wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am seeing a reduction in fine lines within just 10 days of using serumtologie C serum 22.</li>
            <li>There has been no difference in the fine lines or the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the softness and slight glow of my skin.  </li>
            <li>fine lines diminished...</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and amazingly fine line and wrinkles are beginning to disappear.</li>
            <li>There was dryness and some fine lines</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice any change in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that fine lines are decreasing and</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s softer and the fine lines are minimized.</li>
            <li>I noticed a softening of the fine lines around my eyes and my mouth within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer, and looks fuller, making fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines are still visible but fading.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a reduction in fine lines.  </li>

            <li>I also appreciate the great price for such a quality product!  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Whatever you do - don&#x27;t forget to use a light exfoliate -</li>
            <li>I did not receive this product for free.  </li>
            <li>I already saw a change in my skin texture, color and wrinkles, but after using the product for three weeks, the result are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the C Serum primarily to reduce mouth lines.  </li>

            <li>My skin feels clear and bright.</li>
            <li>It is a light oil like substance that just seems to melt into your skin.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were a pump bottle to keep it from being exposed to air and light, though.</li>
            <li>Arrived within a few days of placing the order, well packaged &amp; in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>My makeup went on smoothly.</li>

            <li>Gentle yet effective</li>
            <li>My skin continues to feel smooth and firmer as well.</li>
            <li>I am very concerned about our environment and feel that the best place to make a difference is in our personal environment.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I really like the moisturizer by this company, but for whatever reason I like the Azure Naturals brand of Vit C serum better as it seems to spread better.</li>
            <li>i am 38 years old with good skin because i been taking care of it since my 20;s</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old and this is just as good as skinceuticals.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 70&#x27;s and have used an incredible array of products over the years, including some very &#x27;well known&#x27; ones.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I am 75 years old and have taken really good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>love it so much that I just ordered 3 more bottles from</li>
            <li>So far so good on the results.</li>
            <li>So far so good in terms of applicability and freshness to the face.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about a month and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the customer service is outstanding: quick delivery as well as follow-up emails with information on to how to get the most out of the product.</li>
            <li>The first impression of the product was-- pleasant smell and it absorbs fast without leaving your face oily.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product not only for the positive impact it has on my skin, but for the fair market price.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and am looking forward to trying your new moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li>I ordered another bottle right away just to be sure I would not run out.  </li>
            <li>*22 is a unique stable form of Vitamin C in a safe concentration that is readily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>There is no bad odor and the liquid is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!!!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the fantastic product and also moved my rating from 4 to 5 star because of the excellent customer service and the money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>That is a company that cares about keeping their customers happy and are willing to invest a bit of money to do so, which suggests to me that they carry that same philosophy into producing the product and are not attempting to cut corners to make a bit more profit.</li>
            <li>think you may find after using this product, that the fix was more simple than you ever thought it could be to regain the youthful element and appearance of beautiful skin, I recommend this product highly!  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give this stuff a chance to make a difference before I left a review, but honestly, I saw a pretty great difference right away.</li>
            <li>I  am  sincerely pleased  to  make  this strong  positive endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;AnnMarie</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product with only the best reviews everywhere.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review, and I highly recommend this along with Serumtologie&#x27;s Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After the first week, my skin felt very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Good for any skin type, and I was absolutely floored by the comments I started getting within the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>This serum is easy to apply and absorbs quickly, which I like.</li>
            <li>I have previously worked at a skincare company and am familiar with products of various price ranges, and this serum is incredibly affordable while still offering great results.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a couple days but in seems to absorb very quickly and that i understand s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky to be blessed with pretty good skin even though I abused it in my early years with relentless sun exposure, most people think I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I use this to calm my skin and it loves it!</li>
            <li>after just a week - are nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or tons of age spots, but this definitely makes me feel more confident without wearing makeup because my skin feels and looks better than before.</li>
            <li>I basically do not think all these products make significant improvements on your skin</li>
            <li>but it has lightened, significantly, the darkened areas.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I could immediately tell my skin felt softer and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I especially love how this product uses vitamin C--I am a firm believer in the benefits Vitamin C provides to the body, including the skin!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and will be ordering another bottle today as I am almost done my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>All the bumps are gone and the lines have reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>As serums go, this one delivers a powerful punch!  </li>
            <li>I received this yesterday and have only used it 3 times but the difference in my skin is remarkable.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product so far</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful to hear words like &amp;#34;soft, smooth, radiant &amp;#34; in regards to my skin&#x27;s complexion!&lt;br /&gt;So, in my professional and my personal opinion, Vitamin C Serum *22 by Serumtologie is a product</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because of all the rave reviews</li>
            <li>I am impressed with how silky smooth and fresh my skin looks and feels in just a few days.</li>
            <li>first, with any shopping experience, as a costumer im most satisfied when I get exactly the product I want.</li>
            <li>Also my laugh lines helped!</li>
            <li>I have been using Retin-A 0.04% for almost a year now and it significantly improved my skin.</li>
            <li>I have had significant pore reduction.</li>
            <li>I originally reviewed the item as prompt shipping and item as described.  </li>
            <li>I am so very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a hormone issue.</li>
            <li>I received this order super quick!</li>
            <li>I have researched and tried many skin products, and this is by far, is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light allowing my skin to absorb its ingredients quickly.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>It arrived early, and the company has great customer service as well, they seem to really care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean looking</li>
            <li>My skin has a nice glow and the texture is much better - pores smaller, etc.  </li>
            <li>clean face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels better to be over 50 and astonishing people that you have a 21 year old.</li>
            <li>It goes on light &amp; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>most likely the added vitamins that this includes in the formula which is a nice bonus if there are women who don&#x27;t take their Vita C, etc.</li>
            <li>but I clean my face day and night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am pleased to report that during my second month of using this product I have seen amazing results in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products in my 50+ years, some showed positive results and</li>
            <li>I ordered this product based on so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, when I&#x27;ve finished the bottle, I can post a most positive review.</li>
            <li>so far,  love it!</li>
            <li>However, I have a few wrinkles when I smile and notice the difference after using the serum - love it!!!</li>
            <li>AT 22% ALONG WITH OTHER GREAT FREE RADICAL INGREDIENTS.  </li>
            <li>:  I am still am completely in love with Serumologie Vit C 22 and have not found any other product to be of the great consistent quality as Serumtologie.</li>
            <li>I emailed the seller with my details and was pleasantly surprise how quick they responded and not only that, they added an extra$20 which they call a goodwill refund.  </li>
            <li>, I started using it 3 weeks ago and because of my age, 63,  I am aware  it could take a little  longer to see the best results.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the long term results but my skin does feel much smoother &amp; best of all, the BEST primer ever!</li>
            <li>The serum is great; got it for my Mom and significant other as a gift (they heard about this product through word of mouth)</li>
            <li>but if it can stop aging process somehow, that&#x27;s good enough...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to buy more very soon.</li>
            <li>the offer made to me as a discount did not reflect my true review on this product</li>
            <li>Will  this product  still being good for such time ?</li>
            <li>One squeeze of the dropper, I can rub it on my whole face, neck, chest and top of the hands.</li>
            <li>I want to return the two bottles I got for a full refund.</li>
            <li>It also requires about 5-7 drops for your whole face and neck, so it&#x27;s not quite as potent.</li>
            <li>I am a skin product addict and love receiving products in the mail and to find out how well they really work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the big name brands for anti-aging and S22 is superior to anything I have seen.  </li>
            <li>I also was surprised to receive an e mail from Vanessa the co founder regarding how I liked the serum.</li>
            <li>On top of that I want to tank the customer service they have because they really care about their customers.</li>
            <li>Nothing is true regarding this product.</li>
            <li>My skin has become so supple and radient, thanks to this product :)</li>
            <li>Finally a product that is good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li>I love it, I really see the difference in my skin</li>
            <li>Since skin cells take time to rejuvenate you may need to give it a month or two to see the full results.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good product to add into your daily routine.</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>the wrinkles seemed to sneak up on me all of a sudden, as I have always taken good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It was true.</li>
            <li>I have been a repeat customer of this serum and have referred several friends that have also had good results.</li>
            <li>Will definitely stick with this superior brand.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine that has GORGEOUS skin told me about it and actually lent me a bottle (she bought a bunch at the launch price)</li>
            <li>This stuff really works, I&#x27;m ordering more because now that I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li>No bad reactions.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>The serum feels light on the skin and it&#x27;s absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>This serum is much thicker and richer than the many other vitamin c products I have used and it feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>but I had a question about the scent and usage of the product and she emailed me right away with detailed answers to my questions.  </li>
            <li>First, it is easy you use a dropper and the consistency of the serum allows you to get just the amount you need.</li>
            <li>One of the most important things for me is the fact that the product is 100% vegan and natural (does not contain Parabens, Sulfates, Synthetic Dyes, Aromas, GMO&#x27;s and Petrochemicals!).  </li>
            <li>I will continue using this product with hopes of seeing the many positive results that this product says that it can do for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company reviews and customer service are very positive.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for keeping price reasonable so this product can be easy accessible!  </li>
            <li>The product also seems very pristine/fresh and appears to have a very good &#x27;shelf life&#x27;--no perceptible yellowing/degradation of the formulation from the first to the last drops!</li>
            <li>I saw great results with the moisturizer, but when I added this, I saw an even bigger difference in my skin&#x27;s elasticity, firmness, and even saw some newly appearing fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li>I will let you know I have used this morning and night a few times when I want to look my best a certain day</li>
            <li>I have been happy with other products, not this</li>
            <li>It feel great going on and dries quickly so that I can put on other products on.  </li>
            <li>I also have large pores and this has made a difference that I can see!!</li>
            <li>She replies quickly to any questions or concerns about the product.</li>
            <li>My wife saw quick results and encouraged me to use the products myself.</li>
            <li>As I get older, it&#x27;s more of a struggle.  </li>
            <li>However, it is considered to be a very stable precursor of Vitamin C that is able to liberate the powerful antioxidant in the skin</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and I started using it before the holidays...</li>
            <li>It penetrates quickly into my skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how a product can start working so quickly, but it has.</li>
            <li>Vanessa personally emails you to make sure everything is in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly once applied then</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect this product to work so well or so quickly.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, it helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, skin tone is more even, my skin is more supple and youthful looking.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of age, who wants to see an overall improvement in the radiance and tone of her or his skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is now much more clarified, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>skin absorbs it quickly without any drying and it feels hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The company also showed excellent customer service as I sent them a few questions and they were very responsive and answered all of them quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product soaks into your skin quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it really seems to work.</li>
            <li>I liked that this company took time to add this thoughtful &amp; personal touch.</li>
            <li>The customer service and follow-up have also be exceptional -- I especially appreciate the follow-up emails with suggestions for application and use.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipper.</li>
            <li>I like that these absorb quickly into my skin and that it feels moisturized with out</li>
            <li>I like the way it goes into the skin so quickly too....</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old and have tried so many products to tighten,lift and smooth wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, I quickly ordered from serumtologie again.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs quickly, and it has no smell.</li>
            <li>Love the way the serum feels going on, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>my my skin did start looking tighter rather quickly.</li>
            <li>This serum soaks in really quickly.</li>
            <li>Next is Shave using a fun device and good shaving GEL.</li>
            <li>what I&#x27;ve read Hyaluronic acid is somewhat of a catch phrase right now and the molecules are to large to penetrate the top layer of the skin.</li>
            <li>The serum feels silky on my skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>You have to be quick to order this because it sells so quickly.</li>
            <li>But having the most isn&#x27;t always what matters because a lot of good ingredients are wasted if they don&#x27;t get into the skin on a cellular level and just sit on the surface.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had it in a baggie.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more and just wish it came in a bigger bottle since I love using it on my neck and d√©colletage too.  </li>
            <li>Works quickly.</li>
            <li>Since the liquid is thicker, I ended up using both bottles fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51, and enjoy looking younger than my friends, but yes, I told them about this product too, so it&#x27;s their own fault if they don&#x27;t try it out,</li>
            <li>I have research many similar products and so far I am  comfortable and pleased with this one,  and happy to know that if you have any concerns they will email you back right away!</li>
            <li>I was at the Chanel counter in a major department store and the saleswoman said my skin looked &#x27;amazing&#x27;...</li>
            <li>I can see that it is beginning to smooth the fine lines on my forehead for one and hope to see more results during the next 30 days.</li>
            <li>Love it makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s available to me to buy on amazon and not at my spa with a ridiculous markup!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased and am doing it on another blemish on my neck now hoping to get the same results.</li>
            <li>Brown/age spots are becoming to really lighten.</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 other Vit C serums and this is by far the best</li>
            <li>I have tried other C serum products and the Serumtologie C serum 22 is more effective, evidenced by improved skin quality.</li>
            <li>Can feel my face tighten from very first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for two days in a row but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Overall, a very lovely product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I also have hyper pigmented (dark) spots and blotched areas that are the result of sun damage from my youth and taking birth control in my twenties.&lt;br /&gt;The results I have experienced using Vitamin C Serum *</li>
            <li>This product goes on feeling very light leaving my skin feeling very soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with these products.</li>
            <li>After years of buying online, this is my very first time to write a review.</li>
            <li>First, I appreciate the packaging of the serum in a light protective bottle.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different facial products over the years, and find that with this serum my skin does feel brighter, and it is a great value.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced compared to others I have tried!</li>
            <li>I just purchased my third bottle and am very pleased with its results.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other Vitamin C serums before and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much Serumtologie!</li>
            <li>It is also good price to keep using for long term.  </li>
            <li>drops is all you need, so it lasts a long time and is good value for money.</li>
            <li>I generally do not leave feedback but felt this was a good product worth talking about.</li>
            <li>People comment that my skin looks lovely and are astonished that I am bare of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, I believe that this is an entirely worthwhile product:  highly effective, priced rationally (thankfully), non-irritating (which is normally a side-effect of Vitamin C serums) and with identifiable ingredients (to the best of my own understanding: no fillers, or dangerous chemicals,</li>
            <li>Looking for a quality product with the highest % of vitamin C and not getting discoloration of the serum due to light and opening the bottle with daily use, I found this serum an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>I love finding new beauty products.</li>
            <li>I also try to eat healthy, live a balanced lifestyle, and exercise in moderation.  </li>
            <li>And the forms which are more well preserved aren&#x27;t effective agents on the skin (meaning their not readily absorbed by the skin).&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I can notice a great degree of improvement - both in wrinkles and texture also age spots are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Great product.... Have been using Obagi ,but this seems to work just as well for a lot less.</li>
            <li>Great product.... Have been using Obagi ,but this seems to work just as well for a lot less.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been delighted by the moisturizing benefits of the cream and the wrinkle reduction benefits of the serum since I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a big difference in my face, but that was pretty good to begin with  </li>
            <li>You can really feel and see it working as it blends in very quick.</li>
            <li>I bought this serum about 2 weeks ago and loved it the first day i used, skin really really gets super hidratated and soft, i wish i had it before like when i was 25 to avoid damage on my skin (29now)</li>
            <li>I find it does leave a strange film on my skin, most notably around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>a little dab goes a long ways making it even more of a good thing!!  </li>
            <li>Plus, it is more affordable than many other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging of product - good.&lt;br /&gt;Results of product - seem to be good.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed results the first day!</li>
            <li>This product really delivers!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>Also, I cannot say enough about the CS  and follow up from the company which I Love!</li>
            <li>noticed after a few weeks that my skin is softer, more hydrated with a beautiful natural glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upon first use I noticed that the serum was more cloudy than I had anticipated (and in comparison to obagi professional c), it also almost always has huge air bubbles when I try to ration out the drops onto my finger tips</li>
            <li>What sold me to Vitamin C serum 22 by Serumtologie is its higher concentration of Vitamin C and the PRICE!</li>
            <li>I use this at the end of my evening after I exfoliate and love the way my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it states!</li>
            <li>Of course eating well and exercising are likely aiding in blood flow and better skin along with my skin regimen!   </li>
            <li>Why pay for a NAME when ingredients are what really matters?!?!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for about a week and LOVE the way my skin feels!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 8 weeks and love it!  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find this product by serumtologie at a much better price than the previous product I used.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C isn&#x27;t a very stable ingredient and can quickly lose its potency, thereby losing its antioxidant abilities along with its ability to brighten and smooth the skin.  </li>
            <li>I used witch hazel as my cleanser (amazing &amp; cheap) let it dry and then apply my C22 in the morning and before I go to bed at night.</li>
            <li>I am seeing immediate results, my skin looks great and so tight</li>
            <li>AND YOUR SKIN FEELS SOFT, NOT TACKY, AND VERY SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>It really made a difference for me diminishing fine lines and brightening my complexion.  </li>
            <li>Suggestion: use hot washcloths to clean and soften skin.</li>
            <li>Great serum it&#x60;s a little sticky</li>
            <li>Looks more even and glowy, fine lines are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a more even tone to my skin and smoothness, and it appears the fine lines around eyes are starting to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s goes on very smoothly and absorbs well; my facial skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve not had any problems with any kind of irritation at all.</li>
            <li>I am now on my second bottle of this AMAZING serum and HIGHLY recommend it to all!!!</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, but I was looking for a good serum to help reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>thing that I noticed immediately when using this serum, is that when I apply it right before my makeup, it seems to help my foundation go on much more smoothly, my pores are less noticeable, and my coverage is actually better.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews on this product, I was really excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase this vitamin C serum after all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, but this lovely serum not only is making my skin look and feel amazing</li>
            <li>I really feel like it&#x27;s a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>I think this helped smooth out my skin but didn&#x27;t do much for lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>This product is a great intensive moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much an isolated area, as it is an overall effect that&#x27;s taken place, Which works for me, someone told me, your skin looks so nice and smooth, what  do you do.</li>
            <li>It keeps by skin baby smooth and very hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Great product, using it everyday.</li>
            <li>After that its light foundation that doesn&#x27;t need moisturizer - it will be too much at that point.</li>
            <li>After that its light foundation that doesn&#x27;t need moisturizer - it will be too much at that point.</li>
            <li>This is a nice C and HA serum, and I like the extra ingredients.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is kind and personal.</li>
            <li>As soon as I notified the company of my dissatisfaction with the product, they immediately issued me a refund and even sent me a complimentary skin care product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some creams with which I&#x27;ve had some success in fading the spots, but I can&#x27;t say the C22 is doing that.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get anywhere near this result with many creams and oils I tried.  </li>
            <li>It has all but removed my laugh lines, and crows feet.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, it is thought to be a powerful antioxidant that can treat acne on the surface and even stimulate collagen, according to RealSelf.com.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I will definitely not only be returning to this nice skin product but also will  be referring my friends to it;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying.</li>
            <li>It is not oily or really moisturizing as like most serums, very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed and brightening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also well absorbed .</li>
            <li>I  received the product ( second bottle) as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback.</li>
            <li>I was offered a promotional discounted 3rd bottle in return for my candid feedback</li>
            <li>and I love the product so far.</li>
            <li>You can make this yourself at home, fresh, every week, with 2-3 ingredients.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look fresh.</li>
            <li>but this one is my favorite thus far.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my laugh lines and dimples were relaxing.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to see my skin finally showing an even tone.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed and I believe my skin looks much&lt;br /&gt;younger</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>far I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling incredibly silky, especially when I use it following the Philosophy Miracle Worker.</li>
            <li>I love the way it dties and makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li>In addition, I received a follow up e-mail from the company that was warm &amp; felt personal.</li>

            <li>: my skin is incredibly smooth, my skin is much more radiant, and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in my facial hyper pigmentation!</li>
            <li>They did the sweetest most unexpected thing.</li>
            <li>; email to see how I liked the product and provide tips for not only using the product but maximizing my skin care routine!  </li>
            <li>I noticed that I don&#x27;t need as much cover-up and on many days I can actually get away with a light dusting of powder and be on my way!  </li>
            <li>You may use this at night before bed also for more effectiveness for the skin, but to not waste product I would use it once</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>This serum makes my skin feel so soft and smooth my skin just glows!</li>
            <li>I felt my skin tightened, I use it every morning; sometimes i use vitamin e on top of the serum...makes my skin feel soft....</li>

            <li>My skin feels more hydrated and smoother although I really can‚Äôt see any real visible changes when I look into a mirror.</li>
            <li>My skin also feels taught and fresh.</li>
            <li>It got rave reviews, so it is worth trying.</li>
            <li>Spectacular results in only days...</li>
            <li>I had some marks on my face that are almost gone now - I will be continuing to use this and it will be fun to see the effects in time.</li>
            <li>So far I love this product.</li>
            <li>They are still trying to find ways to make it more natural and organic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and her skin feels nicely refreshed and hydrated and that it helped with her overall skin appearance.  </li>
            <li>The C serum 22 is by far a better product and you see the results.</li>
            <li>I was even contacted by one of the co-founders of this product personally to ask how I liked it.</li>
            <li>Overall my skin looks and feels smooth and more refined.</li>
            <li>after only a week of usage per the instructions (morning and night) work quite effectively.  </li>

            <li>It is worth the price we pay for this serum.</li>

            <li>has vit C 22%, hyaluronic acid 5%, vit E 1% and ferulic acid 1% -- everything you need for fresh - well hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft, more plump and look healthier.</li>
            <li>I rarely write a comment about a beauty product.  </li>
            <li>the drawers are full of half used lotions and serums).&lt;br /&gt;It has acutally makes me want to take better care because I am seeing better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I no longer can live without it and get a lot of compliments on my youthful complexion which is great because I am not young anymore</li>
            <li>After reading some very positive reviews about the product and its customer service, I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>I understand skin care takes time, and finding the right product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that it has more hyaluronic acid than any other C serum that I have found.  </li>
            <li>This serum does on lightly, no weird smell, dries quickly without being tacky.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>I no longer work for the company, but I must say, their highest selling serum was FULL of empty ingredients, pure garbage, for twice the price of this superior product..</li>
            <li>I believe caring for the skin at a young age is the best way to avoid major problems later in life.  </li>
            <li>The serum feels very refreshing, glides on smoothly, directions say to use 5-6 drops in the palm of your hand and spread it over your face, but I&#x27;m finding that you don&#x27;t even need that much to cover your whole face, which means it will last longer (an added plus).  </li>
            <li>I‚Äôm a pretty young guy but have spent a lot of time in the sun, mostly on the tennis court and wasn‚Äôt always that good about using sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It really has made my face more vibrant.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
            <li>I knew right away that I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product</li>
            <li>seems to work right  away.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who has been looking for the right serum.</li>
            <li>I began using serumtologie right away, twice a day, and after 24 hours (3 applications)</li>
            <li>I noticed an increased tightness right away.  </li>
            <li>- the price is right</li>
            <li>My sister noticed right away,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anything right now</li>
            <li>you notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li>the  right  </li>
            <li>right  up</li>
            <li>She says that she&#x27;s using 6-8 drops on her face and neck in the morning and evening right after she cleanses.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I felt a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I know a lot about herbs and this product has the right herbs you need to beautify your skin.</li>
            <li>Not only is the price great, is works well or even better than more of the expensive products available.</li>
            <li>I use three to four small drops in my am serum, before i moisturise and again at night, If you are on the fence on this product, Do not be, Its a great balance of all you need , fresh and works to perfection.</li>
            <li>There is no magic bullet to eliminate aging skin, but this product does a good job of keeping my skin hydrated and safer from free radicals.</li>
            <li>clear and believable description with visible results ;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Serumtologie is hydrating and really improved the texture of my hyperpigmented skin and made surrounding normal skin look and feel even better vs Skinceuticals cream which felt a bit drying and didnt improve skin texture for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this both evening and morning and it has been a powerful product in reducing wrinkles, leaving my skin very soft, and most of all, helping me to look ALIVE !!!.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty funny!  </li>
            <li>There is a slight odor, but overall a great product!</li>
            <li>It has softened the lines on my face, particularly around my mouth, and my skin looks brighter and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, the look of my skin improved--it looked (and felt) more livelier, more colorful, even though I had not gotten any sun.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled with how soft and smooth my skin felt the next morning.</li>
            <li>My skin feels incredibly soft and smooth and looks healthy and alive.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift, but I&#x27;m sold - hope the price stays down üòâ Good job on the formula.</li>
            <li>My pores are significantly less noticeable and my skin is well on its way to actually being flawless for the first time since I can remember.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month now, maybe a little more, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I tend to breakout easy, and many other serums have caused me to breakout.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a lack of information available regarding Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate because it is a relatively new derivative of Vitamin C being used in skin care products.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t wait  to try the  PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I certainly have not heard that before!</li>
            <li>I really like it.it makes my skin feel soft and look better healthier.</li>
            <li>So I have had a few breakouts, but mostly just noticing smoother, tighter, more supple skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Above all I believe this company truly wants to put out a good product for a decent price.</li>
            <li>because it is not only effective, it is extremely gentle and does not irritate my skin in the slightest.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and feels like it is really helping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for 4 days and so far so good...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be happy to purchase a different product from Serumtologie in the future.</li>
            <li>Serums are the most powerful , and finally this serum has the essence of Vit C.  </li>
            <li>Most items temporarily tighten and firm the skin to give it a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>It is quite acne-prone and to keep my breakouts under control, I use benzoyl peroxide which has been really effective but has left my skin very dehydrated.</li>
            <li>Any detriments will be updated on here (they have used two bottles over three months so far, keep wanting me to order more... from my account haha).</li>
            <li>A lot of these kind of products have made my skin feel dry and this does not.</li>
            <li>I applause this company for providing such high quality ingredients at such and INCREDIBLY affordable price..</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes my skin look and feel amazing: tight, smooth, fresh.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a LOT through Amazon over the years and this is THE FIRST TIME a company has actually contacted me personally to ensure I was happy with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rest of my time would be spent either life guarding at highly chlorinated pools or commuting into and biking around the beautiful but auto exhaust infested streets New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a definite decrease of fine lines and skin tone is improving, too!</li>
            <li>I like C22 very much.  </li>
            <li>I like C22 very much.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>you very much .</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very important to know that not all Vitamin C serums are equal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was delivered very fast</li>
            <li>I do understand that a preservative is very much needed in skin care products to kill any bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, the  price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for a product containing both too.  </li>
            <li>The product was very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>I like this serum very much.  </li>
            <li>There are similar products like this on the market, some cheaper and some more expensive, but this one has the highest concentration of good ingredients in effective forms for the price.</li>
            <li>My skin is silky soft and the fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li>At 50 yrs old, forehead creases and fine eye lines have also shown improvement.</li>
            <li>If most other companies strive to protect products from light and air, why shouldn&#x27;t this one?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to get the package and try this new products.....</li>
            <li>I also know they have great customer service because I e-mailed the company asking how long a bottle should last.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely keep using serumtologie C serum ¬∫22 :)</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth after using.</li>
            <li>I am so very grateful to the developers of this skin product!</li>
            <li>the Rosecea outbreak I had at first has cleared up.</li>
            <li>it is the same thing, it all makes our bodies healthy or not.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, you can almost instantly feel the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when this bottle is gone and buy extra for gifts.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much,all my sun spots are clearing on my face so I have started to put two drops on the back of my hands</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the entire bottle to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>I am using my 2nd bottle and it is looking better yet.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft, smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li>This product delivers a higher impact and can improve your over-all anti-aging results.</li>
            <li>But man Im telling you, it really kick starts your skin!</li>
            <li>My sister gave me the first bottle of C22.  </li>
            <li>But I will keep on using it as it has made my skin tighter, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finger crossed this will last and hopefully improve my acne prone skin. :-)</li>
            <li>I understood what the common ingredients were for a great serum.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended it to several friends who also love the results.  </li>
            <li>after three weeks my skin looks 10 years younger or more.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more for myself.</li>
            <li>Cosmetics Database finds Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate to be a 99% safe ingredient and notes only data gaps as a concern.</li>
            <li>I have seen improvement with consistent use.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li>high concentration of vit c!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After first couple days, her skin feels firmer and</li>
            <li>The first day I applied it</li>
            <li>I was paying $200+ for serums at the Dermatology office and didn&#x27;t get this fast of a noticeable result!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft, smooth and glowing after I use.</li>
            <li>I did after the first week felt my skin smoother and  a lifting effect.</li>
            <li>I have just started my third bottle of this serum, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have so many facial producy ats and cosmetics that I could literally match the stock of 1.5 Sephora stores.  </li>
            <li>I am turning 50 in two weeks and getting married at the end of March.</li>
            <li>but I think over time it will fight the formation of more defined wrinkles simply because it firms and hydrates the skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>Applied to my face and immediately noticed how soft and smooth it got.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the more Inexpensive products that actually seems to work!</li>
            <li>I am almost done with the first bottle.</li>
            <li>serum has made my skin so soft and smooth since the first application.</li>
            <li>My overall skin tone is more even and skin is softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Within the first three of you see Denatured Alcohol, DO NOT BUY..</li>
            <li>This is my first time using serumtologie C serum</li>
            <li>I have been using C22 for several months now and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this!</li>
            <li>(it will feel sticky at first)</li>
            <li>First time I feel like I bought a product that is living up to the hype.</li>
            <li>your face is ready for sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s made my skin appear so much more youthful even after a week of daily use.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results and am on my second bottle!  </li>
            <li>I noticed an initial brightening of my skin along with a healthy pinkish tone.  </li>
            <li>But I try different products periodically in case there is something better.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely recommend it for anti aging, premature wrinkles, sun spots and found more even skin complexion.</li>
            <li>Will order more whenever I run low.  </li>
            <li>I researched many C products and finally ordered serumtologie C serum 22 because it does not appear to have chemical preservatives.</li>
            <li>After my first bottle was finished, with results of softening and brightening of my skin, I decided to go with a cheaper alternative</li>
            <li>I saw an immediate improvement to my complexion with the first use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen all of the changes in my skin that I am hoping for but, I am very optimistic!</li>
            <li>Serumtologie C seems to be addressing them all and  smoothing things out, which I tend to notice in the mornings when I first wake up.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how my pores seemed to diminish.  </li>
            <li>This product, however has made my skin feel softer and look more even toned, overall.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, you should do so very soon!</li>
            <li>Love how it feels and feel that my skin looks much younger.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that, but it makes my skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just a shame that it&#x27;s ingredients lists is packed with real power booster good for skin and quite safe as testament that I didn&#x27;t break out which I usually do since I&#x27;m quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS ALSO REALLY AFFORDABLE!</li>
            <li>This costs one third of the cost of Skinceuticals and has more stable vitamin C in it that Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my first 4 days of use.</li>
            <li>But this is the first time I‚Äôve used a skin serum.</li>
            <li>Any comments or insight about the air bubbles, serum color, or feeling of dryness with this product would be greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li>Crowsfeet are diminished &amp; I love the brightness &amp; vibrance that it has given me back.</li>
            <li>and I love the blue bottle...</li>
            <li>this is my first...</li>
            <li>Just received product and felt immediate tightening of my skin after first use.</li>
            <li>My husband has commented on how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>but the serumtologie C serum has a higher concentration of Vitamin C and Ferulic acid.</li>
            <li>After 23 years of marriage, my hubby comments -- for the first time ever -- on the youthful appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>the first time in probably 30 or more years, I feel confident enough to use no makeup on my facial skin (although I do apply lipstick and eye make-up).  </li>
            <li>the first 3 days</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to protect and hydrate my skin in this hot and humid TX weather.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for the first time in my life, I have decided to try out C Serum ¬∞22</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t stop talking about how in awe she is that, being a person that never uses this type of product, the first one I bring home turns out to be the one that&#x27;s ended her seemingly eternal search.</li>
            <li>I have lines above my top lip that were not there before I began using the serum.  </li>
            <li>Trying for the first time.</li>
            <li>The first couple of days, I got some tingling but no redness or inflammation.  </li>
            <li>IT leaves your skin soft, smooth and clears out the sun spots.  </li>
            <li>I really like it !</li>
            <li>You can really see results with this serum!  </li>
            <li>This was my first vitamin c serum</li>
            <li>The serum is light and creamy, and it adds moisture under my moisturizer that I need for my 50 year old + skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin definitely looks better.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this product, but the first time I applied it</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely showing signs of improvement (softer, brighter, more even skin tone).</li>
            <li>the first week .</li>
            <li>Its not expensive</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a week and love the results.  </li>
            <li>- I try them first - this is not one I would refer.</li>
            <li>For the first time I do notice a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I hope that it continues to be marketed at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>This is the first product review I have ever done.</li>
            <li>In the evening I use the serum first, and then add a retinol cream and massage it</li>
            <li>;)  4.</li>
            <li>that was a first compliment I ever got from my derma which I go to almost every month.</li>
            <li>I wish I could  get maybe a larger bottle that would be more cost affective.</li>
            <li>At first she thought it was just a fluke and kept using the product</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a vitamin C serum, so I do have anything else to compare to.  </li>
            <li>My esthetician recommended Skinceuticals,  but this product is much more affordable and hopefully will provide similar results.</li>
            <li>I have now ordered my third bottle and have recommended it to many friends.</li>
            <li>He has just now become interested in skin care and is willing to keep trying this serum even though he prefers creams.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of serumtologie c serum 22 and really love it</li>
            <li>I have friends and strangers saying truthfully how much younger I look!</li>
            <li>The first couple od days</li>
            <li>Finally you rub in the Serum 22 and after 2 or 3 days your skin looks better and in my case tightened, by 25%.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an anti aging serum</li>
            <li>Pretty please?</li>
            <li>but when I saw this product I was interested in trying it.</li>
            <li>Powerful ingredients but gentle.</li>
            <li>sure you use the serum properly.  </li>
            <li>After using this product, the bumps, I noticed recently are disappearing and my skin tone looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This is the first thing l have ever used that l could feel tightening my skin.</li>
            <li>For years, my wife has purchased many different types of what she calls &amp;#34;wrinkle removers.&amp;#34;  A friend mentioned C serum 22 in her presence, so she just had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the product for about 3 weeks and unfortunately never read the directions to use the C Serum am &amp; pm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second order and will be ordering more for myself and my sister.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This actually has substance to it - not oily - and I love that the ingredient list is short, potent and purposeful.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product religiously for more than 14 days now.  </li>
            <li>overall, recommend, will order some more to see if they can keep it up and like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and glowing with an even, smooth surface.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re both in our mid-50&#x27;s and kind of low-maintenance and no real skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; but I figure that we may as well do what we can to protect our skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on on age spots on my hands and it is working very well!  </li>
            <li>I was using something similar, but it had 15% vitamin C and the fact that this formula had 22% vitamin C was appealing.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first product that did not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>I noticed my skin has become more brighter and those tiny acne in my forehead has disappeared.</li>
            <li>, I am willing to finish the bottle and see the results.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, radiant, and clear.</li>
            <li>Second of all I am truly satisfied with the results of using the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this serum and just ordered the moisturizer from the same company.</li>
            <li>, this is the first time I have ever used something like this</li>
            <li>It really does!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and have a few acne scars on my chin that have noticeably faded.  </li>
            <li>It feels really good on my skin...not to heavy or light, not greasy &amp; no harsh odor.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old with mild adult acne, and I attribute this serum, along with Cerave cleanser and a good retinal lotion, with the fact that the last thing I was worried about on my wedding day, was my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very excited about the progress I am making since I was paying pretty close to the same amount for another brand.</li>
            <li>It has natural organic ingredients which are very important to me, except for one preservative, Phenoxyethanol, which is a moderate concern but they use the lowest percentage amount they can to make it effective, one of the very last ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very promptly and I noticed a difference right away in the over all evenness of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The positive results can be seen in a short period of time - prolonged use yields even better results.  </li>
            <li>(I live in a dry climate) and before applying a light top coat of mineral makeup on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product surpassing other high end brands not only for the high percentage of key ingredients but also for the excellent value.  </li>
            <li>My mom and I have both been using for a few days, great so far!</li>
            <li>The perfect accompaniment to my expensive skin care regime; this prodcut is well below the price I pay for my daily skin collection but is very high in ingredients &amp; its magic results.</li>
            <li>Sun &amp; pollution have taken a toll, but I&#x27;m seeing fewer fine lines and more lift after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I won&#x27;t be needing to try any other serums after trying and using (for about three weeks now)</li>
            <li>My initial shipment had a slight problem (not enough for me to contact them to replace the product or get a refund), however, they did both and gave me a full size of their wonderful cream as well.  </li>
            <li>It contains a very high concentration of free radical fighting ingredients offering protection against environmental contaminants keeping the natural aging process to skin at bay.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and new!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m also happy to also be using an anti-aging product that isn&#x27;t too heavy on my &#x27;young&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li>and I really love how my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry but is soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>it comes with the scrubbing auto-brush and if you don&#x27;t clean your face and get the old layers off (which this product is helping to do)</li>
            <li>I need to couple it with a good physical barrier sunscreen (which I haven&#x27;t done well recently) to get the maximum benefit</li>
            <li>but that alone hac marked improvements (from a former sleeping in my makeup kind of girl) üòÅ</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, but used to use a much more expensive serum.  </li>
            <li>I also like that the product does not have a strong scent because I know it will not dry out my skin after a while.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it&#x27;s done more harm than good.</li>
            <li>I had only been using it for about 10 days and  had been really noticing how much better my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>and I felt like I saw an improvement in the texture and glow of my skin and lines around my mouth but wasn&#x27;t sure if the improvements were in my head or if my skin really did look younger at age 65.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time I purchased and the product is very special.  </li>
            <li>Wow...what can I say to convey my sheer delight , first in the fast delivery of this item, the amazing , early results noticed after using this product.....</li>
            <li>I really love how this makes my face feel clean and tight.</li>
            <li>It cannot do plastic surgery obviously but does keep my skin smooth and young looking with fine lines virtually not visible.</li>
            <li>this serum has made my skin super smooth and much more even-toned - a tremendous help with the grey/shadowy look that I was left with after cancer treatments a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I can tell something positive is happening.  </li>
            <li>I have never noticed a positive difference in my skin from any product over night.</li>
            <li>positive reviews I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see any positive changes.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use product and hope for continued positive results.</li>
            <li>I purchased it through Amazon after reading positive reviews.</li>
            <li>But I am very much positive about the product results.</li>
            <li>In 2 weeks they were NOTICEABLY lighter, and now 3.5 weeks they are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I have one that is $20 higher but just absolutely does nothing like this.</li>
            <li>I honesty can&#x27;t tell if this is working to an exact degree because I&#x27;ve hanged my whole routine at once</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure it is not old.</li>
            <li>I have long been acquainted with the benefits of C serum on skin -</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been couple of weeks since the first trial but it looks really working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way to becoming a holy grail product for me and, for me, the customer service only seals the deal!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will be a long time user</li>
            <li>Will update when I see more results , as I haven&#x27;t been using it for too long.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty reasonable for trial.</li>
            <li>Haven used it long but love what I see</li>
            <li>I&#x27; m looking forward to seeing the more long term effects.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of a stronger vitamin C than the average 20%, however the Vitamin E is in oil form i think</li>
            <li>I have tried several different Vitamin C serums ( including OZ Naturals and Cosmetic Skin Solutions) and have just recently found that this product seems to be the most effective for me.</li>
            <li>It protects/nourishes the fresh new cells which are always being produced and which rise to the surface every 30 days if your 30 and every 90 days if your over 50.</li>
            <li>Amazing results in less than a week of use.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my skin is not as dry and its texture is much better.</li>
            <li>The smell of the serum is strange, although I don&#x27;t mind it -- it has a sort of a natural kind of smell.</li>
            <li>So if you have dry skin, just add a night cream on top.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and last all day.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say my skin seems brighter and wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li>The first thing that hits me in the mornings is that my pores are definitely smaller, hence giving me a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>previously used another brand of C serum, and, while it was effective, it exacerbated a skin condition I have called rosacea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on a skin regimen for mild adult acne</li>
            <li>Anyway, that has lightened up considerably, so that‚Äôs a super plus for me.  </li>
            <li>On top of that my skin is naturally dry.  </li>
            <li>They make my skin super hydrated and feeling extemely soft.</li>
            <li>This is a simple and easy thing to do.</li>
            <li>I am 25 years old, with generally good skin (medium to dark tan).</li>
            <li>But, to be honest I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I will re-order certainly.</li>
            <li>I purchased s√©rumtologi√©¬Æ PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer and s√©rumtologi√©¬Æ C serum ¬∫22 for my wife at the suggestion of a trusted friend.</li>
            <li>I ordered the PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer along with the C serum22</li>
            <li>Will certainly keep this in my product line.</li>
            <li>It certainly did not anti-age me.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Vitamin C serum 22 and the Pure Whipped Chiffon moisturizer for two weeks now.  </li>
            <li>I have now been using Vitamin C Serum 22 and Pure Whipped Chiffon for 5 mos.</li>
            <li>use this in conjunction with the ‚Äú100 Pure Hyaluroinc Acid Serum Acid‚Äù, ‚ÄúAvalon Organics‚Äù - Vitamin C renewal moisturizing skin cr&amp;egrave;me</li>
            <li>Maybe I have been buying these Hyaluronic acids which claims to be pure or 100%</li>
            <li>She has large acne all over her checks now.  </li>
            <li>I understand that they now have a companion moisturizer which I will certainly try.</li>
            <li>And it wasn&#x27;t moldy like the Vernal Hyaluronic Acid Pure Skincare Treatment that I bought afterward to try it.</li>
            <li>I have found a new line of skincare !!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to give an accurate review on any wrinkle diminish, but I do know that I love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>As long as this product is available and the formula remains the same (or better), I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li>My skin felt softer after the first application and has continued to feel great for the last few weeks that I have been using this product.  </li>
            <li>In the past couple of weeks, I have noticed a definite visible reduction of pores - which was unexpected, but great!</li>
            <li>I have tried several Vitamin C Serums in the past and this by far is the best one that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I am not a frequent user of any beauty or anti-aging products but now that I&#x27;m 30, I was considering something to help me with my crows feet which are slowly starting to build up, too much smiling isn&#x27;t always good...</li>
            <li>I have been using it everyday for a month and my skin is softer, smoother and blemish free!!</li>
            <li>am 58 years old and have pretty good skin but have hyperpigmentation on my neck and a few lines on forehead and neck as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a knockoff to the other popular one which comes highly recommended -- and it shows.</li>
            <li>I shared my satisfaction and shared how I spilled half the product and immediately ordered another as a testament to how much I was loving it.</li>
            <li>Even though I have very sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t trigger make my skin irritation or any trouble and it also make the skin bright.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminishing, especially my crows feet.</li>
            <li>but  order this seerum for some fine lines under my eyes that are starting to show now  </li>
            <li>Have definitely seen a reduction in fine lines</li>
            <li>I say the phrase &amp;#34;keeping skin healthy&amp;#34; rather than something like &amp;#34;erasing fine lines&amp;#34;, because I believe that can only be done by surgery.</li>
            <li>I have deep furrow lines on my forehead and fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>I have noticed an improvement in the fine lines around my mouth and an overall glow since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be able to get a bottle with this last replenishment.</li>
            <li>They correspond by listing the most active ingredients first..</li>
            <li>started using Vitamin C22 serum about 21 days ago, twice daily, and saw results very rapidly, indeed, including diminishment of fine lines around my nose, mouth and in the&amp;#34;11&amp;#34; furrows between my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft, some fine fines are nearly gone and it seems like the age spots are getting lighter.  </li>
            <li>I received a special offer to try this product, but only after I had already ordered my first bottle of serum.</li>
            <li>By the fifth day I had at least 7 decent size pimples on my face (which is usually fairly clear) and the very fine lines on my forehead were MORE visible.</li>
            <li>All the other positive reviews are spot on :)</li>
            <li>I knew the vitamin C would help reduce the spots, and another popular more expensive</li>
            <li>It is light, has no odor, and is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>After only one week I noticed a huge difference in the softness and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>You are supposed to use this under moisturizer because it allegedly absorbs/sucks the moisturizer better into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the C serum for more than six months, and my skin is noticeably brighter and not as rough.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum, and it seems to be working very well for me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to really make any difference in the appearance or feel of the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for a month and it has healed much of my hormonal cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much....</li>
            <li>I knew I would be gone for two weeks and really wanted to start using it immediately</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I really look forward to applying serumtologie C serum every day.</li>
            <li>I also really appreciated the informative insert that explains the ingredients and what each one does.  </li>
            <li>My face feels much tighter and looks brighter.</li>
            <li>The seller has been very helpful in the correct way for me to use the product.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny so far</li>
            <li>product really works...</li>
            <li>If you are questioning whether this is the real deal don&#x27;t, go out and buy it now.</li>

            <li>Havent seen much results yet in weeks of use but skins seems to look a bit smoother.</li>
            <li>This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li>I also saw my pregnancy mask that I have to use a ton of concealer to hide, get much lighter.  </li>
            <li>The sun damage on my chest is also much lighter with these two products.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>and it took just about that much time for this to really strut its stuff.  </li>
            <li>this helps others who have been in search of a vitamin c product that &#x27;really</li>

            <li>It keeps my skin smooth and glowing with regular use.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is looking so much prettier now, who needs makeup?  </li>

            <li>I feel this has really helped with my skin tone as well, having over 50 skin that is not even toned this</li>
            <li>is really helping to even it out.</li>
            <li>It really helps my skin soak up the moisturizer resulting in moist plump skin</li>

            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>This serum works very well on my mom&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>As a cancer survivor I am very concerned about what skin products I use.</li>
            <li>This serum has worked very well for that.</li>
            <li>, she is very concerned about the customers welfare and very helpful with any questions about their products.</li>
            <li>, this is really making a difference in my skin</li>

            <li>So much softer now.</li>
            <li>and I looked like I&#x27;d been working too much.</li>
            <li>After three weeks my skin is so much softer and looks healthier.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be helping, but is a very gradual change.  </li>
            <li>and i have really seen quite an improvement.</li>
            <li>I ordered two bottles of this and received them in a reasonable amount of time considering they were on backorder.  </li>
            <li>the brown spots from too much sun over the years are almost gone.</li>
            <li>but I really dislike smelly products on my face.</li>
            <li>This is reasonable for this type product and i will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely</li>
            <li>but then why don&#x27;t I see any real effects?</li>

            <li>and I really like what I am seeing in the mirror.</li>
            <li>This for me is very drying and obagi</li>
            <li>and I really have to rub it in.</li>
            <li>Its really in the 5-6 weeks that you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;ve got a winner.</li>
            <li>Too much moisturizer and SPF might be causing acne problems - its in foundation and blush.</li>
            <li>Its really in the 5-6 weeks</li>
            <li>Too much moisturizer and SPF might be causing acne problems - its in foundation and blush.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>This is working very well for me since I&#x27;ve added it to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>The product really seems to help reduce the look of lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>I also like their customer service and very efficient on time deliveries.</li>
            <li>I received it yesterday (which was really fast), applied some in the evening after washing my face, woke up to a virtually line-free face.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m a it of a skeptic, having read that no lotion really works.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know if it would as fast on someone else).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am very picky about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using as much foundation</li>
            <li>and I really think I can see results</li>
            <li>but it really does wonders</li>
            <li>I have been using this product faithfully for about 3 weeks and really haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my wrinkles</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much about it yet,</li>
            <li>it deserves every star I gives it... and the price really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>The Ph is important for it to work properly.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any change in my face.</li>
            <li>now Deja Vu wants $199.?</li>
            <li>Save your money doesn&#x27;t really work as advertised.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>the instructions tell you to use  to cover my face and neck, since it drys on your skin fast.</li>
            <li>So I thought I was going to ran out fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>at  reasonable  price</li>
            <li>so very  please  to  endorse  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought about reducing the amount of the serum I was using, and reducing the frequency - but the dryness and acne were just too much to deal with.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¶ I did not notice any change in my faces texture after using the whole bottle</li>
            <li>the personal customer service I received from Vanessa Powers was so fantastic that I needed to.</li>
            <li>, I did too, and I suppose some them do, &amp;#34;they do want you to buy&amp;#34; but this one really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so I guess the improvements are real and noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>This seems to be working although it takes awhile to really see results.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels much softer and clearer.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the near future!</li>
            <li>Entering my 50&#x27;s and noticing some lines in my face that I&#x27;m not happy with, I decided it was time to look for a serum that might help to keep my skin more healthy as I age.</li>
            <li>It has been a very short time using this product, but I love the way it leaves my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so appreciative and grateful to your company for showing such interest in your individual customer&#x27;s impressions!</li>
            <li>One day I went completely without makeup and a random lady literally came up to me and said I had the best skin of anyone she had ever seen.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft, but not noticing results different from many over the counter creams I have used.  </li>
            <li>My skin still hasn&#x27;t completely recovered, but it&#x27;s starting to get better.</li>
            <li>This company is really good,  I would try their other product since they demonstrated that they really believe in their product and back it up with real guarantees.</li>
            <li>probably over-did use at first and had to buy a 2nd bottle quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am new to using Vitamin C serum, and this is the first time I have used Serumtologie&#x27;s Vit C serum.</li>
            <li>I applied this serum directly on the bump for two days and that bump popped right on out.</li>
            <li>It absorbs right in and even her sensitive skin has had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients of this product are more like topical supplements for your skin, contributing to collagen production, supporting connective tissue and destroying damage causing free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have also used many more expensive products in the past that aren&#x27;t nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and baby soft, and the fine lines around my frown line are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to give a skin review, but so far so good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see what future use of this product will produce!</li>
            <li>I am 21 days into using this product, and there has already been significant physical changes to my skin!  </li>
            <li>I did start out using it every other day, just to do be sure.</li>
            <li>More so than other porducts I have tried (and there have been plenty-</li>
            <li>Probably ok for other skin types.</li>
            <li>Vanessa had mentioned they have tried many other preservatives but haven&#x27;t found one as yet</li>
            <li>The texture is lovely and after about a week of using it only once a day (with no other &amp;#34;leave-on&amp;#34; products)</li>
            <li>My girlfriend seems to think so too as I caught her using it the other day :)</li>
            <li>They have kept up their rigorous skin care regiment&#x27;s and go to the spa regularly but not any more than the past and since taking this they have stated they feel better...</li>
            <li>On some days I still have to apply a moisturizer over top of this, but I can do that every other day now, instead of every day, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t have the viscosity of most other Vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li>and I did  not have one stitch of makeup on and he was staring at me very intensely which made me very self conscious</li>
            <li>the dropper gives perfect control and it sounds weird, but a drop really will cover about half your face (unless you have a huge head I guess)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several &#x27;C-E-Ferulic&#x27; products from various companies and find the combo particularly effective for my skin, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new providers.  </li>
            <li>Thought my skin would feel softer after applying it, however I‚Äôm fine with it as long as it does what it‚Äôs supposed</li>
            <li>Old.). While it hasn&#x27;t done much for the couple of laugh lines I have, it has smoothed them out just the tiniest bit, and the general texture and &#x27;look&#x27; of my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s a power of the positive thinking I will give it another try and order a new bottle.</li>
            <li>It is a very thick serum, which is nice, and drys quickly.  </li>
            <li>When I do use the product as directed morning and evening, the area around my eyes seem to be plumper, and my face is more dewy, when I put on a little makeup, I feel like my skin positively glows.  </li>
            <li>I have only started using this C serum for a little more than a week, however I completely love the texture (non-greasy formula that drys quickly, however does not irritate or dry the skin as some serums do).</li>
            <li>In this day and age, personal passion and outreach are special.</li>
            <li>I have used many other serums from high end to boutique serums.</li>
            <li>Not only is this product as good as advertised, the people behind the company are genuine too.  </li>
            <li>I recently turned 53 and was looking for something more than my normal facial moisturizers, so I experimented with several different age fighting lotions though the past year, and the best one I have found has been Serumtologie C serum 22.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m going to give this product a full 60 days and have ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be thouough and honest with my review as usual to help people make a decision and some of you may have never used serums.</li>
            <li>55 yrs young and married 33 yrs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than average and provided some moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>It has improved my dark circles and I don&#x27;t have to use coverup any more.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s with a pretty active/healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li>did get as a promotion for a disccounter price , but I will definitely order again at full price.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen change so far in terms of skin brightness, tightness, pore size, fine lines, etc, but I have been using it only for 1 week</li>
            <li>I am seeing slight improvement in my skin texture and fine lines after using for a week and a half, however, the smell of this product is kind of a turn off.</li>
            <li>This is my new must have!</li>
            <li>They immediately informed me that it was not -- that it must have gotten by their quality control, they refunded my purchase price, and were also shipping me out a new bottle!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the most amazing product I have ever used on my middle aged, sun damaged, acne scarred skin.</li>
            <li>If the skin isn&#x27;t gently removed, new collagen isn&#x27;t going to be made by our bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was reluctant to use a new product, but this worked out really well.</li>
            <li>I would never write a review good or bad if I wasn&#x27;t honestly satisfied or dissatisfied with a product.</li>
            <li>She said my face seemed to have less wrinkles, more fullness, and &amp;#34;bounced back&amp;#34; when she pressed on my skin - and, I&#x27;m 60.  </li>
            <li>.Better product with 2% more vitamin C than Obagi and less money.</li>
            <li>Have noticed that my skin is much more hydrated, and use less moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is responding with better clarity and is less blotchy.</li>
            <li>No, she has not reversed 10 years, but her cheeks and face look a bit more lifted and the wrinkles around her eyes look less pronounced.  </li>
            <li>Wash your face well, dry, and just lightly massage this serum into your face.</li>
            <li>Customer service is also very helpful in their follow up after a few weeks use to see if I was satisfied and had any questions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am soooo much older.  </li>
            <li>Although Ascorbic Acid can be an irritant and actually cause acne, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is considered gentle and stable and waits to convert into Ascorbic Acid once it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>However, studies done in Australia by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification Scheme found that it should only be used in concentrations up to 5% in most formulas, and up to .1% in sunscreens because it was found to be a moderate irritant and sensitizer in rabbit skin, as well as an eye irritant.</li>
            <li>I know this is a part of growing older</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different serums and this one seems to be good.</li>
            <li>Not sure if higher vitamin C % always means better product.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought it was to try to revive my eye area.</li>
            <li>I am an older woman</li>
            <li>Good product, helps keep thin dry skin moist and looking nice especially under makeup!  </li>
            <li>I ordered Serumtologie after having tried a similar product that quickly lost efficacy.</li>
            <li>I like the design, blue bottle for protection of serum with light, clear indication of ingredients.</li>
            <li>Genetics (  my  area is  mainly in  vitro  Genetic Toxicology).</li>
            <li>far as wrinkle reduction goes, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any of that, but I would think that would take much longer than 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be placing a second order for this Serum as I&lt;br /&gt;am already noticing that my skin is feeling more relaxed &amp; is plumper without any swelling etc.</li>
            <li>Price was decent</li>
            <li>I particularly saw a difference in my hands immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 years old and often get positive comments about my skin.</li>
            <li>Even tho OZ states there is Vitamin C in their product I don&#x27;t feel there is enough to really give anywhere near the full benefit of Serumtologie.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and had no reactions to the product (something which happens to me about a quarter of the time with what I try at the department store!)</li>
            <li>I haven‚Äôt used it very long, but in the few weeks that I have used it, its amazing!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to anyone looking to add C serum to their routine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and buy again</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to people-</li>
            <li>Even though this product didn&#x27;t work for me (too drying), Serumtologie has a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend that you try C Serum ¬∞22 so that you too could join us in using this revolutionary, anti-aging product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Have tried all the high end products, Institute Esterderm, Skin Medica,  etc.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum and this seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I started doing some research and learned that sometimes high concentrations of vitamin C and &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; oils/ingredients can change the pH of the skin and cause acne and dryness.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I do not have too many wrinkles in general and they are not too deep as I have always been pretty religious when it come to skin care</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also using with the Electric Auto Micro Needle Pen Skin Therapy...please see my review for the steps there on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product or any C Serum.  </li>
            <li>and this surpasses them all with HIGH VIT C 22% plus other necessary skin loving nutrients.  </li>
            <li>and I also take some collagen/hyaluroinc acid - advanced formula, type 1,2 &amp; 3 supplements by ‚Äúyoutheory‚Äù that work from within, this combination has really worked extremely well for me.  </li>
            <li>I will be posting rave reviews in trying to help other people like me feel like they are purchasing a product that actually works and is cost effective.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not watery like so many other ones and it leaves my skin feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>Now about the serum ... product has a rich, thick consistency and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>maybe a little better.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely improved after the first week!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the little things :)</li>
            <li>It has all the ingredients found in the stellar Skinceuticals CEF product but with two major differences.</li>
            <li>You must give this a try first before you start trying to do other things that cost more, like going to a plastic surgeon, etc., which may not then be necessary.  </li>
            <li>Even on my throat and jawline, the skin has firmed up a little and looks better.</li>
            <li>but I am dosing it a little better now&lt;</li>
            <li>I have used many c serums that usually &amp;#34;go bad&amp;#34; after a certain amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the possible effects of this serum, but I decided to try it after I&#x27;d heard and read so much about Vitamin C being very good for refining the skin surface.</li>
            <li>The one thing she likes best about it is that it doesn‚Äôt have a bad odor like some brands of C serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50 year old guy just getting into this whole skin care thing.</li>
            <li>Light herbal scent, coverage is about as expected, and leaves skin looking brighter.</li>
            <li>gentle to sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think my wrinkles had faded all that much but saw a before and after photo and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like the product.</li>
            <li>and it really leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>No negative side effects.</li>
            <li>&#x27;They also offer a discount on the next bottle with cost being $5.00 and a complimentary jar of &#x27;whipped &#x27;chiffon Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I get compliments on my skin all the time, and as a person who&#x27;s often out in public, it&#x27;s nice to be mistaken for being ten or twelve years younger than I am.</li>
            <li>I am using it continuously for the last year and contiue to order because its worth it.</li>
            <li>My face looks much fresh and younger.</li>
            <li>My skin is normally oily but with this product it now glows rather than &amp;#34;oul&amp;#34; shines...</li>
            <li>I even get pimples in places that I don&#x27;t normally get them-neck and chest (I tried using it here</li>
            <li>Love the product, can tell the difference in my skin after few weeks of use</li>
            <li>(is that normal?).  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that I didn&#x27;t have any sort of tingling sensation upon first application, as I did with my experience with the obagi product, especially seeing as this product has a higher percentage of vitamin C.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to what may happen after a few more months.</li>
            <li>My skin really does feel smoother and more firm to minimize sagging!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one to waste money on the latest beauty trend.</li>
            <li>refunded me the full price of my first order, and told me my next purchase would only cost $5 as they were giving me a discount.</li>
            <li>rarely write reviews, for this experience, I simply had to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Serumtologie is pleasant to use, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes in my skin yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normal to combination.</li>
            <li>young I want to age with beautiful skin, not skin that is shot up and looks fake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a few times so far, my skin feels nice and soft in the morning?</li>
            <li>product has listed more natural  or Ayurveda/Chinese/Herbal products in it that have a vast history of various uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is fantastic, the first few days I started using it</li>
            <li>I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I normally would wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Vitamin C serum brands in the past and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as a good purchase.</li>
            <li>AND I live in Florida which has tremendously high humidity</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 29 so no hard wrinkles...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it very long but love the ease of use and overall feel of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different lotions/moisturizers but they did nothing for my extremely dry irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>I used 5 drops each morning and night and on the third day my face started to break out, and began to feel more dry.</li>
            <li>I love the seller of this product that stands behind it and answers my questions so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this product is very well reviewed so it&#x27;s likely something to do with my unique skin chemistry that didn&#x27;t click well with the product.</li>
            <li>I have found my new anti-aging secret; it truly is like a primer and moisturizer in one, dries so quickly and stays on in even in this super hot weather!  </li>
            <li>I had a couple of mole like growths under my left eye that raised up and with my nail they scratched right off.</li>
            <li>I find this combination gives better results than just plain c serum.  </li>
            <li>You only need about 5 drops and right away you could feel the tighten of the skin especially around the eyes.(good right).</li>
            <li>SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]]</li>
            <li>For the first time in so long, I actually felt confident enough to leave my house without foundation.</li>
            <li>When the dropper no longer pulls any serum out then you can easily just turn the bottle upside down and shake some onto your finger using the finger as a stopper so it doesn&#x27;t go everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Plucking is not an every other day occurrence any longer, I can go for a week before I notice that in the light I have hairs popping</li>
            <li>, and so far I think the Skingenixx is a little bit better.</li>
            <li>For a Vitamin C serum this one is nice and thick and feels like it penetrates deeper than the more watery 20% serum I&#x27;ve been using in the past.</li>
            <li>I hope not too get ahead of myself as I am trying a variety of new products but</li>
            <li>I set out to find a new product to try and landed in Serumtologie.</li>
            <li>so this was new for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>new skin care  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and get a lot of sun exposure, so a Vitamin C serum was recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>This is my new go-to product</li>
            <li>But would the product live up?</li>
            <li>keep trying and inserting a new item in your core regime.</li>
            <li>keep trying and inserting a new item in your core regime.</li>
            <li>Every day I put a drop on a new spot that showed up on my hand and it didn&#x27;t fade or change in appearance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This appears to be my new wrinkle guard, (&amp; I have skin sensitivities )</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I can live without it...</li>
            <li>It is a great deal for the cost and it only takes a few drops, so one bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs important to close the dropper bottle as soon as possible or the edge of the bottle gets a buildup of white coating.  </li>
            <li>I have used the serum for about 3 weeks now, and the other day at work a peer commented on how my face looked so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I love the consistency and feel of this serum, especially compared to the very watery consistencies of the previously mentioned products.</li>
            <li>The only downside is I am not a huge fan of the scent, which to me is kind of banana.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has to be said that I emailed the company with a couple of questions and they were extremely helpful and very efficient!!!  </li>
            <li>You will waste so much more over on over the counter products that aren&#x27;t nearly as affective and natural as this!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for almost 4 weeks and my skin is very soft.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and my wrinkles are getting softer too.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for 2 weeks, but like the feel of it on my skin very much.  </li>
            <li>my face felt very soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, but this product causes no irritation and leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 49 year old african American women with fine line on my forehead and blemishes on my face</li>
            <li>Since using this my skin has never been so clear!</li>
            <li>This is the first facial skin product I have ordered again!  </li>
            <li>I know of other brands that have same ingredients for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and I believe the fine lines around my eyes are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I just used this product for the first time last night after receiving it in the mail</li>
            <li>Weirdly I was able to screw open the top without breaking the seal.</li>
            <li>She has been using the serum religiously since it first came out, and was recommended to her by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Truth Serum Vitamin C Serum for the past 4 years and love the smell, the way it made my skin feel, and</li>
            <li>My fine lines seemed plumped up and way less noticeable.</li>
            <li>This morning, for the first time ever, I awoke with an actual glow to my face.  </li>
            <li>I recently had a facial (b day present to self, the spa tried to sell me their serum, I showed them the one I ordered from amazon, the spa said it had better ingredients than their serum.</li>
            <li>I have tow other similar products and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>However this purchase has a different and funny smell...</li>
            <li>My skin is softer &amp; fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>WoW!.</li>
            <li>I usually  do not  review  </li>
            <li>And by far, this one is!  </li>
            <li>I will write another review once I have used the serum for a while, but as far as customer service goes -- they can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this skincare product a five star review because as a cosmetologist, the ingredients surpass even the most expensive products that are similar to this one,  and the price is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I am pretty basic.  </li>
            <li>(I usually never break out on my cheek and forehead region</li>
            <li>skin texture is soft supple and radiant !</li>
            <li>, I probably could actually go WITHOUT make-up for the first time in FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my skin just within the past week.  </li>
            <li>When younger, most of my summers were spent with full days on the beach under the harsh sun and without much use of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I have to say WOW!</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better without any allergies what I usually get.</li>
            <li>I first opened the bottle, I noticed that the color and feel of the serum is very different</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t have wrinkles but the fine lines around my eyes seem less visible.</li>
            <li>My skin looked and felt different within the first week.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and it looks healthier!  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>So, I ordered the first bottle of this serum back in June.</li>
            <li>Since I ordered  the second one recently, I should say that I am not disappointed with  the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, I&#x27;m more of a review reader.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m anxious to see how much more improvement I see over time.  </li>
            <li>I try to be consistent, but occasionally miss an evening.  </li>
            <li>Over time, I have noticed that my fine lines and wrinkles are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Anyway, initially the price and the eligibility for Amazon Prime put this product to the first place</li>
            <li>My skin is 70 years old and needs added tender living care, and this seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li>I noticed a visual difference after the first couple of applications.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure that you double check before using it with other cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands that advertise that they help aging skin with wrinkles, skin discolorations, firmness, and the texture, but so many have failed to do anything.  </li>
            <li>I felt like I was 15 years old and going through puberty all over again!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>But I have noticed a pretty big change in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and instantly leaves my skin feeling tighter and noticeably more firm.</li>
            <li>Second is that I see the results and it is taking a little time but it is worth it to me to have that healthy younger looking and feeling skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it morning and evening to get its maximum potential and I always apply my serum on clean skin prior to the rest of my skincare products.</li>
            <li>I also had a major wrinkle between my eyebrows and it looks like it&#x27;s been fading away!!!</li>
            <li>I am always a bit sceptical when it comes to starting using a new product as my skin is pretty sensitive but with Serumtologie C serum</li>
            <li>For the first time in many years I am actually seeing an improvement in my dark circles and overall skin tone.  </li>
            <li>What makes this product different is the 22% NATURAL vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate) which is Vitamin C in its purest, most organic form, and will not irritate the skin like other brands.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for your skin as long as you are comfortable with the low percentage of preservative in C-22.</li>
            <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t empty the bottles so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and feel that my use of this product for the past three to four weeks has brought results of softer, and more even toned skin.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my skin soaked this stuff up - my face felt soft and looked brighter when I woke up the next day.</li>
            <li>First, the serum texture is not soft liquid or thick and it is very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So far, the serum seems to be working on my face, my Skin feels very soft and healthier</li>
            <li>With just the first use, my face was instantly smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes were definitely less noticeable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks now, and yes, I have seen&lt;br /&gt;some initial positive results.</li>
            <li>Overall she is satisfied with the product but final results will be updated over the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so kind to my delicate skin!</li>
            <li>I guess maybe it works better on younger people who have less damage to start with.</li>
            <li>Hard to describe, but definitely looks better!  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older I have noticed that my skin just looks older - not necessarily lots of wrinkles, but it is just not looking as refreshed.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and tight feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and this product is gentle enough not to cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li>Your skin soaks it right up with out being greasy tacky or dry.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my face feel right after I wash, dry and then apply this both morning and night.</li>
            <li>I specially love it&#x27;s gel base coz it doesn&#x27;t drip and gets absorbed easily .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C based serums before, but they were either not concentrated enough to be effective or laced with so many other ingredients that they felt heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt that the price is phenomenal--have you seen those $200 bottles of facial serum??!!</li>
            <li>My large nose pores are noticeable smaller.  </li>
            <li>wife is 33 years old, and although she hasn&#x27;t spent her youth in such abusing environments, during the past 7 years that I&#x27;ve known her, she has always been trying to find that perfect product to add to her daily facial routine.</li>
            <li>I found it to work really well, i had a lot of wrinkles and as of right now i believe half of them have gone.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth &amp; you just need a little bit.  </li>
            <li>but I feel that my skin needs a little more moisture, so I ordered the Pure Whipped Chiffon Daily Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>She gave me 4 ingredients to look for ‚Äì Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (the most pure and non irritating form of vitamin c), Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, and Vitamin E or jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>I decided to continue usage for another week and while the spot on my cheek has faded a little, more red spots have come to join it.</li>
            <li>love getting my little blue bottle out every morning and</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a product with more than 1% hyaluronic in it.</li>
            <li>No skin irritation and I have really sensitive skin on my cheeks due to mild rosacea and this does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely evened out its pigmentation from acne, the pigmentation wasn&#x27;t that strong to begin with, but other products didn&#x27;t work like this one did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few days, and although I haven&#x27;t seen any huge changes, my skin already feels noticeably tighter.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks and see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>My skin is sooooo soft and pores really are smaller!!!</li>
            <li>lighter and clearly continued use will make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I also think it has helped clear up my chin acne.</li>
            <li>I am using this to clear the rosasia break out.  </li>
            <li>I use this twice a day on clean, slightly damp skin.</li>
            <li>I am young and don‚Äôt have any real wrinkles yet but am prone to the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>product makes it clear that it is not tested on animals, its vegan and its paraben free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am using with no problem.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin tolerates it well</li>
            <li>And, as thanks for making my experience known to others out there I will be receiving another bottle of C serum 22 at a deeply discounted rate!!! ...  </li>
            <li>My face is much smoother the lines on my face are starting to disappear and the blemishes appear to be fading.</li>
            <li>It has make my skin so soft, clear and brighter since using it for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I can see the change already.. received product a day early..</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>Sellers are prompt and professional.  </li>
            <li>I am open to trying additional products from this company as they seem very dedicated to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>We have been using the serum for nearly one month now.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels really soft too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 74 years old</li>
            <li>I would definitely  recommend this serum to anyone who wants to see a noticeable change to skin tone and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 74 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the serum morning &amp; night for 3 months and my sun spots/sun damage has completely faded away .</li>
            <li>skin is soft and the spots are fading!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin does NOT break out from this product.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ve got to use a product regularly, and for at least a month or more to see real skin changes.  </li>
            <li>Completely odorless.</li>
            <li>so I mix up my regimen as far as all</li>

            <li>I have mature, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but so far works</li>
            <li>The company emails direct suggestions of use as well as response to review.</li>
            <li>They asked me to offer my review directly here and gave me a discount code for participating.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product,  </li>
            <li>It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>almost like its old.</li>

            <li>Much softer and smaller pores.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and truly believed my skin was beyond improvement.  </li>
            <li>so she can start early to prevent lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li>Skin tighter and smoother, as well as soft.</li>
            <li>The hyperpigmentation on my face has faded considerably (though not gone) and there is a youthful radiance to my skin that I thought I would never see again.  </li>
            <li>Please try, you will be surprised.</li>
            <li>Totally unexpected.  </li>
            <li>Its much cheaper that than the big name company.  </li>
            <li>After 1 week of using this product my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>Vitamin C ‚Äì highest professional grade&lt;</li>
            <li>It is really helping me with skin tone, especially with fading some scars.  </li>
            <li>So far I like the softness of my skin after using C serum.</li>
            <li>After using a friends Obagi brand professional C Serum (20%)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not cause any discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Well, since then I have been looking for a vitamin C option that worked with my sensitive</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a month, but not had any noticeable changes so far.</li>
            <li>So far I like the serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39 years old with dehydrated, oily skin that is sensitive and prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>women/men, that already are in a mature age, you WILL see a difference.</li>
            <li>but I am 40 years old and a lady at a party told me I looked 30.  </li>
            <li>Valerie, owner of Serumtologie, contacted me directly and offered a refund.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended I start using a vitamin C serum since I am in my early 30‚Äôs and in the pre-wrinkle stage.</li>
            <li>Then the company emailed me asking me how I was liking the product so far.</li>
            <li>I also have a short beard and it&#x27;s feeling much softer, nicer to touch, and healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No miracles for seventy-fouryear old skin</li>
            <li>The box is classy as well as the bottle label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that it contains all natural and organic ingredients and that it is manufactured in the USA.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin and Vitamin C is ascorbic acid</li>
            <li>I am over 50 years old.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of anti aging and wrinkle products This product far surpasses them all&lt;</li>
            <li>And he has a professional eye because he  is a specialist in&lt;br /&gt;Botox</li>
            <li>I gave it  4 stars because this is a work in progress for a 60 year old.  </li>
            <li>I use this as my sole moisturizer in the morning because my face tends to get very oily within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 52 year old nurse</li>
            <li>A bit too early to tell...</li>
            <li>My 66 year old skin has noticed diminishing lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and my skin tone is showing improvement.</li>
            <li>So far seems to work well.</li>
            <li>but she does not have sensitive skin with these types of products.  </li>
            <li>After only one week my cheekbones are noticeably tighter which is really encouraging.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been enough time, yet, to see much difference on my forehead</li>
            <li>It really has made a big difference in the moisture that is retained in the skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and have been a Obagi user for years.</li>
            <li>i have been using this moisturizer for nearly two weeks</li>
            <li>There are no side effects so far.</li>
            <li>It surprised and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>But I never ever made a second purchase coz, frankly they didn&#x27;t do much difference to my skin.</li>
            <li>I am 60 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and have been a Obagi user for years.</li>
            <li>As for the feel, oil-management, and natural skin calming properties, this product does the job well.</li>
            <li>however I am 60 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for two weeks, and so far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li>So far I like the results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has now been 3 months since using this product and I just want to say I am amazed at how soft my skin feels .</li>
            <li>This serum will leave you with silky soft skin and hydration immediately after applying.</li>
            <li>I like this but haven&#x27;t noticed any marked changes in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it aside from my skin</li>
            <li>, I was presently surprised.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(I am 63 years old.)  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, this company really cares about their customers, feedback and future ordering.  </li>
            <li>My hands and neck look young too.</li>
            <li>After I used the entire bottle, my skin felt so much smoother to the touch and</li>
            <li>I  am a  72 yr  old  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Definitely much softer and pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li>and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I began noticing a change in my skin after only a few days but absolutely love how it  dramatically changed my skin in just 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>C serums must be at least 17% vitamin C to be effective, and this one goes above and beyond at 22%.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So overall, for me, Serumtologie wins for hyperpigmentation and overall skin improvement vs Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li>The serum feels silky on my skin and absorbs quickly, a perfect base for makeup -</li>
            <li>The serum is a good buy for the price and will also save me a trip to an expensive salon.</li>
            <li>merely because it makes my face feel good.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more hydrated, the dark splotches are unnoticeable and the dark spots have lightened so my freckles look normal and separate!</li>
            <li>High concentration of active ingredient at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It takes very little and is easy to apply I use both morning and evening</li>

            <li>Not to say this product doesn&#x27;t do what it promises, but the other formula worked much, MUCH better for areas of hyperpigmentation and it really helped to keep my skin firm.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face smooth throught the day the only thing i dont like is it dries by the time u get to the other end</li>
            <li>When you first start using it, it makes your skin dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to spend a few more bucks to hold on to my youth just a little longer.</li>
            <li>I started using it following a micro needling skin procedure which had already improved the fine lines and dark spots on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I only use it at night because it makes my face feel super dry</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say nothing about reducing the fine lines yet, of course I have to wait a little bit more to evaluate this effect (at least 30 days!).</li>
            <li>My skin seemed to soak it up in the first few uses and felt really moisturized although each time I use it my skin almost feels more dry and tight-</li>
            <li>I have only the very tiniest fine lines, but they are smaller everyday.  </li>
            <li>I ordered my first bottle in mid February and just now needed to order my second bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple of higher end, more expensive brands - both of which work well;</li>
            <li>I no longer have to use the serum sparingly and can now use more on my neck and decolette as this bottle is only a fraction of the price from what I used to purchase in the past.</li>
            <li>I have used it for two days and not seeing any results yet, but now realize the first bottle was making a big difference, especially since I had gone off of it.  </li>
            <li>When i saw the serumtologie I decided to give it a try, mainly because it has the C listed at 22% vs. the 20 that I was currently using.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous moisturizers over the years, but now that I am growing older</li>
            <li>My skin feels absolutely soft and I feel s major difference.  </li>
            <li>Contains active vitamin C unlike many other products that claim to contain vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this company and will provide further updates during the review process.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the use of these products especially if you been searching high and low for these types of solutions to no avail.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why this product had such high ratings.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly but I noticed that the fill line was a bit low for what I expected in a 1 oz. container.</li>
            <li>I used to have blemishes, little red bumps under my eyes and lots of fine lines around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li>glad that I tried it but am sorry that it did not produce any noticeable positive results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m crazy about the ingredients, they are amazing!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s reasonably priced and it lasts a long time if you follow directions.</li>
            <li>Only a drop of my old serum would be enough to cover my face and neck, and it really did even and brighten my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed much success with minimising my dark spots.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and smoother after using it for a few weeks, and although I purchased it for the promotional price, I would repurchase at full price.</li>
            <li>I was skepical at first, and the price was a little high, but I order it anyway.</li>
            <li>my skin is definitely softer and not nearly as dull.</li>
            <li>It keeps my fine lines practically unnoticed while my skin looks nourished and younger.  </li>
            <li>Serumtologie is hands down worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Compared to Paula&#x27;s Choice C15 booster this one wins hands down.  </li>
            <li>For years I have been searching for the perfect serum, trying one different brand after the other with one disappointing experience after another. .</li>
            <li>I purchased this just to try a new vitamin C serum before repurchasing a different brand.  </li>
            <li>I also had 2 dark spots on my lower right cheek that are gone now too.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any real differences in her appearance yet but she hasn&#x27;t used it very long.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and this really makes my face feel moisturized, without looking or feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>C+ hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Amino Complex Professional Strength (available through Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really helped with my dry skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin is overall much smoother and glows from the extra hydration.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>As someone with Celiac disease and who makes every effort to keep unnecessary chemicals out of my life, I am also thrilled that the makers of serumtolgie has taken the time to put in only quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find 22% Vit C and such good quality for this price.  </li>
            <li>But it is, because the liquid is thick and rich-feeling, going on easily.</li>
            <li>I purchased the C serum 22 a few weeks ago and have very positive results so far.</li>
            <li>I have seen a major difference in her face</li>
            <li>I know it can take time to see major results, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li>and it helps my face look extra young and plumped!</li>
            <li>Let me just say that I have now received MAJOR kudos for introducing her to C Serum ¬∞22.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it&#x27;s higher in vitamin C - 22% than any other similiar products which helps heal the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and night and have noticed major improvements in my skin.  </li>
            <li>My pores are barely noticeable and my skin is glowing!</li>
            <li>I would be interested in the other products you recommend.</li>
            <li>The bottle had no safety covering and was only half full.  </li>
            <li>This product is tacky and leaves my skin feeling tight, as though the product did not get absorbed.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry skin out &amp; after using this for 2 months, the brownish skin around my mouth has brightened to my normal skintone again!</li>
            <li>I have used many different Vitamin C serums for the last few years as part of my regular skin maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very few wrinkles and they are significantly diminished by using this product.  </li>
            <li>have always had very oily skin and have large pores and lots of deep little blackheads.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little sticky but well absorbed in my skin.</li>
            <li>When I am older this is definitely something I would use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other brands that irritate my skin or just plain don‚Äôt work.</li>
            <li>I have used other C serums that have similar ingredients, but less C and cost much more.  </li>
            <li>and I expect to see some results due to the number of positive reviews these products have received.  </li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t had any sort of bad reaction or sensitivity to this serum, so I&#x27;m happy there.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t believe in serums or lotions for help with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>In general, there are plenty of C-Serum products on the market.</li>
            <li>the sun spots I&#x27;ve acquired through the years are starting to clear up.</li>
            <li>, Instantly my face become clear after 2-3 applications.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in my skin, you don&#x27;t need much and so the bottle last a long time.  </li>
            <li>This is a professional grade serum that will help make your skin younger looking, glowing and diminish those age wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Terrific product and doesn&#x27;t cost near what Dr. Oz recommends.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product so far that heals faster than all of the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Serumtologie has stopped my occasional breakouts and has made a marked improvement in the texture of my skin and pores without any drying.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have been using this for close to a month with not much to write about and was ready to add this to my &amp;#34;don&#x27;t buy again shelves&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>First, I was concerned with the small bottle with the eyedropper, but it is evident that this goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for about 3 weeks, but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised because it seems to have helped in such a sort time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it on faith and have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly sensitive to smells of facial products.</li>
            <li>it has made a big difference in the way it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and would suffer occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am a 44 year old female.</li>
            <li>The fact that this serum is all natural and organic is a big plus  for me.</li>
            <li>My first impressions: A+ Packaging - check, Safety Sealed - check, Dark Bottle (to keep vitamin C from oxidizing) - check.</li>
            <li>To make sure it&#x27;s not my vision getting progressively worse</li>
            <li>Great...even though I use prescription Renova, this product did a better job of removing the top thin, thin layer of skin on my face and hands.</li>
            <li>The price was great and so much less expensive than what I was using.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry combo skin.</li>
            <li>My skin transformed in less thatn a week with consistent use.</li>
            <li>This product is more pricey but is not any better than other less expensive products.  </li>
            <li>I bought two of these bottles when the product first came out since it was advertised for half the price.</li>
            <li>Once I started using this product the lines have lightened up considerably and instead of making me look old, my skin is much firmer and the lines have disappeared (except for one deep, deep set line, but the other 3 have disappeared) and makes me look younger.  </li>
            <li>It REALLY works &amp; does not cost as much as other products that do not work.</li>
            <li>However, it is reasonably priced compared to other Vitamin C serums</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive oils or serums as I have been blessed with good genes and don&#x27;t really look my age.  </li>
            <li>The formulations from each of the various makers seem similar, but I find the texture of the C serum 22 from Serumtologie to be superior to other brands--it has a slightly different viscosity (slightly thicker, less watery/oily)</li>
            <li>My face feels extra soft and definitely smoother.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to have an impact on skin -- no real, noticeable reduction of discolored areas or lines.</li>
            <li>Not only that, Amazon is actually where the product is sold by the manufacturer so this is not diluted, old or imperfect in any way.</li>
            <li>I had a small brown patch on my forehead when I first started using this product and after about a month, it was completely gone....and has never returned.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday I was out and about all day without foundation - only Serum C and moisturizer/sunblock - and I am old enough for Medicare!</li>
            <li>am a 34 year old male who has never used any type of facial moisturizers or serum before.</li>
            <li>It has 22 percent Natural Vitamin C, have noticed a visible difference after only one week of use.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I can see that this bottle will definitely last the full month, if not more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products over the years and they don&#x27;t even come close to this.  </li>
            <li>As your complexion gets acclimated to the product, my skin does feel smoother and not dry.</li>
            <li>The consistency is great, not too thin or too thick.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an unbelievable deal for such a high quality product, I&#x27;ve spend several times as much for others that didn&#x27;t measure up to this C Serum 22!</li>
            <li>but so after only a few uses I see a very positive effect.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin and sun damage.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have major problems with my skin, except recently breaking out as a result of side effects from a medication.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôve tried several serums, and have seen some major results with the Serumtologie.  </li>
            <li>It has made a major improvement in the texture of my facial skin.</li>
            <li>I have spent $$$$ yes in the thousands on face products and was going to purchase the NAME BRAND with the high price tag &amp; then looked at ingredients</li>
            <li>especially her dark spots have diminished quite a bit (they are still there mind you) but her face seems brighter and more plump after using this product everyday for the last 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Nothing stops the hands of time but this certainly slows it down.  </li>
            <li>I use this with other serums, VoilaVe and/or Protoxyn, so hard to tell which is better.</li>
            <li>I have used many other vitamin C serums and this formula leaves my skin hydrated and smoothed whereas others left it feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li>This product really helps eliminate dark spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Even the very stubborn dark spots on my face have lightened.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much softer and a definite glow that I had not got from my other &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>After using the entire bottle, I didn&#x27;t notice much improvements compared to other Vitamin C products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>There was a litterally 5 second tacky/sticky feeling but then after that, yout skin feels totallt bare like you have not put anything on your face at all but</li>
            <li>no red meat, oily fish, plenty of water and green tea, 30+ natural sunscreen, plenty of vitamin K from greens, lots of whole grains, veggies and exercise 5 times a week...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not totally sure how it works yet, but I seem to think that the lines around my eyes and mouth are not as distinct.</li>
            <li>I noticed the softness within the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I am a pretty firm Paula&#x27;s Choice buyer because her products work.  </li>
            <li>What I notice now is a new smoothness (no dead skin) and a slight softening of the lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>and I am very optimistic based on the other user reviews and the clinically-proven ingredients!</li>
            <li>I know unbelievable, right?</li>
            <li>that 8 drops will then be placed on the tips of one hand, you rub your fingers together and put product lightly on forehead, down next to eye (where crows feet are) then come down cheeks, across upper lip and across chin.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend who lives in another city commented on my skin, when I told her what I was using, we high fives each other because she said omg, I&#x27;m using that stuff too.  </li>
            <li>But I knew that I wanted a high concentration of vitamin c along with other ingredients that are known to improve your skin.</li>
            <li>Other than that i would highly recommend Poppy Austin products to anyone.</li>
            <li>Less is more--so a product has to really sell me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or irritate and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but when I did and told them exactly what I&#x27;m telling you here, they offered me a discount on my next purchase, which I have not yet accepted yet but will later, as I would like to continue using this at less cost if possible.</li>
            <li>I have not had this long enough to make a complete assessment, but for the three weeks I&#x27;ve have&lt;br /&gt;been</li>
            <li>After a few months and after being convinced w/ the positive reviews, I gave in and purchased the serum, eye gel &amp; moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am especially upset because my cheeks have been clear for so long and now it looks bumpy and there is a red spot that will take forever to go away...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say anything about wrinkles not long enough.</li>
            <li>Seems to work about the same as other high end anti aging creams.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a real change in my skin, smaller pores, firmer and less wrinkles</li>
            <li>I know dark spots its not the main function of this product</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it particularly works well under my eyes, dark circles lightened, firmer looking--</li>
            <li>While I was blessed with good skin, I spent years living at the beach, and did have a few dark spots, all of which have practically disappeared on using your product promotional for the last few months, and, for which I am thankful.  </li>
            <li>The only issue i have is a little to much oil, since i have oily skin.</li>
            <li>It seems less dull, fine lines aren&#x27;t as visible, and the couple of age spots I had are barely visible now.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product -- like many others, I have also used several different expensive lotions and creams with little or no visible results.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good value too, for</li>

            <li> It works so good for her</li>
            <li> I am delighted and will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Feels so good after using it.</li>
            <li> A good friend of mine turned me on to this product.</li>
            <li> have read that hyaluronic products are good to use for aging skin.  </li>
            <li> It looks a good product.</li>
            <li> good it is.</li>
            <li> This is so GOOD to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;‚Äã</li>
            <li> It is a product that is good to mix with others.</li>
            <li> and I feel fairly optimistic about it.  </li>
            <li> I do have good skin</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist if she felt the product was a good one</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good shape with no damage to the package.</li>
            <li> I do take good care of my  skin</li>
            <li> good price and good seller</li>
            <li> am happy with this product make s my face feel really nice</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> so It think its a damn good product.</li>
            <li> I did venture out and use another product from another manufacturer and it was not as good and caused some break outs.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and on the sides of my neck (just under jaw on each side)</li>
            <li> The quality of the packaging and design is exceptionally good.  </li>
            <li> I LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I knew I needed a good vitamin C serum to do the job.</li>
            <li> The eye gel feels somewhat of a hot/cooling sensation and tightens up as it dries - good sign.</li>
            <li> Since i didnt get good results I researched again and found Serumtologie.</li>
            <li> I hope it does as good a job as that did1&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.....</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and hope that if you order a bottle your results are as good as mine.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> The product goes on smoothly and my skin absorbs it wonderfully.</li>
            <li> As a guy I bought this because I wanted something that would be good for my skin but was not pore clogging.</li>
            <li> but this product is so good</li>
            <li> and they assured me that it would be a good combination as the serum would act as a &amp;#34;delivery device&amp;#34; for the retinol cream.  </li>
            <li> this is a good idea</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of compliments already on how good my skin looks (and I am 60.</li>
            <li> Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As always - good luck.days.</li>
            <li> Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As always - good luck.</li>
            <li> The price seems quite good for this C product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s good about this product?</li>
            <li> this is every bit as good as the $100 stuff.</li>
            <li> It may well be that all the products combined contribute to keeping my skin in good shape.</li>
            <li> Good serum, keep upright.</li>
            <li> I loved this serum.</li>
            <li> Yes,  you  do  have a  good product.  </li>
            <li> The product is still good</li>
            <li> Good value for the money .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> I tried the product and it&#x27;s a really good product, it made my skin feel cleaner and firmer.</li>
            <li> A man approached me at the grocery store and told me I was a beautiful lady and that my husband is very lucky!</li>
            <li> if any of them have helped me significantly, but they feel great on my face!</li>
            <li> Great packaging and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I spend 2 months researching the top notch Serums - best known, best rated - but, all with a very high price tag.  </li>

            <li> away.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your product and your kind manner in dealing with your customers.&lt;br /&gt;Breck</li>

            <li> I tested this product for I love to review and loved it.</li>
            <li> The delivery is interesting (an eye dropper), and the serum seems to do a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is perfect this way for all skin types and has never broken me out and in fact has helped my acne.</li>
            <li> Will give honest star rating once I have used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> The delivery was agreed days I feel satisfied with the good product entrega..muy</li>
            <li> It feels more even - skin tone and texture wise.</li>
            <li> So I received this product as a promotion for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I could get another at a reduced rate as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the 22% Vitamin Serum and Moisturizer  -</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion in return for candid feedback.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it has made all the difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In return for my candid assessment expressed in this review, I did receive the product at discounted price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> I value my appearance but I don‚Äôt have that kind of money.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion in return for your candid feedback.  </li>
            <li> Continuing to use serumtolgie as I have now for a couple of weeks, I can honestly say that this will now be part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> so I was using a powder form popular at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 2 weeks and honestly don&#x27;t see a bit of difference.</li>
            <li> Using it for about 2 months and loving it.  </li>
            <li> It does hydrate my skin and it smooths my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all and soaks in nicely on my 50 plus (age) skin.  </li>
            <li> Felt nice but saw no difference.</li>
            <li> Honestly, were in not for the fact that my skin gets so oily in this humidity</li>
            <li> you can then use your favorite spf moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> product I find is packaged well and absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I wanted spectacular</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!  </li>
            <li> Loving this product and will keep buying again and again.  </li>
            <li> received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> To be honest I have not seen any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> received the product as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback.</li>
            <li> Using it for about 1 months and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> it kind of clumps up</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s a kind of &#x27;graininess&#x27; to the feel of my skin just after the serum dries.</li>
            <li> The review of this item was received as a part of a promotion in return for candid feedback of this</li>
            <li> I liked the product.</li>
            <li> but I liked it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and has a lovely consistency at a good price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the eye dropper, would have liked a pump for the applicator</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it is a vegan product and organic.</li>
            <li> After two months, the skin on my face is smoother than it has been for years and still has that really nice glow to it.</li>
            <li> Really liked the feel of this on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed quite a nice difference after using the serum.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to wear under foundation or alone.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this serum!!</li>
            <li> This serum has been WONDERFUL and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an enhanced glow as it has greatly helped my skin!  </li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and easy to use application too</li>
            <li> Great Product,  pleasant - fresh, feels like it tightens and skin seems to love it</li>
            <li> This company is new and the customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> Has a light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been blessed with a good complexion, thanks to great genes.  </li>
            <li> advice is not to give up if it doesn&#x27;t work immediately, as some lucky people have experienced, but give it time to work with your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used Obagi Vitamin C serum, La Mer serums and others and upon switching to this product, I can honestly say this is FAR superior to ANY serum on the market!!!</li>
            <li> Because of this it takes more to cover one&#x27;s face and neck, but that&#x27;s okay if it&#x27;s doing a good collagen building job.</li>
            <li> the serum is easy to use - and so good for the skin...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more confident going without makeup!</li>
            <li> I look forward to more products by Serumtologie.&lt;br /&gt;God bless!  :)</li>
            <li> Awesome for even sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Pretty good feeling when you try it in the night and pleasant results in the morning.</li>
            <li> Everything is even, no dry spots and no oily spots, just perfectly even, for which I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> A nice, very light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re doing something right!!!  </li>
            <li> I read about her on the Serumtologie website and she is not only a beautiful reflection of her own product but a very nice lady as well.</li>
            <li> The consistency and feel of the serum is very nice, and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum, it go&#x27;s on very easily &amp; makes my skin feel so soft, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 wks now</li>
            <li> In my personal opinion the product is very very honest (good value for the money too!)</li>
            <li> The Ann Webb serum goes on like a very light oil and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell there is no substitute to Botox, but this serum is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best serum I have tried to date.  </li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product and feel the price was more than fair and reasonable.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no miracle like Botox and fillers, but as far as a serum goes, this has been the best.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m very impressed!!</li>
            <li> I just turned 60, which I was not overly thrilled about, but I have to say that my face sure doesn&#x27;t show my age.  </li>
            <li> I was not overly thrilled about, but I have to say that my face sure doesn&#x27;t show my age.  </li>
            <li> This and the Rejuvelle serum were the 2 that were most effective for me...on par with Skinceuticals...at a lower price.</li>
            <li> So far I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Using it in combination with a derma-roller is even more effective.</li>
            <li> Like a nice refreshing drink for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> About a week after using it, people started telling me how bright and smooth my skin looked.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!!</li>
            <li> First, it is simply &amp; beautifully packaged.</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft an bright!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Vitamin C product In April, I have used Paulas Choice at 45.00, I have used Timeless, which does not stay well in the bottle, I have used  Peter Thomas Roth, Dr Denese, This Product is by far the very best I have used to date.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my best so far.</li>
            <li> On top of that the company (Serumtologie) is as amazing as their product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Serumtologie is cheaper and more effective.</li>
            <li> This one is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> but I read in an article that for my age (I&#x27;m in my early 30s), the best thing would be a Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Out of kindness I am receiving more of C22 on a promotion for giving an honest opinion of this product.</li>
            <li> it is much more cost effective than you would think.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a week now and seems nice but need to give it more time to see results.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and have many comments on how nice my skin is.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best as it seems to penetrate and work on the deeper layers of skin, not just the surface.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of the C serum after I finish this bottle to maintain the kind of skin this product has helped me obtain.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, i can already see an increased smoothness in eye creases, frown lines and laugh lines</li>
            <li> So far I am really impressed by this product!</li>
            <li> This product is the right balance for me because I get my kick of vitamin C without having experienced the rash that has followed with drug store products and some makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can see the changes in your skin very quickly!  </li>
            <li> and  is a very  fine product.</li>
            <li> , wasn&#x27;t sure if there was a noticeable difference, but people have been commenting how wonderful and young I look!</li>
            <li> WOW, does she love it!!!  </li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite and a great cheaper alternative!</li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice, and serum itself makes my skin feel very smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> Some products with mild fragrance don&#x27;t bother me but there are some which are not so pleasant to my sense of smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding, it felt wonderful to receive such a nice compliment.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and great customer service.  </li>
            <li> going to re-order more right now!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I loved it right away‚Ä¶such a nice product.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> The serum works beautifully, dries quickly, and leaves the skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product I used it for month first before I rated</li>
            <li> Smells great and sooo much product!</li>
            <li> Works great after first day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any others because after the first bottle, I turned from a skeptic into happy customer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moreover, it feels great on your skin, not slimy or too oily which I really like!</li>
            <li> My skin texture has changed drastically , it looks more smooth and healthy, I am delighted  and planing to continue using it .thank</li>
            <li> My skin tone and fine lines have improved!</li>
            <li> I have ordered twice now and my wrinkles and fine lines are disappearing!</li>
            <li> It has softened fine lines and even gotten rid of blemishes!</li>
            <li> Very light, absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Worse to try.</li>
            <li> Makes my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> The staff is very attentive and accommodating.</li>
            <li> The product is very light weight.</li>
            <li> but I have liked this one the best and intend to keep it as part of my long term skin care routine.  </li>
            <li> Worked great at first, but haven&#x27;t seen any progress since then, but no regression either :)</li>
            <li> Soaks into skin quickly with a good results.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t look feel oily and it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> With some very good ingredients, no alcohol or perfume, this serum dries fast and results are seen very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to leave a positive review on all accounts of this serum :)</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use I can honestly say that my skin has a more even tone, the fine lines are easing up and to my surprise</li>
            <li> The products are priced very fairly and have a nice feel to them - the added Vitamin C was a big motivator for me.  </li>
            <li> did brighten my face a lot which I loved and felt great, love this product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a wonderful product for us.</li>
            <li> Is this better than the others on the market?  </li>
            <li> I do love the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> You will be amazed within a week on how much better your skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I reviewed many products on line before ordering this one and I am pleased w/ my choice.  </li>
            <li> As a hairstylest and a Nutrition Consultant I am confident to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it seems to have done that :)</li>
            <li> I think Vaseline moisturizer for men does a better job and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> , I am in love with this.</li>
            <li> Taking away the rosea I have had for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Would love the lines on my face to disappear...</li>
            <li> ; I feel more confident using c22</li>
            <li> my face has a youthful glow to it, even skin tone, I got on top of age spots before using this product, but I can say while using this product the age spots have not returned.&amp;#34; I will continue to use this product I am 47 and will buy it as a gift for my sister who is 54.</li>
            <li> I love how it works</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and you would need a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> I love C serum 22.</li>
            <li> My face is more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My niece has remarked that my skin looks better than hers</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve been using Skincelticals C E Ferulic about 3 years, but I decided to try another product with more vitamin C, so I researched and found Serumtologie.  </li>
            <li> I really love this serum</li>
            <li> After about a week, my skin looked more refreshed and clearer.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> He said it is okay.</li>
            <li> I love to see the way his skin looks.</li>
            <li> We bought three more bottles</li>
            <li> I received email that inquire if the items arrive safely.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this serum.</li>
            <li> I could immediately tell my skin felt better--plumper, softer, more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used SPF30 for more than 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Everybody looks better with a tan, but there&#x27;s a price to pay.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to heal blemishes, brighten skin, refresh facial coloration.  </li>
            <li> and I would like to thank you for making this so FANTASTIC and AFFORDABLE!</li>
            <li> great team for hopefully a promising product</li>
            <li> Love this serum!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Just received this product and already love the way my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> I am so, so pleased with serum c 22</li>
            <li> Cheaper and better than a differnt vitamin C I was using before.</li>
            <li> I really love the feel of this item on my face.  </li>
            <li> Although Vitamin C can be an irritant, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is considered safe and stable.</li>
            <li> My skin color is much better as well as reduced signs of wrinkles..  </li>
            <li> and I was able to wear it under my makeup this morning as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product -</li>
            <li> You have a winning product.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> My favorite out of all my serums.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels firmer and has a much more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> so I was worried that it would make my skin even more oily, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before.</li>
            <li> I am so confident to go without makeup .</li>
            <li> My wife love this vitamin C</li>
            <li> I bought some for my sister and my best friend and can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough!  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product since November 2014.  </li>
            <li> so you have to use a moisturiser on top of it.</li>
            <li> just love it.</li>
            <li> Simply the best!</li>
            <li> Liquid doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; like an oil, mostly water.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff - really has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li> Received this yesterday and saw the plastic seal around the top.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My face appears more youthful with the use of this serum.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel smooth!</li>
            <li> , I love the way both products work together.</li>
            <li> and woooow you see the difference unlike most serums/creams.</li>
            <li> I also love that it has Vitamin C, Hyluronic acid and vitamin E.</li>
            <li> I use this as a serum and my retinol moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> I am about to purchase this item, I am so hopeful that I will see results : )</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m confident in saying that Cserum has done what it says it does.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin firmer and more hydrated when used in conjunction with a moisturizer on top of this product.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> but the product is ok.</li>
            <li> She is pleased with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to see the benefits of more hydrated and even skin tone and hope that with continued use it will get even better.</li>
            <li> and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will continue using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet...</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will be reordering hoping that by keeping it going it will help get rid or tighten more.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and healthier and the color is more even.  </li>
            <li> Partly because of the packaging, in that the dropper style versus is the pump is much more user-friendly, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Also, the serum itself had the most smoothing and moisturizing results.</li>
            <li> I will post more when I have used the serum more.</li>
            <li> Totally in love of this products.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am a self-confessed skin care junkie, must have tried it all, and this delightful product will definitely stay in my arsenal...forever!</li>
            <li> LOVE the results it provides.</li>
            <li> Just ok, didn&#x27;t see a difference so</li>
            <li> and I love it ...</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> if you like the scent or not :-)</li>
            <li> I do love the way it goes on and feels.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see more results the longer</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> What more can I ask for??</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Good product an well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I look fantastic !  </li>
            <li> I have used many Vitamin C serums</li>
            <li> Completely in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> The hydrating qualities are more noticeable when the weather is warmer or more humid.  </li>
            <li> And also better when the serum is used both day and night - twice a day without skipping days nor applications.  </li>
            <li> I find I get better results that way.  </li>
            <li> however, this product produces better results, in a fraction of the time, for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> give my opinion since I don&#x27;t know&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on the backs of my hands and they do look improved - better texture.  </li>
            <li> I love the feeling of my skin after using the C serum.</li>
            <li> Love this porduct.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> My wedding was probably the most stressed I have ever been, and no break</li>

            <li> I love that it is vegan and has no parabens or sulfates.</li>

            <li> I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels when I put it on</li>
            <li> and I love the results I have seen in my face over time.  </li>
            <li> one of my favorite websides I checked and found serumologie which I tried and found</li>
            <li> the contents is okay.</li>
            <li> I had a good laugh and knew that it was because of your product.</li>
            <li> I thought I needed more than 7 drops</li>
            <li> I still use more than 7 drops to cover my face</li>
            <li> love the feeling of tightening of my skin</li>
            <li> love your product and my skin is getting already all the benefits you described.</li>
            <li> I do see a visible glow and healthy look when I apply makeup.</li>
            <li> My slim is more even tone</li>
            <li> I have noticed softer, more supple, skin that is regaining some of that youthful glow</li>
            <li> I am a skincare junkie and have tried many high-end serums - Prevage, Obagi, Skinceuticals, etc.</li>
            <li> To top it off, my hubby even noticed a change- now that means of course</li>
            <li> I will be a regular customer and happily buy monthly!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I  am a  bit  more of a  critic  </li>
            <li> and  also  more  cautious.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love anything that is age defying.</li>
            <li> I found this Serum to be just OK.  </li>
            <li> this product is okay.  </li>
            <li> Love the combination of ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Lovely</li>
            <li> My skin feels more nourished.</li>
            <li> After 1 day, my lines under my eyes were more noticeable.</li>
            <li> After the 1st week, there is no difference, except the more prominent under eye lines.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I like this serum but don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> However, I think the 15% formula produced better results on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t care for the thicker, more sticky feeling of this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the plus side, this serum was more stable and didn&#x27;t oxidize.  </li>
            <li> Love the product we purchase again</li>
            <li> After 3 days of usage I already notice a difference: my skin is radiant and looks more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results, so I order another one.</li>

            <li> It only gets better with use!!!</li>

            <li> She kindly offered me tips on how best to use C serum 22, recommendations on a good moisturizer and a reduction on my next purchase (which I have just ordered), simply for sharing a candid review.</li>
            <li> Great product - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great and i am highly recomende</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes and mouth are gone, my forehead isn&#x27;t furrowed - there is one noticeable very FINE</li>
            <li> These folks show genuine care about you and really want you to love your product , and go over and beyond to keep you happy for return business.</li>
            <li> my husband says how great I looked and especially that my face was more youthful than ever!  </li>
            <li> This is the first C Serum that I have tried and I really loved it.</li>
            <li> The top was able to be unscrewed without taking off the wrapper that is supposed to secure the top.</li>
            <li> My experience with customer service has been superior, being contacted for feedback by the founder of the company within the first month of using the product.</li>
            <li> this serum is pretty good, I can see my skin has been brighten</li>
            <li> this is so good and for the first time I threw out all the stuff Ii have on my shelf...been using about a month...</li>
            <li> I plan to be a life long user of this wonderful serum.</li>
            <li> I then had to buy another bottle for me because she loved it so much!</li>
            <li> so my skin was already in pretty good condition.  </li>
            <li> If my skin doesn&#x27;t improve anymore than it has to this point using this amazing serum, I will be SUPER happy, however, I can only imagine with continued use I will see even more improvements!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I NEVER take the time to give reviews on Amazon, but I must tell you guys what an awesome company this is and their high commitment to customer service.</li>
            <li> IT IS WORTH IT!!</li>
            <li> The sun/aging spots that I have, significantly diminished during this time period!</li>
            <li> but my skin reacts to products that contain too many ingredients or are too strong.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am extremely pleased with the consistency as the semi thickness of the serum allows for an easy application.</li>
            <li> so I find it applies more evenly and easily on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Love the way it easily absorbs into my skin.  </li>
            <li> nice serum, smooths in quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is good or not, but I haven&#x27;t been washing my face in the morning since I&#x27;ve started using this because when I wake up, my skin is nice and soft and glowy, but not greasy like it used to be.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and the texture is more smooth with a more even skin</li>
            <li> on to the most important part, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> What better testimonial than your husband saying how young and great you are looking...  </li>
            <li> Great product so far!  </li>
            <li> And hopefully it&#x27;ll keep those fine lines and wrinkles at bay :)</li>
            <li> :) I will recomend this to everyone that is looking for a glowing skin and to reduce fine lines</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use the product, my face looks a bit drier and the fine lines around my eyes are more visible.  </li>
            <li> With continued use, twice a day, my skin did start to look better with a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and age spots.</li>
            <li> I am over 50, and have many hormonal skin changes,combination skin, and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> In 3 days I was able to see a reduction in the fine lines I have around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is more of a gel like consistency which makes it more user friendly for me.  </li>
            <li> Also love how easy it is to use and how there isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li> My mother has always had very full cheeks</li>
            <li> Even though I will be part of a promotion as part of my candid feedback, I can honestly say, as a person who has researched and used every type of product on the market, both high priced and drugstore quality, that this serum is what I will stay with.</li>
            <li> Amazing in reducing wrinkles, crows feet, smile lines, and even acne.</li>
            <li> You will love how it goes on smoothly, without an oily feel.</li>
            <li> but when I first received it I used it as directed and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My skin is more elastic and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am really happy so far.</li>
            <li> I am rating these products a 5 primarily because of the company&#x27;s outstanding customer service.  </li>
            <li> It is refreshing to deal with a company that genuinely cares about their customers.</li>
            <li> and I have to admit no cream has had such brilliant results.</li>
            <li> Hoping to not look like a 50 year old bride, lol.</li>
            <li> I am glad this product has been made available for amazon customers.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best $30 spent this year.  </li>
            <li> Was received sooner than expected and package in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> but I am happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin so smooth, and I love the wrinkle-fighting powers.</li>
            <li> There are so many cheap serums out there compared to this one</li>
            <li> I love the packaging of the product - the tinted bottle is important to protect the ingredients from degrading.  </li>
            <li> and that is always an important factor to consider for me :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 66 years old &amp; have complements on how great I look.</li>
            <li> It has smooth out my wrinkles will try it for one more</li>
            <li> Thank you for your sincere service and fantastic products.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and more smooth.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did,  Vitamin C 22 is  absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s one of the most important things for me in a skincare product.</li>
            <li> Most important</li>
            <li> This product was supplied to me for free with the understanding that I made a true review how I liked the product.</li>
            <li> I am happy so far with this item.</li>
            <li> After a good deal of research I came across serumtologie C serum 22, and the reviews really sold me.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and surprisingly hydrating.</li>
            <li> You will not find the fountain of youth in any product, but  vitamin C and a warm smile does wonders.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using all 3 in conjunction with my retin-a at night, I have noticed my skin smoother, brighter and surprisingly, I have NOT broken out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to have that kind of response in companies now a days.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely believe these kind of reviews.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and is well absorbed.</li>
            <li> It is a really good product and at a ver reasonable cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although her best description of what it&#x27;s done for her is, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s AWESOME!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;it works!&amp;#34;, I can confidently say that she definitely looks and is now carrying around a new energy that makes her amazingly seem to be aging in reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the right ingredients &amp; the price is unbeatable!!</li>
            <li> The price is right, and the customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li> and it seems like a great value for high potency Vit. C with clean, non-toxic carrier ingredients.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter, who has been blessed with beautiful skin and is very particular about her own skin care, told me that I was looking &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li> , I paid full price and just want to share my discovery of a affordable vitamin C serum that works!</li>
            <li> I know it was the Serumtologie C Serum that attributed to this wonderful experience as I have been using the other products for months and months</li>
            <li> I ordered the serumtologie C serum for 1) to make my face smoother, shine, reduce tinkles,2) from the excellent reviews from other customers.</li>
            <li> First off, I love this product and it&#x27;s become my holy grail!</li>
            <li> I am really excited to continue using this and seeing my skin improve even more.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try more of this line.</li>
            <li> It is packaged easy to handle and to use.  </li>
            <li> goes on easily, haven&#x27;t seen a change yet</li>
            <li> I love this serum and only paying for shipping is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, however I do use it in addition to an added 5 percent hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product goes on easily and does not make skin oily of irritated.</li>
            <li> found out that you can easily pay over $100 for one ounce of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best Serum EVER-I am in my late 50&#x27;s, since I have been using this my skin looks amazing-</li>
            <li> The company is very quick to respond to questions/problems.  </li>
            <li> The serum is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It seems to work even better when the face is damp &amp; moist after you clean it.</li>
            <li> I believe that the natural way to maintain beauty is always the best way, and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I like the way this is easy to apply and not too runny.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> I love this product - helps keep my skin wrinkle free and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but after trying so many of the most popular skin care lines and seeing no results, it is really good to purchase a product that really does help my mature skin.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and makes my skin feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> It is so incredibly easy to use</li>
            <li> Soaks in very quickly and I can already see progress with the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My skin not only looks better but it feels great.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy not greasy.  </li>
            <li> The serum texture is perfect for smooth application and my skin absorbs it immediately - no sticky or wet residue.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - make this old guy look a lot better than he should.</li>
            <li> Be sure when using this product to always use sun protection so that you are not destroying your good deed with UV</li>
            <li> strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> and he said I still looked beautiful and also 40 yrs old not bad considering I&#x27; m</li>
            <li> I will strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so I took a while to post a review because I wanted to give my honest good opinion and with facial things you cant see it in one day.</li>
            <li> The 22% is considered quite strong btw, so you may need to start with a lower strength.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as those high end products...</li>
            <li> Many skin care regimens require a special formula for around the eyes</li>
            <li> Very light smell that goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> the serum is very light and absorbs quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li> 22% of vitamin C in a skin product is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This is the first time to ever use any kind of C serum.</li>
            <li> have not seen any lightening of a dark spot on my cheek, but am impressed that is NOT darkening during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> First off, I received this product as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback</li>
            <li> You only get one chance to have beautiful skin and taking care of it</li>
            <li> You only get one chance to have beautiful skin and taking care of it</li>
            <li> I purchased the first bottle to try and was thrilled when I found out</li>
            <li> and I have recommended it to all my clients who are looking for that extra edge in having beautiful supple, summer skin.</li>
            <li> My overall tone if much better, Its really is just all you need , the bottle and dropper are perfect to keep the product stable, and it works!</li>
            <li> use this product for many weeks to see a true difference.</li>
            <li> I am an aesthetician at one of the finest spas in Newport Beach and can say without hesitation that is hands down the BEST serum you can buy to beautify your face at this price.  </li>
            <li> Particularly my face is more hydrated with a nice glow to it.</li>
            <li> Obagi is the best hands down.</li>
            <li> I had no irritation, and have very fair and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be purchasing more from serumtologie!</li>
            <li> It did, however, take about 3 months to start to see some of the fine lines going away.</li>
            <li> Over time, I did notice fewer fine lines.</li>
            <li> After a scant 3.5 weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t seen reduction in fine lines or crepe areas.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles and fine lines did not diminish at all.&lt;br /&gt;Am</li>
            <li> I think I may have noticed my fine lines fade a bit</li>
            <li> I really thought the reviews were too good to be true, but now I know they are valid.</li>
            <li> i have not noticed any difference in fine line wrinkles yet.  </li>
            <li> Fine lines have soften and skin</li>
            <li> my skin felt refreshed and hydrated immediately, and within days I saw a visible difference as fine lines began smoothing out and my skin tone brightened.</li>
            <li> It also feels fine and does not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Which is fine.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and the serum seems to have helped with the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also reduced the visible appearance of some fine wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am seeing a reduction in fine lines within just 10 days of using serumtologie C serum 22.</li>
            <li> There has been no difference in the fine lines or the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the softness and slight glow of my skin.  </li>
            <li> fine lines diminished...</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and amazingly fine line and wrinkles are beginning to disappear.</li>
            <li> There was dryness and some fine lines</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any change in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that fine lines are decreasing and</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s softer and the fine lines are minimized.</li>

            <li> My skin feels softer, and looks fuller, making fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li> Fine lines are still visible but fading.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a reduction in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> We have both also figured out that 3 to 4  drops does just fine.</li>

            <li> No change in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the area around my eyes has fewer fine lines</li>
            <li> I like that this product is so potent, it uses a higher level of Vitamin C than most products.</li>

            <li> Lovely product that absorbs quickly delivering noticeable results in days.</li>
            <li> Most of these products degrade quickly because vitamin C is so volatile.</li>
            <li> This product does not have a strong scent and applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am and Mature Man who love good skin, thinks it&#x27;s a mark of class to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I really Love this new product!!!!</li>
            <li> noticing results was not mediate for me as some reviewers experienced so my expectations were high right away</li>
            <li> My skin does look healthier, much firmer and more youthful!</li>

            <li> When my order was lost, the owners sent me a free bottle by rush mail.</li>
            <li> I must mention that Customer service has been fantastic - they go out of their way to answer your questions at lightning speed.</li>
            <li> It is a light weight serum that is applied after cleaning and toner.</li>
            <li> The overall appearance of my skin has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> Serumtologic C serum  is fantastic  </li>
            <li> It goes on my face smoothly</li>
            <li> Simply amazing product, 1 drop and my skin is smoother and ready for my sunblock and primer to hit the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I decided to check out the skin care products available on their site and found serumtologie C22.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E ‚Äì protects skins from free radical damage</li>
            <li> My skin feels so light and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The biggest improvement is that the size of my pores are shrinking and my skin is much brighter and has a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C renews your face from sun exposure damage and free radicals</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had such great reviews but hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I piggyback it on top of my retinol at night, once the retinol has absorbed.</li>
            <li> So totally enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> however I do notice a difference in hydration which we all know helps with keeping our face fresh and smooth!</li>
            <li> Serumtologie fit the bill with all these</li>
            <li> The ingredients are just perfect for exfoliating dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin; however, this product feels smooth and non-greasy upon application.</li>
            <li> The next most satisfying thing, if not the most, is top of the line costumer service.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about five days now and notice a difference in how smooth my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciate the great price for such a quality product!  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks but have already noticed great improvement in my skin texture.  </li>
            <li> how smooth and even my skin tone is compared to 3 days before (before I was using the serum).  </li>
            <li> she said how great I looked and didn&#x27;t know I was using anything different on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed light lines are disappearing as well.</li>
            <li> Comfortable.  </li>
            <li> They offer personal and thorough follow up along with great discounts.</li>
            <li> Light weight without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best - I have been using for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> had a great email conversation back and forth with one of the co-founders Vanessa</li>
            <li> The is such a great serum.  </li>
            <li> After using for two weeks I was complimented on how smooth my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I know I want to use a serum as part of my daily skin care and have been so happy with the results I am experiencing with Serumtologie C Serum 22.</li>
            <li> --my skin looks bright and hydrated--a gift for a mom over 40 with two young kids...</li>
            <li> The serum is light yet, substantial.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and you immediately feel a firming.</li>
            <li> I still gave it a 5 because the product did smooth and moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and moist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever you do - don&#x27;t forget to use a light exfoliate -</li>
            <li> I did not receive this product for free.  </li>
            <li> I already saw a change in my skin texture, color and wrinkles, but after using the product for three weeks, the result are fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the C Serum primarily to reduce mouth lines.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and hydrated and tighter.</li>
            <li> My mom got this for me as a gift, and it has been helpful to smooth my skin and make it feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clear and bright.</li>
            <li> It is a light oil like substance that just seems to melt into your skin.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a pump bottle to keep it from being exposed to air and light, though.</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days of placing the order, well packaged &amp; in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> My makeup went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Item as described, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Gentle yet effective</li>
            <li> My skin continues to feel smooth and firmer as well.</li>
            <li> I am very concerned about our environment and feel that the best place to make a difference is in our personal environment.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizer by this company, but for whatever reason I like the Azure Naturals brand of Vit C serum better as it seems to spread better.</li>
            <li> i am 38 years old with good skin because i been taking care of it since my 20;s</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old and this is just as good as skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 70&#x27;s and have used an incredible array of products over the years, including some very &#x27;well known&#x27; ones.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I am 75 years old and have taken really good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> love it so much that I just ordered 3 more bottles from</li>
            <li> So far so good on the results.</li>
            <li> So far so good in terms of applicability and freshness to the face.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the customer service is outstanding: quick delivery as well as follow-up emails with information on to how to get the most out of the product.</li>
            <li> The first impression of the product was-- pleasant smell and it absorbs fast without leaving your face oily.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product not only for the positive impact it has on my skin, but for the fair market price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and am looking forward to trying your new moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li> I ordered another bottle right away just to be sure I would not run out.  </li>
            <li> *22 is a unique stable form of Vitamin C in a safe concentration that is readily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> There is no bad odor and the liquid is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!!!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the fantastic product and also moved my rating from 4 to 5 star because of the excellent customer service and the money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> That is a company that cares about keeping their customers happy and are willing to invest a bit of money to do so, which suggests to me that they carry that same philosophy into producing the product and are not attempting to cut corners to make a bit more profit.</li>
            <li> think you may find after using this product, that the fix was more simple than you ever thought it could be to regain the youthful element and appearance of beautiful skin, I recommend this product highly!  </li>
            <li> I wanted to give this stuff a chance to make a difference before I left a review, but honestly, I saw a pretty great difference right away.</li>
            <li> I  am  sincerely pleased  to  make  this strong  positive endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;AnnMarie</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product with only the best reviews everywhere.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review, and I highly recommend this along with Serumtologie&#x27;s Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After the first week, my skin felt very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Good for any skin type, and I was absolutely floored by the comments I started getting within the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This serum is easy to apply and absorbs quickly, which I like.</li>
            <li> I have previously worked at a skincare company and am familiar with products of various price ranges, and this serum is incredibly affordable while still offering great results.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple days but in seems to absorb very quickly and that i understand s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky to be blessed with pretty good skin even though I abused it in my early years with relentless sun exposure, most people think I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I use this to calm my skin and it loves it!</li>
            <li> after just a week - are nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or tons of age spots, but this definitely makes me feel more confident without wearing makeup because my skin feels and looks better than before.</li>
            <li> I basically do not think all these products make significant improvements on your skin</li>
            <li> but it has lightened, significantly, the darkened areas.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I could immediately tell my skin felt softer and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I especially love how this product uses vitamin C--I am a firm believer in the benefits Vitamin C provides to the body, including the skin!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and will be ordering another bottle today as I am almost done my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> All the bumps are gone and the lines have reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> As serums go, this one delivers a powerful punch!  </li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and have only used it 3 times but the difference in my skin is remarkable.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful to hear words like &amp;#34;soft, smooth, radiant &amp;#34; in regards to my skin&#x27;s complexion!&lt;br /&gt;So, in my professional and my personal opinion, Vitamin C Serum *22 by Serumtologie is a product</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of all the rave reviews</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how silky smooth and fresh my skin looks and feels in just a few days.</li>
            <li> first, with any shopping experience, as a costumer im most satisfied when I get exactly the product I want.</li>
            <li> Also my laugh lines helped!</li>
            <li> I have been using Retin-A 0.04% for almost a year now and it significantly improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had significant pore reduction.</li>
            <li> I originally reviewed the item as prompt shipping and item as described.  </li>
            <li> I am so very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a hormone issue.</li>
            <li> I received this order super quick!</li>
            <li> I have researched and tried many skin products, and this is by far, is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light allowing my skin to absorb its ingredients quickly.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> It arrived early, and the company has great customer service as well, they seem to really care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean looking</li>
            <li> My skin has a nice glow and the texture is much better - pores smaller, etc.  </li>
            <li> clean face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels better to be over 50 and astonishing people that you have a 21 year old.</li>
            <li> It goes on light &amp; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> most likely the added vitamins that this includes in the formula which is a nice bonus if there are women who don&#x27;t take their Vita C, etc.</li>
            <li> but I clean my face day and night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am pleased to report that during my second month of using this product I have seen amazing results in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products in my 50+ years, some showed positive results and</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, when I&#x27;ve finished the bottle, I can post a most positive review.</li>
            <li> so far,  love it!</li>
            <li> However, I have a few wrinkles when I smile and notice the difference after using the serum - love it!!!</li>
            <li> AT 22% ALONG WITH OTHER GREAT FREE RADICAL INGREDIENTS.  </li>
            <li> :  I am still am completely in love with Serumologie Vit C 22 and have not found any other product to be of the great consistent quality as Serumtologie.</li>
            <li> I emailed the seller with my details and was pleasantly surprise how quick they responded and not only that, they added an extra$20 which they call a goodwill refund.  </li>
            <li> , I started using it 3 weeks ago and because of my age, 63,  I am aware  it could take a little  longer to see the best results.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the long term results but my skin does feel much smoother &amp; best of all, the BEST primer ever!</li>
            <li> The serum is great; got it for my Mom and significant other as a gift (they heard about this product through word of mouth)</li>
            <li> but if it can stop aging process somehow, that&#x27;s good enough...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to buy more very soon.</li>
            <li> the offer made to me as a discount did not reflect my true review on this product</li>
            <li> Will  this product  still being good for such time ?</li>
            <li> One squeeze of the dropper, I can rub it on my whole face, neck, chest and top of the hands.</li>
            <li> I want to return the two bottles I got for a full refund.</li>
            <li> It also requires about 5-7 drops for your whole face and neck, so it&#x27;s not quite as potent.</li>
            <li> I am a skin product addict and love receiving products in the mail and to find out how well they really work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the big name brands for anti-aging and S22 is superior to anything I have seen.  </li>
            <li> I also was surprised to receive an e mail from Vanessa the co founder regarding how I liked the serum.</li>
            <li> On top of that I want to tank the customer service they have because they really care about their customers.</li>
            <li> Nothing is true regarding this product.</li>
            <li> My skin has become so supple and radient, thanks to this product :)</li>
            <li> Finally a product that is good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I love it, I really see the difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Since skin cells take time to rejuvenate you may need to give it a month or two to see the full results.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good product to add into your daily routine.</li>
            <li> Many thanks.</li>
            <li> the wrinkles seemed to sneak up on me all of a sudden, as I have always taken good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It was true.</li>
            <li> I have been a repeat customer of this serum and have referred several friends that have also had good results.</li>
            <li> Will definitely stick with this superior brand.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine that has GORGEOUS skin told me about it and actually lent me a bottle (she bought a bunch at the launch price)</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, I&#x27;m ordering more because now that I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> No bad reactions.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> The serum feels light on the skin and it&#x27;s absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li> This serum is much thicker and richer than the many other vitamin c products I have used and it feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li> but I had a question about the scent and usage of the product and she emailed me right away with detailed answers to my questions.  </li>
            <li> First, it is easy you use a dropper and the consistency of the serum allows you to get just the amount you need.</li>
            <li> One of the most important things for me is the fact that the product is 100% vegan and natural (does not contain Parabens, Sulfates, Synthetic Dyes, Aromas, GMO&#x27;s and Petrochemicals!).  </li>
            <li> I will continue using this product with hopes of seeing the many positive results that this product says that it can do for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company reviews and customer service are very positive.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for keeping price reasonable so this product can be easy accessible!  </li>
            <li> The product also seems very pristine/fresh and appears to have a very good &#x27;shelf life&#x27;--no perceptible yellowing/degradation of the formulation from the first to the last drops!</li>
            <li> I saw great results with the moisturizer, but when I added this, I saw an even bigger difference in my skin&#x27;s elasticity, firmness, and even saw some newly appearing fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li> I will let you know I have used this morning and night a few times when I want to look my best a certain day</li>
            <li> I have been happy with other products, not this</li>
            <li> It feel great going on and dries quickly so that I can put on other products on.  </li>
            <li> I also have large pores and this has made a difference that I can see!!</li>
            <li> She replies quickly to any questions or concerns about the product.</li>
            <li> My wife saw quick results and encouraged me to use the products myself.</li>
            <li> As I get older, it&#x27;s more of a struggle.  </li>
            <li> However, it is considered to be a very stable precursor of Vitamin C that is able to liberate the powerful antioxidant in the skin</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I started using it before the holidays...</li>
            <li> It penetrates quickly into my skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how a product can start working so quickly, but it has.</li>
            <li> Vanessa personally emails you to make sure everything is in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly once applied then</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect this product to work so well or so quickly.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, skin tone is more even, my skin is more supple and youthful looking.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of age, who wants to see an overall improvement in the radiance and tone of her or his skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is now much more clarified, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> skin absorbs it quickly without any drying and it feels hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The company also showed excellent customer service as I sent them a few questions and they were very responsive and answered all of them quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product soaks into your skin quickly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it really seems to work.</li>
            <li> I liked that this company took time to add this thoughtful &amp; personal touch.</li>
            <li> The customer service and follow-up have also be exceptional -- I especially appreciate the follow-up emails with suggestions for application and use.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipper.</li>
            <li> I like that these absorb quickly into my skin and that it feels moisturized with out</li>
            <li> I like the way it goes into the skin so quickly too....</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have tried so many products to tighten,lift and smooth wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, I quickly ordered from serumtologie again.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly, and it has no smell.</li>
            <li> Love the way the serum feels going on, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> my my skin did start looking tighter rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This serum soaks in really quickly.</li>
            <li> Next is Shave using a fun device and good shaving GEL.</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve read Hyaluronic acid is somewhat of a catch phrase right now and the molecules are to large to penetrate the top layer of the skin.</li>
            <li> The serum feels silky on my skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> You have to be quick to order this because it sells so quickly.</li>
            <li> But having the most isn&#x27;t always what matters because a lot of good ingredients are wasted if they don&#x27;t get into the skin on a cellular level and just sit on the surface.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had it in a baggie.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more and just wish it came in a bigger bottle since I love using it on my neck and d√©colletage too.  </li>
            <li> Works quickly.</li>
            <li> Since the liquid is thicker, I ended up using both bottles fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51, and enjoy looking younger than my friends, but yes, I told them about this product too, so it&#x27;s their own fault if they don&#x27;t try it out,</li>
            <li> I have research many similar products and so far I am  comfortable and pleased with this one,  and happy to know that if you have any concerns they will email you back right away!</li>
            <li> I was at the Chanel counter in a major department store and the saleswoman said my skin looked &#x27;amazing&#x27;...</li>
            <li> I can see that it is beginning to smooth the fine lines on my forehead for one and hope to see more results during the next 30 days.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> Best of all, it&#x27;s available to me to buy on amazon and not at my spa with a ridiculous markup!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased and am doing it on another blemish on my neck now hoping to get the same results.</li>
            <li> Brown/age spots are becoming to really lighten.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 other Vit C serums and this is by far the best</li>
            <li> I have tried other C serum products and the Serumtologie C serum 22 is more effective, evidenced by improved skin quality.</li>
            <li> Can feel my face tighten from very first application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for two days in a row but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Overall, a very lovely product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I also have hyper pigmented (dark) spots and blotched areas that are the result of sun damage from my youth and taking birth control in my twenties.&lt;br /&gt;The results I have experienced using Vitamin C Serum *</li>
            <li> This product goes on feeling very light leaving my skin feeling very soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with these products.</li>
            <li> After years of buying online, this is my very first time to write a review.</li>
            <li> First, I appreciate the packaging of the serum in a light protective bottle.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different facial products over the years, and find that with this serum my skin does feel brighter, and it is a great value.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced compared to others I have tried!</li>
            <li> I just purchased my third bottle and am very pleased with its results.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other Vitamin C serums before and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much Serumtologie!</li>
            <li> It is also good price to keep using for long term.  </li>
            <li> drops is all you need, so it lasts a long time and is good value for money.</li>
            <li> I generally do not leave feedback but felt this was a good product worth talking about.</li>
            <li> People comment that my skin looks lovely and are astonished that I am bare of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, I believe that this is an entirely worthwhile product:  highly effective, priced rationally (thankfully), non-irritating (which is normally a side-effect of Vitamin C serums) and with identifiable ingredients (to the best of my own understanding: no fillers, or dangerous chemicals,</li>
            <li> Looking for a quality product with the highest % of vitamin C and not getting discoloration of the serum due to light and opening the bottle with daily use, I found this serum an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> I love finding new beauty products.</li>
            <li> I also try to eat healthy, live a balanced lifestyle, and exercise in moderation.  </li>
            <li> And the forms which are more well preserved aren&#x27;t effective agents on the skin (meaning their not readily absorbed by the skin).&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I can notice a great degree of improvement - both in wrinkles and texture also age spots are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Great product.... Have been using Obagi ,but this seems to work just as well for a lot less.</li>
            <li> Great product.... Have been using Obagi ,but this seems to work just as well for a lot less.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been delighted by the moisturizing benefits of the cream and the wrinkle reduction benefits of the serum since I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a big difference in my face, but that was pretty good to begin with  </li>
            <li> You can really feel and see it working as it blends in very quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum about 2 weeks ago and loved it the first day i used, skin really really gets super hidratated and soft, i wish i had it before like when i was 25 to avoid damage on my skin (29now)</li>
            <li> I find it does leave a strange film on my skin, most notably around my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> a little dab goes a long ways making it even more of a good thing!!  </li>
            <li> Plus, it is more affordable than many other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging of product - good.&lt;br /&gt;Results of product - seem to be good.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed results the first day!</li>
            <li> This product really delivers!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Also, I cannot say enough about the CS  and follow up from the company which I Love!</li>
            <li> noticed after a few weeks that my skin is softer, more hydrated with a beautiful natural glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon first use I noticed that the serum was more cloudy than I had anticipated (and in comparison to obagi professional c), it also almost always has huge air bubbles when I try to ration out the drops onto my finger tips</li>
            <li> What sold me to Vitamin C serum 22 by Serumtologie is its higher concentration of Vitamin C and the PRICE!</li>
            <li> I use this at the end of my evening after I exfoliate and love the way my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it states!</li>
            <li> Of course eating well and exercising are likely aiding in blood flow and better skin along with my skin regimen!   </li>
            <li> Why pay for a NAME when ingredients are what really matters?!?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about a week and LOVE the way my skin feels!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 8 weeks and love it!  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this product by serumtologie at a much better price than the previous product I used.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C isn&#x27;t a very stable ingredient and can quickly lose its potency, thereby losing its antioxidant abilities along with its ability to brighten and smooth the skin.  </li>
            <li> I used witch hazel as my cleanser (amazing &amp; cheap) let it dry and then apply my C22 in the morning and before I go to bed at night.</li>
            <li> I am seeing immediate results, my skin looks great and so tight</li>
            <li> AND YOUR SKIN FEELS SOFT, NOT TACKY, AND VERY SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li> It really made a difference for me diminishing fine lines and brightening my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Suggestion: use hot washcloths to clean and soften skin.</li>
            <li> Great serum it&#x60;s a little sticky</li>
            <li> Looks more even and glowy, fine lines are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a more even tone to my skin and smoothness, and it appears the fine lines around eyes are starting to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goes on very smoothly and absorbs well; my facial skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve not had any problems with any kind of irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I am now on my second bottle of this AMAZING serum and HIGHLY recommend it to all!!!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, but I was looking for a good serum to help reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> thing that I noticed immediately when using this serum, is that when I apply it right before my makeup, it seems to help my foundation go on much more smoothly, my pores are less noticeable, and my coverage is actually better.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews on this product, I was really excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this vitamin C serum after all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, but this lovely serum not only is making my skin look and feel amazing</li>
            <li> I really feel like it&#x27;s a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> I think this helped smooth out my skin but didn&#x27;t do much for lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> This product is a great intensive moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much an isolated area, as it is an overall effect that&#x27;s taken place, Which works for me, someone told me, your skin looks so nice and smooth, what  do you do.</li>
            <li> It keeps by skin baby smooth and very hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Great product, using it everyday.</li>
            <li> After that its light foundation that doesn&#x27;t need moisturizer - it will be too much at that point.</li>
            <li> After that its light foundation that doesn&#x27;t need moisturizer - it will be too much at that point.</li>
            <li> This is a nice C and HA serum, and I like the extra ingredients.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is kind and personal.</li>
            <li> As soon as I notified the company of my dissatisfaction with the product, they immediately issued me a refund and even sent me a complimentary skin care product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some creams with which I&#x27;ve had some success in fading the spots, but I can&#x27;t say the C22 is doing that.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get anywhere near this result with many creams and oils I tried.  </li>
            <li> It has all but removed my laugh lines, and crows feet.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, it is thought to be a powerful antioxidant that can treat acne on the surface and even stimulate collagen, according to RealSelf.com.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I will definitely not only be returning to this nice skin product but also will  be referring my friends to it;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying.</li>
            <li> It is not oily or really moisturizing as like most serums, very lightweight.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed and brightening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also well absorbed .</li>
            <li> I  received the product ( second bottle) as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback.</li>
            <li> I was offered a promotional discounted 3rd bottle in return for my candid feedback</li>
            <li> and I love the product so far.</li>
            <li> You can make this yourself at home, fresh, every week, with 2-3 ingredients.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look fresh.</li>
            <li> but this one is my favorite thus far.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my laugh lines and dimples were relaxing.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to see my skin finally showing an even tone.</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed and I believe my skin looks much&lt;br /&gt;younger</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> far I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling incredibly silky, especially when I use it following the Philosophy Miracle Worker.</li>
            <li> I love the way it dties and makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> In addition, I received a follow up e-mail from the company that was warm &amp; felt personal.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.  </li>
            <li> What I love about C Serum 22 is that it goes on so naturally</li>

            <li> : my skin is incredibly smooth, my skin is much more radiant, and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in my facial hyper pigmentation!</li>
            <li> They did the sweetest most unexpected thing.</li>
            <li> ; email to see how I liked the product and provide tips for not only using the product but maximizing my skin care routine!  </li>
            <li> I noticed that I don&#x27;t need as much cover-up and on many days I can actually get away with a light dusting of powder and be on my way!  </li>
            <li> You may use this at night before bed also for more effectiveness for the skin, but to not waste product I would use it once</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> This serum makes my skin feel so soft and smooth my skin just glows!</li>
            <li> I felt my skin tightened, I use it every morning; sometimes i use vitamin e on top of the serum...makes my skin feel soft....</li>
            <li> Not extremely obvious, but kind of freckle-y looking.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels more hydrated and smoother although I really can‚Äôt see any real visible changes when I look into a mirror.</li>
            <li> My skin also feels taught and fresh.</li>
            <li> It got rave reviews, so it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> Spectacular results in only days...</li>
            <li> I had some marks on my face that are almost gone now - I will be continuing to use this and it will be fun to see the effects in time.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product.</li>
            <li> They are still trying to find ways to make it more natural and organic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and her skin feels nicely refreshed and hydrated and that it helped with her overall skin appearance.  </li>
            <li> The C serum 22 is by far a better product and you see the results.</li>
            <li> I was even contacted by one of the co-founders of this product personally to ask how I liked it.</li>
            <li> Overall my skin looks and feels smooth and more refined.</li>
            <li> after only a week of usage per the instructions (morning and night) work quite effectively.  </li>
            <li> It is by the far the most affordable serum product on Amazon or elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and my make up doesn&#x27;t cake on top after I apply</li>
            <li> It is worth the price we pay for this serum.</li>
            <li> I believe- are so kind and personal.</li>
            <li> has vit C 22%, hyaluronic acid 5%, vit E 1% and ferulic acid 1% -- everything you need for fresh - well hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft, more plump and look healthier.</li>
            <li> I rarely write a comment about a beauty product.  </li>
            <li> the drawers are full of half used lotions and serums).&lt;br /&gt;It has acutally makes me want to take better care because I am seeing better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I no longer can live without it and get a lot of compliments on my youthful complexion which is great because I am not young anymore</li>
            <li> After reading some very positive reviews about the product and its customer service, I decided to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> I understand skin care takes time, and finding the right product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love that it has more hyaluronic acid than any other C serum that I have found.  </li>
            <li> This serum does on lightly, no weird smell, dries quickly without being tacky.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> I no longer work for the company, but I must say, their highest selling serum was FULL of empty ingredients, pure garbage, for twice the price of this superior product..</li>
            <li> I believe caring for the skin at a young age is the best way to avoid major problems later in life.  </li>
            <li> The serum feels very refreshing, glides on smoothly, directions say to use 5-6 drops in the palm of your hand and spread it over your face, but I&#x27;m finding that you don&#x27;t even need that much to cover your whole face, which means it will last longer (an added plus).  </li>
            <li> I‚Äôm a pretty young guy but have spent a lot of time in the sun, mostly on the tennis court and wasn‚Äôt always that good about using sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It really has made my face more vibrant.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
            <li> I knew right away that I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product</li>
            <li> seems to work right  away.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who has been looking for the right serum.</li>
            <li> I began using serumtologie right away, twice a day, and after 24 hours (3 applications)</li>
            <li> I noticed an increased tightness right away.  </li>
            <li> - the price is right</li>
            <li> My sister noticed right away,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything right now</li>
            <li> you notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> the  right  </li>
            <li> right  up</li>
            <li> She says that she&#x27;s using 6-8 drops on her face and neck in the morning and evening right after she cleanses.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I felt a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I know a lot about herbs and this product has the right herbs you need to beautify your skin.</li>
            <li> Not only is the price great, is works well or even better than more of the expensive products available.</li>
            <li> I use three to four small drops in my am serum, before i moisturise and again at night, If you are on the fence on this product, Do not be, Its a great balance of all you need , fresh and works to perfection.</li>
            <li> There is no magic bullet to eliminate aging skin, but this product does a good job of keeping my skin hydrated and safer from free radicals.</li>
            <li> clear and believable description with visible results ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Serumtologie is hydrating and really improved the texture of my hyperpigmented skin and made surrounding normal skin look and feel even better vs Skinceuticals cream which felt a bit drying and didnt improve skin texture for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this both evening and morning and it has been a powerful product in reducing wrinkles, leaving my skin very soft, and most of all, helping me to look ALIVE !!!.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty funny!  </li>
            <li> There is a slight odor, but overall a great product!</li>
            <li> It has softened the lines on my face, particularly around my mouth, and my skin looks brighter and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the look of my skin improved--it looked (and felt) more livelier, more colorful, even though I had not gotten any sun.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled with how soft and smooth my skin felt the next morning.</li>
            <li> My skin feels incredibly soft and smooth and looks healthy and alive.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift, but I&#x27;m sold - hope the price stays down üòâ Good job on the formula.</li>
            <li> My pores are significantly less noticeable and my skin is well on its way to actually being flawless for the first time since I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now, maybe a little more, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I tend to breakout easy, and many other serums have caused me to breakout.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a lack of information available regarding Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate because it is a relatively new derivative of Vitamin C being used in skin care products.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait  to try the  PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I certainly have not heard that before!</li>
            <li> I really like it.it makes my skin feel soft and look better healthier.</li>
            <li> So I have had a few breakouts, but mostly just noticing smoother, tighter, more supple skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Above all I believe this company truly wants to put out a good product for a decent price.</li>
            <li> because it is not only effective, it is extremely gentle and does not irritate my skin in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and feels like it is really helping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 4 days and so far so good...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be happy to purchase a different product from Serumtologie in the future.</li>
            <li> Serums are the most powerful , and finally this serum has the essence of Vit C.  </li>
            <li> Most items temporarily tighten and firm the skin to give it a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> It is quite acne-prone and to keep my breakouts under control, I use benzoyl peroxide which has been really effective but has left my skin very dehydrated.</li>
            <li> Any detriments will be updated on here (they have used two bottles over three months so far, keep wanting me to order more... from my account haha).</li>
            <li> A lot of these kind of products have made my skin feel dry and this does not.</li>
            <li> I applause this company for providing such high quality ingredients at such and INCREDIBLY affordable price..</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes my skin look and feel amazing: tight, smooth, fresh.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a LOT through Amazon over the years and this is THE FIRST TIME a company has actually contacted me personally to ensure I was happy with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rest of my time would be spent either life guarding at highly chlorinated pools or commuting into and biking around the beautiful but auto exhaust infested streets New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a definite decrease of fine lines and skin tone is improving, too!</li>
            <li> I like C22 very much.  </li>
            <li> I like C22 very much.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> you very much .</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very important to know that not all Vitamin C serums are equal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was delivered very fast</li>
            <li> I do understand that a preservative is very much needed in skin care products to kill any bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, the  price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for a product containing both too.  </li>
            <li> The product was very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> I like this serum very much.  </li>
            <li> There are similar products like this on the market, some cheaper and some more expensive, but this one has the highest concentration of good ingredients in effective forms for the price.</li>
            <li> My skin is silky soft and the fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> At 50 yrs old, forehead creases and fine eye lines have also shown improvement.</li>
            <li> If most other companies strive to protect products from light and air, why shouldn&#x27;t this one?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to get the package and try this new products.....</li>
            <li> I also know they have great customer service because I e-mailed the company asking how long a bottle should last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely keep using serumtologie C serum ¬∫22 :)</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth after using.</li>
            <li> I am so very grateful to the developers of this skin product!</li>
            <li> the Rosecea outbreak I had at first has cleared up.</li>
            <li> it is the same thing, it all makes our bodies healthy or not.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, you can almost instantly feel the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when this bottle is gone and buy extra for gifts.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much,all my sun spots are clearing on my face so I have started to put two drops on the back of my hands</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the entire bottle to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> I am using my 2nd bottle and it is looking better yet.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft, smooth and glowing.  </li>
            <li> This product delivers a higher impact and can improve your over-all anti-aging results.</li>
            <li> But man Im telling you, it really kick starts your skin!</li>
            <li> My sister gave me the first bottle of C22.  </li>
            <li> But I will keep on using it as it has made my skin tighter, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finger crossed this will last and hopefully improve my acne prone skin. :-)</li>
            <li> I understood what the common ingredients were for a great serum.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended it to several friends who also love the results.  </li>
            <li> after three weeks my skin looks 10 years younger or more.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more for myself.</li>
            <li> Cosmetics Database finds Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate to be a 99% safe ingredient and notes only data gaps as a concern.</li>
            <li> I have seen improvement with consistent use.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> high concentration of vit c!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After first couple days, her skin feels firmer and</li>
            <li> The first day I applied it</li>
            <li> I was paying $200+ for serums at the Dermatology office and didn&#x27;t get this fast of a noticeable result!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft, smooth and glowing after I use.</li>
            <li> I did after the first week felt my skin smoother and  a lifting effect.</li>
            <li> I have just started my third bottle of this serum, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have so many facial producy ats and cosmetics that I could literally match the stock of 1.5 Sephora stores.  </li>
            <li> I am turning 50 in two weeks and getting married at the end of March.</li>
            <li> but I think over time it will fight the formation of more defined wrinkles simply because it firms and hydrates the skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> Applied to my face and immediately noticed how soft and smooth it got.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the more Inexpensive products that actually seems to work!</li>
            <li> I am almost done with the first bottle.</li>
            <li> serum has made my skin so soft and smooth since the first application.</li>
            <li> My overall skin tone is more even and skin is softer to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Within the first three of you see Denatured Alcohol, DO NOT BUY..</li>
            <li> This is my first time using serumtologie C serum</li>
            <li> I have been using C22 for several months now and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this!</li>
            <li> (it will feel sticky at first)</li>
            <li> First time I feel like I bought a product that is living up to the hype.</li>
            <li> your face is ready for sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s made my skin appear so much more youthful even after a week of daily use.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results and am on my second bottle!  </li>
            <li> I noticed an initial brightening of my skin along with a healthy pinkish tone.  </li>
            <li> But I try different products periodically in case there is something better.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely recommend it for anti aging, premature wrinkles, sun spots and found more even skin complexion.</li>
            <li> Will order more whenever I run low.  </li>
            <li> I researched many C products and finally ordered serumtologie C serum 22 because it does not appear to have chemical preservatives.</li>
            <li> After my first bottle was finished, with results of softening and brightening of my skin, I decided to go with a cheaper alternative</li>
            <li> I saw an immediate improvement to my complexion with the first use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen all of the changes in my skin that I am hoping for but, I am very optimistic!</li>
            <li> Serumtologie C seems to be addressing them all and  smoothing things out, which I tend to notice in the mornings when I first wake up.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how my pores seemed to diminish.  </li>
            <li> This product, however has made my skin feel softer and look more even toned, overall.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, you should do so very soon!</li>
            <li> Love how it feels and feel that my skin looks much younger.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that, but it makes my skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just a shame that it&#x27;s ingredients lists is packed with real power booster good for skin and quite safe as testament that I didn&#x27;t break out which I usually do since I&#x27;m quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS ALSO REALLY AFFORDABLE!</li>
            <li> This costs one third of the cost of Skinceuticals and has more stable vitamin C in it that Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my first 4 days of use.</li>
            <li> But this is the first time I‚Äôve used a skin serum.</li>
            <li> Any comments or insight about the air bubbles, serum color, or feeling of dryness with this product would be greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li> Crowsfeet are diminished &amp; I love the brightness &amp; vibrance that it has given me back.</li>
            <li> and I love the blue bottle...</li>
            <li> this is my first...</li>
            <li> Just received product and felt immediate tightening of my skin after first use.</li>
            <li> My husband has commented on how soft and smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> but the serumtologie C serum has a higher concentration of Vitamin C and Ferulic acid.</li>
            <li> After 23 years of marriage, my hubby comments -- for the first time ever -- on the youthful appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> the first time in probably 30 or more years, I feel confident enough to use no makeup on my facial skin (although I do apply lipstick and eye make-up).  </li>
            <li> the first 3 days</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to protect and hydrate my skin in this hot and humid TX weather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for the first time in my life, I have decided to try out C Serum ¬∞22</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t stop talking about how in awe she is that, being a person that never uses this type of product, the first one I bring home turns out to be the one that&#x27;s ended her seemingly eternal search.</li>
            <li> I have lines above my top lip that were not there before I began using the serum.  </li>
            <li> Trying for the first time.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days, I got some tingling but no redness or inflammation.  </li>
            <li> IT leaves your skin soft, smooth and clears out the sun spots.  </li>
            <li> I really like it !</li>
            <li> You can really see results with this serum!  </li>
            <li> This was my first vitamin c serum</li>
            <li> The serum is light and creamy, and it adds moisture under my moisturizer that I need for my 50 year old + skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin definitely looks better.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but the first time I applied it</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely showing signs of improvement (softer, brighter, more even skin tone).</li>
            <li> the first week .</li>
            <li> Its not expensive</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week and love the results.  </li>
            <li> - I try them first - this is not one I would refer.</li>
            <li> For the first time I do notice a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I hope that it continues to be marketed at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This is the first product review I have ever done.</li>
            <li> In the evening I use the serum first, and then add a retinol cream and massage it</li>
            <li> ;)  4.</li>
            <li> that was a first compliment I ever got from my derma which I go to almost every month.</li>
            <li> I wish I could  get maybe a larger bottle that would be more cost affective.</li>
            <li> At first she thought it was just a fluke and kept using the product</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a vitamin C serum, so I do have anything else to compare to.  </li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended Skinceuticals,  but this product is much more affordable and hopefully will provide similar results.</li>
            <li> I have now ordered my third bottle and have recommended it to many friends.</li>
            <li> He has just now become interested in skin care and is willing to keep trying this serum even though he prefers creams.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of serumtologie c serum 22 and really love it</li>
            <li> I have friends and strangers saying truthfully how much younger I look!</li>
            <li> The first couple od days</li>
            <li> Finally you rub in the Serum 22 and after 2 or 3 days your skin looks better and in my case tightened, by 25%.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an anti aging serum</li>
            <li> Pretty please?</li>
            <li> but when I saw this product I was interested in trying it.</li>
            <li> Powerful ingredients but gentle.</li>
            <li> sure you use the serum properly.  </li>
            <li> After using this product, the bumps, I noticed recently are disappearing and my skin tone looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li> This is the first thing l have ever used that l could feel tightening my skin.</li>
            <li> For years, my wife has purchased many different types of what she calls &amp;#34;wrinkle removers.&amp;#34;  A friend mentioned C serum 22 in her presence, so she just had to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 3 weeks and unfortunately never read the directions to use the C Serum am &amp; pm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second order and will be ordering more for myself and my sister.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This actually has substance to it - not oily - and I love that the ingredient list is short, potent and purposeful.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product religiously for more than 14 days now.  </li>
            <li> overall, recommend, will order some more to see if they can keep it up and like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and glowing with an even, smooth surface.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re both in our mid-50&#x27;s and kind of low-maintenance and no real skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; but I figure that we may as well do what we can to protect our skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on on age spots on my hands and it is working very well!  </li>
            <li> I was using something similar, but it had 15% vitamin C and the fact that this formula had 22% vitamin C was appealing.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first product that did not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin has become more brighter and those tiny acne in my forehead has disappeared.</li>
            <li> , I am willing to finish the bottle and see the results.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, radiant, and clear.</li>
            <li> Second of all I am truly satisfied with the results of using the product.  </li>
            <li> Love this serum and just ordered the moisturizer from the same company.</li>
            <li> , this is the first time I have ever used something like this</li>
            <li> It really does!</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and have a few acne scars on my chin that have noticeably faded.  </li>
            <li> It feels really good on my skin...not to heavy or light, not greasy &amp; no harsh odor.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old with mild adult acne, and I attribute this serum, along with Cerave cleanser and a good retinal lotion, with the fact that the last thing I was worried about on my wedding day, was my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very excited about the progress I am making since I was paying pretty close to the same amount for another brand.</li>
            <li> It has natural organic ingredients which are very important to me, except for one preservative, Phenoxyethanol, which is a moderate concern but they use the lowest percentage amount they can to make it effective, one of the very last ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very promptly and I noticed a difference right away in the over all evenness of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The positive results can be seen in a short period of time - prolonged use yields even better results.  </li>
            <li> (I live in a dry climate) and before applying a light top coat of mineral makeup on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product surpassing other high end brands not only for the high percentage of key ingredients but also for the excellent value.  </li>
            <li> My mom and I have both been using for a few days, great so far!</li>
            <li> The perfect accompaniment to my expensive skin care regime; this prodcut is well below the price I pay for my daily skin collection but is very high in ingredients &amp; its magic results.</li>
            <li> Sun &amp; pollution have taken a toll, but I&#x27;m seeing fewer fine lines and more lift after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I won&#x27;t be needing to try any other serums after trying and using (for about three weeks now)</li>
            <li> My initial shipment had a slight problem (not enough for me to contact them to replace the product or get a refund), however, they did both and gave me a full size of their wonderful cream as well.  </li>
            <li> It contains a very high concentration of free radical fighting ingredients offering protection against environmental contaminants keeping the natural aging process to skin at bay.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and new!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m also happy to also be using an anti-aging product that isn&#x27;t too heavy on my &#x27;young&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> and I really love how my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry but is soft and smooth...</li>
            <li> it comes with the scrubbing auto-brush and if you don&#x27;t clean your face and get the old layers off (which this product is helping to do)</li>
            <li> I need to couple it with a good physical barrier sunscreen (which I haven&#x27;t done well recently) to get the maximum benefit</li>
            <li> but that alone hac marked improvements (from a former sleeping in my makeup kind of girl) üòÅ</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, but used to use a much more expensive serum.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the product does not have a strong scent because I know it will not dry out my skin after a while.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it&#x27;s done more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I had only been using it for about 10 days and  had been really noticing how much better my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> and I felt like I saw an improvement in the texture and glow of my skin and lines around my mouth but wasn&#x27;t sure if the improvements were in my head or if my skin really did look younger at age 65.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time I purchased and the product is very special.  </li>
            <li> Wow...what can I say to convey my sheer delight , first in the fast delivery of this item, the amazing , early results noticed after using this product.....</li>
            <li> I really love how this makes my face feel clean and tight.</li>
            <li> It cannot do plastic surgery obviously but does keep my skin smooth and young looking with fine lines virtually not visible.</li>
            <li> this serum has made my skin super smooth and much more even-toned - a tremendous help with the grey/shadowy look that I was left with after cancer treatments a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I can tell something positive is happening.  </li>
            <li> I have never noticed a positive difference in my skin from any product over night.</li>
            <li> positive reviews I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see any positive changes.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use product and hope for continued positive results.</li>
            <li> I purchased it through Amazon after reading positive reviews.</li>
            <li> But I am very much positive about the product results.</li>
            <li> In 2 weeks they were NOTICEABLY lighter, and now 3.5 weeks they are pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I have one that is $20 higher but just absolutely does nothing like this.</li>
            <li> I honesty can&#x27;t tell if this is working to an exact degree because I&#x27;ve hanged my whole routine at once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure it is not old.</li>
            <li> I have long been acquainted with the benefits of C serum on skin -</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been couple of weeks since the first trial but it looks really working.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way to becoming a holy grail product for me and, for me, the customer service only seals the deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will be a long time user</li>
            <li> Will update when I see more results , as I haven&#x27;t been using it for too long.</li>
            <li> The price is pretty reasonable for trial.</li>
            <li> Haven used it long but love what I see</li>
            <li> I&#x27; m looking forward to seeing the more long term effects.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a stronger vitamin C than the average 20%, however the Vitamin E is in oil form i think</li>
            <li> I have tried several different Vitamin C serums ( including OZ Naturals and Cosmetic Skin Solutions) and have just recently found that this product seems to be the most effective for me.</li>
            <li> It protects/nourishes the fresh new cells which are always being produced and which rise to the surface every 30 days if your 30 and every 90 days if your over 50.</li>
            <li> Amazing results in less than a week of use.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin is not as dry and its texture is much better.</li>
            <li> The smell of the serum is strange, although I don&#x27;t mind it -- it has a sort of a natural kind of smell.</li>
            <li> So if you have dry skin, just add a night cream on top.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and last all day.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say my skin seems brighter and wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The first thing that hits me in the mornings is that my pores are definitely smaller, hence giving me a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> previously used another brand of C serum, and, while it was effective, it exacerbated a skin condition I have called rosacea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on a skin regimen for mild adult acne</li>
            <li> Anyway, that has lightened up considerably, so that‚Äôs a super plus for me.  </li>
            <li> On top of that my skin is naturally dry.  </li>
            <li> They make my skin super hydrated and feeling extemely soft.</li>
            <li> This is a simple and easy thing to do.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old, with generally good skin (medium to dark tan).</li>
            <li> But, to be honest I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I will re-order certainly.</li>
            <li> I purchased s√©rumtologi√©¬Æ PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer and s√©rumtologi√©¬Æ C serum ¬∫22 for my wife at the suggestion of a trusted friend.</li>
            <li> I ordered the PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer along with the C serum22</li>
            <li> Will certainly keep this in my product line.</li>
            <li> It certainly did not anti-age me.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C serum 22 and the Pure Whipped Chiffon moisturizer for two weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I have now been using Vitamin C Serum 22 and Pure Whipped Chiffon for 5 mos.</li>
            <li> use this in conjunction with the ‚Äú100 Pure Hyaluroinc Acid Serum Acid‚Äù, ‚ÄúAvalon Organics‚Äù - Vitamin C renewal moisturizing skin cr&amp;egrave;me</li>
            <li> Maybe I have been buying these Hyaluronic acids which claims to be pure or 100%</li>
            <li> She has large acne all over her checks now.  </li>
            <li> I understand that they now have a companion moisturizer which I will certainly try.</li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t moldy like the Vernal Hyaluronic Acid Pure Skincare Treatment that I bought afterward to try it.</li>
            <li> I have found a new line of skincare !!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to give an accurate review on any wrinkle diminish, but I do know that I love the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> As long as this product is available and the formula remains the same (or better), I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer after the first application and has continued to feel great for the last few weeks that I have been using this product.  </li>
            <li> In the past couple of weeks, I have noticed a definite visible reduction of pores - which was unexpected, but great!</li>
            <li> I have tried several Vitamin C Serums in the past and this by far is the best one that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I am not a frequent user of any beauty or anti-aging products but now that I&#x27;m 30, I was considering something to help me with my crows feet which are slowly starting to build up, too much smiling isn&#x27;t always good...</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday for a month and my skin is softer, smoother and blemish free!!</li>
            <li> am 58 years old and have pretty good skin but have hyperpigmentation on my neck and a few lines on forehead and neck as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff to the other popular one which comes highly recommended -- and it shows.</li>
            <li> I shared my satisfaction and shared how I spilled half the product and immediately ordered another as a testament to how much I was loving it.</li>
            <li> Even though I have very sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t trigger make my skin irritation or any trouble and it also make the skin bright.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminishing, especially my crows feet.</li>
            <li> but  order this seerum for some fine lines under my eyes that are starting to show now  </li>
            <li> Have definitely seen a reduction in fine lines</li>
            <li> I say the phrase &amp;#34;keeping skin healthy&amp;#34; rather than something like &amp;#34;erasing fine lines&amp;#34;, because I believe that can only be done by surgery.</li>
            <li> I have deep furrow lines on my forehead and fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in the fine lines around my mouth and an overall glow since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to get a bottle with this last replenishment.</li>
            <li> They correspond by listing the most active ingredients first..</li>
            <li> started using Vitamin C22 serum about 21 days ago, twice daily, and saw results very rapidly, indeed, including diminishment of fine lines around my nose, mouth and in the&amp;#34;11&amp;#34; furrows between my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft, some fine fines are nearly gone and it seems like the age spots are getting lighter.  </li>
            <li> I received a special offer to try this product, but only after I had already ordered my first bottle of serum.</li>
            <li> By the fifth day I had at least 7 decent size pimples on my face (which is usually fairly clear) and the very fine lines on my forehead were MORE visible.</li>
            <li> All the other positive reviews are spot on :)</li>
            <li> I knew the vitamin C would help reduce the spots, and another popular more expensive</li>
            <li> It is light, has no odor, and is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> After only one week I noticed a huge difference in the softness and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> You are supposed to use this under moisturizer because it allegedly absorbs/sucks the moisturizer better into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the C serum for more than six months, and my skin is noticeably brighter and not as rough.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, and it seems to be working very well for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to really make any difference in the appearance or feel of the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a month and it has healed much of my hormonal cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much....</li>
            <li> I knew I would be gone for two weeks and really wanted to start using it immediately</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I really look forward to applying serumtologie C serum every day.</li>
            <li> I also really appreciated the informative insert that explains the ingredients and what each one does.  </li>
            <li> My face feels much tighter and looks brighter.</li>
            <li> The seller has been very helpful in the correct way for me to use the product.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny so far</li>
            <li> product really works...</li>
            <li> If you are questioning whether this is the real deal don&#x27;t, go out and buy it now.</li>
            <li> face looks absolutely awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No change AFTER USING THE WHOLE BOTTLE.</li>

            <li> I am amazed after just 2 days how much softer my face and forehead feel.</li>
            <li> Havent seen much results yet in weeks of use but skins seems to look a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> I also saw my pregnancy mask that I have to use a ton of concealer to hide, get much lighter.  </li>
            <li> The sun damage on my chest is also much lighter with these two products.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> and it took just about that much time for this to really strut its stuff.  </li>
            <li> this helps others who have been in search of a vitamin c product that &#x27;really</li>
            <li> this helps others who have been in search of a vitamin c product that &#x27;really works&#x27;.</li>

            <li> They really seem to care how their products are working out for you.</li>
            <li> My pigmentation is fading and the skin feels very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin smooth and glowing with regular use.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is looking so much prettier now, who needs makeup?  </li>
            <li> But this one really does do what it says.</li>
            <li> People are very responsive and I recommend their products.  </li>

            <li> Even my husband noticed how much softer and smoother my skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Did not see any improvement after using the whole bottle</li>
            <li> In just two weeks, I&#x27;m finding that I do not need to use as much foundation as I have been.  </li>
            <li> It really has helped to regulate my sebum production and acne and even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> They have helped my skin from drying out too much but haven&#x27;t done much to stop the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended it !</li>

            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The dying effect I didn&#x27;t really care for,  </li>
            <li> I really hope the treatment fades them.</li>
            <li> I have since tossed the bottle and bought the real deal.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed by the results.  </li>
            <li> I apply 2x a day and really appreciate the immediate sensation of tightening and smoothing.  </li>

            <li> I would highly recommend to others who are picky about their skin like I am!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I really like that the serum doesn&#x27;t have any scent.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Facial skin is radiant and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My brown spots are much lighter and my skin firmer.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve the quality of their skin.</li>
            <li> When I told,her,  she said  it is really making a difference</li>
            <li> ‚Ä¶ this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> so I was really intrigued with vitamin C serums and stumbled upon this while browsing Amazon</li>
            <li> I feel this has really helped with my skin tone as well, having over 50 skin that is not even toned this</li>
            <li> is really helping to even it out.</li>
            <li> It really helps my skin soak up the moisturizer resulting in moist plump skin</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin was a lot smoother, and brighter, people really complimented me.</li>
            <li> I am very picky and have tried EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> Skin feels healthier and much softer.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I really like the product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what this is supposed to do, but I didn&#x27;t get the jolt on this one.</li>
            <li> and it really works</li>
            <li> This serum works very well on my mom&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> As a cancer survivor I am very concerned about what skin products I use.</li>
            <li> This serum has worked very well for that.</li>
            <li> , she is very concerned about the customers welfare and very helpful with any questions about their products.</li>
            <li> , this is really making a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> it really helps and wont promote acne wich was my consern because i have oily skin and suffered acne before..</li>
            <li> My face definitly feels a lot softer and my complexion is really got its glow on with this product.  </li>
            <li> So much softer now.</li>
            <li> and I looked like I&#x27;d been working too much.</li>
            <li> After three weeks my skin is so much softer and looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be helping, but is a very gradual change.  </li>
            <li> and i have really seen quite an improvement.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles of this and received them in a reasonable amount of time considering they were on backorder.  </li>
            <li> the brown spots from too much sun over the years are almost gone.</li>
            <li> but I really dislike smelly products on my face.</li>
            <li> This is reasonable for this type product and i will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely</li>
            <li> but then why don&#x27;t I see any real effects?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m hallucinating or if this serum really works.</li>
            <li> really like this serum, and it seems to be working very well for me.</li>
            <li> Really like this brand of vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> and I really like what I am seeing in the mirror.</li>
            <li> This for me is very drying and obagi</li>
            <li> and I really have to rub it in.</li>
            <li> Its really in the 5-6 weeks that you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;ve got a winner.</li>
            <li> Too much moisturizer and SPF might be causing acne problems - its in foundation and blush.</li>
            <li> Its really in the 5-6 weeks</li>
            <li> Too much moisturizer and SPF might be causing acne problems - its in foundation and blush.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> This is working very well for me since I&#x27;ve added it to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> The product really seems to help reduce the look of lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I also like their customer service and very efficient on time deliveries.</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday (which was really fast), applied some in the evening after washing my face, woke up to a virtually line-free face.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m a it of a skeptic, having read that no lotion really works.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t know if it would as fast on someone else).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using as much foundation</li>
            <li> and I really think I can see results</li>
            <li> but it really does wonders</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for about 3 weeks and really haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my wrinkles</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much about it yet,</li>
            <li> it deserves every star I gives it... and the price really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> The Ph is important for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any change in my face.</li>
            <li> now Deja Vu wants $199.?</li>
            <li> Save your money doesn&#x27;t really work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> the instructions tell you to use  to cover my face and neck, since it drys on your skin fast.</li>
            <li> So I thought I was going to ran out fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> at  reasonable  price</li>
            <li> so very  please  to  endorse  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought about reducing the amount of the serum I was using, and reducing the frequency - but the dryness and acne were just too much to deal with.</li>
            <li> ‚Ä¶ I did not notice any change in my faces texture after using the whole bottle</li>
            <li> the personal customer service I received from Vanessa Powers was so fantastic that I needed to.</li>
            <li> , I did too, and I suppose some them do, &amp;#34;they do want you to buy&amp;#34; but this one really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> so I guess the improvements are real and noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> This seems to be working although it takes awhile to really see results.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels much softer and clearer.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the near future!</li>
            <li> Entering my 50&#x27;s and noticing some lines in my face that I&#x27;m not happy with, I decided it was time to look for a serum that might help to keep my skin more healthy as I age.</li>
            <li> It has been a very short time using this product, but I love the way it leaves my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so appreciative and grateful to your company for showing such interest in your individual customer&#x27;s impressions!</li>
            <li> One day I went completely without makeup and a random lady literally came up to me and said I had the best skin of anyone she had ever seen.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft, but not noticing results different from many over the counter creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> My skin still hasn&#x27;t completely recovered, but it&#x27;s starting to get better.</li>
            <li> This company is really good,  I would try their other product since they demonstrated that they really believe in their product and back it up with real guarantees.</li>
            <li> probably over-did use at first and had to buy a 2nd bottle quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am new to using Vitamin C serum, and this is the first time I have used Serumtologie&#x27;s Vit C serum.</li>
            <li> I applied this serum directly on the bump for two days and that bump popped right on out.</li>
            <li> It absorbs right in and even her sensitive skin has had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients of this product are more like topical supplements for your skin, contributing to collagen production, supporting connective tissue and destroying damage causing free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have also used many more expensive products in the past that aren&#x27;t nearly as good.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and baby soft, and the fine lines around my frown line are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to give a skin review, but so far so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to see what future use of this product will produce!</li>
            <li> I am 21 days into using this product, and there has already been significant physical changes to my skin!  </li>
            <li> I did start out using it every other day, just to do be sure.</li>
            <li> More so than other porducts I have tried (and there have been plenty-</li>
            <li> Probably ok for other skin types.</li>
            <li> Vanessa had mentioned they have tried many other preservatives but haven&#x27;t found one as yet</li>
            <li> The texture is lovely and after about a week of using it only once a day (with no other &amp;#34;leave-on&amp;#34; products)</li>
            <li> My girlfriend seems to think so too as I caught her using it the other day :)</li>
            <li> They have kept up their rigorous skin care regiment&#x27;s and go to the spa regularly but not any more than the past and since taking this they have stated they feel better...</li>
            <li> On some days I still have to apply a moisturizer over top of this, but I can do that every other day now, instead of every day, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t have the viscosity of most other Vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li> and I did  not have one stitch of makeup on and he was staring at me very intensely which made me very self conscious</li>
            <li> the dropper gives perfect control and it sounds weird, but a drop really will cover about half your face (unless you have a huge head I guess)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several &#x27;C-E-Ferulic&#x27; products from various companies and find the combo particularly effective for my skin, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new providers.  </li>
            <li> Thought my skin would feel softer after applying it, however I‚Äôm fine with it as long as it does what it‚Äôs supposed</li>
            <li> Old.). While it hasn&#x27;t done much for the couple of laugh lines I have, it has smoothed them out just the tiniest bit, and the general texture and &#x27;look&#x27; of my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s a power of the positive thinking I will give it another try and order a new bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick serum, which is nice, and drys quickly.  </li>
            <li> When I do use the product as directed morning and evening, the area around my eyes seem to be plumper, and my face is more dewy, when I put on a little makeup, I feel like my skin positively glows.  </li>
            <li> I have only started using this C serum for a little more than a week, however I completely love the texture (non-greasy formula that drys quickly, however does not irritate or dry the skin as some serums do).</li>
            <li> In this day and age, personal passion and outreach are special.</li>
            <li> I have used many other serums from high end to boutique serums.</li>
            <li> Not only is this product as good as advertised, the people behind the company are genuine too.  </li>
            <li> I recently turned 53 and was looking for something more than my normal facial moisturizers, so I experimented with several different age fighting lotions though the past year, and the best one I have found has been Serumtologie C serum 22.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m going to give this product a full 60 days and have ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be thouough and honest with my review as usual to help people make a decision and some of you may have never used serums.</li>
            <li> 55 yrs young and married 33 yrs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than average and provided some moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> It has improved my dark circles and I don&#x27;t have to use coverup any more.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s with a pretty active/healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li> did get as a promotion for a disccounter price , but I will definitely order again at full price.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen change so far in terms of skin brightness, tightness, pore size, fine lines, etc, but I have been using it only for 1 week</li>
            <li> I am seeing slight improvement in my skin texture and fine lines after using for a week and a half, however, the smell of this product is kind of a turn off.</li>
            <li> This is my new must have!</li>
            <li> They immediately informed me that it was not -- that it must have gotten by their quality control, they refunded my purchase price, and were also shipping me out a new bottle!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most amazing product I have ever used on my middle aged, sun damaged, acne scarred skin.</li>
            <li> If the skin isn&#x27;t gently removed, new collagen isn&#x27;t going to be made by our bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was reluctant to use a new product, but this worked out really well.</li>
            <li> I would never write a review good or bad if I wasn&#x27;t honestly satisfied or dissatisfied with a product.</li>
            <li> She said my face seemed to have less wrinkles, more fullness, and &amp;#34;bounced back&amp;#34; when she pressed on my skin - and, I&#x27;m 60.  </li>
            <li> .Better product with 2% more vitamin C than Obagi and less money.</li>
            <li> Have noticed that my skin is much more hydrated, and use less moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is responding with better clarity and is less blotchy.</li>
            <li> No, she has not reversed 10 years, but her cheeks and face look a bit more lifted and the wrinkles around her eyes look less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> Wash your face well, dry, and just lightly massage this serum into your face.</li>
            <li> Customer service is also very helpful in their follow up after a few weeks use to see if I was satisfied and had any questions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am soooo much older.  </li>
            <li> Although Ascorbic Acid can be an irritant and actually cause acne, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is considered gentle and stable and waits to convert into Ascorbic Acid once it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> However, studies done in Australia by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification Scheme found that it should only be used in concentrations up to 5% in most formulas, and up to .1% in sunscreens because it was found to be a moderate irritant and sensitizer in rabbit skin, as well as an eye irritant.</li>
            <li> I know this is a part of growing older</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different serums and this one seems to be good.</li>
            <li> Not sure if higher vitamin C % always means better product.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought it was to try to revive my eye area.</li>
            <li> I am an older woman</li>
            <li> Good product, helps keep thin dry skin moist and looking nice especially under makeup!  </li>
            <li> I ordered Serumtologie after having tried a similar product that quickly lost efficacy.</li>
            <li> I like the design, blue bottle for protection of serum with light, clear indication of ingredients.</li>
            <li> Genetics (  my  area is  mainly in  vitro  Genetic Toxicology).</li>
            <li> far as wrinkle reduction goes, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any of that, but I would think that would take much longer than 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be placing a second order for this Serum as I&lt;br /&gt;am already noticing that my skin is feeling more relaxed &amp; is plumper without any swelling etc.</li>
            <li> Price was decent</li>
            <li> I particularly saw a difference in my hands immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 years old and often get positive comments about my skin.</li>
            <li> Even tho OZ states there is Vitamin C in their product I don&#x27;t feel there is enough to really give anywhere near the full benefit of Serumtologie.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and had no reactions to the product (something which happens to me about a quarter of the time with what I try at the department store!)</li>
            <li> I haven‚Äôt used it very long, but in the few weeks that I have used it, its amazing!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to anyone looking to add C serum to their routine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and buy again</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to people-</li>
            <li> Even though this product didn&#x27;t work for me (too drying), Serumtologie has a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend that you try C Serum ¬∞22 so that you too could join us in using this revolutionary, anti-aging product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have tried all the high end products, Institute Esterderm, Skin Medica,  etc.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum and this seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I started doing some research and learned that sometimes high concentrations of vitamin C and &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; oils/ingredients can change the pH of the skin and cause acne and dryness.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I do not have too many wrinkles in general and they are not too deep as I have always been pretty religious when it come to skin care</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also using with the Electric Auto Micro Needle Pen Skin Therapy...please see my review for the steps there on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product or any C Serum.  </li>
            <li> and this surpasses them all with HIGH VIT C 22% plus other necessary skin loving nutrients.  </li>
            <li> and I also take some collagen/hyaluroinc acid - advanced formula, type 1,2 &amp; 3 supplements by ‚Äúyoutheory‚Äù that work from within, this combination has really worked extremely well for me.  </li>
            <li> I will be posting rave reviews in trying to help other people like me feel like they are purchasing a product that actually works and is cost effective.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not watery like so many other ones and it leaves my skin feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> Now about the serum ... product has a rich, thick consistency and glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> maybe a little better.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely improved after the first week!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the little things :)</li>
            <li> It has all the ingredients found in the stellar Skinceuticals CEF product but with two major differences.</li>
            <li> You must give this a try first before you start trying to do other things that cost more, like going to a plastic surgeon, etc., which may not then be necessary.  </li>
            <li> Even on my throat and jawline, the skin has firmed up a little and looks better.</li>
            <li> but I am dosing it a little better now&lt;</li>
            <li> I have used many c serums that usually &amp;#34;go bad&amp;#34; after a certain amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the possible effects of this serum, but I decided to try it after I&#x27;d heard and read so much about Vitamin C being very good for refining the skin surface.</li>
            <li> The one thing she likes best about it is that it doesn‚Äôt have a bad odor like some brands of C serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old guy just getting into this whole skin care thing.</li>
            <li> Light herbal scent, coverage is about as expected, and leaves skin looking brighter.</li>
            <li> gentle to sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my wrinkles had faded all that much but saw a before and after photo and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like the product.</li>
            <li> and it really leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> No negative side effects.</li>
            <li> &#x27;They also offer a discount on the next bottle with cost being $5.00 and a complimentary jar of &#x27;whipped &#x27;chiffon Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on my skin all the time, and as a person who&#x27;s often out in public, it&#x27;s nice to be mistaken for being ten or twelve years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> I am using it continuously for the last year and contiue to order because its worth it.</li>
            <li> My face looks much fresh and younger.</li>
            <li> My skin is normally oily but with this product it now glows rather than &amp;#34;oul&amp;#34; shines...</li>
            <li> I even get pimples in places that I don&#x27;t normally get them-neck and chest (I tried using it here</li>
            <li> Love the product, can tell the difference in my skin after few weeks of use</li>
            <li> (is that normal?).  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that I didn&#x27;t have any sort of tingling sensation upon first application, as I did with my experience with the obagi product, especially seeing as this product has a higher percentage of vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to what may happen after a few more months.</li>
            <li> My skin really does feel smoother and more firm to minimize sagging!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one to waste money on the latest beauty trend.</li>
            <li> refunded me the full price of my first order, and told me my next purchase would only cost $5 as they were giving me a discount.</li>
            <li> rarely write reviews, for this experience, I simply had to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Serumtologie is pleasant to use, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes in my skin yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normal to combination.</li>
            <li> young I want to age with beautiful skin, not skin that is shot up and looks fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times so far, my skin feels nice and soft in the morning?</li>
            <li> product has listed more natural  or Ayurveda/Chinese/Herbal products in it that have a vast history of various uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic, the first few days I started using it</li>
            <li> I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I normally would wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Vitamin C serum brands in the past and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as a good purchase.</li>
            <li> AND I live in Florida which has tremendously high humidity</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 29 so no hard wrinkles...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long but love the ease of use and overall feel of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lotions/moisturizers but they did nothing for my extremely dry irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> I used 5 drops each morning and night and on the third day my face started to break out, and began to feel more dry.</li>
            <li> I love the seller of this product that stands behind it and answers my questions so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this product is very well reviewed so it&#x27;s likely something to do with my unique skin chemistry that didn&#x27;t click well with the product.</li>
            <li> I have found my new anti-aging secret; it truly is like a primer and moisturizer in one, dries so quickly and stays on in even in this super hot weather!  </li>
            <li> I had a couple of mole like growths under my left eye that raised up and with my nail they scratched right off.</li>
            <li> I find this combination gives better results than just plain c serum.  </li>
            <li> You only need about 5 drops and right away you could feel the tighten of the skin especially around the eyes.(good right).</li>
            <li> SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]]</li>
            <li> For the first time in so long, I actually felt confident enough to leave my house without foundation.</li>
            <li> When the dropper no longer pulls any serum out then you can easily just turn the bottle upside down and shake some onto your finger using the finger as a stopper so it doesn&#x27;t go everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Plucking is not an every other day occurrence any longer, I can go for a week before I notice that in the light I have hairs popping</li>
            <li> , and so far I think the Skingenixx is a little bit better.</li>
            <li> For a Vitamin C serum this one is nice and thick and feels like it penetrates deeper than the more watery 20% serum I&#x27;ve been using in the past.</li>
            <li> I hope not too get ahead of myself as I am trying a variety of new products but</li>
            <li> I set out to find a new product to try and landed in Serumtologie.</li>
            <li> so this was new for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> new skin care  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and get a lot of sun exposure, so a Vitamin C serum was recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> This is my new go-to product</li>
            <li> But would the product live up?</li>
            <li> keep trying and inserting a new item in your core regime.</li>
            <li> keep trying and inserting a new item in your core regime.</li>
            <li> Every day I put a drop on a new spot that showed up on my hand and it didn&#x27;t fade or change in appearance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This appears to be my new wrinkle guard, (&amp; I have skin sensitivities )</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think I can live without it...</li>
            <li> It is a great deal for the cost and it only takes a few drops, so one bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs important to close the dropper bottle as soon as possible or the edge of the bottle gets a buildup of white coating.  </li>
            <li> I have used the serum for about 3 weeks now, and the other day at work a peer commented on how my face looked so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I love the consistency and feel of this serum, especially compared to the very watery consistencies of the previously mentioned products.</li>
            <li> The only downside is I am not a huge fan of the scent, which to me is kind of banana.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has to be said that I emailed the company with a couple of questions and they were extremely helpful and very efficient!!!  </li>
            <li> You will waste so much more over on over the counter products that aren&#x27;t nearly as affective and natural as this!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for almost 4 weeks and my skin is very soft.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and my wrinkles are getting softer too.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks, but like the feel of it on my skin very much.  </li>
            <li> my face felt very soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, but this product causes no irritation and leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 49 year old african American women with fine line on my forehead and blemishes on my face</li>
            <li> Since using this my skin has never been so clear!</li>
            <li> This is the first facial skin product I have ordered again!  </li>
            <li> I know of other brands that have same ingredients for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and I believe the fine lines around my eyes are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time last night after receiving it in the mail</li>
            <li> Weirdly I was able to screw open the top without breaking the seal.</li>
            <li> She has been using the serum religiously since it first came out, and was recommended to her by her dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Truth Serum Vitamin C Serum for the past 4 years and love the smell, the way it made my skin feel, and</li>
            <li> My fine lines seemed plumped up and way less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This morning, for the first time ever, I awoke with an actual glow to my face.  </li>
            <li> I recently had a facial (b day present to self, the spa tried to sell me their serum, I showed them the one I ordered from amazon, the spa said it had better ingredients than their serum.</li>
            <li> I have tow other similar products and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> However this purchase has a different and funny smell...</li>
            <li> My skin is softer &amp; fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> WoW!.</li>
            <li> I usually  do not  review  </li>
            <li> And by far, this one is!  </li>
            <li> I will write another review once I have used the serum for a while, but as far as customer service goes -- they can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this skincare product a five star review because as a cosmetologist, the ingredients surpass even the most expensive products that are similar to this one,  and the price is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I am pretty basic.  </li>
            <li> (I usually never break out on my cheek and forehead region</li>
            <li> skin texture is soft supple and radiant !</li>
            <li> , I probably could actually go WITHOUT make-up for the first time in FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my skin just within the past week.  </li>
            <li> When younger, most of my summers were spent with full days on the beach under the harsh sun and without much use of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and I have to say WOW!</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better without any allergies what I usually get.</li>
            <li> I first opened the bottle, I noticed that the color and feel of the serum is very different</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t have wrinkles but the fine lines around my eyes seem less visible.</li>
            <li> My skin looked and felt different within the first week.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and it looks healthier!  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> So, I ordered the first bottle of this serum back in June.</li>
            <li> Since I ordered  the second one recently, I should say that I am not disappointed with  the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, I&#x27;m more of a review reader.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see how much more improvement I see over time.  </li>
            <li> I try to be consistent, but occasionally miss an evening.  </li>
            <li> Over time, I have noticed that my fine lines and wrinkles are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Anyway, initially the price and the eligibility for Amazon Prime put this product to the first place</li>
            <li> My skin is 70 years old and needs added tender living care, and this seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> I noticed a visual difference after the first couple of applications.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure that you double check before using it with other cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands that advertise that they help aging skin with wrinkles, skin discolorations, firmness, and the texture, but so many have failed to do anything.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I was 15 years old and going through puberty all over again!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> But I have noticed a pretty big change in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and instantly leaves my skin feeling tighter and noticeably more firm.</li>
            <li> Second is that I see the results and it is taking a little time but it is worth it to me to have that healthy younger looking and feeling skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it morning and evening to get its maximum potential and I always apply my serum on clean skin prior to the rest of my skincare products.</li>
            <li> I also had a major wrinkle between my eyebrows and it looks like it&#x27;s been fading away!!!</li>
            <li> I am always a bit sceptical when it comes to starting using a new product as my skin is pretty sensitive but with Serumtologie C serum</li>
            <li> For the first time in many years I am actually seeing an improvement in my dark circles and overall skin tone.  </li>
            <li> What makes this product different is the 22% NATURAL vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate) which is Vitamin C in its purest, most organic form, and will not irritate the skin like other brands.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for your skin as long as you are comfortable with the low percentage of preservative in C-22.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t empty the bottles so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and feel that my use of this product for the past three to four weeks has brought results of softer, and more even toned skin.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my skin soaked this stuff up - my face felt soft and looked brighter when I woke up the next day.</li>
            <li> First, the serum texture is not soft liquid or thick and it is very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> So far, the serum seems to be working on my face, my Skin feels very soft and healthier</li>
            <li> With just the first use, my face was instantly smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes were definitely less noticeable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks now, and yes, I have seen&lt;br /&gt;some initial positive results.</li>
            <li> Overall she is satisfied with the product but final results will be updated over the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so kind to my delicate skin!</li>
            <li> I guess maybe it works better on younger people who have less damage to start with.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe, but definitely looks better!  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older I have noticed that my skin just looks older - not necessarily lots of wrinkles, but it is just not looking as refreshed.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and tight feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and this product is gentle enough not to cause any irritation.  </li>
            <li> Your skin soaks it right up with out being greasy tacky or dry.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my face feel right after I wash, dry and then apply this both morning and night.</li>
            <li> I specially love it&#x27;s gel base coz it doesn&#x27;t drip and gets absorbed easily .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C based serums before, but they were either not concentrated enough to be effective or laced with so many other ingredients that they felt heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt that the price is phenomenal--have you seen those $200 bottles of facial serum??!!</li>
            <li> My large nose pores are noticeable smaller.  </li>
            <li> wife is 33 years old, and although she hasn&#x27;t spent her youth in such abusing environments, during the past 7 years that I&#x27;ve known her, she has always been trying to find that perfect product to add to her daily facial routine.</li>
            <li> I found it to work really well, i had a lot of wrinkles and as of right now i believe half of them have gone.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth &amp; you just need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> but I feel that my skin needs a little more moisture, so I ordered the Pure Whipped Chiffon Daily Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> She gave me 4 ingredients to look for ‚Äì Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (the most pure and non irritating form of vitamin c), Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, and Vitamin E or jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> I decided to continue usage for another week and while the spot on my cheek has faded a little, more red spots have come to join it.</li>
            <li> love getting my little blue bottle out every morning and</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a product with more than 1% hyaluronic in it.</li>
            <li> No skin irritation and I have really sensitive skin on my cheeks due to mild rosacea and this does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely evened out its pigmentation from acne, the pigmentation wasn&#x27;t that strong to begin with, but other products didn&#x27;t work like this one did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few days, and although I haven&#x27;t seen any huge changes, my skin already feels noticeably tighter.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> My skin is sooooo soft and pores really are smaller!!!</li>
            <li> lighter and clearly continued use will make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I also think it has helped clear up my chin acne.</li>
            <li> I am using this to clear the rosasia break out.  </li>
            <li> I use this twice a day on clean, slightly damp skin.</li>
            <li> I am young and don‚Äôt have any real wrinkles yet but am prone to the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> product makes it clear that it is not tested on animals, its vegan and its paraben free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am using with no problem.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin tolerates it well</li>
            <li> And, as thanks for making my experience known to others out there I will be receiving another bottle of C serum 22 at a deeply discounted rate!!! ...  </li>
            <li> My face is much smoother the lines on my face are starting to disappear and the blemishes appear to be fading.</li>
            <li> It has make my skin so soft, clear and brighter since using it for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I can see the change already.. received product a day early..</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> Sellers are prompt and professional.  </li>
            <li> I am open to trying additional products from this company as they seem very dedicated to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> We have been using the serum for nearly one month now.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels really soft too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 74 years old</li>
            <li> I would definitely  recommend this serum to anyone who wants to see a noticeable change to skin tone and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 74 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the serum morning &amp; night for 3 months and my sun spots/sun damage has completely faded away .</li>
            <li> skin is soft and the spots are fading!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin does NOT break out from this product.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ve got to use a product regularly, and for at least a month or more to see real skin changes.  </li>
            <li> Completely odorless.</li>
            <li> so I mix up my regimen as far as all</li>
            <li> AND WOW.</li>
            <li> I decided to change my lifestyle completely, quit smoking (2 weeks now)</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I have mature, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but so far works</li>
            <li> The company emails direct suggestions of use as well as response to review.</li>
            <li> They asked me to offer my review directly here and gave me a discount code for participating.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product,  </li>
            <li> It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> almost like its old.</li>
            <li> I have moderately sensitive combination skin and every time I use it on my face</li>
            <li> Much softer and smaller pores.  </li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and truly believed my skin was beyond improvement.  </li>
            <li> so she can start early to prevent lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li> Skin tighter and smoother, as well as soft.</li>
            <li> The hyperpigmentation on my face has faded considerably (though not gone) and there is a youthful radiance to my skin that I thought I would never see again.  </li>
            <li> Please try, you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> Totally unexpected.  </li>
            <li> Its much cheaper that than the big name company.  </li>
            <li> After 1 week of using this product my skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> Vitamin C ‚Äì highest professional grade&lt;</li>
            <li> It is really helping me with skin tone, especially with fading some scars.  </li>
            <li> So far I like the softness of my skin after using C serum.</li>
            <li> After using a friends Obagi brand professional C Serum (20%)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product does not cause any discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Well, since then I have been looking for a vitamin C option that worked with my sensitive</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month, but not had any noticeable changes so far.</li>
            <li> So far I like the serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 years old with dehydrated, oily skin that is sensitive and prone to break outs.</li>
            <li> women/men, that already are in a mature age, you WILL see a difference.</li>
            <li> but I am 40 years old and a lady at a party told me I looked 30.  </li>
            <li> Valerie, owner of Serumtologie, contacted me directly and offered a refund.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I start using a vitamin C serum since I am in my early 30‚Äôs and in the pre-wrinkle stage.</li>
            <li> Then the company emailed me asking me how I was liking the product so far.</li>
            <li> I also have a short beard and it&#x27;s feeling much softer, nicer to touch, and healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No miracles for seventy-fouryear old skin</li>
            <li> The box is classy as well as the bottle label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it contains all natural and organic ingredients and that it is manufactured in the USA.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and Vitamin C is ascorbic acid</li>
            <li> I am over 50 years old.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of anti aging and wrinkle products This product far surpasses them all&lt;</li>
            <li> And he has a professional eye because he  is a specialist in&lt;br /&gt;Botox</li>
            <li> I gave it  4 stars because this is a work in progress for a 60 year old.  </li>
            <li> I use this as my sole moisturizer in the morning because my face tends to get very oily within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 52 year old nurse</li>
            <li> A bit too early to tell...</li>
            <li> My 66 year old skin has noticed diminishing lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and my skin tone is showing improvement.</li>
            <li> So far seems to work well.</li>
            <li> but she does not have sensitive skin with these types of products.  </li>
            <li> After only one week my cheekbones are noticeably tighter which is really encouraging.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been enough time, yet, to see much difference on my forehead</li>
            <li> It really has made a big difference in the moisture that is retained in the skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and have been a Obagi user for years.</li>
            <li> i have been using this moisturizer for nearly two weeks</li>
            <li> There are no side effects so far.</li>
            <li> It surprised and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> But I never ever made a second purchase coz, frankly they didn&#x27;t do much difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 60 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and have been a Obagi user for years.</li>
            <li> As for the feel, oil-management, and natural skin calming properties, this product does the job well.</li>
            <li> however I am 60 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for two weeks, and so far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> So far I like the results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has now been 3 months since using this product and I just want to say I am amazed at how soft my skin feels .</li>
            <li> This serum will leave you with silky soft skin and hydration immediately after applying.</li>
            <li> I like this but haven&#x27;t noticed any marked changes in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it aside from my skin</li>
            <li> , I was presently surprised.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (I am 63 years old.)  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this company really cares about their customers, feedback and future ordering.  </li>
            <li> My hands and neck look young too.</li>
            <li> After I used the entire bottle, my skin felt so much smoother to the touch and</li>
            <li> I  am a  72 yr  old  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Definitely much softer and pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li> and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I began noticing a change in my skin after only a few days but absolutely love how it  dramatically changed my skin in just 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> C serums must be at least 17% vitamin C to be effective, and this one goes above and beyond at 22%.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So overall, for me, Serumtologie wins for hyperpigmentation and overall skin improvement vs Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> The serum feels silky on my skin and absorbs quickly, a perfect base for makeup -</li>
            <li> The serum is a good buy for the price and will also save me a trip to an expensive salon.</li>
            <li> merely because it makes my face feel good.  </li>
            <li> My skin is more hydrated, the dark splotches are unnoticeable and the dark spots have lightened so my freckles look normal and separate!</li>
            <li> High concentration of active ingredient at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little and is easy to apply I use both morning and evening</li>
            <li> w/ASDM&#x27;s 100% Hyaluronic Acid Serum shipped by ASDM, put that one first after cleaning w/Clinique #1 and #2, then using ASDM&#x27;s 100% Hyaluronic serum (remember to let everything dry inbetween so do other things as you&#x27;re getting ready for work or school to stay on time), then use this C serum, then I use serumtologie&#x27;s Pure Whipped Moisturizer which goes w/</li>
            <li> w/ASDM&#x27;s 100% Hyaluronic Acid Serum shipped by ASDM, put that one first after cleaning w/Clinique #1 and #2, then using ASDM&#x27;s 100% Hyaluronic serum (remember to let everything dry inbetween so do other things as you&#x27;re getting ready for work or school to stay on time), then use this C serum, then I use serumtologie&#x27;s Pure Whipped Moisturizer which goes w/</li>
            <li> Not to say this product doesn&#x27;t do what it promises, but the other formula worked much, MUCH better for areas of hyperpigmentation and it really helped to keep my skin firm.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face smooth throught the day the only thing i dont like is it dries by the time u get to the other end</li>
            <li> When you first start using it, it makes your skin dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to spend a few more bucks to hold on to my youth just a little longer.</li>
            <li> I started using it following a micro needling skin procedure which had already improved the fine lines and dark spots on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I only use it at night because it makes my face feel super dry</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say nothing about reducing the fine lines yet, of course I have to wait a little bit more to evaluate this effect (at least 30 days!).</li>
            <li> My skin seemed to soak it up in the first few uses and felt really moisturized although each time I use it my skin almost feels more dry and tight-</li>
            <li> I have only the very tiniest fine lines, but they are smaller everyday.  </li>
            <li> I ordered my first bottle in mid February and just now needed to order my second bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of higher end, more expensive brands - both of which work well;</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use the serum sparingly and can now use more on my neck and decolette as this bottle is only a fraction of the price from what I used to purchase in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used it for two days and not seeing any results yet, but now realize the first bottle was making a big difference, especially since I had gone off of it.  </li>
            <li> When i saw the serumtologie I decided to give it a try, mainly because it has the C listed at 22% vs. the 20 that I was currently using.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous moisturizers over the years, but now that I am growing older</li>
            <li> My skin feels absolutely soft and I feel s major difference.  </li>
            <li> Contains active vitamin C unlike many other products that claim to contain vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this company and will provide further updates during the review process.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the use of these products especially if you been searching high and low for these types of solutions to no avail.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this product had such high ratings.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly but I noticed that the fill line was a bit low for what I expected in a 1 oz. container.</li>
            <li> I used to have blemishes, little red bumps under my eyes and lots of fine lines around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> glad that I tried it but am sorry that it did not produce any noticeable positive results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about the ingredients, they are amazing!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s reasonably priced and it lasts a long time if you follow directions.</li>
            <li> Only a drop of my old serum would be enough to cover my face and neck, and it really did even and brighten my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed much success with minimising my dark spots.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter and smoother after using it for a few weeks, and although I purchased it for the promotional price, I would repurchase at full price.</li>
            <li> I was skepical at first, and the price was a little high, but I order it anyway.</li>
            <li> my skin is definitely softer and not nearly as dull.</li>
            <li> It keeps my fine lines practically unnoticed while my skin looks nourished and younger.  </li>
            <li> Serumtologie is hands down worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Compared to Paula&#x27;s Choice C15 booster this one wins hands down.  </li>
            <li> For years I have been searching for the perfect serum, trying one different brand after the other with one disappointing experience after another. .</li>
            <li> I purchased this just to try a new vitamin C serum before repurchasing a different brand.  </li>
            <li> I also had 2 dark spots on my lower right cheek that are gone now too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any real differences in her appearance yet but she hasn&#x27;t used it very long.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and this really makes my face feel moisturized, without looking or feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> C+ hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Amino Complex Professional Strength (available through Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really helped with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin is overall much smoother and glows from the extra hydration.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> As someone with Celiac disease and who makes every effort to keep unnecessary chemicals out of my life, I am also thrilled that the makers of serumtolgie has taken the time to put in only quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find 22% Vit C and such good quality for this price.  </li>
            <li> But it is, because the liquid is thick and rich-feeling, going on easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased the C serum 22 a few weeks ago and have very positive results so far.</li>
            <li> I have seen a major difference in her face</li>
            <li> I know it can take time to see major results, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> and it helps my face look extra young and plumped!</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I have now received MAJOR kudos for introducing her to C Serum ¬∞22.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it&#x27;s higher in vitamin C - 22% than any other similiar products which helps heal the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and night and have noticed major improvements in my skin.  </li>
            <li> My pores are barely noticeable and my skin is glowing!</li>
            <li> I would be interested in the other products you recommend.</li>
            <li> The bottle had no safety covering and was only half full.  </li>
            <li> This product is tacky and leaves my skin feeling tight, as though the product did not get absorbed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin out &amp; after using this for 2 months, the brownish skin around my mouth has brightened to my normal skintone again!</li>
            <li> I have used many different Vitamin C serums for the last few years as part of my regular skin maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very few wrinkles and they are significantly diminished by using this product.  </li>
            <li> have always had very oily skin and have large pores and lots of deep little blackheads.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little sticky but well absorbed in my skin.</li>
            <li> When I am older this is definitely something I would use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other brands that irritate my skin or just plain don‚Äôt work.</li>
            <li> I have used other C serums that have similar ingredients, but less C and cost much more.  </li>
            <li> and I expect to see some results due to the number of positive reviews these products have received.  </li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t had any sort of bad reaction or sensitivity to this serum, so I&#x27;m happy there.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t believe in serums or lotions for help with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> In general, there are plenty of C-Serum products on the market.</li>
            <li> the sun spots I&#x27;ve acquired through the years are starting to clear up.</li>
            <li> , Instantly my face become clear after 2-3 applications.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my skin, you don&#x27;t need much and so the bottle last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is a professional grade serum that will help make your skin younger looking, glowing and diminish those age wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Terrific product and doesn&#x27;t cost near what Dr. Oz recommends.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product so far that heals faster than all of the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Serumtologie has stopped my occasional breakouts and has made a marked improvement in the texture of my skin and pores without any drying.</li>
            <li> That being said, I have been using this for close to a month with not much to write about and was ready to add this to my &amp;#34;don&#x27;t buy again shelves&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> First, I was concerned with the small bottle with the eyedropper, but it is evident that this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about 3 weeks, but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised because it seems to have helped in such a sort time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it on faith and have no regrets.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly sensitive to smells of facial products.</li>
            <li> it has made a big difference in the way it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and would suffer occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old female.</li>
            <li> The fact that this serum is all natural and organic is a big plus  for me.</li>
            <li> My first impressions: A+ Packaging - check, Safety Sealed - check, Dark Bottle (to keep vitamin C from oxidizing) - check.</li>
            <li> To make sure it&#x27;s not my vision getting progressively worse</li>
            <li> Great...even though I use prescription Renova, this product did a better job of removing the top thin, thin layer of skin on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> The price was great and so much less expensive than what I was using.  </li>
            <li> I have normal to dry combo skin.</li>
            <li> My skin transformed in less thatn a week with consistent use.</li>
            <li> This product is more pricey but is not any better than other less expensive products.  </li>
            <li> I bought two of these bottles when the product first came out since it was advertised for half the price.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this product the lines have lightened up considerably and instead of making me look old, my skin is much firmer and the lines have disappeared (except for one deep, deep set line, but the other 3 have disappeared) and makes me look younger.  </li>
            <li> It REALLY works &amp; does not cost as much as other products that do not work.</li>
            <li> However, it is reasonably priced compared to other Vitamin C serums</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive oils or serums as I have been blessed with good genes and don&#x27;t really look my age.  </li>
            <li> The formulations from each of the various makers seem similar, but I find the texture of the C serum 22 from Serumtologie to be superior to other brands--it has a slightly different viscosity (slightly thicker, less watery/oily)</li>
            <li> My face feels extra soft and definitely smoother.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to have an impact on skin -- no real, noticeable reduction of discolored areas or lines.</li>
            <li> Not only that, Amazon is actually where the product is sold by the manufacturer so this is not diluted, old or imperfect in any way.</li>
            <li> I had a small brown patch on my forehead when I first started using this product and after about a month, it was completely gone....and has never returned.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday I was out and about all day without foundation - only Serum C and moisturizer/sunblock - and I am old enough for Medicare!</li>
            <li> am a 34 year old male who has never used any type of facial moisturizers or serum before.</li>
            <li> It has 22 percent Natural Vitamin C, have noticed a visible difference after only one week of use.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I can see that this bottle will definitely last the full month, if not more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products over the years and they don&#x27;t even come close to this.  </li>
            <li> As your complexion gets acclimated to the product, my skin does feel smoother and not dry.</li>
            <li> The consistency is great, not too thin or too thick.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s an unbelievable deal for such a high quality product, I&#x27;ve spend several times as much for others that didn&#x27;t measure up to this C Serum 22!</li>
            <li> but so after only a few uses I see a very positive effect.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin and sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have major problems with my skin, except recently breaking out as a result of side effects from a medication.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve tried several serums, and have seen some major results with the Serumtologie.  </li>
            <li> It has made a major improvement in the texture of my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I have spent $$$$ yes in the thousands on face products and was going to purchase the NAME BRAND with the high price tag &amp; then looked at ingredients</li>
            <li> especially her dark spots have diminished quite a bit (they are still there mind you) but her face seems brighter and more plump after using this product everyday for the last 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Nothing stops the hands of time but this certainly slows it down.  </li>
            <li> I use this with other serums, VoilaVe and/or Protoxyn, so hard to tell which is better.</li>
            <li> I have used many other vitamin C serums and this formula leaves my skin hydrated and smoothed whereas others left it feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li> This product really helps eliminate dark spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Even the very stubborn dark spots on my face have lightened.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much softer and a definite glow that I had not got from my other &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After using the entire bottle, I didn&#x27;t notice much improvements compared to other Vitamin C products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> There was a litterally 5 second tacky/sticky feeling but then after that, yout skin feels totallt bare like you have not put anything on your face at all but</li>
            <li> no red meat, oily fish, plenty of water and green tea, 30+ natural sunscreen, plenty of vitamin K from greens, lots of whole grains, veggies and exercise 5 times a week...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally sure how it works yet, but I seem to think that the lines around my eyes and mouth are not as distinct.</li>
            <li> I noticed the softness within the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am a pretty firm Paula&#x27;s Choice buyer because her products work.  </li>
            <li> What I notice now is a new smoothness (no dead skin) and a slight softening of the lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I am very optimistic based on the other user reviews and the clinically-proven ingredients!</li>
            <li> I know unbelievable, right?</li>
            <li> that 8 drops will then be placed on the tips of one hand, you rub your fingers together and put product lightly on forehead, down next to eye (where crows feet are) then come down cheeks, across upper lip and across chin.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend who lives in another city commented on my skin, when I told her what I was using, we high fives each other because she said omg, I&#x27;m using that stuff too.  </li>
            <li> But I knew that I wanted a high concentration of vitamin c along with other ingredients that are known to improve your skin.</li>
            <li> Other than that i would highly recommend Poppy Austin products to anyone.</li>
            <li> Less is more--so a product has to really sell me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or irritate and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but when I did and told them exactly what I&#x27;m telling you here, they offered me a discount on my next purchase, which I have not yet accepted yet but will later, as I would like to continue using this at less cost if possible.</li>
            <li> I have not had this long enough to make a complete assessment, but for the three weeks I&#x27;ve have&lt;br /&gt;been</li>
            <li> After a few months and after being convinced w/ the positive reviews, I gave in and purchased the serum, eye gel &amp; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am especially upset because my cheeks have been clear for so long and now it looks bumpy and there is a red spot that will take forever to go away...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything about wrinkles not long enough.</li>
            <li> Seems to work about the same as other high end anti aging creams.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a real change in my skin, smaller pores, firmer and less wrinkles</li>
            <li> I know dark spots its not the main function of this product</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it particularly works well under my eyes, dark circles lightened, firmer looking--</li>
            <li> While I was blessed with good skin, I spent years living at the beach, and did have a few dark spots, all of which have practically disappeared on using your product promotional for the last few months, and, for which I am thankful.  </li>
            <li> The only issue i have is a little to much oil, since i have oily skin.</li>
            <li> It seems less dull, fine lines aren&#x27;t as visible, and the couple of age spots I had are barely visible now.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product -- like many others, I have also used several different expensive lotions and creams with little or no visible results.  </li>
            <li> half way drop it all in one hand rub and apply ...other than that i would highly recommend...</li>
            <li> The first a few days of using it, my face seemed dry</li>
            <li> so my skin, regardless of how well I try to take care of it, suffers from a fairly constant presence of some type of imperfection - usually nothing major - small bumps or breakouts - but rarely flawless.  </li>
            <li> Many cosmetics and skin care lines include the unnecessary use of wheat or other gluten.</li>
            <li> On older skin like mine it may take a little longer.  </li>
            <li> My step-mother always used to tell me I looked tired, but she rarely says that to me now (thank God!)</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, as I have a Rosecea condition and have had several bad reactions to other products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a coincidence, but I&#x27;ve been told twice in the past 3-4 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product that I look young to have a 12-year old.</li>
            <li> product is non-comedogenic, but SOMETHING in it really irritated my skin, which is now covered in small, deep pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I thought I should start using a product now that will provide extra  nutrition to my facial skin and might help in long term.  </li>
            <li> just need a tiny bit of the product so this one bottle will last a really long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using my new serum 22 for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is on the delicate side (to be expected after 55+ years on the planet) and C serum 22 is gentle and soothing.</li>
            <li> It has been awhile since I&#x27;ve used a C Serum due to the ridiculous pricing, so when I saw the fantastic value that  </li>
            <li> These products use only natural ingredience that you can define and understand and keep the ingredients to the simple few that are the necessary ones.</li>
            <li> I actually din&#x27;t took their 100% money back guarantee but a few weeks ago, I got an email from Vanessa M. Powers, co-founder and was really nice to inform me that she and the company was sorry the product didn&#x27;t work for me and wanted me to send her my order ID# via the seller and will refund my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I started my forehead was always dry and my wrinkles around my eyes were so bad people were asking if I felt good</li>
            <li> Lines and dark spots have faded and I&#x27;m hardly  a &#x27;young thing&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Because of my chemo treatments, my face got so dark and so far this serum has been a miracle.</li>
            <li> I have a natural glow and the dark spots are lighting up.</li>
            <li> So I imagine this bottle is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I left a long review,</li>
            <li> I only use 7 drops and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not been used long enough yet to determine its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it long enough now that I would have seen a flare up if it clogged my pores.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see the effects, but will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> serum which provided me with short and long term results.  </li>
            <li> Finally my long search is over when I found the only brand Serumtologie C serum which has the 5% hyaluronic content.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice results.  </li>
            <li> I used Skinceuticals C E Ferulic for a long time, but it gets thick-ish, yellow and has a sticky finish over time.  </li>
            <li> Not been using long enough to know if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I feel that the outbreak in the first few days was due to combining C22 with another product.</li>
            <li> but I have never experienced the true &#x27;glowing&#x27; results until this morning.  </li>
            <li> Not great but not bad.</li>
            <li> A vivid demonstration of  Vit C antioxidants in action: cut an apple in half- apply lemon juice to one half and let both halves sit out.  </li>
            <li> But other than that no other complaints.</li>
            <li> I have used other, more expensive C serums and I will always go back to this one!!  </li>
            <li> SOOOO remember that for the first 1-3 months you are treating LAYERS of DEAD SKIN CELLS!!</li>
            <li> It reduces your pore size, softens wrinkles and seems to prevent new ones, and makes your skin firm and glowing.</li>
            <li> I live in a city where we get Santa Ana winds all year round.  </li>
            <li> It seems to even out the tone of my skin but, using it twice a day as instructed, this bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I rated it a 4 star only because I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it for very long.</li>
            <li> Slight burn when used on skin (warning to sensitive skin users like myself.)</li>
            <li> The previous serum I was using cost close to $100.00 and did not perform nearly as well as Serum 22.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this for several weeks and did not see a single change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried one other and I didn&#x27;t really see any difference with it and that one was a little watery side.</li>
            <li> Within a week the dark spots had lighted twice as much as with my previous brand (Paula&#x27;s Choice) as a result of using this.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft, without making your your skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> I recently tried C serum 22, having previously used a more expensive, well-known antioxidant serum.  </li>
            <li> i swutched from a 20% serum to this because of the higher concentration and seriously nothing.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this (or any other topical) isn&#x27;t going to help the scars</li>
            <li> Last night I did a derma roller treatment (which I do about every other week - I know, not often enough) and again followed with my beauty routine including the Serumtologie C Serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a four-star rating because I use several other products at the same time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s likely I&#x27;ll buy it again, but only use it on those occasions when my skin is too irritated to use the other Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> and so little goes so far.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been working slowly but steadily!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but other than a sort of tight feeling after it dries, I don&#x27;t notice a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> It might sound silly</li>
            <li> In fact, there were old spots that I had been working to lighten over the past year that simply disappeared with this product.  </li>
            <li> The 22% Vitamin C keeps the skin clear and the 5 percent Hyaluronic Acid helps with dead cells.</li>
            <li> and it has faded some sun damage from long ago.  </li>
            <li> and I look forward to a long relationship with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle, no real change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time, maybe three weeks, but some creams make an immediate difference and these drops do not have that effect.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money is my early gut feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Giving it three stars since I have not been using it a long time.</li>
            <li> Minor lines are reduced if not gone.  </li>
            <li> bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting miracles - have been in my skin too long for that to happen.  </li>
            <li> One drop goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> will continue to use these products and look forward to the long term effects they have to offer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have a couple of days left before my 1st bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing long term results.</li>
            <li> The hyperpigmentation has faded (not completely gone) and yes my skin feels smoother and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but I will continue to purchase as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long term solution and hopefully have found it</li>
            <li> It also had some minor pitting which evened out also.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for a long time, but from what I can tell so</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t break out, don&#x27;t have an adverse reaction, the product hasn&#x27;t spoiled, you&#x27;re working on your skin as a project instead of slapping something on for a week and expecting to see miraculous results,</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t break out, don&#x27;t have an adverse reaction, the product hasn&#x27;t spoiled, you&#x27;re working on your skin as a project instead of slapping something on for a week and expecting to see miraculous results,</li>
            <li> It also has a slightly strange smell.</li>
            <li> the minor issue is the drying of the skin, counter the dryness with moisturizer, problem solved.</li>
            <li> I kept using it hoping it was just an initial reaction, however after almost a month I am tapping out and going back to my previous vitamin C product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically take close looks at myself, and after just a short period of time applying, I still don&#x27;t need to do so to notice how much younger and healthier my skin is looking.</li>
            <li> My pores seem smaller, my skin is definitely brighter and my face appears slightly lifted.  </li>
            <li> I mean ladies it really makes your skin look and feel luminous and  dewy-hydrated.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I seem to purchase new creams and lotions for my wife to try out all of the time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using this serum and will try some of the other products as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared it to several other types of serums with vitamin c and hyaluronic acid and none of the others</li>
            <li> Other than than I felt the product had potential.</li>
            <li> The same goes for my other cheek</li>
            <li> I have not used any other vitamin C product prior to this.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts for so long!</li>
            <li> I will finish my bottle and use it as a basic moisturizer but will not buy it again due to the cost and ineffective anti-aging component.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other products that have irritated my skin, giving me a rash or making my eyes burn.</li>
            <li> Other products such as this one burned my skin when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the company has raised the price significantly</li>
            <li> Especially after spending endless amounts on products that do not deliver on their promises.</li>
            <li> I am73 and recently lost 50 lbs due to an illness</li>
            <li> Vanessa e-mailed me back within a day and gave me a promo code to use which brought the price of my second bottle down to $5.00!  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed my skin does not have dry patches anymore.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt leave any sticky residue and it doesnt dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Using it by itself would feel a bit too dry for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my face,  </li>
            <li> So so product...makes my skin dry...</li>
            <li> When it dries, you face feels dry, so you need to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Took care of the dry spots and evened out my skin tone</li>
            <li> Made my face extremely dry and flaky all over my face</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin</li>
            <li> LET IT DRY</li>
            <li> It does not irritate or dry out her skin</li>
            <li> I also see improvement in dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It works well as a moisturizer, as I no longer have dry flakey skin in areas I did before using.</li>
            <li> My wife recommend their product if you have dry skin or your neck needs tighting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried stopping and starting it again over the last few months</li>
            <li> As well, the label and the owner totally transparent about the amount of each active ingredient and the formulation.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products with a range of active ingredients</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint that it lasted such a short time, but I think I will use less to make it last longer and still hoping for the same results!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Both are very similar at their core components with the same type of Vitamin C they use, but C serum 22-Max differs by few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no  new lines have appeared.  </li>
            <li> At first, my skin was soaking up quite a bit of the serum, but after just a few days, I noticed that I was having to use less and less.</li>
            <li> and I already have noticed that my skin is softer, tiny lines are disappearing and dark spots are fading.  </li>
            <li> The dark puffy circles are smaller.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of almost $40!</li>
            <li> the past I have tried other Vitamin C serums, some that have been more expensive with not the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews, but felt like</li>
            <li> so I have a lot of loose wrinkly skin on my face and body</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s saying a lot as I live in Colorado where the winters are hard on exposed skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this daily for about a week and a half in my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Even at the regular $85 price is almost half the cost of Skinceuticals  </li>
            <li> I tried it for a month and only saw a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> I don‚Äôt know a lot about these types of products, so I can‚Äôt say whether 22 percent C serum makes a big difference from the 20 percent or less</li>
            <li> have typically guessed my age 10 years younger than I am beforehand.  </li>
            <li> Instant result- lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed while in the sun my skin appears less red!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is slightly moisturizing, but not generally enough for me.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and resumed my previous facial regimen.</li>
            <li> (less imperfections) and softer, so the product definitely improves hydration through boosting collagen production!  </li>
            <li> The biggest difference I notice is the decrease in the size of my pores, overall smoothness and a brightness, and a slight lift (tightness) of my skin.</li>
            <li> (it sounded good), but was disappointed: that product was too harsh.</li>
            <li> I did this for 2 weeks and found it would leave my skin feeling a little dry,  but was softening it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> it leaves the skin very dry</li>
            <li> I had been needing something for my skin, which tends to be very dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin has always been very dry, but after using this product for just 2 days I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, it does not seem to be doing anything for my skin....</li>
            <li> It is not working!!Makes the skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this product to any woman or man who takes care of her/his skin seriously.  </li>
            <li> The skin feels tight after using it but the result does not last.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use other similar products that are less costly and I have to admit that I went back to your product because those other products don&#x27;t compare!</li>
            <li> I am not sure about all of you, but I personally would definitely prefer to apply as few chemicals as possible.  </li>
            <li> This product outshines many products I tried including HSN, QVC., and other doctors who sell very expensive products online.</li>
            <li> i used it every single day for 1 full month and my skin is getting worse not better.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottle would would last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> A big plus is that we have been using it on dark spots on my husband&#x27;s hands and see noticeable improvement!</li>
            <li> I have been using C serum for 4 weeks now (with a little extra around my mouth)</li>
            <li> So much my mom aunt and sister and a few friends have all started using it also!!!</li>
            <li> My skin just looks better and those lines aren&#x27;t as bad as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line: If you want great results, order this serum and you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> To say the least I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> So, it is difficult for me to determine how much additional difference the serum is making following the procedure at this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old chicken and this really works...same stuff in sears for $89.00...</li>
            <li> I am 68 yrs old and my skin looks like late forties,early fifties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks</li>
            <li> im still waiting to see the results I expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take but a few drops for your entire face and neck,  </li>
            <li> It has only been a few days, but it does give my skin that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> It took only a few days for the effects of the serum to work</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on creams and serums and if this works as it people have said it does then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Filipina/half white, who still suffers from adult breakouts, but my main struggle is with hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neater and, if you&#x27;re careful, you don&#x27;t contaminate the unused product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the Serumtologie C serum has been formulated to include a number of widely recognized ingredients beneficial to improved skin condition.  </li>
            <li> Irritated my skin, dried my skin out and possibly even caused me to breakout.</li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> It seems to have closed my pores a bit</li>
            <li> Felt some tightening affects, but not much.</li>
            <li> a few weeks of use,morning and night, I have noticed my skin is softer and there is a definite fading of a brown mark on my cheek, for that alone</li>
            <li> I am hoping this serum delivers, although it has only been a few weeks since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Nothing works in mins or overnight, but this I have noticed the last few days has began tightening the skin around my eyes and jaw.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m motivated by these results to continue until the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I respect the science behind the formulation and found that it works in real life application.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> After only a few days of using 22% vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> a fact that all skin product needs 4 weeks of continuous work before you&#x27;ll start seeing any results - and that&#x27;s minimal as the skin cells turn over every 21 days.</li>
            <li> Curious about the efficacy of vitamin C in this product.</li>
            <li> I hope to see an improvement in my skin in the next few weeks</li>
            <li> there was really no change with this product.</li>
            <li> and as she has aged, they have sagged.</li>
            <li> It actually has smoothed out lines on my face over a few week period.</li>
            <li> I saw minimal improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> and you only need to use a few drops a 2 x a day.</li>
            <li> Have not really noticed any change.</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly once a day for quite a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Only have to use a few drops.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a base under my daily make up and feel that is it a lovely thing to have against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I am not at all taken in by false compliments, but recently my 21- year- old daughter and I traveled to St. Thomas and upon returning to the cruise ship we were detained by the customs official.  </li>
            <li> My face is softer and I&#x27;m actually wearing less makeup!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed slight improvement in dark circles under my eyes; however, my skin gets red and tingly in the places that I have applied it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other serums that had actually shown results in a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I also have pretty sensitive skin, and I have not had any bad reactions to this serum even using it around the eye area.</li>
            <li> I do not notice any dramatic results, but my skin is much brighter and my pores are not clogged.  </li>
            <li> I have a few dark spots that are noticeably lighter in just three weeks, and overall my skin looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> I do have a couple noticeable dry spots..and ironically oily spots as well, typically around my nose.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so just use a dab.</li>
            <li> However, this serumtologie product reduced the amount of blotchy-ness as a little goes a long way with this serum.</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning and evening, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product is a bit pricey but since a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I am using it with the combination of other products, as it makes my skin feel dry, but I have an impression that it makes my wrinkles less visible.</li>
            <li> I have even stopped using make up, which is huge because I have gone through life with very troubled skin.  </li>
            <li> She eve gave me recommendations for other qualify skin care products.</li>
            <li> other company  would do that for me?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no dermatologist, but I can&#x27;t argue with the mirror or other people&#x27;s comments.</li>
            <li> I like the small size of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I would make is</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve tried numerous anti aging products.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, which I use with other products.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I tried it is that Costco quit carrying my past C skin product.  </li>
            <li> be using it once I&#x27;m finish with my other serum.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> so I decided to order this one again even though the other brands are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this same item in past and no issues.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li> the other day we were talking about day to day issues</li>
            <li> I have used some other products</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other products from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I found it to have a silkier consistency than what I used before, and it didn&#x27;t have an odor like the other product.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference with the other product but continued to use it.</li>
            <li> It never happened to me with other C Serums I&#x27;ve use (Skin Ceuticals).  </li>
            <li> It might work for other complexions, but not mine.</li>
            <li> use with other anti-aging serums</li>
            <li> have to mention that I have received a gift/discount for writing this, but would have done so anyway - as I rely on other peoples comments.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything other than moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how much younger I look in 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m concerned about: one is my forehead and the other is under my eyes because my cheekbones have been a bit &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use all the product I purchased but, unlike some other reviews no one seems to notice a difference nor do I.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase Serumtologie due to my extreme satisfaction with the results.</li>
            <li> On this product, I had to leave a review because when I first decided to purchase I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> The serum works well with other products including sunscreen and makeup.</li>
            <li> I had read that Serumtologie remained stabilized as evidenced by the fact that it didn&#x27;t turn orange as the other product had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to do a comparison to ONE of the other Serum C products - Azure&#x27;s</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m updating as of July 16, 2015: I&#x27;ve dropped every other C serum and switched to this one exclusively.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m updating as of July 16, 2015: I&#x27;ve dropped every other C serum and switched to this one exclusively.</li>
            <li> (This doesn&#x27;t even take into account the other ingredients of this product).  </li>
            <li> I am not sure, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like the product has extra perfumes of colors added, maybe thats the reason why.</li>
            <li> There is nothing else on the market (other than fillers) to erase those lines.</li>
            <li> ..WAS skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> But I take other supplements and don&#x27;t need to overdose...</li>
            <li> I have not had any breakouts from the product which often happens with other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> For me, I just didn&#x27;t think it worked as well as other Vitamin C Serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin,a little bit damaged from the sun.</li>
            <li> I want to point out that Serumtologie C is a different form of Vitamin C which I have found to be more stable and doesn&#x27;t go bad in a month like the others I&#x27;ve tried in the past!</li>
            <li> and I must be very careful about what products I use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about as I&#x27;ve seen no changes to my skin and actually found my skin to be worse since using it than my last product.  </li>
            <li> Has the active ingredients I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am 75 yrs old, and was doubtful anything would really help my face look younger and fresher, and yes, the lines and wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell if there are any long term results, but it does seem to make my skin feel softer and possibly I am seeing less brown spots or at least a blending of skin color to make them seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I keep it in the refrigerator because my experience with the previous products was that they seemed to go bad very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effectiveness is hard to determine since I was already using vitamin C, however, I will be going back to Ann Webb as soon as I finish this product.</li>
            <li> Add that to the constant pollution of Los Angeles along, my skin has become quite dull.</li>
            <li> Having over 15 years experience as an esthetician (skin care specialist) and a licensed instructor, I&#x27;ve worked with countless product lines on a large base of clients with various skin types and conditions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on the deeper lines but they are not as bad as when I started and this is the results of only the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I have noticed dark spots on hands seem to be improving</li>
            <li> It has also lightened the dark spots on my d√©collet√©.</li>
            <li> Brightens your skin reduces dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see what happens with long term use of the Vitamin C serum and Whipped Chiffon.  </li>
            <li> I had been getting dark spots from recurring acne, since getting off birth control a year ago.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are gone.</li>
            <li> Some dark spots and wrinkles started bothering me couple of years ago.</li>
            <li> my dark spots have lightened and lines around my lips are shrinking.  </li>
            <li> I have one area on my jaw that has a dark spot about the size of a dime and am going to be watching that to see if it fades.</li>
            <li> I still have dark spots they didn&#x27;t fade at all</li>
            <li> I will always be a lifelong customer !!</li>
            <li> I will try their other products!</li>
            <li> and of course, she didn&#x27;t mean I looked 30 or even 35, but that I look younger than the 48 years that I am</li>
            <li> My other products leave little goo balls under my eyes and this doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My wife (who is 52) ordered this after trying a few other vitamin C serums.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and only notice very small change to lines on my face.</li>
            <li> And one think that I noticed, besides the way my skin feels, and the decreasing forehead ceases, is that I am plucking my chins hairs less often.  </li>
            <li> It seemed that my skin got healthier from using Serumtologie C serum, and it required less to achieve hydration.</li>
            <li> I noticed results in less than a week--</li>
            <li> I have previously used vitamin C from DHC and this product blows it away from the start.</li>
            <li> I am noticing smoother skin and wrinkles seem less defined.  </li>
            <li> The texture of my skin has softened and some lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Still the forbead wrinkles, but less pronounced.</li>
            <li> I also see a slight reduction in the redness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> In much less time than that (1 week)</li>
            <li> but I did see a difference with previous serums.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing less make up because my skin has improved.  </li>
            <li> I feeeel my skin looks less wrinkled</li>
            <li> I bought it to address previous acne scarring on one corner of my face - the pigmentation and pitting.</li>
            <li> Less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles are less visible and my face is smoother.</li>
            <li> an wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I would say that during this week those spots appear less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I had previously read that this product could reduce age spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used Skinceuticals CE Ferulic</li>
            <li> It spreads easier than my previous brand&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does last a little bit since is only on your face but still expensive for my taste</li>
            <li> In addition, I noticed that my normally dry skin that was getting drier due to the cold weather, felt soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Also, I had a broken blood vessel (I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s technically the correct term, but it looked like a red dot on my cheek that I always felt compelled to cover up) which you can hardly see at all now.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C serums in the past and this was not what i expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> Then use another Hot washcloth, then finish with a cold washcloth.</li>
            <li> so at first, I was afraid of having a reaction to the product.  </li>
            <li> 39 year old male, never used any skin care products before, thought it was just girlie (sorry ladies!).</li>
            <li> I need to try using a little less, as I am already finished with my bottle.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a facelift, ladies, but I&#x27;ve noticed subtle changes in my skin&#x27;s elasticity and tone over the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying it each morning, my face feels tight and&lt;br /&gt;shiny, and I am noticing a reduction in the lines on my&lt;br /&gt;forehead, which is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> /&gt;it does not burn or feels tight</li>
            <li> My skin did not react and have that tight, itchy sore feeling.</li>
            <li> During the winter, I could usually be found flying down mountain sides on skis or a snowboard while getting consistently hit in the face with high speed, frigid winter air.</li>
            <li> so hopefully I can get a few less wrinkles then my mom had at my age.</li>
            <li> My skin looks dry, thick and skin pores enlarged after three days using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of some people having bad reactions to topical vitamin c serum, but if you&#x27;re not one of these few, I would highly recommend you try this one.</li>
            <li> This serum says I&#x27;ll see results in as little as 30 days</li>
            <li> the bigining it was a little drying to my skin</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would compares to other products.  </li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint is that the label is so fully wrapped around the bottle, I can&#x27;t tell the level of the liquid and know when to reorder!  </li>
            <li> My skin texture seems to have improved,dark spots lightened, and possibly a little firmer.</li>
            <li> just got a little easier for me with this product.  </li>
            <li> just got a little easier for me with this product.  </li>
            <li> Saw little results after 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this serum, along with their whipped chiffon moisturizer for a little over three months</li>
            <li> The product information states that &amp;#34;visible results can be seen in as little as 30 days.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It seemed to lighten my age spots a little after a month.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at this little miracle in a bottle .</li>
            <li> i have been using this serum for a little over one month and my skin feels softer and appears brighter.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to offer a little education...</li>
            <li> Notice little improvement in the line and</li>
            <li> After a month of use, I see little improvement but will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> The little furrow lines are gone.</li>
            <li> This serum is a little on the sticky side.</li>
            <li> I noticed it took care of the little things that I don&#x27;t like about my face.</li>
            <li> I received the product before expected!!!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50 and I am little skeptical about miracles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and see no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother and firmer after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for few days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> a few weeks go..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have a few wrinkles and kinks in my skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago &amp; wanted to try it for about a month before leaving my review.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Noticed results within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> read a few articles on Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li> and I will write another review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> So, I wanted to go ahead and edit my review since its been a few days now</li>
            <li> Is not too heavy, it&#x27;s been easier for me to apply make up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope the ferulic acid will lighten a few brown sun spots I have.</li>
            <li> I have been using a few drops every morning and before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> The serum is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on my face at all.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of application I noticed smoother skin on my face and neck and a softer texture.</li>
            <li> Takes a few weeks, but do see noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Twice I tried to use it, but after a few weeks my skin looked dried out.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use I have a smoother , healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> a heavy or oily feel like some moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> so I use my serum day and night and always follow up with a moisturizer once my serum has dried.</li>
            <li> Also, I read somewhere, the glow goes away a few weeks after you stop using it.</li>
            <li> My puffiness has been reduced, the skin has begun to firm up and looks brighter.</li>
            <li> noticed, after just a few applications, brighter and smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue using it and will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Feels like I have anti-aged my wrinkles under my eyes and on my face by years in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Waiting for these few pigmented acne scars to go away.</li>
            <li> I will follow-up after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but the smell is quite similar.&lt;br /&gt;After 7 days of use, I do not see improvement on my skin, in fact, it dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few of these serums that include Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic together to see what the difference is....</li>
            <li> Harsh wake up</li>
            <li> but you see a firm skin.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference immediately and have been using it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> We are our own worst critics and people</li>
            <li> of all, the company has contacted me a few times by email to see how the product is working and to answer any questions.  </li>
            <li> bottle of this, using the 8 drop method, at night, every night, will last you approximately 5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been a few months now and I am still ordering this serum.</li>
            <li> For this price, I would expect that missing an evening here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what this will to my skin in a few weeks and months.</li>
            <li> I Knocked my bottle over after a week and lost half the product!</li>
            <li> Lines &amp; wrinkles are less noticeable!  </li>
            <li> My skin is smother and less lines !  </li>
            <li> For the last year I have had horrible dry skin with eczema on my face, this serum had an immediate positive impact on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This one is fairly thick and has lasted a bit longer that the other brands.  </li>
            <li> It has not been dramatic, but an overall softening effect.  </li>
            <li> The dropper helps to control the amount you use and so there is very little waste.</li>
            <li> I had been using another C serum and wanted to try a similar but less expensive brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past few weeks, my skin has felt tighter.  </li>
            <li> but I do have a few blemishes and a couple small scars from dog bite</li>
            <li> but I have noticed my chin hairs have slowed down their growth by at least 75%.  </li>
            <li> This was suggested to help reverse the effects of my sun damage and/or slow down (or what I call -hold at bay)</li>
            <li> The only problem I had is that it comes with a shrink wrap over the cap that was a little difficult getting off.</li>
            <li> I will re-post after a few weeks with any new results.&lt;br /&gt;Great company, can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
            <li> It goes bad if left open.</li>
            <li> Those harsh chemicals made my skin crepey, rough and thin.</li>
            <li> After I have used it for about a week, i notice my skin is brighter, and mean while a lot of pimples popped out as well, maybe due to my late night sleep, but i do have my beauty sleep of 8 hours everyday.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked to get a personal response back within a few hours!</li>
            <li> Used for a little over a month some times twice a day, but at least once a day every day.</li>
            <li> I am a little late with writing this review</li>
            <li> After a month using I see very little improvement .</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast but just little bit disappointed</li>
            <li> Listen, I am here to tell you, after having a dull, uneven complexion for the past 7 years-</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying I&#x27;m not the review type of person;  I write reviews when something is really bad or really</li>
            <li> After using the serum for the past 2 months I am amazed in the improvement of my complexion.</li>
            <li> The change in my skim is unbelievable</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Have not felt/seen a tightening effect, but i am not sure that this is a claimed result; yet, I would like to find a product that also provides tightening.</li>
            <li> This I not business as usual.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed about my skin and as I mentioned earlier I have tried just about everything on the market to keep my face from showing my age.  </li>
            <li> The serum has softened the small wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> I usually keep abreast of the&lt;br /&gt;new products that help skin as I am 68</li>
            <li> usually break out from stress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a Vitamin C serum for my face but was not sure which product to buy.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a bit small for the price.</li>
            <li> A small bottle of goodness.</li>
            <li> but it caused my cheek, nose, and the space between my eyebrows to break out in small bumps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I usually use Kiehls midnight recovery serum night, and I use this morning.</li>
            <li> I used vitamin C serum from Skinceuticals and Biopeutics in the past, both worked well for me</li>
            <li> Hoping for no more sagging.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive if you are paying regular price</li>
            <li> I see a visible difference in the small lines and wrinkles around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it works, haven&#x27; seen any results</li>
            <li> No more mixing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written about this problem in the past</li>
            <li> I felt so uncomfortable with the attention I was getting in front of my husband but definitely flattered.</li>
            <li> I am lazy and do not wash my face at night</li>
            <li> I have had very few spots the past 24 weeks and will continue to use the serum.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately the bottle won&#x27;t stay closed tight.</li>
            <li> Less visibility of lines and wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> Over a few days, it looked and felt like my skin was glowing instead of the dull look it always has, especially during the cold Midwest winters here.  </li>
            <li> I think IMO its not a good product, and feel I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> Also, my dark spots have decreased quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also completely stopped using a very expensive product with hydroquinone along with tretinoin.  </li>
            <li> and i have broken out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say, but I think I  see a difference.</li>
            <li> That is until I started seeing lines around my eyes  and a generally dull tone to my skin.</li>
            <li> I could hardly wait for this Vitamin C to be delivered.  </li>
            <li> The cost of finding one that works and that you like and doesn&#x27;t break the bank is hard.  </li>
            <li> Hard to describe.</li>
            <li> really hard to find qualities</li>
            <li> I found this out the hard way after taking on vacation.</li>
            <li> Wow, if you want to get taken again, order this, bad.</li>
            <li> She has received a lot of compliments lately on her skin tone, and the sun spots seem to be fading, which she attributes, at least in part, to C serums.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this every day and hope see changes soon or at least hope to delay aging.</li>
            <li> I will have to try it myself but at least I can attest to the products effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> I know it takes at least 30 days for a product to work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review after I use this product for at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 20s</li>
            <li> it is free of all those nasty ingredients, like parabens!</li>
            <li> Give it at least 30 day for sunspots, they did not happen overnight , but you will see improvement.</li>
            <li> I am updating because I have just recommended this product to my sister and was looking over the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I would encourage everyone to at least try it once.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to see results after having used it for a week, at least.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that his wrinkles are also slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li> Because of the thick indentations lines around my mouth, I stay away from the mouth and eye areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try another soon, works slowly I guess, some improvement.</li>
            <li> This serum is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I am the worst at nightly routines except brushing my teeth‚Ä¶but I was excited to start using serumtologie serum</li>
            <li> and I mean NEVER</li>
            <li> In just a few days the texture of my skin has improved DRAMATICALLY!!</li>
            <li> with other overly  expensive serums.  </li>
            <li> The difference in my skin is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I am very anxious for a month to go by, but I don&#x27;t know if this is attributed to the vitamin C</li>
            <li> Ten people in front of me had horrible results and they were at least 15 years younger.</li>
            <li> I can feel a subtle tightening on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t hesitate ordering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious, my skin is like I&#x27;m 21 again.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is a gem.</li>
            <li> I have bought less expensive Vitamin C products and have returned them or used them on my hands.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles below my eye area have become remarkably shallow.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive</li>
            <li> I have medium brown skin &amp; get really bad hyperpigmentation right across my nose during the summer due to a faint birthmark that basically burns badly over the summer.</li>
            <li> I would least expect it, asking what my skin care Secret is.</li>
            <li> Having had a very bad experience with fillers this has really made a difference.</li>
            <li> which is why I purchased this one--hoping that I could get results with a less expensive product (an ongoing quest) but alas, it felt like a placebo serum.  </li>
            <li> and I can hardly wait!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve taken at least 5 years off of my skin!  </li>
            <li> I have also tried other less expensive brands (like Azure Naturals) and been disappointed.</li>
            <li> A bit anxious now??!!</li>
            <li> No more makeup mask!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt unhealthy for some time now</li>
            <li> and since I have been using this product my breakouts have significantly decreased.  </li>
            <li> Definitely decreased the lines on my forehead and crows feet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to give this product a poor review.  </li>
            <li> It has broken her out with whiteheads all over her checks.  </li>
            <li> but it has gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> , after a week of usage, my skin looks worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It will be my secret serum from now on.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well and non - irritating.  </li>
            <li> It provides instant hydration and radiance and even smoothes out the nasty little creases (aka &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34;!).  </li>
            <li> This made a dramatic difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> already seen dramatic results</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in the other serum.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered others that didn&#x27;t do anything and some went bad in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients that don&#x27;t cause terrible side effects</li>
            <li> I am 62, soon to be 63 and although people always are shocked at my age, I noticed some deeper lines and small bumps on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable results!!!</li>
            <li> I also had 2 brown spots from pimples gone wrong that I thought would be with me forever.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, so I have started looking around a bit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have sun damage spots on my forehead that appeared two years ago.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ordered my C Serum 22, but had to leave state for work before it was delivered.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t worry about putting it on and it disturbing my makeup (Clarins UV Plus HP sunscreen mulit-protection tint).</li>
            <li> I am addicted to it !</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to use products without a reaction.</li>
            <li> Some faint discoloration I had on my chin has disappeared.</li>
            <li> I asked wat was wrong</li>
            <li> This product is useless.  </li>
            <li> YOU END UP BEING BILLED EACH MONTH DESPITE THE FAKE CLAIM OF A 14 DAY TRIAL&lt;</li>
            <li> Unfortunately It breaks me out, my skin couldnt tolerate i</li>
            <li> It is a needless, affordable, efficient, non greasy  treatment.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I began using Serum 22 the morning after it arrived and have used it every day since without fail (about 3 weeks at this posting).  </li>
            <li> Kinda weird for me</li>
            <li> I am trying to repay my skin for years of abuse and am addicted to this product already!</li>
            <li> Beware that product is mucho expensive</li>
            <li> It is expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but I use it liberally and it lasted 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: this horrible stuff caused my face to literally break out in sores, turn red and become puffy.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I&#x27;ve been there, done that, bought the t-shirt and wore it out on expensive products.  </li>

            <li> Other products give me a horrible, artificial feeling on my skin that drives me nuts.  </li>

            <li> ,I noticed my skin was looking bad around my eyes, forehead and cheeks from smoking, lack of water, not using sunscreen, bad diet etc etc.</li>
            <li> although the tightness isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for about 2 years now. I like that it has a 5% concentration of hyaluronic acid. It is hard to find a product with more than 1% hyaluronic in it. My dermatologist also  likes the antioxidants that are in it. There is no magic bullet to eliminate aging skin, but this product does a good job of keeping my skin hydrated and safer from free radicals. I always use a sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible C formulation! I am definitely hooked!</li>
            <li> I am seeing slight improvement in my skin texture and fine lines after using for a week and a half, however, the smell of this product is kind of a turn off. I deal with it because of the benefits of the product. The packaging is great and the eyedropper is perfect for application.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It definitely has made my skin softer and brighter, fresher, just as described.  I have also noticed my skin does not have dry patches anymore.  This is the first facial skin product I have ordered again!  I also know they have great customer service because I e-mailed the company asking how long a bottle should last.  I ordered my first bottle in mid February and just now needed to order my second bottle.  I thought the bottle would would last a little longer.  Vanessa e-mailed me back within a day and gave me a promo code to use which brought the price of my second bottle down to $5.00!  Even without a promo code, I will definitely continue to order this serum!</li>
            <li> did brighten my face a lot which I loved and felt great, love this product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> s√©rumtologi√©¬Æ C serum ¬∫22 is a wonderful product.  I use it every morning and night.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks and I already have noticed that my skin is softer, tiny lines are disappearing and dark spots are fading.  The customer service is beyond compare.  They are wonderful.  I plan on using this product forever.  Thank you for making such a wonderful product for us.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I have sensitive skin and am using with no problem.  Skin has a nicer glow and feels softer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note  I am receiving a promotion re: this product</li>
            <li> My wife (who is 52) ordered this after trying a few other vitamin C serums.  She likes Dermaceutic C25, but it is very expensive so she decided to give this a try.  It is a very thick serum, which is nice, and drys quickly.  You are supposed to use this under moisturizer because it allegedly absorbs/sucks the moisturizer better into the skin.  She uses this twice a day, in the morning after toner and then under moisturizer (Shiseido nutriperfect day) and then sunscreen (elta MD).  She uses it at night, after toner and before moisturizer.  She has received a lot of compliments lately on her skin tone, and the sun spots seem to be fading, which she attributes, at least in part, to C serums.  Is this better than the others on the market?  She does not know, but says that this is a good one and she would order it again.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice any difference after using for about 2 months</li>
            <li> This serum says I&#x27;ll see results in as little as 30 days and I can hardly wait! The serum texture is perfect for smooth application and my skin absorbs it immediately - no sticky or wet residue. I will update my review forward the end of my 30 days but I have a feeling it will remain 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. use it every day.</li>
            <li> The customer service by this company is outstanding, delivery time was exceptional and the product is still being reviewed as I have a skin type that takes a great deal more care than the norm - the sun can have disastirous affects.  I highly recommend this company and will provide further updates during the review process.</li>
            <li> im still waiting to see the results I expected. One thing I will say ,I have had a bump on my nose for two months that wouldn&#x27;t budge. I applied this serum directly on the bump for two days and that bump popped right on out. I was very pleased and am doing it on another blemish on my neck now hoping to get the same results. will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I do love the way my skin looks. I also had 2 brown spots from pimples gone wrong that I thought would be with me forever. In 2 weeks they were NOTICEABLY lighter, and now 3.5 weeks they are pretty much gone.THAT was amazing!! Didn&#x27;t expect that. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion for providing feedback, but I would be writing this review without any additional reward!!!  I have extremely sensitive skin, but this lovely serum not only is making my skin look and feel amazing, it is doing so without any irritation.  I have a few dark spots that are noticeably lighter in just three weeks, and overall my skin looks brighter.  I have only the very tiniest fine lines, but they are smaller everyday.  This serum does on lightly, no weird smell, dries quickly without being tacky.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really is the best one on the market and it&#x27;s priced just right.</li>
            <li> I went through 1 bottle and immediately ordered a second bottle so I wouldn&#x27;t skip a beat. I really love how this makes my face feel clean and tight. This is the perfect combination of feeling moisturized, but not oily. My skin feels really great after using this and for only $30/bottle I really feel like it&#x27;s a fantastic deal. All the other positive reviews are spot on :) I&#x27;m 27 so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or tons of age spots, but this definitely makes me feel more confident without wearing makeup because my skin feels and looks better than before. And hopefully it&#x27;ll keep those fine lines and wrinkles at bay :) Also, Vanessa the Co-founder is fantastic. She replies quickly to any questions or concerns about the product. She eve gave me recommendations for other qualify skin care products. Based on the product itself and then the great customer service- I&#x27;ll definitely keep using serumtologie C serum ¬∫22 :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks without my wife&#x27;s knowledge.  She was looking at me and asked me if I was doing botox - LOL.  She said my face seemed to have less wrinkles, more fullness, and &amp;#34;bounced back&amp;#34; when she pressed on my skin - and, I&#x27;m 60.  I told her I was using this product and she demanded I order some for her.</li>
            <li> Great!!&lt;br /&gt;Works well, this is the second time I have purchased this product.</li>
            <li> This is a professional grade serum that will help make your skin younger looking, glowing and diminish those age wrinkles. You will love how it goes on smoothly, without an oily feel. It is absorbed quickly. make it part of your daily regimen and follow with a moisturizer. You will be amazed within a week on how much better your skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it goes on smooth and works under ur makeup</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Absorbs well into the skin. Fine lines are diminishing, especially my crows feet. My skin feels so soft and smooth after using. I started seeing results within days of using. No negative side effects. A little goes a long way, so just use a dab. This is defiantely one of my favorites. The quality is amazing. It&#x27;s just as good as those high end products...maybe a little better.</li>
            <li> I like C22 very much.  My sensitive skin tolerates it well and it has faded some sun damage from long ago.  I will re-order and recommend to my friends.  Re:  packaging, it would be nice if there was a gap in the label on the bottle so  I could see when I need to re-order.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I LOVE IT!!  It has softened the lines on my face, particularly around my mouth, and my skin looks brighter and more vibrant. There are huge benefits in continued use of this product.  It contains a very high concentration of free radical fighting ingredients offering protection against environmental contaminants keeping the natural aging process to skin at bay. I reviewed many products on line before ordering this one and I am pleased w/ my choice.  And, the company that makes this product actually cares!  They contacted me asking how I like the product and sent me a lengthy email answering all my questions.  And, as thanks for making my experience known to others out there I will be receiving another bottle of C serum 22 at a deeply discounted rate!!! ...  a promotion in return for candid feedback.  Thank you, serumtologie, C serum 22!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet, but I just started using it. I love the awesome ingredients and that is is 22%!</li>
            <li> I  purchased the C Serum hoping to reduce wrinkles around my eyes.  Amazingly, besides diminish wrinkles on my face it also helped to tighten and smoothen my skin.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am so very grateful to the developers of this skin product! At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, as I have a Rosecea condition and have had several bad reactions to other products. After 3 weeks of use I can honestly say that my skin has a more even tone, the fine lines are easing up and to my surprise the Rosecea outbreak I had at first has cleared up. I feel that the outbreak in the first few days was due to combining C22 with another product. Now I am using it alone...but I feel that my skin needs a little more moisture, so I ordered the Pure Whipped Chiffon Daily Facial Moisturizer. As this moisturizer is made to combine with C22 I expect the best! I received a e-note from Vaness Powers the co- founder of Serumotologie and she has been wonderful in supporting me through the correct use of this product. I am very concerned about our environment and feel that the best place to make a difference is in our personal environment. As a hairstylest and a Nutrition Consultant I am confident to recommend this product. Whether we put a substance in out mouth or on our skin...it is the same thing, it all makes our bodies healthy or not. These products use only natural ingredience that you can define and understand and keep the ingredients to the simple few that are the necessary ones. I&#x27;ll let you know if this does cure my Rosecea (a surprise bonus!)...it seems to have done that :)</li>
            <li> I do not like this product. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and see no difference in my skin. I think IMO its not a good product, and feel I wasted my money.  Very disappointed.  I think Vaseline moisturizer for men does a better job and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, you can almost instantly feel the difference in your skin. It leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft, without making your your skin feel tight. The hydration is amazing it makes your skin almost glow, I am in love with this. It doesnt leave any sticky residue and it doesnt dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum because a co worker raved about it so I decided to give it a try. I have very sensitive skin and I must be very careful about what products I use. This serum is wonderful I&#x27;m a 49 year old african American women with fine line on my forehead and blemishes on my face and I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for 4 days and I can honestly say that I see improvement in my skin. My face is much smoother the lines on my face are starting to disappear and the blemishes appear to be fading.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is impressive, but the product seems to have no effect on me. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Taking away the rosea I have had for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Serum C-22 is a wonderful product.  It is packaged easy to handle and to use.  It has make my skin so soft, clear and brighter since using it for 3 weeks.  Customer service is also very helpful in their follow up after a few weeks use to see if I was satisfied and had any questions.&lt;br /&gt;what other company  would do that for me?  &#x27;They also offer a discount on the next bottle with cost being $5.00 and a complimentary jar of &#x27;whipped &#x27;chiffon Moisturizer.  &#x27;Great &#x27;customer service and I look forward to a long relationship with them.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Would love the lines on my face to disappear...22% of vitamin C in a skin product is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> very disappointed. I liked the idea of a stronger vitamin C than the average 20%, however the Vitamin E is in oil form i think and i have broken out pretty bad. Its clogging my pores so badly I now have milia and blackheads like crazy, where there where none before. . I kept using it hoping it was just an initial reaction, however after almost a month I am tapping out and going back to my previous vitamin C product. The only effect i have gotten from this product is acne.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not was I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my skin all the time, and as a person who&#x27;s often out in public, it&#x27;s nice to be mistaken for being ten or twelve years younger than I am. I&#x27;ve been using the C serum for more than six months, and my skin is noticeably brighter and not as rough. I think lines are smaller too. I&#x27;m no dermatologist, but I can&#x27;t argue with the mirror or other people&#x27;s comments.</li>
            <li> tightens my skin. smells great!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love having the vit C on my face, I know it helps, I was in the sun growing up working on the farm and I am paying for it now, but I feel the vit c helps!</li>
            <li> My face feels extra soft and definitely smoother. The dark puffy circles are smaller.</li>
            <li> It is really good. It helped to replenish my skin.</li>
            <li> very good is working just fine</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; I feel more confident using c22 my face has a youthful glow to it, even skin tone, I got on top of age spots before using this product, but I can say while using this product the age spots have not returned.&amp;#34; I will continue to use this product I am 47 and will buy it as a gift for my sister who is 54. You will benefit to add this to your daily morning ritual. After writing this review I received a discount on this product... A very nice surprise :)</li>
            <li> I love how it works i feel my skin tightening!</li>
            <li> great product, great price.. I can see the change already.. received product a day early.. I will buy more when this bottle is gone and buy extra for gifts.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum, and it seems to be working very well for me. It did, however, take about 3 months to start to see some of the fine lines going away. It is a bit expensive, so I have started looking around a bit. I started using the Skingenixx vitamin c serum as well, [[ASIN:B00VXE0EEY Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]], and so far I think the Skingenixx is a little bit better. I guess time will tell.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I know of other brands that have same ingredients for a lot more money. I have been using for about a week now and have seen immediate results. My skin tone and fine lines have improved! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Good for your skin, looks bright, young.&lt;br /&gt;2 Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great serum!! Everyone needs this!!! My skin is sooooo soft and pores really are smaller!!! This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my 11 line. I have gotten botox and decided to find a possible substitute in a serum. I&#x27;ll tell there is no substitute to Botox, but this serum is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I have been using this daily for about a week and a half in my face and neck. My skin seems to be evening out by degrees and I&#x27;m more confident going without makeup! I have some acne spots that I&#x27;m hoping will continue to lighten up. My skin hasn&#x27;t had any sort of bad reaction or sensitivity to this serum, so I&#x27;m happy there.</li>
            <li> I like the way this serum feels on my skin.  It makes my skin smooth and soft.  I would recommend using this product.  It softens the lines on your face and makes it look healthier.</li>
            <li> This is a nice C and HA serum, and I like the extra ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I really like the moisturizer by this company, but for whatever reason I like the Azure Naturals brand of Vit C serum better as it seems to spread better.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best serum I have tried to date.  My skin is much softer and younger looking.  Doesn&#x27;t take but a few drops for your entire face and neck,  Would highly recommend this to anyone looking to add C serum to their routine.</li>
            <li> Love it. And I can tell a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum morning and evening and I can feel a difference. The liquid absorbs immediatey into the skin- and you would need a moisturizer on top of it. Using it by itself would feel a bit too dry for me. I like the small size of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion I would make is is in the bottling itself. Somehow we need to see the content in the bottle, and how much is left. I will re-order certainly. Thank you for a great product and better yet, thank you for the free shipment! it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much,all my sun spots are clearing on my face so I have started to put two drops on the back of my hands also&lt;br /&gt;And they are looking great. It works so good my husband is now using it too</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum 22 by Serumtologie is like being touched by an Angel&#x27;s wand. Lines and dark spots have faded and I&#x27;m hardly  a &#x27;young thing&#x27;  This is my second bottle and I will never use anything else. Wow!  Serumtologie is a great company, helpful and informative. Bravo! August 26. By bunny H</li>
            <li> My skin already feels softer. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I am loving the Serumtologie C serum 22.  This is my second time I purchased and the product is very special.  I do not notice any dramatic results, but my skin is much brighter and my pores are not clogged.  I can tell something positive is happening.  I will continue to buy.  Additionally, the customer service is exceptional.</li>
            <li> Best Serum for the price!!! I have to say that i been using this product for 3 weeks now and I already see a diffrence in my face.&lt;br /&gt;At the bigining it was a little drying to my skin but it took me a week to settle on my skin. i am 38 years old with good skin because i been taking care of it since my 20;s but  order this seerum for some fine lines under my eyes that are starting to show now  and there almost gone!:) I will recomend this to everyone that is looking for a glowing skin and to reduce fine lines ans wrinkles IS AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased s√©rumtologi√©¬Æ PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer and s√©rumtologi√©¬Æ C serum ¬∫22 for my wife at the suggestion of a trusted friend. My wife saw quick results and encouraged me to use the products myself. I&#x27;ve been delighted by the moisturizing benefits of the cream and the wrinkle reduction benefits of the serum since I have dry skin. I&#x27;ve made them both a part of my daily routine. I highly recommend the use of these products especially if you been searching high and low for these types of solutions to no avail. Thank you s√©rumtologi√©¬Æ!</li>
            <li> great product--I notice a difference in my skin.  Sellers are prompt and professional.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> The product is nice and silky but it&#x27;s taking WAY longer than promised. I will continue to use the entire bottle to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> Not only is this product as good as advertised, the people behind the company are genuine too.  I&#x27;ve personally communicated with them and they went above board to make me feel like a valued customer.  And one think that I noticed, besides the way my skin feels, and the decreasing forehead ceases, is that I am plucking my chins hairs less often.  Yes, I know this sounds crazy but I have noticed my chin hairs have slowed down their growth by at least 75%.  Plucking is not an every other day occurrence any longer, I can go for a week before I notice that in the light I have hairs popping out.&lt;br /&gt;And I love the way it absorbs into my skin so quickly and I can feel the nice tightening that helps those wrinkles fade away.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your product and your kind manner in dealing with your customers.&lt;br /&gt;Breck</li>
            <li> It helped with the brown spots on my legs and didn&#x27;t cause any stinging at all on my face.  The service from the company was excellent, and they provided feedback when I indicated I wanted to reorder but found the product out of stock.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the first C Serum that I have tried and I really loved it. My skin felt smoother and firmer after just a few uses. Their customer service is kind and personal. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any effect of it yet</li>
            <li> ‚ÄúThe is the best face serum that I have used, and the price is great‚Äù</li>
            <li> Serumtologie C serum 22 Max the best I every had lighted up my complexion diminished fine lines &amp; wrinkles  the hyaluronic acid 5% has given my face volume. On a scale 1-10  I give it a 10</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference after using it for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am using my 2nd bottle and it is looking better yet. Because of my chemo treatments, my face got so dark and so far this serum has been a miracle. I am still under treatment but my face is lighter and clearly continued use will make a difference.  I also noticed that my skin is not as dry and its texture is much better. I use it before I go to bed and in the morning prior to putting makeup.  I am very excited about the progress I am making since I was paying pretty close to the same amount for another brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle, no real change in my skin. Not sure how it would compares to other products.  This is the first time to ever use any kind of C serum. On older skin like mine it may take a little longer.  I will continue to use this every day and hope see changes soon or at least hope to delay aging. I rated the product 3*, but would rate their customer service 10+.</li>
            <li> Incredible ....saw a difference in the first week! I should have taken a before picture it&#x27;s that dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;I am recommending it to all my friends and clients. Looking forward to the moisturizer I know it will be just as fabulous...Thank you..Thank You...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandra in Santa Fe NM</li>
            <li> Ladies, I am super impressed with this product.  I have been using it for 1 week and YES YES  it Is incredible !!!!  You will not be disappointed. Honestly,  I am seeing results that are amazing. My skin is silky soft and the fine lines are diminishing. After you apply it, your skin will feel Tighter...  I PROMISE.</li>
            <li> I love C serum 22. I haven‚Äôt used it very long, but in the few weeks that I have used it, its amazing! My face is more hydrated. I can‚Äôt wait to see the results after using it for a couple of months. I love that there are no harmful chemicals! I‚Äôm going to order another bottle tonight, I don‚Äôt ever want to be without it! I ordered the PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer along with the C serum22, I can&#x27;t wait  to try the  PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer! I have used so many skin care lines over the years, but I truly believe this is what I have been searching for!</li>
            <li> Disappointing.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to really make any difference in the appearance or feel of the skin.  Haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time, maybe three weeks, but some creams make an immediate difference and these drops do not have that effect. Don&#x27;t waste your money is my early gut feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Giving it three stars since I have not been using it a long time.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin. Clumps under foundation. I&#x27;m using it as a night serum.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Everyone has commented on how bright and clear my skin looks.  My niece has remarked that my skin looks better than hers and I am soooo much older.  Will certainly keep this in my product line.</li>
            <li> I applied this serum to my face as part of my skin care routine for over a month and I didn&#x27;t have the results I was expecting. As soon as I notified the company of my dissatisfaction with the product, they immediately issued me a refund and even sent me a complimentary skin care product. I was very impressed with the customer service. Overall, this product is very well reviewed so it&#x27;s likely something to do with my unique skin chemistry that didn&#x27;t click well with the product. I am open to trying additional products from this company as they seem very dedicated to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve been using Skincelticals C E Ferulic about 3 years, but I decided to try another product with more vitamin C, so I researched and found Serumtologie.  I&#x27;ve been using Serumtologie during the last five months, night and morning,  and I do notice a difference in hydration and my skin looks brighter, pores tighter and some aging spots are fading. It makes my skin soft, smooth and glowing.  I really love this serum and I recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a promotion for providing feedback, but I would be writing this review without any additional reward.</li>
            <li> I have noticed dark spots on hands seem to be improving</li>
            <li> For years I have been searching for the perfect serum, trying one different brand after the other with one disappointing experience after another. . .until now! I can honestly say that I won&#x27;t be needing to try any other serums after trying and using (for about three weeks now) Serumtologie C serum. With just the first use, my face was instantly smoother, and the fine lines around my eyes were definitely less noticeable! After about a week, my skin looked more refreshed and clearer. At first, my skin was soaking up quite a bit of the serum, but after just a few days, I noticed that I was having to use less and less. It seemed that my skin got healthier from using Serumtologie C serum, and it required less to achieve hydration. If my skin doesn&#x27;t improve anymore than it has to this point using this amazing serum, I will be SUPER happy, however, I can only imagine with continued use I will see even more improvements! I LOVE this serum!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good feeling when you try it in the night and pleasant results in the morning. I basically do not think all these products make significant improvements on your skin but if it can stop aging process somehow, that&#x27;s good enough...and I think it does.</li>
            <li> Have definitely seen a reduction in fine lines</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve tried numerous anti aging products. This is one product that I will be ordering again. I&#x27;ll admit that I don&#x27;t use it as often as I should but when I first received it I used it as directed and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. My face feels great.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend C serum 22..</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying this prod.  Not only is the price great, is works well or even better than more of the expensive products available.</li>
            <li> I basically bought this for my hubby. He said it is okay. Except that it cause dryness. He pair it with Neutrogena anti wrinkle. It has some effect like lightening the brown spot although not totally disappearing the spot yet. As for anti wrinkle effect, we have not see any difference yet. We have been using the serum for nearly one month now. We will give this serum a try for another month.    Updated - 21st January 2015  My husband has been using the serum for seven weeks now. Brown/age spots are becoming to really lighten. Its not drying up his face anymore. He is really loving the product. I also noticed that his wrinkles are also slowly diminishing. I love to see the way his skin looks. We bought three more bottles so we do not have to worry if this product ever go out of stocks.     The customer service is also excellent. I received email that inquire if the items arrive safely. Then a follow up on experiences of using the product. I highly recommend the fantastic product and also moved my rating from 4 to 5 star because of the excellent customer service and the money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Using a C serum once you approach your 40&#x27;s is always a good addition to your skin care routine. This product delivers a higher impact and can improve your over-all anti-aging results.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this serum. I could immediately tell my skin felt better--plumper, softer, more hydrated. After a few uses, the look of my skin improved--it looked (and felt) more livelier, more colorful, even though I had not gotten any sun. Over time, I did notice fewer fine lines. I plan to continue using serumtologie C serum!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. Thank you</li>
            <li> This serum is really nice. Has a light pleasant smell. Goes on smooth. But man Im telling you, it really kick starts your skin! Looks more even and glowy, fine lines are starting to fade. Your skin soaks it right up with out being greasy tacky or dry. A little bit goes a long way! So I imagine this bottle is going to last a long time. I love finding new beauty products. Your skin feels really soft too. No burning or tingling that I noticed. My face hasnt broke out either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion and I&#x27;m not financially compensated for them.</li>
            <li> Thank you serumtologie for your AWESOME customer service.  This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like C22 very much.  I use it on my face, neck, and d√©colletage. I&#x27;ve always been blessed with a good complexion, thanks to great genes.  As I get older, it&#x27;s more of a struggle.  However, my neck and d√©colletage seem to be smoother after using C22.  My sister gave me the first bottle of C22.  I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles since.  I will probably order some for my daughters. I believe caring for the skin at a young age is the best way to avoid major problems later in life.  I&#x27;ve used SPF30 for more than 30 years.  Unfortunately, I have sun damage spots on my forehead that appeared two years ago.  This is probably from suntans and sunburns in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s. Everybody looks better with a tan, but there&#x27;s a price to pay. I&#x27;ve used some creams with which I&#x27;ve had some success in fading the spots, but I can&#x27;t say the C22 is doing that.  However, people are complimenting me on my skin again.  When they ask me what I&#x27;m doing, I tell them my routine which includes C22.  I wish I didn&#x27;t empty the bottles so quickly.  I&#x27;ll have to buy more very soon.</li>
            <li> Terrific product and doesn&#x27;t cost near what Dr. Oz recommends.  I&#x27;ve used this for almost 4 weeks and my skin is very soft.  Minor lines are reduced if not gone.  I will continue to use it 2 x a day to work on the deep wrinkles. I highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m 74 years old and it&#x27;s the best product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to heal blemishes, brighten skin, refresh facial coloration.  Does not eliminate wrinkles, however.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face smooth throught the day the only thing i dont like is it dries by the time u get to the other end so my suggestion fill the dropper half way drop it all in one hand rub and apply ...other than that i would highly recommend...the offer made to me as a discount did not reflect my true review on this product</li>
            <li> Februrary 26, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!  I have used it for a month and it has healed much of my hormonal cystic acne.  I am very impressed.  This is the only product so far that heals faster than all of the others I have tried.  I will continue to use on a daily basis.  Thank you so much....</li>
            <li> Wow! I cannot believe it has already been 21 days. Unfortunately, I ordered my C Serum 22, but had to leave state for work before it was delivered. I knew I would be gone for two weeks and really wanted to start using it immediately so I placed an order for another bottle to be delivered to me out of state. However, I did not put in the out of state address, I put in my home address. I now have two bottles and have been using the serumtologie C serum 22 since December 14th and I must say I LOVE IT! It has only been a few days, but it does give my skin that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. I will continue to use your product and I would like to thank you for making this so FANTASTIC and AFFORDABLE!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  On my second bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a disappointment. It certainly did not anti-age me. My skin still looks the same.</li>
            <li> I like the Serumtologie C Serum.  It does do what it states.  However, it is not an instant fix for a younger look.  But I will keep on using it as it has made my skin tighter, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Need to apply it twice a day to see results... also need to use keep hydrated and use sun screen. I was not and the customer care team called me... great team for hopefully a promising product</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself but ended up giving it to my mom.  She absolutely loves it.  I have seen a major difference in her face especially her dark spots have diminished quite a bit (they are still there mind you) but her face seems brighter and more plump after using this product everyday for the last 2 weeks.  She has tried all sorts of products but she swears she has never used anything like this before and she is recommending it to all her friends and family.  I will have to try it myself but at least I can attest to the products effectiveness.  So far so good.  Thank you for this amazing product and for making my mom a happy camper.</li>
            <li> goes on easily, haven&#x27;t seen a change yet but I&#x27;m a patient gal.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be the easiest serum to use and one that I have actually noticed a difference in my skin. First, it is easy you use a dropper and the consistency of the serum allows you to get just the amount you need. Secondly, several years ago I had facial shingles that left scars and darkened areas on a part of my forehead. Obviously, this (or any other topical) isn&#x27;t going to help the scars but it has lightened, significantly, the darkened areas. It has also lightened the dark spots on my d√©collet√©. My face definitely is brighter and moisturizer can (and should) be applied almost immediately. My ONLY complaint is that the label is so fully wrapped around the bottle, I can&#x27;t tell the level of the liquid and know when to reorder!  It certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt that the price is phenomenal--have you seen those $200 bottles of facial serum??!!</li>
            <li> Love this serum!&lt;br /&gt;Only used it for a week and I can already see great results.  I hope not too get ahead of myself as I am trying a variety of new products but so far,  love it! Doesn&#x27;t dry my face,  my skin looks brighter,  healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Finger crossed this will last and hopefully improve my acne prone skin. :-)</li>
            <li> Didnt see a big or no difference after 1 month use.</li>
            <li> I really look forward to applying serumtologie C serum every day. It makes my skin very soft and my wrinkles are getting softer too.  I can feel a subtle tightening on my skin.  I didn&#x27;t get anywhere near this result with many creams and oils I tried.  This product outshines many products I tried including HSN, QVC., and other doctors who sell very expensive products online.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth &amp; you just need a little bit.  I can see that this bottle will definitely last the full month, if not more.  I also really appreciated the informative insert that explains the ingredients and what each one does.  Seems like a good product.</li>
            <li> Customer service was great! I will purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Just received this product and already love the way my skin looks and feels.  I had my annual doctors appointment yesterday and he commented on how beautiful my skin was.  I am 60!  I will definitely continue using this serum and will try some of the other products as well</li>
            <li> Good product. I am starting to use it and I am so happy I can afford it . Thank you very much. By the way,  I need to go  out of the country for six months. I would like to get some bottles to take with me.  Will  this product  still being good for such time ? Please, tell me. I will appreciate your  comments.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRICE FOR AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little sticky but well absorbed in my skin.</li>
            <li> So so product...makes my skin dry...</li>
            <li> just ordered 4th bottle.  I spend 2 months researching the top notch Serums - best known, best rated - but, all with a very high price tag.  I understood what the common ingredients were for a great serum.  I found Serumtologie.  There is no reason you can&#x27;t get the best products with the best dermatologist recommended ingredients - with it costing over $60.  Serumtologie has achieved all of that - that was their mission, which I like.</li>
            <li> I recently turned 53 and was looking for something more than my normal facial moisturizers, so I experimented with several different age fighting lotions though the past year, and the best one I have found has been Serumtologie C serum 22.  It has all but removed my laugh lines, and crows feet.  My face feels much tighter and looks brighter. My skin is more elastic and smooth.  My large nose pores are noticeable smaller.  I am so, so pleased with serum c 22 I will continue to purchase it.  It&#x27;s a good value too, for a little dab goes a long ways making it even more of a good thing!!  I have recommended it to several friends who also love the results.  I noticed results in less than a week-- after three weeks my skin looks 10 years younger or more.  A must have!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now, maybe a little more, and I love it.  My skin feels softer and I believe the fine lines around my eyes are much less noticeable.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product to my friends and family and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more for myself.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at this product. Cheaper and better than a differnt vitamin C I was using before. One squeeze of the dropper, I can rub it on my whole face, neck, chest and top of the hands. This is my new must have!</li>
            <li> I do recommend this serum. Thank You!</li>
            <li> This has a nice consistency.  Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough to give a skin review, but so far so good</li>
            <li> Good stuff - make this old guy look a lot better than he should.</li>
            <li> One of the best C serum I&#x27;ve tried. Skin is plump and smooth. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really love the feel of this item on my face.  The seller has been very helpful in the correct way for me to use the product.</li>
            <li> https://www.truthinaging.com/ingredients/sodium-ascorbyl-phosphate&lt;br /&gt;There is a lack of information available regarding Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate because it is a relatively new derivative of Vitamin C being used in skin care products. However, it is considered to be a very stable precursor of Vitamin C that is able to liberate the powerful antioxidant in the skin ( ScienceLab.com). Although Ascorbic Acid can be an irritant and actually cause acne, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is considered gentle and stable and waits to convert into Ascorbic Acid once it is absorbed. Therefore, it is thought to be a powerful antioxidant that can treat acne on the surface and even stimulate collagen, according to RealSelf.com. It also has skin-whitening abilities ( Beijing Brilliance Biochemical).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety Measures/Side Effects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cosmetics Database finds Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate to be a 99% safe ingredient and notes only data gaps as a concern. Although Vitamin C can be an irritant, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is considered safe and stable. However, studies done in Australia by the National Industrial Chemicals Notification Scheme found that it should only be used in concentrations up to 5% in most formulas, and up to .1% in sunscreens because it was found to be a moderate irritant and sensitizer in rabbit skin, as well as an eye irritant.</li>
            <li> I have seen great changes to my skin.  My skin color is much better as well as reduced signs of wrinkles..  I would definitely  recommend this serum to anyone who wants to see a noticeable change to skin tone and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for few days. It works great and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time last night after receiving it in the mail and I was thrilled with how soft and smooth my skin felt the next morning. I have previously used vitamin C from DHC and this product blows it away from the start. It goes on so silky smooth and I was able to wear it under my makeup this morning as well. My skin feels awesome.  I was asked to write a candid review as part of a promotion for this product.  Even if I was not receiving a discount for this product, I would give it 5 stars. It is worth every penny so far and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works over time. I have never noticed a positive difference in my skin from any product over night. Don&#x27;t hesitate to grab this awesome serum. I plan on stocking up!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. This is the best thing I have tried so far. I have seen improvement with consistent use.  It lives up to its claims and reviews.</li>
            <li> Hello Vanessa,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your product really works...my former girlfriends bags, wrinkles, crows feet, and dark&lt;br /&gt; patches under her eyes are just about gone. Great stuff. Take care and may&lt;br /&gt; God bless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;V/r, Jeff</li>
            <li> I love this product - I have seen a real change in my skin, smaller pores, firmer and less wrinkles - love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 74 yrs old.  While I was blessed with good skin, I spent years living at the beach, and did have a few dark spots, all of which have practically disappeared on using your product promotional for the last few months, and, for which I am thankful.  You have a winning product.&lt;br /&gt;All best wishes</li>
            <li> The serum feels very refreshing, glides on smoothly, directions say to use 5-6 drops in the palm of your hand and spread it over your face, but I&#x27;m finding that you don&#x27;t even need that much to cover your whole face, which means it will last longer (an added plus).  I am using this along with an eye serum I am using and I do see a difference when I use the product vs not using the product for a day or two.  When I don&#x27;t use the product, my face looks a bit drier and the fine lines around my eyes are more visible.  When I do use the product as directed morning and evening, the area around my eyes seem to be plumper, and my face is more dewy, when I put on a little makeup, I feel like my skin positively glows.  I like this product a lot and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> After using the serum for the past 2 months I am amazed in the improvement of my complexion.My skin has become smoother along with the overall added radiance.If you are questioning whether this is the real deal don&#x27;t, go out and buy it now.</li>
            <li> It cleared my face within three weeks.</li>
            <li> this product seems to improve my skin</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! My favorite out of all my serums. The change in my skim is unbelievable thank you to the makers oft his wonderful product. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It took some time and patience but I did see good results from using this product. My skin feels firmer and has a much more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I use it in conjunction with my Skinmedica Dermal Repair, Skinceuticals Retinol 1.0 and Vitamin B serum. I bought this serum to replace my Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, and am so happy that I did! I will definitely be keeping this serum in my skincare regime.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and feel that my use of this product for the past three to four weeks has brought results of softer, and more even toned skin.  I am noticing smoother skin and wrinkles seem less defined.  Happy with the product and feel the price was more than fair and reasonable.  Thank you for this product&#x27;s availability through amazon!</li>
            <li> This has proved to be a wonderful product for my distressed skin!  It provides instant hydration and radiance and even smoothes out the nasty little creases (aka &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34;!).  I use it as a base under my daily make up and feel that is it a lovely thing to have against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;A quick &amp;#34;Thanks&amp;#34; to  Serumtologie for this great product and for the the great discount they offered me in return for my testimonial.&lt;br /&gt;(The truth is, I was recommending this product to my friends prior to this deal being offered).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Sandy</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. It is worth a try. I have even given it as a gift. My friends love it too!</li>
            <li> This product contains a steroid which caused me to suffer amnesia. There should be a warning label. Be careful.</li>
            <li> I tested this product for I love to review and loved it. I have oily skin so I was worried that it would make my skin even more oily, but no It didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> high concentration of vit c!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift to my girl friend. she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before. I will buy this again for her again</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to write a review . I have been using the serum morning &amp; night for 3 months and my sun spots/sun damage has completely faded away . I am so confident to go without makeup . I will always be a lifelong customer !!</li>
            <li> I think this helped smooth out my skin but didn&#x27;t do much for lines and wrinkles.  I have been using it for about 4 months.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I started using it before the holidays...skin is soft and the spots are fading!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now the end of January and I really love how my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry but is soft and smooth...and that&#x27;s saying a lot as I live in Colorado where the winters are hard on exposed skin.  Also love how easy it is to use and how there isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say, but I think I  see a difference. No one has commented, though, so it is definitely not a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this FAITHFULLY for a month now and ZIPPO ZERO results. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> used one bottle and did not see results.</li>
            <li> My wife love this vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;It makes face and skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Her face looks absolutely awesome.&lt;br /&gt;After first couple days, her skin feels firmer and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;She want to going to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible texture.  Saw no result either way. Would not use again.</li>
            <li> I began noticing a change in my skin after only a few days but absolutely love how it  dramatically changed my skin in just 3 weeks.  My sister and my husband both commented on my skin and asked what I was doing differently after just a week of using the serum. Serumtologie has stopped my occasional breakouts and has made a marked improvement in the texture of my skin and pores without any drying. I bought some for my sister and my best friend and can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough!  I&#x27;ll never be without it.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product since November 2014.  I am on bottle #2 now and have been impressed with the look and feel of my skin during pregnancy.  I am not worried about this product causing endocrine disruption since EWG gave it a rating of 1. I have had very few spots the past 24 weeks and will continue to use the serum.  It penetrates quickly into my skin so I don&#x27;t worry about putting it on and it disturbing my makeup (Clarins UV Plus HP sunscreen mulit-protection tint). Be sure when using this product to always use sun protection so that you are not destroying your good deed with UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;I have not seen any lightening of a dark spot on my cheek, but am impressed that is NOT darkening during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my second bottle.  Started using the 1st bottle 2x/day on Jan 23 2015.  Today is Feb 17.  After a scant 3.5 weeks of use, I haven&#x27;t seen reduction in fine lines or crepe areas. Have not felt/seen a tightening effect, but i am not sure that this is a claimed result; yet, I would like to find a product that also provides tightening. What is great about this product is it&#x27;s smooth gel-like texture and it&#x27;s anti-aging ingredients.  This does not bead up under moisturizer or foundation.  I can put this around the eye area, no stinging.  My sensitive skin does NOT break out from this product.  So, I&#x27;m going to give this product a full 60 days and have ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, which I use with other products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a vitamin C serum that was  comparable to my very expensive one and I can across serumtologie C serum 22-max. The first day I applied it I could feel my face soaking it up. After only 4 days I can tell a difference in my skin tone.  Not only is it great for my skin it is easy on my wallet as well!! I am hooked and will continue  to  purchase this product !  I was not given this product so I would write an excellent review, I paid full price and just want to share my discovery of a affordable vitamin C serum that works!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. No change AFTER USING THE WHOLE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum I have used, and I have tried many! My skin looks much brighter, and some of my freckles and sunspots are fading. I have dry skin, and this really makes my face feel moisturized, without looking or feeling greasy. I tend to breakout easy, and many other serums have caused me to breakout. Since I have been using it, my acne is clearing up, and I haven&#x27;t gotten anymore blemishes! I couldn&#x27;t be more excited about this product!!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Brightens your skin reduces dark spots. You can feel it tightening your skin.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous feeling on my face, amazing!</li>
            <li> WIll be getting more of this stuff! My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> i used it every single day for 1 full month and my skin is getting worse not better. it leaves the skin very dry so you have to use a moisturiser on top of it. in short, did not work for me.</li>
            <li> just love it. I am using it continuously for the last year and contiue to order because its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product daily now for about 3 weeks and have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the product! I was paying $200+ for serums at the Dermatology office and didn&#x27;t get this fast of a noticeable result! I will definitely be recommending this product to my friends. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft, smooth and glowing after I use. I&#x27;m 45 years old and this is just as good as skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> Simply the best! All the right ingredients &amp; the price is unbeatable!!</li>
            <li> Wow...what can I say to convey my sheer delight , first in the fast delivery of this item, the amazing , early results noticed after using this product.....I mean ladies it really makes your skin look and feel luminous and  dewy-hydrated. I have only used in for two days morning and evening and still see the results. .&lt;br /&gt;....then receiving a wonderful follow up by customer support. This I not business as usual. These folks show genuine care about you and really want you to love your product , and go over and beyond to keep you happy for return business. I will definitely not only be returning to this nice skin product but also will  be referring my friends to it;&lt;br /&gt;Customer care is fabulous, and want the business...and deserve it too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell....skin still feels the same after 2 weeks of use.  Liquid doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; like an oil, mostly water.  Not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about as I&#x27;ve seen no changes to my skin and actually found my skin to be worse since using it than my last product.  The only reason why I tried it is that Costco quit carrying my past C skin product.  Now I&#x27;m off to find another C serum as this one would be a return if I could do that!  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Great stuff - really has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after using this.</li>
            <li> I just received this product as a promotion, and for my surprise it works very good. My face looks much fresh and younger. I&#x27; m very happy with it.  S</li>
            <li> Hi. Received this yesterday and saw the plastic seal around the top. Weirdly I was able to screw open the top without breaking the seal. So it could be anything in there? A bit anxious now??!! Is it supposed to be a gel-ish consistency?</li>
            <li> Very light, absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Worse to try.</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews I knew I had to try it! I did after the first week felt my skin smoother and  a lifting effect. After 21 days using it every morning I can now go out without make up, feeling my skin glowing !  I am addicted to it ! The company follow up is also a very nice touch. Very appreciative of my feedback also. I recommend trying this serum . It does work .</li>
            <li> Myso much smoother now. I love this serum and only paying for shipping is a great bonus. Thank you and I would reccommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I can see quite a difference in my skin since using serum 22  I love it</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised.  My face appears more youthful with the use of this serum.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using serumtologie C serum. When I first started using it, I could immediately tell my skin felt softer and more hydrated.  Over a few days, it looked and felt like my skin was glowing instead of the dull look it always has, especially during the cold Midwest winters here.  With continued use, twice a day, my skin did start to look better with a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and age spots. I especially love how this product uses vitamin C--I am a firm believer in the benefits Vitamin C provides to the body, including the skin!</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be using it once I&#x27;m finish with my other serum.</li>
            <li> I have just started my third bottle of this serum, and I love it. I am over 50, and have many hormonal skin changes,combination skin, and fine lines.  I have researched and tried many skin products, and this is by far, is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve quit using a more expensive and trusted brand for hormonal breakouts because since using this I don&#x27;t have them anymore. I don&#x27;t notice any shiney or oiliness throughout the day. My skin texture seems to have improved,dark spots lightened, and possibly a little firmer. My skin definitely seems smoother and softer. There&#x27;s no miracle like Botox and fillers, but as far as a serum goes, this has been the best. I think you&#x27;ve got to use a product regularly, and for at least a month or more to see real skin changes.  I hope to see continued improvement!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old guy just getting into this whole skin care thing. I am amazed after just 2 days how much softer my face and forehead feel. I don&#x27;t know how a product can start working so quickly, but it has. So far I am very happy with this. No skin irritation and I have really sensitive skin on my cheeks due to mild rosacea and this does not irritate my skin at all. As time progresses I will update my review.&lt;br /&gt;Update 06-20-2015: Over 3 weeks of using this twice a day and not only is my face softer, but the lines around my eyes have noticeably reduced.I am really happy so far. Not only am I noticing but others around me have commented about &amp;#34;the work&amp;#34; I have had done. So I am absolutely happy with my purchase and just bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Good serum. No bad reactions. Completely odorless. Dries matte. Havent seen much results yet in weeks of use but skins seems to look a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I hate it. It did nothing for me but it didn&#x27;t do anything bad either. I just don&#x27;t think it works. I&#x27;ve used other serums that had actually shown results in a few days of use. I have use this twice a day for over a month and there has been no change.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff!! It made my face smoother and took wrinkles away!</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff!! She has been using the serum religiously since it first came out, and was recommended to her by her dermatologist. It works so good for her I have actually started using it. This is a high quality product with only the best reviews everywhere. I would recommend this product to anyone, yes even men. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have ordered twice now and my wrinkles and fine lines are disappearing! It makes my face feel smooth!</li>
            <li> I am still in a trial period with both the C serum and the whipped facial moisturizer and I expect to see some results due to the number of positive reviews these products have received.  The products are priced very fairly and have a nice feel to them - the added Vitamin C was a big motivator for me.  I am rating these products a 5 primarily because of the company&#x27;s outstanding customer service.  They strive for customer satisfaction and take the necessary steps to ensure the individual concerns and/or needs are met.  It is refreshing to deal with a company that genuinely cares about their customers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum!  I will definitely be making this along with their whipped chiffon moisturizer, part of my regular regime.  I saw great results with the moisturizer, but when I added this, I saw an even bigger difference in my skin&#x27;s elasticity, firmness, and even saw some newly appearing fine lines disappear.  I also saw my pregnancy mask that I have to use a ton of concealer to hide, get much lighter.  The sun damage on my chest is also much lighter with these two products.  I feel like I&#x27;ve taken at least 5 years off of my skin!  I do regret that I didn&#x27;t see that you can put it around your eyes, so that will be something I&#x27;m starting.  I will  update my review after I&#x27;ve tried that.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review, and I highly recommend this along with Serumtologie&#x27;s Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used OleHenriksen Truth Serum Vitamin C Serum for the past 4 years and love the smell, the way it made my skin feel, and how I had a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t like the price tag. I set out to find a new product to try and landed in Serumtologie. I&#x27;ve never used anything with HA in it so this was new for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very impressed!! It goes on smoothly and absorbs immediately. I do miss the &amp;#34;orange-y&amp;#34; smell but that&#x27;s not the end of the world! I&#x27;m pairing it with the Whipped moisturizer as recommended and again, I love the way both products work together. My skin is so smooth and tight feeling afterwards. Can&#x27;t wait to see the 30/60/90 day after pictures to compare!</li>
            <li> My mom and I have both been using for a few days, great so far!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product so I chose not to review it until I had used the entire bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting miracles - have been in my skin too long for that to happen.  But was hoping to see just a little improvement; maybe in lessening of fine lines because of all the wonderful ingredients in this serum.  Used it twice a day before moisturizing.  It went on smoothly and absorbed quickly.  Very faint odor which was not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;But it made no visible difference in the appearance of my skin.  Wrinkles and fine lines did not diminish at all.&lt;br /&gt;Am glad that I tried it but am sorry that it did not produce any noticeable positive results.</li>
            <li> If I could, I would rate this 4.5. The delivery is interesting (an eye dropper), and the serum seems to do a good job of moisturizing. The smell of the serum is strange, although I don&#x27;t mind it -- it has a sort of a natural kind of smell. It does leave a sort of protective film on your skin that you can feel wash off later in the day. My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t really seem to have an impact on skin -- no real, noticeable reduction of discolored areas or lines. Other than that, it&#x27;s fine -- just don&#x27;t purchase it expecting any visible improvements in your skin,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! So much my mom aunt and sister and a few friends have all started using it also!!! Its taken the red blotchiness out of my skin my li es are becoming finer!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to be thouough and honest with my review as usual to help people make a decision and some of you may have never used serums. This serum is great! It is not oily or really moisturizing as like most serums, very lightweight. When you apply it, your skin drinks it up instantly so you may feel like you have not done anything at all. That is the point but your skin glows and looks firmer. There was a litterally 5 second tacky/sticky feeling but then after that, yout skin feels totallt bare like you have not put anything on your face at all but look in the mirror and woooow you see the difference unlike most serums/creams. I have $100 serums/creams that do not give those results. It does not sting or burn, you cannot even feel like you put anything on your face!!! So if you have dry skin, just add a night cream on top. I have normal to dry combo skin. I loooove that I do not have to use 2 moisturizers because I want something with vitamin C. I do not want to be a grease ball. It is perfect this way for all skin types and has never broken me out and in fact has helped my acne. It is a miracle product for me. I also love that it has Vitamin C, Hyluronic acid and vitamin E. I use this as a serum and my retinol moisturizer on top. I have a lot of skincare so I mix up my regimen as far as all but this serum is the best I have tried. I have one that is $20 higher but just absolutely does nothing like this. I left a long review, sorry if it was boring but I wanted to express my love for this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the C serum 22 a few weeks ago and have very positive results so far. It took only a few days for the effects of the serum to work and I have to admit no cream has had such brilliant results. I use it together with the Even Glow serum.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed and brightening.</li>
            <li> First off, I received this product as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback AND WOW. I&#x27;ve used this product for one night and woke up amazed. My fine lines seemed plumped up and way less noticeable. I know it sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;m so excited to see what future use of this product will produce! Seriously, don&#x27;t hesitate ordering. Serumtologie is hands down worth every penny. I would give it 10 stars if possible.</li>
            <li> I have so many facial producy ats and cosmetics that I could literally match the stock of 1.5 Sephora stores.  That being said, I have been using this for close to a month with not much to write about and was ready to add this to my &amp;#34;don&#x27;t buy again shelves&amp;#34;.  Last night I did a derma roller treatment (which I do about every other week - I know, not often enough) and again followed with my beauty routine including the Serumtologie C Serum.  This morning, for the first time ever, I awoke with an actual glow to my face.  To say the least I was pleasantly surprised.  I know it was the Serumtologie C Serum that attributed to this wonderful experience as I have been using the other products for months and months and the only change I made recently was the C Serum.  I am obsessed about my skin and as I mentioned earlier I have tried just about everything on the market to keep my face from showing my age.  I don&#x27;t have terrible skin to begin with because I am so obsessive but I have never experienced the true &#x27;glowing&#x27; results until this morning.  I know it takes at least 30 days for a product to work and it took just about that much time for this to really strut its stuff.  My husband, who is used to seeing me with all sorts of masks and products on my face, said &amp;#34;Looks like you finally found your answer.  Your look beautiful this morning.&amp;#34;.  I knew right away that I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product again.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is not to give up if it doesn&#x27;t work immediately, as some lucky people have experienced, but give it time to work with your skin.  I LOVE this product and will be ordering another bottle today as I am almost done my first bottle.  This serum is much thicker and richer than the many other vitamin c products I have used and it feels great on the skin.  I do not refrigerate it as I would never remember to get it out of the refrigerator when I am doing my face and would just reach for another product to take its place.  I just turned 60, which I was not overly thrilled about, but I have to say that my face sure doesn&#x27;t show my age.  You only get one chance to have beautiful skin and taking care of it just got a little easier for me with this product.  Hope this helps others who have been in search of a vitamin c product that &#x27;really works&#x27;.I was not overly thrilled about, but I have to say that my face sure doesn&#x27;t show my age.  You only get one chance to have beautiful skin and taking care of it just got a little easier for me with this product.  Hope this helps others who have been in search of a vitamin c product that &#x27;really works&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am about to purchase this item, I am so hopeful that I will see results : ) I can&#x27;t wait to give a review of the product after using it. I have spent hundreds of dollars on creams and serums and if this works as it people have said it does then I will be posting rave reviews in trying to help other people like me feel like they are purchasing a product that actually works and is cost effective. I am turning 50 in two weeks and getting married at the end of March. Hoping to not look like a 50 year old bride, lol. Stay tuned for my review. Currently giving it 5 stars as I anticipate it being and doing as stated. Will give honest star rating once I have used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> good quality!! exceeds my expectations!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! 39 year old male, never used any skin care products before, thought it was just girlie (sorry ladies!). I&#x27;ve felt unhealthy for some time now,I noticed my skin was looking bad around my eyes, forehead and cheeks from smoking, lack of water, not using sunscreen, bad diet etc etc. I decided to change my lifestyle completely, quit smoking (2 weeks now) no red meat, oily fish, plenty of water and green tea, 30+ natural sunscreen, plenty of vitamin K from greens, lots of whole grains, veggies and exercise 5 times a week...you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try a serum and choose this.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is holy s*** this stuff is awesome! I&#x27;m serious, my skin is like I&#x27;m 21 again. I have noticed a vast improvement and I have been using it for 1 week. I used to have blemishes, little red bumps under my eyes and lots of fine lines around my eyes and forehead. All the bumps are gone and the lines have reduced significantly. Granted I&#x27;ve made a lot of lifestyle changes but I&#x27;m confident in saying that Cserum has done what it says it does. My skin looks and feels great, especially after putting it on. I only use 7 drops and it goes a long way. I wish I had taken a picture before using it and again after just one week. GQ would be calling me up for a photo shoot haha...&lt;br /&gt;Whoever designed this product needs a standing ovation. I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> The delivery was agreed days I feel satisfied with the good product entrega..muy me is of great help for what I practice</li>
            <li> I did not see ant difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this. It makes my skin firmer and more hydrated when used in conjunction with a moisturizer on top of this product. I&#x27;ve compared it to several other types of serums with vitamin c and hyaluronic acid and none of the others have the same concentration so I decided to order this one again even though the other brands are cheaper. I think I may have noticed my fine lines fade a bit (I&#x27;m 29 so no hard wrinkles...yet) but I can&#x27;t be sure. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product but I think over time it will fight the formation of more defined wrinkles simply because it firms and hydrates the skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> I use a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was smooth without stickiness .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also well absorbed . Satisfactory .</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin yet but it has only been aliterate over a week!</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Makes my skin feel so soft. Minimizes pores as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> I received a special offer to try this product, but only after I had already ordered my first bottle of serum. So this will be my second bottle. I love this product. My face glows and looks so radiant. I&#x27;m not even wearing that much makeup these days. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve wasted so much money on products that didn&#x27;t agree with my skin or didn&#x27;t do a thing to improve my skin tone, texture, and look.  This serum delivers as promised!  They&#x27;re doing something right!!!  My girlfriend who lives in another city commented on my skin, when I told her what I was using, we high fives each other because she said omg, I&#x27;m using that stuff too.  It was pretty funny!  She said I&#x27;m going to write them and ask for a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Applied to my face and immediately noticed how soft and smooth it got.  Easy to apply and last all day. Last over a month.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend and I love it.  It is one of the more Inexpensive products that actually seems to work!</li>
            <li> It is working out great</li>
            <li> It is best product. very effective.</li>
            <li> Feels great and makes my skin feel smoother!</li>
            <li> I ordered the serumtologie C serum for 1) to make my face smoother, shine, reduce tinkles,2) from the excellent reviews from other customers. I recently had a facial (b day present to self, the spa tried to sell me their serum, I showed them the one I ordered from amazon, the spa said it had better ingredients than their serum. I will continue to use the serumtologie C, it is making my face glow also getting compliments on how smooth my face looks, and at age over 45 lol, will be very happy, grateful for compliments. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Deniseüòä</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about two months.  I can honestly say my skin seems brighter and wrinkles less noticeable. I use this in morning and retin a at night.  Work great together !</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast but just little bit disappointed the product box by it self is damage when I received it but the product is ok. now looking forward the result.</li>
            <li> In the weeks that I have been using this Vitamin C serum on my face And neck, I can tell a big difference. I like the way it makes my face feel right after I wash, dry and then apply this both morning and night. I am glad this product has been made available for amazon customers.</li>
            <li> If you use C serums, this is a great product.  High concentration of active ingredient at a very reasonable price.  I have used the skinceutical serum which is much more expensive and found no difference in effectiveness.  I have also tried other less expensive brands (like Azure Naturals) and been disappointed.This and the Rejuvelle serum were the 2 that were most effective for me...on par with Skinceuticals...at a lower price.</li>
            <li> It seems to even out the tone of my skin but, using it twice a day as instructed, this bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The serum is great. I use it now for almost 2 weeks. My skin is glowing! I have mature, sensitive skin and it is difficult to use products without a reaction. This one works great. Thank you. I  received the product ( second bottle) as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely improved after the first week! I&#x27;m half Filipina/half white, who still suffers from adult breakouts, but my main struggle is with hyper pigmentation. My brown spots have noticeably faded. Texture is smooth. Still using and we will see...&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is impeccable! Vanessa personally emails you to make sure everything is in tip top shape. Had an issue with a leaky bottle, she replaced it in a snap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  The price was great and so much less expensive than what I was using.  However, I cannot see anything that looks&lt;br /&gt;like an improvement in the lines?  Back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> How often do products actually meet, or in this case, exceed your expectations? C serum 22 from serumtologie promised to revitalize skin health and reduce wrinkles as a bonus! After working a lifetime outdoors, my skin was hammered by the elements. In researching a variety of products, I finally decided on C serum 22%. I was simply amazed by the product after only 3 weeks. This stuff works!! When my order was lost, the owners sent me a free bottle by rush mail. There will always be a bottle of this product in my cabinet. Thx serumtologie...</li>
            <li> best vitamen c available brightens smooths helps reduce fine lins and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Fianc√© tells me her skin feels much tighter? She is pleased with it</li>
            <li> Having finished my bottle of Vitamin C serum from another company, I was going to order the same one yet again, when this product caught my eye on Amazon. With some very good ingredients, no alcohol or perfume, this serum dries fast and results are seen very quickly. I do not find that it dries my skin and it does not take much to cover the face and neck. Follow this with a sunscreen and you are well protected for the day. This company is new and the customer service is excellent. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great ingredients. The best C serum I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with the first bottle. I am in my early 50 and I am little skeptical about miracles. So it&#x27;s not a miracle but so far works well  for me. I am using it with the combination of other products, as it makes my skin feel dry, but I have an impression that it makes my wrinkles less visible. To make sure it&#x27;s not my vision getting progressively worse or it&#x27;s a power of the positive thinking I will give it another try and order a new bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now and really like what it&#x27;s doing for my skin. It feels more even - skin tone and texture wise. Also I feel great that it&#x27;s got a great ewg rating so I&#x27;m not harming my skin by regular use. I&#x27;ve started to see the benefits of more hydrated and even skin tone and hope that with continued use it will get even better. I need to couple it with a good physical barrier sunscreen (which I haven&#x27;t done well recently) to get the maximum benefit so will post another update once I&#x27;ve tried that out. I have bought another bottle recently as well. I was offered a promotional discounted 3rd bottle in return for my candid feedback - however note that I would have bought it anyway. I must mention that Customer service has been fantastic - they go out of their way to answer your questions at lightning speed. That is some dedication and I really appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 days and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to give an accurate review on any wrinkle diminish, but I do know that I love the way this feels on my skin. I also think it has helped clear up my chin acne. Almost anything I put on my chin breaks me out. Not this product. It actually helps. Love this stuff and will continue using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review after I use this product for at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Been using product.  It is great</li>
            <li> Lovely product that absorbs quickly delivering noticeable results in days. I use it morning and night. It has lightened sun spots and freckles, evened skin tone overall. Softer skin without the grease as I have an oily t zone. Pore size reduced. Just ordered my 2nd bottle looking forward to continued improvement. At 50 yrs old, forehead creases and fine eye lines have also shown improvement. The company emails direct suggestions of use as well as response to review. They asked me to offer my review directly here and gave me a discount code for participating. I have tried 3 other Vit C serums and this is by far the best</li>
            <li> The serum works beautifully, dries quickly, and leaves the skin smooth.  It seems to affect my skin quite well.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product not only for the positive impact it has on my skin, but for the fair market price. I have tried other C serum products and the Serumtologie C serum 22 is more effective, evidenced by improved skin quality. Shrunken pores, diminished fine lines and firmer elasticity has made me grateful for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Serumtologie C Serum for about one month and I love the product so far. I&#x27;m 31 and don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet...my goal is to prevent them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has made my skin so soft and smooth since the first application. I use it every morning and every night and I noticed results the first day! The serum has softened the small wrinkles around my eyes and forehead. The over-all appearance of my skin is brighter and fresher looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to everyone. I&#x27;ve already told the girls at work about it!</li>
            <li> I am now on my second bottle of this AMAZING serum and HIGHLY recommend it to all!!! I have used Obagi Vitamin C serum, La Mer serums and others and upon switching to this product, I can honestly say this is FAR superior to ANY serum on the market!!! You will be thrilled how this product makes your skin feel...and the price is beyond fair for what it does for your skin!!!</li>
            <li> So far I like this product,  have only used it for two weeks. Easy to use, however I do use it in addition to an added 5 percent hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I have used C serum for about 2 months and have been very pleased with the results.  In the past couple of weeks, I have noticed a definite visible reduction of pores - which was unexpected, but great! My overall skin tone is more even and skin is softer to the touch.  I will definitely continue using this product in addition to moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the results of this serum!  After using this product for a short time, my skin felt softer and firmer.  I was also very pleased with their kind customer service.</li>
            <li> Nice product! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Used for a little over a month some times twice a day, but at least once a day every day. No results</li>
            <li> Love this product! My skin is normally oily but with this product it now glows rather than &amp;#34;oul&amp;#34; shines...</li>
            <li> Slight burn when used on skin (warning to sensitive skin users like myself.) However, this serumtologie product reduced the amount of blotchy-ness as a little goes a long way with this serum. Light herbal scent, coverage is about as expected, and leaves skin looking brighter.</li>
            <li> This serum is unbelievable! I had a couple of mole like growths under my left eye that raised up and with my nail they scratched right off. I know unbelievable, right? My face looks amazing. My younger sister is now using this product &amp; she loves it. Your skin will love it!</li>
            <li> One of the best serums on the market ingredient and price wise.. Very very impressed.. I have worked for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; skincare company for the last two years and began to learn a lot about ingredients, and how they are listed. They correspond by listing the most active ingredients first.. Within the first three of you see Denatured Alcohol, DO NOT BUY.. It damages the skin.. Serumtologie has one of the best ingredient listings, and the product DELIVERS.. Good for any skin type, and I was absolutely floored by the comments I started getting within the first two weeks of use. Of course I noticed, but for co-workers and clientele to notice, that was big.. I no longer work for the company, but I must say, their highest selling serum was FULL of empty ingredients, pure garbage, for twice the price of this superior product.. I applause this company for providing such high quality ingredients at such and INCREDIBLY affordable price.. Thank you Serumtologie, sincerely!</li>
            <li> Most of these products degrade quickly because vitamin C is so volatile. You can make this yourself at home, fresh, every week, with 2-3 ingredients. http://healthbeautyandskincareproducts.com/how-to-make-a-homemade-vitamin-c-serum</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> I found it to work really well, i had a lot of wrinkles and as of right now i believe half of them have gone. I will be reordering hoping that by keeping it going it will help get rid or tighten more.</li>
            <li> I have been using C serum for three weeks, I use in the morning and night.  I am very happy with the results!!  My skin feels softer and healthier and the color is more even.  I don&#x27;t need to use any foundation products or BB cream any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lin-Mei Kravis</li>
            <li> Have been using this for months now and am very pleased.  I had deep lines around my mouth and was concerned that I&#x27;d never get rid of them.  Once I started using this product the lines have lightened up considerably and instead of making me look old, my skin is much firmer and the lines have disappeared (except for one deep, deep set line, but the other 3 have disappeared) and makes me look younger.  I am delighted and will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon when looking for a formula that contained the ingredients recommended by Dr. Oz: vitamin c and hyaluronic acid. I have tow other similar products and this one is my favorite. Partly because of the packaging, in that the dropper style versus is the pump is much more user-friendly, in my opinion. Also, the serum itself had the most smoothing and moisturizing results. Lastly, the company provided terrific customer service.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking to improve the texture and tone of their skin!</li>
            <li> I got this serum a few weeks go..I really like it.it makes my skin feel soft and look better healthier. I did receive this item for my review.I will post more when I have used the serum more. Stay tuned!!</li>
            <li> Totally in love of this products. Would highly recommend and buy again</li>
            <li> This is my first time using serumtologie C serum and I love it. It has made a huge difference to my skin tone it&#x27;s much softer and a definite glow that I had not got from my other &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; skin product lines. It makes my skin look fresh. I am very happy with all the Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> I honesty can&#x27;t tell if this is working to an exact degree because I&#x27;ve hanged my whole routine at once but that alone hac marked improvements (from a former sleeping in my makeup kind of girl) üòÅ</li>
            <li> Like the scent. Easy to use. seems to work right  away.</li>
            <li> For a Vitamin C serum this one is nice and thick and feels like it penetrates deeper than the more watery 20% serum I&#x27;ve been using in the past. Because of this it takes more to cover one&#x27;s face and neck, but that&#x27;s okay if it&#x27;s doing a good collagen building job.</li>
            <li> I really thought the reviews were too good to be true, but now I know they are valid. I have been using C22 for several months now and my skin has never looked better. It reduces your pore size, softens wrinkles and seems to prevent new ones, and makes your skin firm and glowing. I am a self-confessed skin care junkie, must have tried it all, and this delightful product will definitely stay in my arsenal...forever!</li>
            <li> I recently tried C serum 22, having previously used a more expensive, well-known antioxidant serum.  This is an outstanding product surpassing other high end brands not only for the high percentage of key ingredients but also for the excellent value.  I am equally impressed with the company&#x27;s great customer service - responsive, helpful, knowledgable - both for their own products and for skin care in general.  They really seem to care how their products are working out for you.</li>
            <li> noticeable difference in just 1 month of use</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this serum! I will be purchasing more in the near future!</li>
            <li> strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have purchased this same item in past and no issues. LOVE the results it provides. However this purchase has a different and funny smell...almost like its old. The top was able to be unscrewed without taking off the wrapper that is supposed to secure the top. I&#x27;m not too sure it is not old. Plan to contact seller.</li>
            <li> Just ok, didn&#x27;t see a difference so won&#x27;t buy it again :(</li>
            <li> I am in the sun a lot and used this for several days at night and in the morning after purchasing it and saw instant results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no change after 4 weeks.  Maybe it takes longer, but I would think there&#x27;d be something. I&#x27;m frankly suspicious of some of these glowing reviews.  One reviewer said this product &amp;#34;hydrated her face&amp;#34; -- well it doesn&#x27;t do that at all. When it dries, you face feels dry, so you need to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C serum 22 , for about 3 months and I love it ...My skin texture has changed drastically , it looks more smooth and healthy, I am delighted  and planing to continue using it .thank you very much . SCH</li>
            <li> My sister and I started using the product (5 days now) and it is fantastic,we already see the difference on our faces.My pigmentation is fading and the skin feels very soft.&lt;br /&gt;We will definitely order the serum again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this! The price is right, and the customer service is amazing. I have moderately sensitive combination skin and every time I use it on my face I breakout. I even get pimples in places that I don&#x27;t normally get them-neck and chest (I tried using it here once I realized my face didn&#x27;t tolerate it).  I&#x27;ve tried stopping and starting it again over the last few months but I just don&#x27;t think this serum is for me.</li>
            <li> I apply this every morning and it has made my skin feel great!  After rubbing in a dime size amount, I let it soak in while I brush my teeth (it will feel sticky at first) and then I  apply mineral powder before heading out the door.  If I am going to use sunscreen or concealer, I mix it with a squirt of this serum and it goes in great.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great product for my face.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My skin is softer &amp; fine lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum now for a few weeks and I notice a difference in my skin.  Smoother and tighter and my pores appear to be smaller.  I am definitely going to continue using this product and I recommend it to anyone who has been looking for the right serum.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about 5 days and some days only once, but I definitely could see and feel a difference in my skin. Much softer and smaller pores.  i have not noticed any difference in fine line wrinkles yet.  I also used on my neck/chest.</li>
            <li> I am the worst at nightly routines except brushing my teeth‚Ä¶but I was excited to start using serumtologie serum so i couldn&#x27;t wait to try it before heading off to bed. Honestly, I loved it right away‚Ä¶such a nice product. So far I am impressed. I have a few wrinkles and kinks in my skin so I do not expect a miracle but so after only a few uses I see a very positive effect. First time I feel like I bought a product that is living up to the hype.</li>
            <li> This product is a great intensive moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on my skin.  Pleasant smell and easy to use application too</li>
            <li> I see the difference in my skin! This serum delivers!</li>
            <li> This product really delivers!! It is a light weight serum that is applied after cleaning and toner.It dries quickly once applied then your face is ready for sunscreen! The overall appearance of my skin has greatly improved. Fine lines have soften and skin just looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I have only used several times. I haven&#x27;t used enough to evaluated yet. Will update my comments later on.</li>
            <li> So I received this product as a promotion for an honest review. This product goes on easily and does not make skin oily of irritated. I like the way it makes my skin dewy and bright. The only downside is I am not a huge fan of the scent, which to me is kind of banana. UPDATE: I let my friend try this and she loves it, so I guess it is just a personal preference on if you like the scent or not :-)</li>
            <li> Took me a while to write this review because I wanted to see how this actually worked. I love it! First, I was concerned with the small bottle with the eyedropper, but it is evident that this goes a long way. I do believe that I see a difference since using this. Time will tell but I will be ordering more of this!</li>
            <li> Not working at all...</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  It&#x27;s not been used long enough yet to determine its effectiveness. I do love the way it goes on and feels.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this product by serumtologie at a much better price than the previous product I used.  I put it on every morning and evening before putting lotion on my face.  It keeps my skin smooth and glowing with regular use.  I purchased the first bottle to try and was thrilled when I found out I could get another at a reduced rate as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback. Thank you for providing great customer service.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!  Will definitely buy again.  Can feel my face tighten from very first application.Using it in combination with a derma-roller is even more effective. WoW!. Bonus.... Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Goes on great and is lightweight. I can already see a difference in my skin - it&#x27;s brighter and smoother! Can&#x27;t wait to see more results the longer I use it.</li>
            <li> I received the product as the result of a promotional offer and willingness to give a very candid review.  It&#x27;s fabulous !!!!  I am in my early 70&#x27;s and have used an incredible array of products over the years, including some very &#x27;well known&#x27; ones.  I use this both evening and morning and it has been a powerful product in reducing wrinkles, leaving my skin very soft, and most of all, helping me to look ALIVE !!!.  Yes, I love it and I will order again</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C serum 22 and the Pure Whipped Chiffon moisturizer for two weeks now.  I am amazed at the results that I am seeing.  For the first time in many years I am actually seeing an improvement in my dark circles and overall skin tone.  It has not been dramatic, but an overall softening effect.  I am 63 years old and truly believed my skin was beyond improvement.  I am anxious to see what happens with long term use of the Vitamin C serum and Whipped Chiffon.  Becky W  I have now been using Vitamin C Serum 22 and Pure Whipped Chiffon for 5 mos. and I love it.  My skin has never looked better.  The  clarity and feel is wonderful.  My skin seems to glow.  I am thrilled that I found these wonderful products at my age.  Becky W</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using my new serum 22 for a little over a month and already I see improvements in my skin.  I usually keep abreast of the&lt;br /&gt;new products that help skin as I am 68 and I&#x27;m trying not to look it.  This product with the combination of Hyaluronic moisturizer and Vitamin&lt;br /&gt;C is definitely showing promise.  I see improvements in the texture and also the evening out of discolorations.  It&#x27;s a keeper and I will now&lt;br /&gt;buy a bottle for my daughter who is 37 so she can start early to prevent lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few weeks ago &amp; wanted to try it for about a month before leaving my review. Well, it didn&#x27;t even take a month to notice the effects of this serum. It is great! I generally don&#x27;t believe in serums or lotions for help with wrinkles. However, I have a few wrinkles when I smile and notice the difference after using the serum - love it!!! Also, my skin feels and looks smoother. What more can I ask for??</li>
            <li> Best face product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It lightens and tightens the skin, just like it says it will.  Really wonderful for the skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, very satisfied. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> As serums go, this one delivers a powerful punch!  Looking forward to continued use and results.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this serum!! I feel like it&#x27;s made my skin appear so much more youthful even after a week of daily use. My skin feels fresher and tighter and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I had been needing something for my skin, which tends to be very dry.  I am pleased with the results and am on my second bottle!  A big plus is that we have been using it on dark spots on my husband&#x27;s hands and see noticeable improvement!</li>
            <li> Good product an well worth the money. Skin tighter and smoother, as well as soft.</li>
            <li> Saw little results after 4 weeks.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Serumtologic C serum  is fantastic  my friend  bought me a bottle, after using it for one week . My face glows  . I look fantastic !  I order  a bottle because  I do not want  this product to sold out . I usually  do not  review  Any product , but this one is exceptional . I will recommend  this product .</li>
            <li> After just a couple of nightly applications of serumtologie C serum ¬∫22 I noticed an initial brightening of my skin along with a healthy pinkish tone.  What I notice now is a new smoothness (no dead skin) and a slight softening of the lines under my eyes.  I may start to use it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I like a dropper application rather than a lotion.  It&#x27;s neater and, if you&#x27;re careful, you don&#x27;t contaminate the unused product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave only four stars because I have only used it 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the 22% Vitamin Serum and Moisturizer  - my skin felt refreshed and hydrated immediately, and within days I saw a visible difference as fine lines began smoothing out and my skin tone brightened. The serum feels silky on my skin and absorbs quickly, a perfect base for makeup - but my skin is looking so much prettier now, who needs makeup?  I give 22% Vitamin C Serum my highest recommendation and have urged my sister and best friends to try it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> Holy smokes! I did not expect this product to work so well or so quickly.  I am 21 days into using this product, and there has already been significant physical changes to my skin!  The hyperpigmentation on my face has faded considerably (though not gone) and there is a youthful radiance to my skin that I thought I would never see again.  The 2 acne scar marks on my face have disappeared, and there is a noticeable firmness to my cheeks. At a recent family gathering, my 4 aunts would not stop staring at me.  Finally, one of them broke the silence and asked what I was doing differently.  I said the only change was adding the Vitamin C Serum 22 to my regimen.  I have used many Vitamin C serums but this one is my favorite thus far.  I&#x27;ve heard of some people having bad reactions to topical vitamin c serum, but if you&#x27;re not one of these few, I would highly recommend you try this one.</li>
            <li> I love it, work very good. my skin is soften.</li>
            <li> I do believe my skin has benefited from the use of this product twice a day. The texture of my skin has softened and some lines are less noticeable. It also feels fine and does not cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Love the product, can tell the difference in my skin after few weeks of use</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle serumtologie C serum 22. I never write a review and I have used hundreds of skin care products. But this one really does do what it says. Please try, you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> Love this! Improves ski in short time period</li>
            <li> Completely in love with this product.  It is one of the best $30 spent this year.  I purchased this just to try a new vitamin C serum before repurchasing a different brand.  I had been getting dark spots from recurring acne, since getting off birth control a year ago.  I knew the vitamin C would help reduce the spots, and another popular more expensive had given me very good results.  But I try different products periodically in case there is something better.  And by far, this one is!  Within a week the dark spots had lighted twice as much as with my previous brand (Paula&#x27;s Choice) as a result of using this.  In fact, there were old spots that I had been working to lighten over the past year that simply disappeared with this product.  In addition, I noticed that my normally dry skin that was getting drier due to the cold weather, felt soft and supple.  In fact, my laugh lines and dimples were relaxing.  Totally unexpected.  The hydrating qualities are more noticeable when the weather is warmer or more humid.  And also better when the serum is used both day and night - twice a day without skipping days nor applications.  I find I get better results that way.  I also use a Clarisonic brush once a day.  For the cost, it&#x27;s a steal.  I&#x27;ve used a couple of higher end, more expensive brands - both of which work well; however, this product produces better results, in a fraction of the time, for a fraction of the cost.  As long as this product is available and the formula remains the same (or better), I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about 3 weeks, but so far I like it.  Time will tell if there are any long term results, but it does seem to make my skin feel softer and possibly I am seeing less brown spots or at least a blending of skin color to make them seem less noticeable.  I would recommend you try it!</li>
            <li> I kept on breaking out and since I have been using this product my breakouts have significantly decreased.  Also, my dark spots have decreased quite a bit.  It is nice to see my skin finally showing an even tone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now.  I don&#x27;t see any difference.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase again.  2 stars says &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34;, 3 says &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Okay&amp;#34;.  I wish they had a star for &amp;#34;Can&#x27;t give my opinion since I don&#x27;t know&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2-3 months now.  I don&#x27;t see a big difference in my face, but that was pretty good to begin with  I&#x27;ve also been using it on the backs of my hands and they do look improved - better texture.  It&#x27;s goes on very smoothly and absorbs well; my facial skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve not had any problems with any kind of irritation at all. I did start out using it every other day, just to do be sure. One drop goes a long way.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Noticed results within a few weeks. Will definitely recommend it for anti aging, premature wrinkles, sun spots and found more even skin complexion.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Its much cheaper that than the big name company.  I&#x27;ve found the cheaper products don&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve found that I no longer can live without it and get a lot of compliments on my youthful complexion which is great because I am not young anymore and my skin has been troublesome my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do need to add I will be receiving an additional bottle of the product as part of a promotion in return for my feedback.  I would never write a review good or bad if I wasn&#x27;t honestly satisfied or dissatisfied with a product.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of my skin after using the C serum. It is a great deal for the cost and it only takes a few drops, so one bottle goes a long way! The seller is also the best I have ever done business with. They are sending me a promotional bottle of the serum just for writing this product review.</li>
            <li> I actually gave this as a gift. But I have heard that the person I gave it to likes it a lot!</li>
            <li> Amazing product ! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the long term results but my skin does feel much smoother &amp; best of all, the BEST primer ever! Once I apply serum I continue with my spf moisturizer &amp; makeup. My makeup stays flawless &amp; intact all day &amp; with no creases! Will definitely continue to use &amp; purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m nearing 70 and have used this product for about 6 months.  I love it!  It is easily absorbed and I believe my skin looks much&lt;br /&gt;younger than I am.  I&#x27;ve always taken good care of my skin, but used to use a much more expensive serum.  Now I still have great&lt;br /&gt;results and much more money!!  People are very responsive and I recommend their products.  SCM</li>
            <li> This review is for the customer service on this product! I purchased it because I am knowledgeable about the ingredients and it seems like a great value for high potency Vit. C with clean, non-toxic carrier ingredients. It arrived quickly but I noticed that the fill line was a bit low for what I expected in a 1 oz. container. I emailed the company, questioning whether that was customary. They immediately informed me that it was not -- that it must have gotten by their quality control, they refunded my purchase price, and were also shipping me out a new bottle! That is a company that cares about keeping their customers happy and are willing to invest a bit of money to do so, which suggests to me that they carry that same philosophy into producing the product and are not attempting to cut corners to make a bit more profit. I will write another review once I have used the serum for a while, but as far as customer service goes -- they can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I have used the C serum 22 for two weeks now and definitely like the product.  It goes on my face smoothly and I do see a change in the lines and wrinkles.  I&#x27;m 72 and still worry about lines and wrinkles.  Will order more whenever I run low.  It is a keeper.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I just started using this 2 days ago &amp; my skin is already improving! I really Love this new product!!!!</li>
            <li> Love! Love this porduct. My skin transformed in less thatn a week with consistent use. My dark circles are gone. This is worth every penny.  It is exceptionally great during the winter when the air is dryer.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing product, 1 drop and my skin is smoother and ready for my sunblock and primer to hit the day.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it once a day and it had work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Soon buying my second and some for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;Dont forget to close it real good. It goes bad if left open. (happened to a friend)</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion in return for candid feedback. First of all, the customer service is outstanding: quick delivery as well as follow-up emails with information on to how to get the most out of the product. I researched many C products and finally ordered serumtologie C serum 22 because it does not appear to have chemical preservatives. After my first bottle was finished, with results of softening and brightening of my skin, I decided to go with a cheaper alternative (it sounded good), but was disappointed: that product was too harsh. Serumtologie C serum 22 delivers results, so I am sticking with it! It is light, has no odor, and is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I bought it trying to help my skin to look it&#x27;s best before my wedding. In my opinion, it helped tremendously. I am 30 years old with mild adult acne, and I attribute this serum, along with Cerave cleanser and a good retinal lotion, with the fact that the last thing I was worried about on my wedding day, was my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I usually break out from stress. My wedding was probably the most stressed I have ever been, and no break outs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend! There are a lot of similar products I have sampled through birchbox, etc...this is by far my favorite and a great cheaper alternative!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive products over the years and they don&#x27;t even come close to this.  My skin is noticeably smoother and brighter.  I saw an immediate improvement to my complexion with the first use. Update Sept. 2015: I&#x27;m on my second bottle of C22 and I love it!  I&#x27;ve also completely stopped using a very expensive product with hydroquinone along with tretinoin.  Those harsh chemicals made my skin crepey, rough and thin. C22 helped restore my skin to a much healthier state.</li>
            <li> Feels so good after using it. I like how it makes my face moisturized.</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum, brightens skin, tightens and a great addition to  my skin regimen.  I use it under my moisturizer in the morning and under my night cream at night.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products in my 50+ years, some showed positive results and many did not.:-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few articles on Hyaluronic Acid and it peeked my interest so, with my love of Amazon.com I decided to check out the skin care products available on their site and found serumtologie C22. Based on the ingredients and  positive reviews I decided to purchase this product. I haven&#x27;t seen all of the changes in my skin that I am hoping for but, I am very optimistic! I will continue using this product with hopes of seeing the many positive results that this product says that it can do for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company reviews and customer service are very positive.I will recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better. Seriously, this stuff is a gem. It takes about two weeks or so and then you see your skin has transformed into a beautiful site. At 52 I say that because my skin looks close to flawless in regards to smoothness and clarity. Still the forbead wrinkles, but less pronounced. I hope you might give this a try. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! On the advice of my dermatologist, I started using a Vit C serum in the morning. I was using another brand and when I was buying a refill I opted to purchase this serum because of the lower price and great reviews (and they do not test on animals!)! I love this serum! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 45 days now I can see a noticeable difference in my complexion. Some faint discoloration I had on my chin has disappeared. Not only that, my skin feels softer. I recently got in touch with the maker via email  and I was shocked to get a personal response back within a few hours! I was duly impressed. I look forward to trying their other products.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of the serum when it is applied.  Nourishing not greasy.  Like a nice refreshing drink for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very oily skin and have large pores and lots of deep little blackheads.  It seems like they are trying to repair -  though that might not make sense.  The blackheads are surfacing and eliminating. So I have had a few breakouts, but mostly just noticing smoother, tighter, more supple skin.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am pleased.  More so than other porducts I have tried (and there have been plenty- the drawers are full of half used lotions and serums).&lt;br /&gt;It has acutally makes me want to take better care because I am seeing better results.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the product and also for checking with me.  Very nice customer service.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I can honestly say it has made all the difference. My pores are smaller, skin tone is more even, my skin is more supple and youthful looking. I use this under the serumtologie whipped moisturizer before I go to bed and wake up looking well-rested and youthful.</li>
            <li> This product is working very well for me. I don&#x27;t have major problems with my skin, except recently breaking out as a result of side effects from a medication. I do have a couple noticeable dry spots..and ironically oily spots as well, typically around my nose. Serumtologie C seems to be addressing them all and  smoothing things out, which I tend to notice in the mornings when I first wake up. The first thing that hits me in the mornings is that my pores are definitely smaller, hence giving me a smooth finish. Everything is even, no dry spots and no oily spots, just perfectly even, for which I&#x27;m very pleased. This product isn&#x27;t oily by any means so if you need any form of oil, you&#x27;ll have to add it, which I do to my eyebrows with an organic essential oil. Continuous use appears to be key so I&#x27;ll continue my regimen, morning and evening. The company contacted me twice after I purchased Serumtologie C, to check on my usage and progress and to get some feedback. It took me a while to get back to them but when I did and told them exactly what I&#x27;m telling you here, they offered me a discount on my next purchase, which I have not yet accepted yet but will later, as I would like to continue using this at less cost if possible.</li>
            <li> I am starting to see a difference with my face.</li>
            <li> This feels terrific.  Nothing stops the hands of time but this certainly slows it down.  A bit.  Which is fine.</li>
            <li> I really like the outcome this product produced. It&#x27;s not so much an isolated area, as it is an overall effect that&#x27;s taken place, Which works for me, someone told me, your skin looks so nice and smooth, what  do you do. That&#x27;s when I really took notice of this product. I will be buying another bottle?</li>
            <li> The skin stays moist.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Noticed a big difference in my skin tone and texture after just one week.</li>
            <li> For me, this was too drying. Probably ok for other skin types. The company was very nice</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  About a week after using it, people started telling me how bright and smooth my skin looked. I will definitely be buying more! Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Have used over 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any change. I was hoping this was finally something that was going to work. I believe if something is as good as they say you should see results right away.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and have only used it 3 times but the difference in my skin is remarkable.  The first thing I noticed was how my pores seemed to diminish.  I also see a slight reduction in the redness of my skin.  I am very pleased with this product so far and I will write another review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Love serumtologie vitamin C I am so glad I read the reviews!  I have seen aHuge difference in my skin in the short time I have been using!  The biggest compliment I have received was from my husband the other day we were talking about day to day issues and I did  not have one stitch of makeup on and he was staring at me very intensely which made me very self conscious I asked wat was wrong and he said I still looked beautiful and also 40 yrs old not bad considering I&#x27; m 55 yrs young and married 33 yrs. That said it A LL I do not want to be without this wonderful serumüôÜ Also, I cannot say enough about the CS  and follow up from the company which I Love! you don&#x27;t receive that treatment in big department stores!!!</li>
            <li> A good friend of mine turned me on to this product. I have very sensitive, dry skin and sun damage.  After 1 week of using this product my skin feels so soft and I really think my crows feet are fading. I definitely will recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally sure how it works yet, but I seem to think that the lines around my eyes and mouth are not as distinct. Time will tell, and that&#x27;s why I ordered two more.</li>
            <li> I love serumtologie C serum 22. The results were improved texture , softer skin, and a brighter complexion. I am getting the highest quality product and it deliveries results. I am very impressed with this wonderful product and the tips that I received for even  better results. The customer service was very helpful and returned my emails. The quality of the packaging was perfect clean lines, dark bottle for protection and a detail ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt; I have used some other products but I will always be a fan of serumtologie 22.This  is my#1  new skin care  product twice a day forever .Better product with 2% more vitamin C than Obagi and less money. This product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve tried several serums, and have seen some major results with the Serumtologie.  My face feels plumper, pores tighter and some aging spots are fading.  And, I was especially impressed by the powerful, organic ingredients in this serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Vitamin C ‚Äì highest professional grade&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Hyaluronic Acid ‚Äì elasticity, hydration &amp; firmness of skin, collagen building&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Vitamin E ‚Äì protects skins from free radical damage&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Ferulic Acid - an anti-oxidant extender&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs important to close the dropper bottle as soon as possible or the edge of the bottle gets a buildup of white coating.  It is water soluble and can be cleaned of easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In return for my candid assessment expressed in this review, I did receive the product at discounted price.</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out. I have not noticed much improvement in my skin at this point. I will continue to use this product for awhile longer.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and get a lot of sun exposure, so a Vitamin C serum was recommended by my dermatologist.  This is the third brand I have tried, and it is the best. This product really helps eliminate dark spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it works or not.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum, along with their whipped chiffon moisturizer for a little over three months and I am very happy with it. Entering my 50&#x27;s and noticing some lines in my face that I&#x27;m not happy with, I decided it was time to look for a serum that might help to keep my skin more healthy as I age. This one has a great combination of some of the ingredients that are proving effective in keeping skin healthy as we age. I say the phrase &amp;#34;keeping skin healthy&amp;#34; rather than something like &amp;#34;erasing fine lines&amp;#34;, because I believe that can only be done by surgery. This product, however has made my skin feel softer and look more even toned, overall. I noticed the softness within the first few weeks.  I also have pretty sensitive skin, and I have not had any bad reactions to this serum even using it around the eye area. Many skin care regimens require a special formula for around the eyes and I like that this is an all in one product, in that way. Above all I believe this company truly wants to put out a good product for a decent price. My experience with customer service has been superior, being contacted for feedback by the founder of the company within the first month of using the product. There are similar products like this on the market, some cheaper and some more expensive, but this one has the highest concentration of good ingredients in effective forms for the price. I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling incredibly silky, especially when I use it following the Philosophy Miracle Worker. Even my husband noticed how much softer and smoother my skin felt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen change so far in terms of skin brightness, tightness, pore size, fine lines, etc, but I have been using it only for 1 week and I am very optimistic based on the other user reviews and the clinically-proven ingredients! I will update if I see changes in skintone in the coming weeks.</li>
            <li> This has replaced my nighttime moisturizer. Works great without leaving any greasy residue. My skin feels refreshed in the morning. Don&#x27;t know if this is good or not, but I haven&#x27;t been washing my face in the morning since I&#x27;ve started using this because when I wake up, my skin is nice and soft and glowy, but not greasy like it used to be. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a Vitamin C serum for my face but was not sure which product to buy. I am so happy with this product I can already see a difference in my face. My skin feels smoother and the serum seems to have helped with the fine lines and wrinkles. I am applying twice a day before I use my regular moisturizer. The serum is a good buy for the price and will also save me a trip to an expensive salon. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of age, who wants to see an overall improvement in the radiance and tone of her or his skin.  I have long been acquainted with the benefits of C serum on skin - the Serumtologie C serum has been formulated to include a number of widely recognized ingredients beneficial to improved skin condition.  The positive results can be seen in a short period of time - prolonged use yields even better results.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this yet, you should do so very soon!</li>
            <li> Superb quality.  Have been using for 2 weeks now.  I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles yet and am trying to keep it that way!</li>
            <li> I like it alot.  The bottle is a bit small for the price. I feel like its working.</li>
            <li> I just love SERUMTOLOGIE C SERUM . I also gave one to my daughter and she love it to.Works great on the fine lines by my eyes.</li>
            <li> Food for my face. Love how it feels and feel that my skin looks much younger. OYEAHHHH</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has improved the appearance of my skin! It has softened fine lines and even gotten rid of blemishes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this skincare product a five star review because as a cosmetologist, the ingredients surpass even the most expensive products that are similar to this one,  and the price is fabulous! I&#x27;ve only used it for two days in a row but so far so good! So, I wanted to go ahead and edit my review since its been a few days now that I&#x27;ve been using this product: This product is WONDERFUL!! You can literally feel and see the difference with the moisture your skin retains from this product!! Less visibility of lines and wrinkles!! I only use it once a day and it still works GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I have now purchased FOUR bottles of this.  It is really helping me with skin tone, especially with fading some scars.  It does make my face break out, so I don&#x27;t like that, but it makes my skin really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to get the package and try this new products.....the best customer service they respond immediately if you have any questions they are the best</li>
            <li> This made a dramatic difference with my skin. Took care of the dry spots and evened out my skin tone</li>
            <li> Did not see any improvement after using the whole bottle but I didn&#x27;t break out either. Just a shame that it&#x27;s ingredients lists is packed with real power booster good for skin and quite safe as testament that I didn&#x27;t break out which I usually do since I&#x27;m quite sensitive.  I ordered this back in September of 2014. I actually din&#x27;t took their 100% money back guarantee but a few weeks ago, I got an email from Vanessa M. Powers, co-founder and was really nice to inform me that she and the company was sorry the product didn&#x27;t work for me and wanted me to send her my order ID# via the seller and will refund my purchase.  I emailed the seller with my details and was pleasantly surprise how quick they responded and not only that, they added an extra$20 which they call a goodwill refund.  This company is really good,  I would try their other product since they demonstrated that they really believe in their product and back it up with real guarantees. That tells a lot to me as a consumer.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the transcript of their email:</li>
            <li> This product is useless.  Does not show any improvement in the skin.  Don&#x27;t waist your money on another product that does not work.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the whipped chiffon cream, I really love the combination. My skin feels so light and hydrated. Is not too heavy, it&#x27;s been easier for me to apply make up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;ve only been using it twice a day for a couple of weeks and the lines around my eyes and mouth have already improved.  I am surprised because it seems to have helped in such a sort time.  The biggest improvement is that the size of my pores are shrinking and my skin is much brighter and has a nice glow.  In just two weeks, I&#x27;m finding that I do not need to use as much foundation as I have been.  This product really works!!!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far I like the softness of my skin after using C serum. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Serumtologie serum 22 twice and I continue to use it twice daily as indicated in the instructions.  I started using it following a micro needling skin procedure which had already improved the fine lines and dark spots on my skin.  So, it is difficult for me to determine how much additional difference the serum is making following the procedure at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read that hyaluronic products are good to use for aging skin.  I have incorporated the serum in to my daily regimen and hope that with regular&lt;br /&gt;use it will help to minimize wrinkles in the years to come.  Plus, it is more affordable than many other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging of product - good.&lt;br /&gt;Results of product - seem to be good.  Thought my skin would feel softer after applying it, however I‚Äôm fine with it as long as it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients - very happy it does not contain parabens, sulfates, dyes, chemicals, etc.  I would not have purchased it if it contained harmful&lt;br /&gt;ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service - happy to order it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend product to a friend.</li>
            <li> There is a reason why there is over 1000 reviews on this product......it simply just works. It really has helped to regulate my sebum production and acne and even out my skin tone.  I use it all over my face, neck, and d√©collet√©. My skin is now much more clarified, smooth and soft. I&#x27;m really impressed with the results. Will be forever part of my beauty regime. Especially for the summer months.</li>
            <li> It looks a good product.But still I have to wait&lt;br /&gt;how good it is. I need to use it more time.</li>
            <li> For years I have used moisturizers.  They have helped my skin from drying out too much but haven&#x27;t done much to stop the wrinkles.  I know this is a part of growing older but I still don&#x27;t have to like it.  So I decided to augment my skin care routine with this serum after reading the description and reviews.  The product information states that &amp;#34;visible results can be seen in as little as 30 days.&amp;#34;  In much less time than that (1 week) I have noticed an improvement--even in my neck!  Nothing I have used before has made such a difference in my skin tone.  My skin just looks better and those lines aren&#x27;t as bad as they used to be.  Excellent product which I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> A. I like skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;B. I love transparency&lt;br /&gt;C. Natural ingredients that don&#x27;t cause terrible side effects please!&lt;br /&gt;This product has all of them. Not only that, Amazon is actually where the product is sold by the manufacturer so this is not diluted, old or imperfect in any way. THIS IS ALSO REALLY AFFORDABLE! So anyway, the owner of the company followed up and was in contact to make sure I received the product on time. This costs one third of the cost of Skinceuticals and has more stable vitamin C in it that Skinceuticals. As well, the label and the owner totally transparent about the amount of each active ingredient and the formulation. This is a win-win!&lt;br /&gt;So how does it work? I&#x27;m in my first 4 days of use. My skin is more moisturized and smoother. I hope the ferulic acid will lighten a few brown sun spots I have. My skin seems glowy- which is the vitamin C! Can you tell I like it??</li>
            <li> Feels okay, but I took a before picture each day and after, and I see no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> \\&quot; I am an aesthetician at one of the finest spas in Newport Beach and can say without hesitation that is hands down the BEST serum you can buy to beautify your face at this price.  What makes this product different is the 22% NATURAL vitamin C (sodium ascorbyl phosphate) which is Vitamin C in its purest, most organic form, and will not irritate the skin like other brands.  I love the smooth texture and quick absorption of this serum, it is like a primer and moisturizer in one, with the awesome benefits of pure topical vitamin C smoothing all those fine lines and wrinkles.  This is my new go-to product and I have recommended it to all my clients who are looking for that extra edge in having beautiful supple, summer skin.</li>
            <li> Love it !! I highly recommended it !</li>
            <li> I use it after I cleanse my face. I love the way it dties and makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> Terrible product! Irritated my skin, dried my skin out and possibly even caused me to breakout. Did not deliver anything as to what the product claims. GARBAGE! A complete waste of almost $40!</li>
            <li> I buy and review a lot of products. But this is the first time I‚Äôve used a skin serum. I remembered when Dr Oz talked about it and sort of filed it away. That is until I started seeing lines around my eyes  and a generally dull tone to my skin. So I did what I always do before a purchase. I researched what vitamin c serums can do and the various options out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out that you can easily pay over $100 for one ounce of this stuff. I value my appearance but I don‚Äôt have that kind of money. But I knew that I wanted a high concentration of vitamin c along with other ingredients that are known to improve your skin. The serumtologie serum has 22% c along with hyaluronic acid, e and ferulic acid. I have been using a few drops every morning and before I go to bed. Here‚Äôs what I found- my skin is definitely softer and not nearly as dull. Makes me look well rested even when I‚Äôm not. The only problem I had is that it comes with a shrink wrap over the cap that was a little difficult getting off. But other than that no other complaints. This is so GOOD to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;‚Äã</li>
            <li> Product as expected. Fast Shipment.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion in return for your candid feedback.  I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two weeks, but have noticed an improvement in my skin tone and my skin feels tighter.  I plan to continue using for more results.</li>
            <li> I have used many different Vitamin C serums for the last few years as part of my regular skin maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product two months ago to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results have been excellent. First, the serum texture is not soft liquid or thick and it is very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The skin absorbs it quickly without any drying and it feels hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed after a few weeks that my skin is softer, more hydrated with a beautiful natural glow.&lt;br /&gt;It also reduced the visible appearance of some fine wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company also showed excellent customer service as I sent them a few questions and they were very responsive and answered all of them quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just placed my second order for this and look forward to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works! I totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a reduction in fine lines within just 10 days of using serumtologie C serum 22. I use a cleanser and toner and then apply this product every evening.  It appaers to actually be working to give me a younger look.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase, the C Serum is helping to reduce lines and wrinkles.  Love the product</li>
            <li> Very effective C serum. Generous amount for a competitive price. C serums must be at least 17% vitamin C to be effective, and this one goes above and beyond at 22%. The formulation is well thought out and ideal for repairing and improving the look, feel and health of your skin. The ingredients of this product are more like topical supplements for your skin, contributing to collagen production, supporting connective tissue and destroying damage causing free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;I previously used another brand of C serum, and, while it was effective, it exacerbated a skin condition I have called rosacea. I am very impressed with serumtologie&#x27;s C serum because it is not only effective, it is extremely gentle and does not irritate my skin in the slightest. I look forward to trying other products from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Great for your face. Product soaks into your skin quickly and evenly.  Very light smell that goes away quickly.  It has been a very short time using this product, but I love the way it leaves my skin feeling soft.  I received this free by giving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Really like this product. My skin feels firmer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a Vitamin C serum for a while that didn&#x27;t break the bank. After using a friends Obagi brand professional C Serum (20%) I knew I needed to invest in this type of product. After a good deal of research I came across serumtologie C serum 22, and the reviews really sold me. I&#x27;ve been using this product both morning and night for the last 6 days. Upon first use I noticed that the serum was more cloudy than I had anticipated (and in comparison to obagi professional c), it also almost always has huge air bubbles when I try to ration out the drops onto my finger tips (is that normal?).  My skin seemed to soak it up in the first few uses and felt really moisturized although each time I use it my skin almost feels more dry and tight- although the tightness isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing. I was surprised to find that I didn&#x27;t have any sort of tingling sensation upon first application, as I did with my experience with the obagi product, especially seeing as this product has a higher percentage of vitamin C. Regardless, I&#x27;m hopeful that this serum is something that will work for me. Any comments or insight about the air bubbles, serum color, or feeling of dryness with this product would be greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say what the results will be, I just received it, but the reviews are great so hopefully it will be beneficial for me.</li>
            <li> I just started, waiting for the results.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  I purchased it on faith and have no regrets.  My skin is brighter and smoother after using it for a few weeks, and although I purchased it for the promotional price, I would repurchase at full price. Also, as a person with oily skin who is prone to breakouts this has no scent and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. I&#x27;ve used it long enough now that I would have seen a flare up if it clogged my pores.  Overall, a very lovely product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A SCAM.  YOU END UP BEING BILLED EACH MONTH DESPITE THE FAKE CLAIM OF A 14 DAY TRIAL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T FLL FOR THIS</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! It is so kind to my delicate skin! I am ordering another bottle! I Love It!</li>
            <li> this serum is pretty good, I can see my skin has been brighten</li>
            <li> So far so good!!! It&#x27;s light allowing my skin to absorb its ingredients quickly.  A huge plus+++ It does not irritate my skin.  I have sensitive skin and this product does not cause any discomfort.  A week into using it, my bff said &amp;#34;why do you look like we&#x27;re still in H.S???:)&amp;#34; (it has been 17 years since we graduated...lol) I&#x27;d say is a combination of my ritual habits which now includes this awesome product.  Huge compliments to customer service - SUPERB! I have never received such service from a retailer on Amazon! Vanessa rocks!</li>
            <li> I am using this to clear the rosasia break out.  So far so good.  Not sticky.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> My cousin raved about this serum, so I thought I would give it a try. I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it really seems to work. My skin is brighter and smoother and it doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. This is my new favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Product is perfect for my aging, sun over-exposed skin. It seems to be providing a restorative balance after only a couple of months use. Non-irritating. Works well with my sun screen. Was received sooner than expected and package in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff- it&#x27;s an all in one (practical) Vit C plus everything else that helps with lifting and is anti- aging. I have fairly oily skin and this product is great for that. I use it in conjunction with a Neutrogena anti- wrinkle cream (retinol) at night and during the day before applying my mineral make- up and it&#x27;s just perfect. I just wish I had heeded the offer to buy 3 or more to get a discount, I bought the bottles one at a time now that I&#x27;m confident I like it and it works!</li>
            <li> First of all, the price point is awesome. I have previously worked at a skincare company and am familiar with products of various price ranges, and this serum is incredibly affordable while still offering great results. I&#x27;m incredibly sensitive to smells of facial products. If it smells bad, I won&#x27;t use it.  So I was relieved to discover that this has literally no smell. The serum is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy on my face at all. My face has been softer since using it and I feel like it&#x27;s smoothed out my complexion overall. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I love it.</li>
            <li> It has been awhile since I&#x27;ve used a C Serum due to the ridiculous pricing, so when I saw the fantastic value that  serumtologie is I had to give it a try. I&#x27;m happy I did. First, it is simply &amp; beautifully packaged. This to me is often the sign of a quality product. In addition, I received a follow up e-mail from the company that was warm &amp; felt personal. When ordering online, this is a quality that is most often missed. I liked that this company took time to add this thoughtful &amp; personal touch. But would the product live up? It did...... I love it. I began using serumtologie right away, twice a day, and after 24 hours (3 applications) I  could tell a difference in how my skin feels... and within 72 hours, I could SEE a difference in tone &amp; hydration &amp; overall texture and smoothness. . As someone with Celiac disease and who makes every effort to keep unnecessary chemicals out of my life, I am also thrilled that the makers of serumtolgie has taken the time to put in only quality ingredients. Many cosmetics and skin care lines include the unnecessary use of wheat or other gluten. This one does not. Continuing to use serumtolgie as I have now for a couple of weeks, I can honestly say that this will now be part of my skin care routine. I might add that I am not someone who uses a ton of products. I am pretty basic.  Less is more--so a product has to really sell me. This one has. Crowsfeet are diminished &amp; I love the brightness &amp; vibrance that it has given me back.</li>
            <li> I am new to using Vitamin C serum, and this is the first time I have used Serumtologie&#x27;s Vit C serum. I found it to have a silkier consistency than what I used before, and it didn&#x27;t have an odor like the other product. Great value too.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I love the way it makes my skin feel as soon as I put it on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of the serum to coat my face. I believe my skin has a healthy glow to it.  I have tried several products with a range of active ingredients but I have liked this one the best and intend to keep it as part of my long term skin care routine.  I do recommended it!</li>
            <li> Love this serum! I have noticed a huge difference in my skin since using it. Particularly my face is more hydrated with a nice glow to it. Would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying I&#x27;m not the review type of person;  I write reviews when something is really bad or really great.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the serum and used it with a moisturizer I already had. I did this for 2 weeks and found it would leave my skin feeling a little dry,  but was softening it at the same time.  The dying effect I didn&#x27;t really care for,  so I decided to change my moisturizer and add Serumtologie&#x27;s whipped moisturizer.  I have done this for about 2 weeks now and LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!  The 2 products work amazingly together!  My skin is softer and the texture is more smooth with a more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these products and look forward to the long term effects they have to offer.&lt;br /&gt;It also has to be said that I emailed the company with a couple of questions and they were extremely helpful and very efficient!!!  I look forward to more products by Serumtologie.&lt;br /&gt;God bless!  :)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nothing like Obaji vitamin c serum.  Made my face extremely dry and flaky all over my face and I didn&#x27;t see any positive changes.</li>
            <li> Is ok serum.&lt;br /&gt;Previously I order the same serum from timeless but they run out of stock so I got this one . After a month using I see very little improvement .</li>
            <li> It is a product that is good to mix with others.</li>
            <li> Some dark spots and wrinkles started bothering me couple of years ago. I used to go to beach without any protection.&lt;br /&gt; I really hope the treatment fades them. I never realised you could do anything about spots until I saw this and I feel fairly optimistic about it.  And I&#x27;be never written a review for any products before but was compelled to do so for this awesome cosmetic product.&lt;br /&gt;It has been couple of weeks since the first trial but it looks really working.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy to use it every night and excited to wake up in the morning with my better skin condition.&lt;br /&gt; It is also good price to keep using for long term.  I am going to order more for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff to the other popular one which comes highly recommended -- and it shows. I saw no changes after 8 weeks. I have since tossed the bottle and bought the real deal.</li>
            <li> Magical product !&lt;br /&gt;Very hydrating&lt;br /&gt;Very healing&lt;br /&gt;Very gentle to sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Very clear and believable description with visible results ;)</li>
            <li> Vitamin C renews your face from sun exposure damage and free radicals so I was using a powder form popular at Sephora. I saw no difference with the other product but continued to use it. At the airport I was pulled aside and they tested it thinking it was a different white substance. :-D Well, since then I have been looking for a vitamin C option that worked with my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on a skin regimen for mild adult acne but my skin reacts to products that contain too many ingredients or are too strong. This product is the right balance for me because I get my kick of vitamin C without having experienced the rash that has followed with drug store products and some makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 20s so I&#x27;m also happy to also be using an anti-aging product that isn&#x27;t too heavy on my &#x27;young&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> Yes I would say it work it make my face feel softer it look more hydrate. Great product I used it for month first before I rated</li>
            <li> 5star AWESOME ! already got more, using it on my breast surgery scars and I LOVE IT !!</li>
            <li> This product brings out the best in my skin, and ordering and receiving on time is excellent. I am in my 60s and my skin looks great</li>
            <li> I am in the beauty industry and have used many beauty products, and this serum gives results! The  serum is at a great price point for one containing Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid. I like the consistency of if, because it absorbs into my skin. I have already seen the softening effects of the serum and will definitely be adding it to my skincare routine permanantly!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It REALLY works &amp; does not cost as much as other products that do not work. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to buy it...probably forever. I have noticed some lines disappear and skin feels great.  My age spots have faded although not entirely gone. I didn&#x27;t think my wrinkles had faded all that much but saw a before and after photo and was pleasantly surprised.  The product comes well packaged and I love the blue bottle...it&#x27;s the little things :)</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly. Have used serum for several days...no allergic reaction...already noticeable suppleness in skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous. A friend of mine, Suzanne Baker recommended I try it- I was absolutely amazed by the results.  This has def been added to my routine!!</li>
            <li> I used C serum 22 morning and night and my eye lids got itchy. Now I&#x27;ve quit using it and am medicating my eye lids. Other than than I felt the product had potential.</li>
            <li> Have used one bottle. Still waiting to see a big difference.</li>
            <li> It seemed to lighten my age spots a little after a month. It&#x27;s better than average and provided some moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 2 weeks and honestly don&#x27;t see a bit of difference. i swutched from a 20% serum to this because of the higher concentration and seriously nothing. I do have good skin but I did see a difference with previous serums.Trying It for another week but probably not for me.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and feels like it is really helping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different serums and this one seems to be good. I know it can take time to see major results, so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.  I have used vitamin C serums before and C22 feels just as protective and healthful as the others.  I apply 2x a day and really appreciate the immediate sensation of tightening and smoothing.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this and report and changes in texture and color of my aging 60 + years.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had such great reviews but hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  There has been no difference in the fine lines or the texture of my skin.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to be the daytime part of my retinol/serum regimen. It is very lightweight and surprisingly hydrating. I haven&#x27;t used a moisturizer at all since I started the serum. It isn&#x27;t a facelift, ladies, but I&#x27;ve noticed subtle changes in my skin&#x27;s elasticity and tone over the last few weeks. Sometimes I piggyback it on top of my retinol at night, once the retinol has absorbed. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this to calm my skin and it loves it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I love it!</li>
            <li> I can already feel the results in just a short time of using this product!  After the first week, my skin felt very smooth.  My skin has always been very dry, but after using this product for just 2 days I could tell a difference.  In the past few weeks, my skin has felt tighter.  I&#x27;m excited to see more results with continued use!</li>
            <li> Has the active ingredients I was looking for. A better deal is to be had at https://www.scottsmarketplace.com/buy/939/vitamin-c-serum-2oz-advanced-vitamin-c-serum-for-f/</li>
            <li> I never write reviews...this is my first...this is so good and for the first time I threw out all the stuff Ii have on my shelf...been using about a month...I&#x27;m an old chicken and this really works...same stuff in sears for $89.00...thank you</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a short time but I am happy with the results so far.  My skin feels softer.  I am hoping with continued use I will see more benefits.</li>
            <li> After using these serum for three days, my skiing broke out in huge pimples.  It never happened to me with other C Serums I&#x27;ve use (Skin Ceuticals).  I want to return the two bottles I got for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Using it for about 2 months and loving it.  My skin is brighter and people at work have noticed.  I am fair skinned and have a few acne scars on my chin that have noticeably faded.  I have been wearing less make up because my skin has improved.  I am looking forward to what may happen after a few more months.</li>
            <li> This is great! It made my skin so smooth, and I love the wrinkle-fighting powers. I would recommend this to all my lady friends (and men too!). My daughter, who is 23, also uses it!</li>
            <li> Helped with hydration and smoothed the appearance of my brow lines.</li>
            <li> Received order very fast!! Use in AM and PM and can already see a diffetence. Skin is so soft an bright!!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of application I noticed smoother skin on my face and neck and a softer texture.</li>
            <li> Makes my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;You have beautiful skin.&amp;#34;  I love hearing that and appreciate the person telling me.  My dermatologist told me topical vitamin C is the best treatment against aging skin.  I added vitamin C by serumtologie to my skin care.  I am very happy with the softness and slight glow of my skin.  It definitely softens the effects of aging.  You will not find the fountain of youth in any product, but  vitamin C and a warm smile does wonders.</li>
            <li> I have been using the C Serum for two weeks now, and I can see the changes in my skin. As a Realtor in the Caribbean the sun has taken a toll on my neck and face. However, I must say this is an excellent product which I will repurchase before it&#x27;s finish.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!!!  I have been using it for almost a year and it has become a regular part of my routine.  It keeps by skin baby smooth and very hydrated.  I had a small brown patch on my forehead when I first started using this product and after about a month, it was completely gone....and has never returned.  I love this serum :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month, but not had any noticeable changes so far. It feels good on my skin, but nothing special. I will keep using and update if I see any differences.</li>
            <li> Item received timely. So far I like the serum. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 4 days and so far so good...it really hydrates my face. ****I just placed an order for my 2nd bottle yesterday. It&#x27;s been almost 1 month and I have a couple of days left before my 1st bottle is empty. I&#x27;ve used it every morning and night on my face, neck, decolette and hands. I have to say that I am extremely pleased with the consistency as the semi thickness of the serum allows for an easy application. I&#x27;ve been using another serum of Vitamin C + E Ferulic brand for about 2 years and have always been happy with the difference its made on my face (plumpier, smoother, brighter -- overall, its made my face look healthier and younger). This product continues to do the same. After reading some very positive reviews about the product and its customer service, I decided to give this product a try. What sold me to Vitamin C serum 22 by Serumtologie is its higher concentration of Vitamin C and the PRICE! I no longer have to use the serum sparingly and can now use more on my neck and decolette as this bottle is only a fraction of the price from what I used to purchase in the past. So happy I stumbled into this product. I&#x27;ll likely be a regular customer!</li>
            <li> I ran out of serumtologie, and used another product.  I was so disappointed in the other serum.  I could hardly wait for this Vitamin C to be delivered.  I have used it for two days and not seeing any results yet, but now realize the first bottle was making a big difference, especially since I had gone off of it.  I am very impressed with the customer service and the personalized letters from the co founder, Vanessa Powers.  I am convinced.  It is the best skin product out there.  I am 75 yrs old, and was doubtful anything would really help my face look younger and fresher, and yes, the lines and wrinkles are less noticeable.  I am a believer!</li>
            <li> So -- I have been using this product for a month. I think it is one of the best C serums out there! It does hydrate my skin and it smooths my skin nicely. It seems to have closed my pores a bit and yes, some of my discoloration has faded; not all but I can definitly see a difference. It feels good to put on and it works beautifully with the rest of my skin care regime!  It is not greasy at all and soaks in nicely on my 50 plus (age) skin.  It could probably be used alone on younger skin.  I already ordered another bottle. This is great at a fantastik price! I hope they do not up the price too much or I won&#x27;t be able to purchase it again! I have recommended this product!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. Very very satisfied. Takes a few weeks, but do see noticeable results. When you first start using it, it makes your skin dry. As your complexion gets acclimated to the product, my skin does feel smoother and not dry. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not great but not bad. Felt nice but saw no difference. That&#x27;s all I have to say about it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Have been using this morning and night for 4 days now and can already see some improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and appearance.  I put moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the feel of this product‚Ä¶it&#x27;s both cool and refreshing! I asked my dermatologist if she felt the product was a good one and there were several ingredients in it, she said were excellent to use:).</li>
            <li> Just received product and felt immediate tightening of my skin after first use. Looking forward to seeing long term results.</li>
            <li> What I love about C Serum 22 is that it goes on so naturally and so little goes so far.  When I put it on, my skin feels like it still breathes!  Other products give me a horrible, artificial feeling on my skin that drives me nuts.  My face either feels puffy, or my pores feel clogged.  C Serum 22 has no chemical side effects.  My skin really does feel smoother and more firm to minimize sagging!  Cristina</li>
            <li> make my skin feel soft but at 49 years of age i&#x27;d need a bath tub of this stuff I have enjoyed using this product. it has made a big difference in the way it makes my skin soft and I indeed have a glow to my skin. I found this produst to be everything it claims to be thank you for the chance to let me try your wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I like it. I will buy it again...</li>
            <li> Having over 15 years experience as an esthetician (skin care specialist) and a licensed instructor, I&#x27;ve worked with countless product lines on a large base of clients with various skin types and conditions.&lt;br /&gt;It is very important to know that not all Vitamin C serums are equal. Vitamin C isn&#x27;t a very stable ingredient and can quickly lose its potency, thereby losing its antioxidant abilities along with its ability to brighten and smooth the skin.  And the forms which are more well preserved aren&#x27;t effective agents on the skin (meaning their not readily absorbed by the skin).&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve found in Serumtologie Vitamin C Serum *22 is a unique stable form of Vitamin C in a safe concentration that is readily absorbed into the skin. This product has a combination of organic herbal extracts, vitamins, hyaluronic &amp; ferulic acids, that all work synergistically resulting in brightening, antioxidant,  and anti aging effects on the skin! AND it&#x27;s organic, vegan, it&#x27;s not tested on animals &amp; it is free of all those nasty ingredients, like parabens! Did I mention it is Made in the USA??!?&lt;br /&gt;My skin is the biggest test of validity to any product&#x27;s effectiveness. I&#x27;m 39 years old with dehydrated, oily skin that is sensitive and prone to break outs. I have deep furrow lines on my forehead and fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I also have hyper pigmented (dark) spots and blotched areas that are the result of sun damage from my youth and taking birth control in my twenties.&lt;br /&gt;The results I have experienced using Vitamin C Serum *22 - morning &amp; evening- after just a week - are nothing short of amazing! My skin is more hydrated, the dark splotches are unnoticeable and the dark spots have lightened so my freckles look normal and separate! The fine lines around my eyes and mouth are gone, my forehead isn&#x27;t furrowed - there is one noticeable very FINE line- only one! My jaw line is taut-  along with the skin on my neck and chest!&lt;br /&gt;And it isn&#x27;t just my discerning eye that has noticed the improvements! My husband has commented on how soft and smooth my skin is. Strangers are complimenting my youthful appearance- and are shocked when I tell them my age! Listen, I am here to tell you, after having a dull, uneven complexion for the past 7 years- it&#x27;s wonderful to hear words like &amp;#34;soft, smooth, radiant &amp;#34; in regards to my skin&#x27;s complexion!&lt;br /&gt;So, in my professional and my personal opinion, Vitamin C Serum *22 by Serumtologie is a product no woman, whether in her twenties or in her seventies, should be without!</li>
            <li> Good product !  I could feel it soaking into my skin immediately.  Use a.m. And p.m.&lt;br /&gt;Use before moisturizer .  There is no scent or oily feeling , skin just drinks it up</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and i hope it works well for me then i will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product -- like many others, I have also used several different expensive lotions and creams with little or no visible results.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and almost immediately noticed a brightening of my skin with the use of Best C Serum.  The customer service and follow-up have also be exceptional -- I especially appreciate the follow-up emails with suggestions for application and use.  And best of all, Best C Serum is reasonably priced.  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this product,  I have used many vitamin C products and this is the best. Their customer service department is excellent.</li>
            <li> I can tell when I don&#x27;t wear this.  It really has made my face more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Vitamin C product In April, I have used Paulas Choice at 45.00, I have used Timeless, which does not stay well in the bottle, I have used  Peter Thomas Roth, Dr Denese, This Product is by far the very best I have used to date. My sun stops are almost gone, My skin is firmer, My overall tone if much better, Its really is just all you need , the bottle and dropper are perfect to keep the product stable, and it works! I use three to four small drops in my am serum, before i moisturise and again at night, If you are on the fence on this product, Do not be, Its a great balance of all you need , fresh and works to perfection. Give it at least 30 day for sunspots, they did not happen overnight , but you will see improvement. S√©rumtologi√©¬Æ Beverly Hills, CA is and does what it says it will. Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> So totally enjoy using this product. My skin is softer and more supple. I also like that the product does not have a strong scent because I know it will not dry out my skin after a while. And no parabens or other nasty additives! thank you, Serumtologie. A small bottle of goodness.</li>
            <li> I love love this stuff!! My skin tone appears a lot brighter! I have been using this for a month maybe and can&#x27;t say enough about it!! I will try their other products! I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and acne prone skin .. No problem with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of all the rave reviews but unfortunately it&#x27;s done more harm than good. This product does not have a strong scent and applies smoothly. It did help my skin look more even and hydrated but it caused my cheek, nose, and the space between my eyebrows to break out in small bumps (I usually never break out on my cheek and forehead region so I suspect this is the culprit because it was the only change I made to my regimen). I am especially upset because my cheeks have been clear for so long and now it looks bumpy and there is a red spot that will take forever to go away... I also got a whitehead and feel a huge zit coming on my chin. I will probably have to toss this. UPDATE: I decided to continue usage for another week and while the spot on my cheek has faded a little, more red spots have come to join it. The same goes for my other cheek but thankfully I only applied to one region on that cheek. Additionally, I have rash bumps on my inner cheeks by my nose that won&#x27;t go away... For my troubles, I did receive a refund.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in good shape with no damage to the package. I love the product. I waited to write the review until i had used it several times. I see a definite difference in my skin quality. It is tighter, softer, smother and there are fewer lines. I will definitely keep using this!</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I had a GF order it &amp; she noticed a difference in one day!</li>
            <li> I have used Vitamin C serum 22 by serumtologie Anti Aging for several months.  I noticed an increased tightness right away.  I am 75 years old and have taken really good care of my skin.  I have very few wrinkles and they are significantly diminished by using this product.  I have bought less expensive Vitamin C products and have returned them or used them on my hands.  I love this product and thank you for providing a quality Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a month.  I can&#x27;t tell much difference yet,....but it feels wonderful!  Quick shipper.</li>
            <li> This is the best Serum EVER-I am in my late 50&#x27;s, since I have been using this my skin looks amazing-it looks younger and my skin glows. Love this Product. I am a little late with writing this review but I ordered my 3 bottle today. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to people- women/men, that already are in a mature age, you WILL see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this Vitamin C for about a week.  I am using it a s directed every morning.  It feel great going on and dries quickly so that I can put on other products on.  I will use it for a month every day and see if the product works as directed. I am very anxious for a month to go by, but I don&#x27;t know if this is attributed to the vitamin C but I am 40 years old and a lady at a party told me I looked 30.  I do take good care of my  skin but maybe it is the serumtologie¬Æ C serum ¬∫22...&lt;br /&gt;This C Serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a coincidence, but I&#x27;ve been told twice in the past 3-4 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this product that I look young to have a 12-year old. I&#x27;m 40. So take from that what you will, but I&#x27;ve never been told that before, so I&#x27;m definitely sticking with this stuff!! ;)</li>
            <li> Smoother, firmer skin within a couple of days!</li>
            <li> I use this at the end of my evening after I exfoliate and love the way my skin feels so soft! I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in my fine lines however I do notice a difference in hydration which we all know helps with keeping our face fresh and smooth! Smells great and sooo much product! Will become a staple in my routine!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find this product. It has all the ingredients found in the stellar Skinceuticals CEF product but with two major differences. Even at the regular $85 price is almost half the cost of Skinceuticals  but the serumtologie C serum has a higher concentration of Vitamin C and Ferulic acid. And now I see it at a drastically lower price here on Amazon.  Love Skinceuticals. Love Obagi. But this is my go to daily product from now on.</li>
            <li> Update 8/1/14: Even though this product didn&#x27;t work for me (too drying), Serumtologie has a high quality product.  The consistency and feel of the serum is very nice, and it absorbs quickly.  The company is very quick to respond to questions/problems.  Valerie, owner of Serumtologie, contacted me directly and offered a refund.  I&#x27;d be happy to purchase a different product from Serumtologie in the future.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change at all.  Felt some tightening affects, but not much.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum!  I have used other, more expensive C serums and I will always go back to this one!!  I noticed a tightness and glow that I LOVE.  I have been using it evening and morning.  I need to try using a little less, as I am already finished with my bottle.  That is my only complaint that it lasted such a short time, but I think I will use less to make it last longer and still hoping for the same results!!  I love that it has more hyaluronic acid than any other C serum that I have found.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of vit C skin products but never used it in this formula before. Unfortunately It breaks me out, my skin couldnt tolerate i</li>
            <li> DERMATOLOGIST RECOMMENDED&lt;br /&gt; My dermatologist recommended I start using a vitamin C serum since I am in my early 30‚Äôs and in the pre-wrinkle stage. She gave me 4 ingredients to look for ‚Äì Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (the most pure and non irritating form of vitamin c), Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, and Vitamin E or jojoba oil.  Serumtologie fit the bill with all these and I have had outstanding results.  There are so many cheap serums out there compared to this one, you get what you pay for.  I am impressed with how silky smooth and fresh my skin looks and feels in just a few days. I will be ordering again for sure!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results!!! I have been using this serum for 30 days...fine lines diminished...skin texture is soft supple and radiant ! Thank you for a product that delivers as promised! I can&#x27;t tell you how many thousands of dollars!! Yes...thousands over the years of infomercial garbage u have bought that did nothing! I am amazed at this little miracle in a bottle . Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Twice I tried to use it, but after a few weeks my skin looked dried out. It might work for other complexions, but not mine.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple of different kinds of C serum.  This one is fairly thick and has lasted a bit longer that the other brands.  I&#x27;m not sure if any of them have helped me significantly, but they feel great on my face!</li>
            <li> Great Product for a Great Price! The first impression of the product was-- pleasant smell and it absorbs fast without leaving your face oily. It is a needless, affordable, efficient, non greasy  treatment. The ingredients are just perfect for exfoliating dead skin cells. After a few days of use I have a smoother , healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> Notice difference on my wife... she loves it...</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Contains active vitamin C unlike many other products that claim to contain vitamin C.  The price is great!</li>
            <li> Great Product and excellent price!! I have been using this vitamin C serum 22 for almost 2 weeks.  Skin feels and looks smoother already.  The previous serum I was using cost close to $100.00 and did not perform nearly as well as Serum 22.  I have told several friends about it.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in 1 month.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! It feels really good on my skin...not to heavy or light, not greasy &amp; no harsh odor. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product for an incredible price.  An aesthetician recommended another vitamin C product (too oily).  I bought this instead and LOVE it.  It really made a difference for me diminishing fine lines and brightening my complexion.  Would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so appreciative and grateful to your company for showing such interest in your individual customer&#x27;s impressions! I love this product!ive already seen dramatic results: my skin is incredibly smooth, my skin is much more radiant, and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in my facial hyper pigmentation! As a former esthetician, I researched the best products, all the while knowing that I needed a vitamin C serum. I read glowing reviews! I had to try for myself and am indeed amazed! I&#x27;m waiting to finish my moisturizer before moving on to yours!you have a customer for life and am already singing the praises of this serum! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product three times and I do see a difference in my skin. It seems less dull, fine lines aren&#x27;t as visible, and the couple of age spots I had are barely visible now. Also, I had a broken blood vessel (I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s technically the correct term, but it looked like a red dot on my cheek that I always felt compelled to cover up) which you can hardly see at all now. My step-mother always used to tell me I looked tired, but she rarely says that to me now (thank God!) I think it&#x27;s reasonably priced and it lasts a long time if you follow directions. I&#x27;m 53, but I would tell younger women who don&#x27;t have wrinkles or age spots yet to use this now! Don&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this Vitamin C serum. I have oily skin; however, this product feels smooth and non-greasy upon application. Would purchase again and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve never been one to waste money on the latest beauty trend. I&#x27;ve erred on the side of practicality and acceptance of the aging process. At 45-years-old, I splurged. Whoa! I&#x27;m incredibly happy with the results. My skin appears brighter and healthier. I no longer wear foundation or concealer. After 23 years of marriage, my hubby comments -- for the first time ever -- on the youthful appearance of my skin. He said I sparkled. No joke. He had no idea that I was experimenting with this fountain of youth.</li>
            <li> good price and good seller</li>
            <li> LGP review for Serumtologie posted on Amazon.com May 11, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I am nearing my 71st birthday this summer.  I started using Serumtologie&lt;br /&gt;I started using Vitamin C22 serum about 21 days ago, twice daily, and saw results very rapidly, indeed, including diminishment of fine lines around my nose, mouth and in the&amp;#34;11&amp;#34; furrows between my eyebrows.  While these are not full-blown wrinkles, they are, nonetheless present, and would, no doubt, be persistent given no attention to them.&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in probably 30 or more years, I feel confident enough to use no makeup on my facial skin (although I do apply lipstick and eye make-up).  People comment that my skin looks lovely and are astonished that I am bare of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, I believe that this is an entirely worthwhile product:  highly effective, priced rationally (thankfully), non-irritating (which is normally a side-effect of Vitamin C serums) and with identifiable ingredients (to the best of my own understanding: no fillers, or dangerous chemicals, gratefully).&lt;br /&gt;I have written of my favorable experience with this product in return for a generous discount on my second bottle. as well as a sample of their Whipped Chiffon moisturizer, designed to work with their Vitamin C22 serum.  I wish this boutique skincare company much, much success.&lt;br /&gt;Well-done, Serumtologie!</li>
            <li> I have already received it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love, love the Vitamin C Serum, I&#x27;m  70+ and would not be without it. I ordered my 3rd Bottle and get complements on my Skin  from People I would least expect it, asking what my skin care Secret is. So please, you like to try a a great product let it be that one.</li>
            <li> So far, the serum seems to be working on my face, my Skin feels very soft and healthier, I started using it 3 weeks ago and because of my age, 63,  I am aware  it could take a little  longer to see the best results.  It would be wonderful to know if you have Eye Cream!!</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;In a few weeks of use,morning and night, I have noticed my skin is softer and there is a definite fading of a brown mark on my cheek, for that alone I will keep on buying C Serum!&lt;br /&gt;5 drops is all you need, so it lasts a long time and is good value for money.</li>
            <li> I got it for my mom. She loves it! Thank you for this product</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum, it go&#x27;s on very easily &amp; makes my skin feel so soft, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 wks now, I have one brown spot on my face &amp; it&#x27;s almost gone!!!</li>
            <li> first, with any shopping experience, as a costumer im most satisfied when I get exactly the product I want. The next most satisfying thing, if not the most, is top of the line costumer service. I got both from this company.&lt;br /&gt;Within the first 3 days I knew I had liquid gold in my possession. No exaggeration here.  Brighter, firmer, cleaner, even, and glowing skin that just got better with time. Then the craziest thing happened. I Knocked my bottle over after a week and lost half the product! I immediately ordered another. Then the company emailed me asking me how I was liking the product so far. I shared my satisfaction and shared how I spilled half the product and immediately ordered another as a testament to how much I was loving it. They did the sweetest most unexpected thing. This company (lady who contacted me is Vanessa) refunded me the full price of my first order, and told me my next purchase would only cost $5 as they were giving me a discount. I used the code today to order another even though I&#x27;m just halfway through my current bottle. Freaks me out to think about being without it!&lt;br /&gt;They are always in touch with me, checking in around how the serum is working and giving me tips to maximum your use and its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be without this product.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write reviews, for this experience, I simply had to. This experience restored my faith in online shopping. It&#x27;s been my best so far. Very kind and caring costumer care.&lt;br /&gt;One satisfied girl.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life! Amazing in reducing wrinkles, crows feet, smile lines, and even acne. I have told all my sisters and mom about this. I love it!</li>
            <li> First of all, the customer service from Serumtologie is AMAZING!  Shortly after purchasing the product I received an email from Vanessa, the co-founder of the company and then several weeks after beginning usage I received a second &amp;#34;check-in&amp;#34; email to see how I liked the product and provide tips for not only using the product but maximizing my skin care routine!  I have purchased a LOT through Amazon over the years and this is THE FIRST TIME a company has actually contacted me personally to ensure I was happy with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the most important part, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I began using Serum 22 the morning after it arrived and have used it every day since without fail (about 3 weeks at this posting).  I absolutely love the feel of this product on my skin. I have oily skin, aging skin AND I live in Florida which has tremendously high humidity so my skin, regardless of how well I try to take care of it, suffers from a fairly constant presence of some type of imperfection - usually nothing major - small bumps or breakouts - but rarely flawless.  After incorporating this product into my routine for several weeks, I now look in the mirror and see radiant (not oily) skin!  My pores are significantly less noticeable and my skin is well on its way to actually being flawless for the first time since I can remember.  I noticed that I don&#x27;t need as much cover-up and on many days I can actually get away with a light dusting of powder and be on my way!  Honestly, were in not for the fact that my skin gets so oily in this humidity, I probably could actually go WITHOUT make-up for the first time in FOREVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is well on it&#x27;s way to becoming a holy grail product for me and, for me, the customer service only seals the deal! Bravo Serumtologie!</li>
            <li> Not sure if higher vitamin C % always means better product. After using the entire bottle, I didn&#x27;t notice much improvements compared to other Vitamin C products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I feeeel my skin looks less wrinkled and I look youngerthan my chronilogical age.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to protect and hydrate my skin in this hot and humid TX weather.  I found serumtologie on a whim after searching ‚Äúbest vitamin C serums‚Äù online.  The awesome reviews on the customer service of this company are what finally led me to purchase, and I‚Äôm so glad I did.  I have found my new anti-aging secret; it truly is like a primer and moisturizer in one, dries so quickly and stays on in even in this super hot weather!  I have received so many compliments on my skin just within the past week.  I would highly recommend to others who are picky about their skin like I am!</li>
            <li> i have been using this serum for a little over one month and my skin feels softer and appears brighter.  after just 1 week of using the serum both morning and night i saw a difference in the deepness and length of my frown lines.  the serum is very light and absorbs quickly into your skin.  you can then use your favorite spf moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go.  i would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Very good vit c serum</li>
            <li> very good I&#x27;m really happy with this. I tried one other and I didn&#x27;t really see any difference with it and that one was a little watery side. Happy with this one, try it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money. I regretted in buying it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with the whipped moisturizing cream for about 3 weeks.  I have seen a lot of improvement in skin tone on my face, neck, chest  and hands.  I like that these absorb quickly into my skin and that it feels moisturized with out a heavy or oily feel like some moisturizers.  I have used a lot of different products with very different results.  This one actually feels like it delivers what it claims.  Will continue to use and see what the future results will be.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
            <li> This is truly the best serum I&#x27;ve used. Definitely decreased the lines on my forehead and crows feet. Also my laugh lines helped! When you apply, apple in the morning under moisterizer, then do your makeup. You may use this at night before bed also for more effectiveness for the skin, but to not waste product I would use it once a day only and just use another vitamin c serum at night. I usually use Kiehls midnight recovery serum night, and I use this morning. I will let you know I have used this morning and night a few times when I want to look my best a certain day and it helps my face look extra young and plumped! Love this!</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using the product. (on the 2nd bottle!) I use it 2x per day which is lasting about 1 month per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I am 58 years old and have pretty good skin but have hyperpigmentation on my neck and a few lines on forehead and neck as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit it seems to be working. The hyperpigmentation has faded (not completely gone) and yes my skin feels smoother and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;The product I find is packaged well and absorbs into the skin nicely. It is a bit drying for me so I use a moisturizer.  I wear a moisturizer with spf 15 or 30 during the day. At night after I apply the serum I use a night moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have tried other Vitamin C serums, some that have been more expensive with not the same results.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I love it!  My skin feels incredibly soft and smooth and looks healthy and alive.  Yesterday I was out and about all day without foundation - only Serum C and moisturizer/sunblock - and I am old enough for Medicare!</li>
            <li> goes on very smooth and feels great.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but other than a sort of tight feeling after it dries, I don&#x27;t notice a change in my skin. I guess maybe it works better on younger people who have less damage to start with.</li>
            <li> I am going on one month of using this serum. I didn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin to begin with, but I can tell this has made my skin even better! Love it. It is a little expensive but I will continue to purchase as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I have been using this serum so this will be a 2 part review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 34 year old male who has never used any type of facial moisturizers or serum before. I have just now noticed that I am showing signs of aging (wrinkles, sun spots and drying) through the abuse I have put my skin through while growing up. When younger, most of my summers were spent with full days on the beach under the harsh sun and without much use of sunscreen. During the winter, I could usually be found flying down mountain sides on skis or a snowboard while getting consistently hit in the face with high speed, frigid winter air. The rest of my time would be spent either life guarding at highly chlorinated pools or commuting into and biking around the beautiful but auto exhaust infested streets New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the first time in my life, I have decided to try out C Serum ¬∞22 and I have to say WOW! Just through 2 weeks of use, it has brought to my attention, the above mentioned signs of aging. I don&#x27;t typically take close looks at myself, and after just a short period of time applying, I still don&#x27;t need to do so to notice how much younger and healthier my skin is looking. My face is looking smoother, hydrated, and I&#x27;m quite sure the sun spots I&#x27;ve acquired through the years are starting to clear up. I also have a short beard and it&#x27;s feeling much softer, nicer to touch, and healthier looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is 33 years old, and although she hasn&#x27;t spent her youth in such abusing environments, during the past 7 years that I&#x27;ve known her, she has always been trying to find that perfect product to add to her daily facial routine. Let me just say that I have now received MAJOR kudos for introducing her to C Serum ¬∞22. She can&#x27;t stop talking about how in awe she is that, being a person that never uses this type of product, the first one I bring home turns out to be the one that&#x27;s ended her seemingly eternal search. Although her best description of what it&#x27;s done for her is, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s AWESOME!&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;it works!&amp;#34;, I can confidently say that she definitely looks and is now carrying around a new energy that makes her amazingly seem to be aging in reverse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend that you try C Serum ¬∞22 so that you too could join us in using this revolutionary, anti-aging product. Your face will undoubtedly, thank you for the rest of your life.</li>
            <li> My facial skin is definitely softer and smoother when touched.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure of this product.  I have lines above my top lip that were not there before I began using the serum.  Otherwise it seems to brighten up the rest of my face -- with a glow.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday.  Because of the thick indentations lines around my mouth, I stay away from the mouth and eye areas.  After 2 to 4 days, the lines appear to subside.  I will give an update later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few days, and although I haven&#x27;t seen any huge changes, my skin already feels noticeably tighter.  I really like that the serum doesn&#x27;t have any scent.  I&#x27;m glad I got it, and hope that my skin will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> This serum is easy to apply and absorbs quickly, which I like. However, I&#x27;ve used Bianca Ferosi&#x27;s vitamin C serum, and preferred it much better. Only a drop of my old serum would be enough to cover my face and neck, and it really did even and brighten my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serumtologie is pleasant to use, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes in my skin yet. It also requires about 5-7 drops for your whole face and neck, so it&#x27;s not quite as potent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and only notice very small change to lines on my face. Goes on smooth and absorbs quickly but I would like to see better results faster.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife and she likes it a lot</li>
            <li> use with other anti-aging serums</li>
            <li> am happy with this product make s my face feel really nice</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy expensive oils or serums as I have been blessed with good genes and don&#x27;t really look my age.  Hearing about the benefits of Vitamin C, and exploring what is out there in that line, I came across Serumtologie C and ordered it.  After having an issue with the delivery of the serum and seeing how conscientious the company is, I am glad I found this product.  I have used it for about five days now and notice a difference in how smooth my skin feels.  If this improves any more for fine lines, I will be very happy!  I will re-post after a few weeks with any new results.&lt;br /&gt;Great company, can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
            <li> Trying for the first time. Love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> this doesnt work at all! i prefer to spend more in a better brand...i have used it for a month and havent seen any change!..waste of money!</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my satisfaction. I prefer Obagi products instead.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the C22 serumtologie!  I have been using it for a couple of weeks, maybe 3, and the most noticeable difference to me is the smoothness of my skin.  Hard to describe, but definitely looks better!  I also appreciate the great price for such a quality product!  I like the way it goes into the skin so quickly too....overall a wonderful product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks but have already noticed great improvement in my skin texture.  It is difficult to find 22% Vit C and such good quality for this price.  I am stocking up on many.</li>
            <li> I love this Serum! I have tried several Vitamin C Serums in the past and this by far is the best one that I&#x27;ve found. I love the consistency....it&#x27;s not watery like so many other ones and it leaves my skin feeling baby soft. I only wish it came in a bigger bottle! Awesome product! :)</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 2 weeks, but like the feel of it on my skin very much.  The first couple of days, I got some tingling but no redness or inflammation.  I will continue to use all of this, as I feel it would be too soon to give it a 5 star rating but it is on its way,  I have been looking for a long term solution and hopefully have found it - the price is right and I like the fact that it is somewhat organic on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have to mention that I have received a gift/discount for writing this, but would have done so anyway - as I rely on other peoples comments.</li>
            <li> Seems to work about the same as other high end anti aging creams.  Of course, I want miracles.. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product.  I saw improvement on my face in 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered very fast</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I am seeing results allready.  my dark spots have lightened and lines around my lips are shrinking.  I love this product!  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This product was one of the products I used to help even the tone and improve the skin on my face. I believe it did its job. After finishing the bottle I noticed that my skin was more even toned and brighter. I also had compliments from my friends saying how much younger I looked (and I&#x27;m in my 60&amp;#34;s)!</li>
            <li> THIS BEST C SERUM  .. is the best.  I have tried all kinds of VIT C serum&#x27;s  and this surpasses them all with HIGH VIT C 22% plus other necessary skin loving nutrients.  IT leaves your skin soft, smooth and clears out the sun spots.  I love it.  I used to be an Obagi user but now am sold on this brand of Vit C.  Try it, i know you will love it and its even the best price on the market!</li>
            <li> This is my 1st bottle, but I&#x27;m very impressed &amp; seeing results in 3 weeks. I&#x27;m 59 and I have tried so many products for age spots before, but this one I will reorder. It&#x27;s working and great ingredients, too ! I really like it !</li>
            <li> Drying, and overpriced. I will stick to using my squalene oil.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  For the last year I have had horrible dry skin with eczema on my face, this serum had an immediate positive impact on my skin.  My sister noticed right away, how smooth and even my skin tone is compared to 3 days before (before I was using the serum).  I have tried many different lotions/moisturizers but they did nothing for my extremely dry irritated skin.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Definitely give 5 star!</li>
            <li> Facial skin is radiant and smooth.  It is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a outstanding product ! I am 68 yrs old and my skin looks like late forties,early fifties. I have always tried to use the best products that I could afford and I feel that C serum 22 is at the Top of the list. My brown spots are much lighter and my skin firmer. I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to improve the quality of their skin.</li>
            <li> This works! My skin is the best it&#x27;s been in years after only one bottle</li>
            <li> Love it.. I love the fact that its not oily serum feeling. It drys very nicely. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my C Serum 22, and have had no adverse&lt;br /&gt;effects whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;After applying it each morning, my face feels tight and&lt;br /&gt;shiny, and I am noticing a reduction in the lines on my&lt;br /&gt;forehead, which is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;After I use the C Serum 22, I also apply my wonderful&lt;br /&gt;moisturizing cream on top of it so my face is moist and&lt;br /&gt;healthy looking.&lt;br /&gt;The combination is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;br /&gt;I love getting my little blue bottle out every morning and&lt;br /&gt;using my wonderful new product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more when I run low.</li>
            <li> You can really see results with this serum!  I had only been using it for about 10 days and  had been really noticing how much better my skin looked.  That was totally affirmed when on a visit to my Mom she said how great I looked and didn&#x27;t know I was using anything different on my skin.  When I told,her,  she said  it is really making a difference and now her and my sister are buying it too!</li>
            <li> The best vitamin C serum out there!! This serum makes my skin feel so soft and smooth my skin just glows! It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or irritate and I have sensitive skin. This serum will change the way your skin looks. it&#x27;s awesome and I love it!!! I will be a lifetime customer!</li>
            <li> Love this!!!!!  Love it!!! Love it!! Loveit!! Wish they sold it by the gallon.  I am over seventy it&#x27;s amazing. Wish I had it decades ago.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife but decided to try it myself and man I‚Äôm glad I did. I‚Äôm a pretty young guy but have spent a lot of time in the sun, mostly on the tennis court and wasn‚Äôt always that good about using sunscreens. In the space of 6 weeks it has evened out my skin tone, my face feels smoother and looks MUCH better. Bottom line‚Ä¶ this stuff is the real deal. I‚Äôve even told some of my buddies about it. Kinda weird for me but the mirror don‚Äôt lie :) And my wife thinks it‚Äôs the bomb too! You guys need to have an auto ship subscription option that would offer a discount and ensure we don‚Äôt run out!</li>
            <li> Loving the way this serum is absorbed into my skin so quickly. In just 10 days I have seem a &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; look to my face. Yes, I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> I am in love with this serum! noticing results was not mediate for me as some reviewers experienced so my expectations were high right away but I continued using and I am so glad I hung in there! My skin has never looked better! I have sensitive skin and would suffer occasional breakouts. Since using this my skin has never been so clear! I was always a retin A user and still broke out so I was really intrigued with vitamin C serums and stumbled upon this while browsing Amazon so I decided to give it a try, I am so glad I did. I feel this has really helped with my skin tone as well, having over 50 skin that is not even toned this is really helping to even it out. I have also noticed light lines are disappearing as well. I tend to have dry skin so I use my serum day and night and always follow up with a moisturizer once my serum has dried. It really helps my skin soak up the moisturizer resulting in moist plump skin which is what I always strive for especially as I age. I plan to be a life long user of this wonderful serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for almost a month and I have noticed that my skin does look healthier. I have had compliments that my skin looks like it is glowing. I look forward to seeing more results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve been using this bottle for three months now, so I think its about time I posted a review. My skin definitely evened out its pigmentation from acne, the pigmentation wasn&#x27;t that strong to begin with, but other products didn&#x27;t work like this one did. It also had some minor pitting which evened out also. I noticed that my skin was a lot smoother, and brighter, people really complimented me. One day I went completely without makeup and a random lady literally came up to me and said I had the best skin of anyone she had ever seen. My friends also commented that my skin was glowing. And I got the &amp;#34;oh you have perfect skin&amp;#34; compliment from many people. I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used 5 drops every morning. I didn&#x27;t use it at night. I used it before my sunblock. I am 25 years old, with generally good skin (medium to dark tan). It&#x27;s normal to combination. I bought it to address previous acne scarring on one corner of my face - the pigmentation and pitting. After using this I can go make up free and feel fine about it. This was my first vitamin c serum so I was very happy with the results. It arrived early, and the company has great customer service as well, they seem to really care. Also the price - when I bought it, was on sale. When I am older this is definitely something I would use on a regular basis. Also, I read somewhere, the glow goes away a few weeks after you stop using it. I&#x27;m not sure about it as I&#x27;m still not finished with the first bottle - almost though. But even still, it got rid of my pitting (mostly) so It think its a damn good product.</li>
            <li> Loving this serum! The main reason I bought it was to try to revive my eye area. I am a 44 year old female. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I could see results almost immediately. My puffiness has been reduced, the skin has begun to firm up and looks brighter. I will definitely order this product again!</li>
            <li> A nice, very light moisturizer.  Comfortable.  Hasn&#x27;t done anything other than moisturize.  But I like this better than creams.</li>
            <li> No miracles for seventy-fouryear old skin</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!  I have noticed the diminishing appearance of my pores, (which i wasn&#x27;t expecting)and this is huge for me. My skin does look healthier, much firmer and more youthful! I am very picky and have tried EVERYTHING. I will continue to use this product in the future! Anyone thinking about this.....do it! I noticed a difference within 5 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for creating a product that finally works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Melissa</li>
            <li> LIKE MOST OF US I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT, OR NEARLY PERFECT, ANTI-AGING PRODUCT.  I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AS CLOSE AS I&#x27;VE COME TO IT.  YOU USE THE GLASS EYE DROPPER (JUST 7 DROPS) AND IT WILL DO YOUR FACE AND NECK.  LET IT DRY AND YOUR SKIN FEELS SOFT, NOT TACKY, AND VERY SMOOTH.  I FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS TO USE IT MORNING AND EVENING AFTER WASHING YOUR FACE FAITHFULLY.  THIS IS THE MOST VITAMIN C SERUM I HAVE FOUND AT 22% ALONG WITH OTHER GREAT FREE RADICAL INGREDIENTS.  MY DAUGHTER IS A ESTHETICIAN AND I EVEN BOUGHT IT FOR HER TO TRY.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that delivers! I am 55 years old and have tried so many products to tighten,lift and smooth wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and hope to never be without it!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing serum. I&#x27;ve ordered 3 times now and have turned my mom and friends onto this great product.  My dermatologist suggested I start using a serum that includes Vitamin C.  The cost of finding one that works and that you like and doesn&#x27;t break the bank is hard.  I was so happy this serum solved all those challenges in one try.  I did venture out and use another product from another manufacturer and it was not as good and caused some break outs.  So, I quickly ordered from serumtologie again.</li>
            <li> Feels awesome.  You can feel your skin tightening.</li>
            <li> I felt my skin tightened, I use it every morning; sometimes i use vitamin e on top of the serum...makes my skin feel soft....</li>
            <li> I am a skin product addict and love receiving products in the mail and to find out how well they really work. I must say that this product does what it says it will do. The serum is light and creamy, and it adds moisture under my moisturizer that I need for my 50 year old + skin.  I can see that it is beginning to smooth the fine lines on my forehead for one and hope to see more results during the next 30 days.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging of the product - the tinted bottle is important to protect the ingredients from degrading.  I have used other C serums that have similar ingredients, but less C and cost much more.  I have used the serum for a couple of weeks now and notice that my skin feels softer.  I have one area on my jaw that has a dark spot about the size of a dime and am going to be watching that to see if it fades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to leave a positive review on all accounts of this serum :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed, after just a few applications, brighter and smoother skin.  My 17 year old daughter, who has been blessed with beautiful skin and is very particular about her own skin care, told me that I was looking &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;.....and of course, she didn&#x27;t mean I looked 30 or even 35, but that I look younger than the 48 years that I am :)  I was decidedly pleased with her comments!  My skin definitely looks better.  I have fair skin and on the sides of my neck (just under jaw on each side) I have somewhat darker looking skin.  Not extremely obvious, but kind of freckle-y looking.  Hard to describe. Probably this Arizona sun.  Anyway, that has lightened up considerably, so that‚Äôs a super plus for me.  I have combination/oily skin and I am so pleased with my skin&#x27;s response to this serum.  It actually helps with the oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my opinions and thoughts on a bit more for those of you who might be interested:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The quality of the packaging and design is exceptionally good.  The box is classy as well as the bottle label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I‚Äôm very pleased with the ingredients.  I research stuff extensively before I purchase something, and I decided on this product when I wanted to try a vitamin c serum because it seemed to have everything I was looking for in a serum AND it‚Äôs affordable and that is always an important factor to consider for me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Their customer service is outstanding.  You get the feeling that you&#x27;re personal friends with the owners because they go above and beyond to accommodate you.  Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending this product to my friends (and probably a stranger or two!)</li>
            <li> Great Product,  pleasant - fresh, feels like it tightens and skin seems to love it</li>
            <li> After applying the C serum. I would get blister on my face that would last up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product ROCKS. I LOVED it. I use it daily from one to two times a day. My skin is tighter, brighter, and smoother than ever. On top of that the company (Serumtologie) is as amazing as their product. They offer personal and thorough follow up along with great discounts. Can&#x27;t wait to use more of their products.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!, Instantly my face become clear after 2-3 applications. Skin feels healthier and much softer. I will strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve been using this serum 6-8 drops at a time, as directed, for about two weeks now, morning and evening. My skin feels more hydrated and smoother although I really can‚Äôt see any real visible changes when I look into a mirror. I like that it contains all natural and organic ingredients and that it is manufactured in the USA. I plan to continue using it and will update my review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now and have I have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was as described.  My appearance of my skin continues to improve with each use.</li>
            <li> Use this every morning and night and love it!!!! I can actually see results from this product!!! Works wonderfully!!</li>
            <li> I have used the serum for about 3 weeks now, and the other day at work a peer commented on how my face looked so smooth and soft! I had thought I noticed a changed but assumed it was the power of suggestion. I am trying to repay my skin for years of abuse and am addicted to this product already!</li>
            <li> Really works. The wrinkles under my eyes seem to diminish after use &amp; the overall appearance of my skin seems dewey &amp; youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 66 years old &amp; have complements on how great I look.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on so many positive reviews. I had used all but about a quarter of the bottle and was thinking &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34;. But, I decided to finish the bottle anyway. I was using the serum every morning and every evening.  That was when I started noticing the lines around my eyes were almost gone. The deeper crows feet were of course still there, but the finer lines were practically gone. I ordered another bottle and I&#x27;ll follow up with another review when I have finished the second bottle.</li>
            <li> I live in a city where we get Santa Ana winds all year round.  On top of that my skin is naturally dry.  I was impressed by all the reviews on this product and decided to try it.  It lived up to my expectations! My skin feels more hydrated and appears &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; without feeling greasy.  My skin also feels taught and fresh. Thank you very much for keeping price reasonable so this product can be easy accessible!  I will definitely be purchasing again... and again.</li>
            <li> Love it. Give it some time before it starts to work. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m distribution of cosmetics and my customers in Indonesia fits serumtologie products and they are very satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> The serum is easy to use. My face tends to be oily so it is so nice that this product soaks in very well leaving a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see the effects, but will continue to use it.  It got rave reviews, so it is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I used this for almost a month and didn&#x27;t see any improvement in lines, wrinkles or hydration.  I stopped when my skin started getting red and irritated.  I do have sensitive skin and Vitamin C is ascorbic acid so maybe I should have known.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product on another website and loved it, was thrilled to see if offered by Amazon.  I use this product every morning and evening, a little goes a long way.  My skin has a more even tone and feels wonderful.  This product goes on feeling very light leaving my skin feeling very soft and hydrated.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Spectacular results in only days... I&#x27;ve tried the big name brands for anti-aging and S22 is superior to anything I have seen.  Feels like I have anti-aged my wrinkles under my eyes and on my face by years in a few weeks.  Definitely recommend S22 and very happy customer here.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Absorbs quickly. Light weight without a greasy feel. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love it. It works wonders on wrinkles..</li>
            <li> Purchased this serum on my bf&#x27;s account (Amazon Prime, hello!). I am 23yo with oily, acne-prone skin. I have been using Retin-A 0.04% for almost a year now and it significantly improved my skin. Of course, I would still get my occasional breakout. I have been left with numerous pigmented acne scars and although it takes time for them to lighten, I haven&#x27;t found a product that would help speed up the process. I knew I needed a good vitamin C serum to do the job. I always came across this one but I was reluctant. After a few months and after being convinced w/ the positive reviews, I gave in and purchased the serum, eye gel &amp; moisturizer. After 2 weeks of using all 3 in conjunction with my retin-a at night, I have noticed my skin smoother, brighter and surprisingly, I have NOT broken out. Not once. (I have 2 breakouts at the moment because of 2 pesky blackheads that were getting on my nerves. My fault). The serum absorbs beautifully onto the skin - no oily residue. The moisturizer as well. The eye gel feels somewhat of a hot/cooling sensation and tightens up as it dries - good sign. Overall very satisfied with these products. Waiting for these few pigmented acne scars to go away.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  It seems like it is helping my skin, wrinkles look smoother and face looks younger.  Worked for me.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3d bottle of the serum. I really like the product and I am using it religiously. I am over 50 years old. The results are very good. My skin is looking better without any allergies what I usually get. I have no additional suggestions for the product. I recommended the product to many friends. Customer service is very good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A.P.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of anti aging and wrinkle products This product far surpasses them all&lt;br /&gt;It just goes to prove that Quality of a product does NOT necessarily coincide with price</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell any change in wrinkles or skin tone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my second bottle of this serum. I&#x27;ve tried several &#x27;C-E-Ferulic&#x27; products from various companies and find the combo particularly effective for my skin, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new providers.  The formulations from each of the various makers seem similar, but I find the texture of the C serum 22 from Serumtologie to be superior to other brands--it has a slightly different viscosity (slightly thicker, less watery/oily) so I find it applies more evenly and easily on my face and neck. The product also seems very pristine/fresh and appears to have a very good &#x27;shelf life&#x27;--no perceptible yellowing/degradation of the formulation from the first to the last drops!</li>
            <li> I like this product and have purchased it before.  The seller is very good also.</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  As I have gotten older I have noticed that my skin just looks older - not necessarily lots of wrinkles, but it is just not looking as refreshed.  So when I heard about this serum, I thought I would give it a try.  Well, I am glad I heard about it!  I have been using it for several weeks now and my skin is looking so much better!  I had some marks on my face that are almost gone now - I will be continuing to use this and it will be fun to see the effects in time.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but the first time I applied it my face felt very soft and hydrated.  I&#x27;m sure I will be a long time user merely because it makes my face feel good.  I am an older woman so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles.  I will follow-up after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have only started using this C serum for a little more than a week, however I completely love the texture (non-greasy formula that drys quickly, however does not irritate or dry the skin as some serums do). My skin is definitely showing signs of improvement (softer, brighter, more even skin tone). I rated it a 4 star only because I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it for very long. Will purchase it again -</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other brands that irritate my skin or just plain don‚Äôt work. This one felt different the moment I put it on. No greasy, tingly feeling or hurting my eyes. I am so happy to have found this brand on Amazon! Five stars well deserved</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month. It has smooth out my wrinkles will try it for one more month,,and see if I have more results.</li>
            <li> how does this product have so many stars and rave reviews?  After using an entire bottle, I see no difference on my skin.  I&#x27;d suggest skinceutical ferulic (sp?) serum which provided me with short and long term results.  Beware that product is mucho expensive which is why I purchased this one--hoping that I could get results with a less expensive product (an ongoing quest) but alas, it felt like a placebo serum.  Not good or bad.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I only wish I would have taken before and after photos.  It keeps my fine lines practically unnoticed while my skin looks nourished and younger.  I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Best vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I wanted spectacular and I got so so.  I don&#x27;t really know what this is supposed to do, but I didn&#x27;t get the jolt on this one.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best - I have been using for a few weeks now and my face is looking better than ever.  It takes very little and is easy to apply I use both morning and evening - I can notice a great degree of improvement - both in wrinkles and texture also age spots are less noticeable.  Thanks for a great product!  Your company is doing a great job in offering this product and you are easy to contact and actually get a reply!</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel great, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown skin &amp; get really bad hyperpigmentation right across my nose during the summer due to a faint birthmark that basically burns badly over the summer. I tried Skinceuticals Pigment Corrector 1st. It is expensive. I tried it for a month and only saw a slight improvement. Since i didnt get good results I researched again and found Serumtologie. I have been using it for a few weeks and see a huge improvement. So I have found...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serumtologie is cheaper and more effective. You see results quicker vs Skineuticals which is way more expensive and doesnt work quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serumtologie keeps hyperpigmentation at bay. I have been in the sun with SPF and didnt get hyperpigmented immediatley after sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serumtologie is hydrating and really improved the texture of my hyperpigmented skin and made surrounding normal skin look and feel even better vs Skinceuticals cream which felt a bit drying and didnt improve skin texture for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, for me, Serumtologie wins for hyperpigmentation and overall skin improvement vs Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> Do I LOVE  C  serum 22 ? yes !&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much that I just ordered 3 more bottles from&lt;br /&gt;amazon ! One for home , one for travel , and one spare ! I noticed a&lt;br /&gt;difference the first week . Softer, brighter skin and it healed the&lt;br /&gt;redness around my runny nose from the cold weather ! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my&lt;br /&gt;imagination because at a recent family event my Brother in law said .. You&lt;br /&gt;look great .. And he has a professional eye because he  is a specialist in&lt;br /&gt;Botox injections ( which I have never had ) . This product is better than&lt;br /&gt;La Mer ( at $300) or Dr Macrene( at $200+) cream .&lt;br /&gt;I love the packaging . It&#x27;s clean looking and I like the eye dropper&lt;br /&gt;approach . You have a great product . But if I hadn&#x27;t read reviews on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon I would never know about it. Its not expensive and it really works</li>
            <li> This product is okay but way too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> This serum works very well on my mom&#x27;s face. She loves it.very moisture but not oily</li>
            <li> Up to using once daily each day believe I&#x27;m seeing brighter skin.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this product and I will continue to use it. It has made a major improvement in the texture of my facial skin. I have started using it on the back of my hands and notice they are already softer. I have used many products and of all this has had the most positive results</li>
            <li> I love this serum. The fact that this serum is all natural and organic is a big plus  for me. As a cancer survivor I am very concerned about what skin products I use. The Combination of ingredients are wonderful. I also was surprised to receive an e mail from Vanessa the co founder regarding how I liked the serum. No doubt in my mind I will order again and again. I buy a lot from Amazon. There a great company.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for three weeks and have not noticed any difference in my skin as yet.  Maybe I got a bad bottle?  Maybe heat or air interferes with it&#x27;s effectiveness?  I will give it more time and hopefully I will notice something.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product. It has improved my dark circles and I don&#x27;t have to use coverup any more. I can see a brighter complexion. I gave it  4 stars because this is a work in progress for a 60 year old.  I am anxious to see how much younger I look in 6 months.</li>
            <li> I started using this and another product at the same time. I have had significant pore reduction. I use this as my sole moisturizer in the morning because my face tends to get very oily within a couple of hours. This serum has worked very well for that. Skin is softer and moisturized, but oil free!</li>
            <li> Serumtologie C-22 made a difference in my skin after one week. You can really feel and see it working as it blends in very quick. It seems to work even better when the face is damp &amp; moist after you clean it. So far so good on the results. It has natural organic ingredients which are very important to me, except for one preservative, Phenoxyethanol, which is a moderate concern but they use the lowest percentage amount they can to make it effective, one of the very last ingredients listed. I do understand that a preservative is very much needed in skin care products to kill any bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;I had a great email conversation back and forth with one of the co-founders Vanessa, she is very concerned about the customers welfare and very helpful with any questions about their products. They are still trying to find ways to make it more natural and organic. It&#x27;s rare to have that kind of response in companies now a days.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s higher in vitamin C - 22% than any other similiar products which helps heal the skin. I would recommend this product for your skin as long as you are comfortable with the low percentage of preservative in C-22. Vanessa had mentioned they have tried many other preservatives but haven&#x27;t found one as yet that works well to kill bacteria. I have research many similar products and so far I am  comfortable and pleased with this one,  and happy to know that if you have any concerns they will email you back right away!</li>
            <li> I could not believe how this made my face feel.  It is really amazing.  Works great after first day.</li>
            <li> I love vitamin c serums. They make my skin super hydrated and feeling extemely soft. This one is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far so I&#x27;ll continue repurchasing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for THEE VERY BEST vitamin c serum and all I read is that it&#x27;s one of the best if not THEE best on the Internet. It has 22% Vit C. That&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve seen in the serum. It&#x27;s expensive but I use it liberally and it lasted 6 weeks. I&#x27;m willing to spend a few more bucks to hold on to my youth just a little longer. I was going to get botox before and I&#x27;ve put it off the last few months because it has really softened my forehead wrinkles. I SWEAR I&#x27;m telling the truth and I rarely believe these kind of reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used many c serums that usually &amp;#34;go bad&amp;#34; after a certain amount of time.  I find this combination gives better results than just plain c serum.  My skin is smoother, has a healthy glow and looks better than ever.  Also my skin tone is brighter.  I have only been using this product for a week and love the results.  Will definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Meh. I guess I&#x27;m looking for a miracle. This wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for a long time, but from what I can tell so, this is really making a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, my skin felt softer hit no improved difference</li>
            <li> Seems to be a thicker consistency; more like I am used to.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my face!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anybody - I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and often refer people to products - I try them first - this is not one I would refer.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning before putting on my SPF 30 moisturizer.  I&#x27;m a 52 year old nurse and I&#x27;ve had so many patients think I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s that you know this stuff is working!</li>
            <li> Results are already noticeable!!!! Loving this product and will keep buying again and again.  My skin feels absolutely soft and I feel s major difference.  I also had a major wrinkle between my eyebrows and it looks like it&#x27;s been fading away!!! Love this product so glad I read all the great reviews because it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum about 2 weeks ago and loved it the first day i used, skin really really gets super hidratated and soft, i wish i had it before like when i was 25 to avoid damage on my skin (29now) it really helps and wont promote acne wich was my consern because i have oily skin and suffered acne before..even my scars look better now! I know dark spots its not the main function of this product but I does help with that too! On top of that I want to tank the customer service they have because they really care about their customers. Thank u!</li>
            <li> I used vitamin C serum from Skinceuticals and Biopeutics in the past, both worked well for me but they are pricey.  So I wanted to give Serum 22 a try since it is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the bottle, I noticed that the color and feel of the serum is very different but the smell is quite similar.&lt;br /&gt;After 7 days of use, I do not see improvement on my skin, in fact, it dried out my skin.  I need to return it.  Can someone tell me how to do so?</li>
            <li> Wow, if you want to get taken again, order this, bad. Nothing is true regarding this product. It is drying and itches, nothing soothing about it. I threw away the packaging and am stuck with it. It also came with crusty stuff around the rim, I think it was used. I have been happy with other products, not this</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C serums in the past and this was not what i expected it to be.  Not a fan :(</li>
            <li> Will continue to use product and hope for continued positive results. Very pleased with product, but have to learn to be patient. Works well and will continue to apply.</li>
            <li> Great product so far!  I have been using this serum for a week and I really love the way it makes my skin feel.  I can tell it is providing extra moisture and tightening my skin.  Can&#x27;t wait to watch the results continue.</li>
            <li> Received this product by mistake actually.  However, the company issued a refund but asked me to keep it and perhaps give it a try.  Of course, I did.  I am pleased with the serum.  It is definitely plumping up my skin cells and giving a smoother texture.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I never actually used a serum before but I read in an article that for my age (I&#x27;m in my early 30s), the best thing would be a Vitamin C serum. Tempted by fact that this serum has the highest percentage of Vitamin C in any available product on the market, great reviews and a discount code I had, I just had to try it. My skin has improved a lot since I started using it, it has an even tone and even a glow! I still don&#x27;t have wrinkles but the fine lines around my eyes seem less visible. I will continue to use it to prevent wrinkles and give my face a very nice boost! The seller was great and I received my order very quickly. Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> A bit too early to tell...only started using is 3 days ago (when my C-Ferulic ran out!)  I hope it does as good a job as that did1&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.....</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of these serums that include Vitamin C &amp; Hyaluronic together to see what the difference is....This is the one that feels the best on my face and also the one that I have gotten the most results from.  My face definitly feels a lot softer and my complexion is really got its glow on with this product.  I love it! It  is so much more affordable than the serum that I purchased in a retail store ($130)  and works even better. Out of all the ones I tried on the Amazon web site,  this one is a keeper and the one I will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> In the week I&#x27;ve used it, I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my skin. So much softer now. Go glad I added this to my nightly routine!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;Before I started my forehead was always dry and my wrinkles around my eyes were so bad people were asking if I felt good and I looked like I&#x27;d been working too much. Harsh wake up call...so I found this product online and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKED for:&lt;br /&gt;-lines by eyes and forehead&lt;br /&gt;-smile lines&lt;br /&gt;-neck (signs of aging)&lt;br /&gt;-speeds healing of insect bites overnight (on my neck and leg!)&lt;br /&gt;- helps hydrate the top of my hands&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try it on my elbows next.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter tried it for a week because at 26 yrs she began getting lines on her forehead. The lines were gone in a couple weeks. I then had to buy another bottle for me because she loved it so much! It&#x27;s worth the money. I add a couple drops in my makeup. I recently also had one of those face scans to see how hydrated your skin is. Ten people in front of me had horrible results and they were at least 15 years younger. I got up there and they didn&#x27;t see any problems so they borrowed another photo to show me! So, I know this is helping hydration and I have scientific proof.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this serum! My skin looks and feels better than ever. My pores appear smaller and darker spots have faded. What a great price too!  My skin looked and felt different within the first week. I&#x27;ve already ordered another bottle!</li>
            <li> First off, I love this product and it&#x27;s become my holy grail! Those who is having 2nd thoughts, stop &amp; order this! You will waste so much more over on over the counter products that aren&#x27;t nearly as affective and natural as this! My skin has become so supple and radient, thanks to this product :)</li>
            <li> After three weeks my skin is so much softer and looks healthier.  My 66 year old skin has noticed diminishing lines around my mouth.  The lines around my eyes look so much better than before.  I have already ordered my second bottle and will receive another bottle as a part of  a promotion for writing this review.  I recommend this product and hope that if you order a bottle your results are as good as mine.</li>
            <li> i feel is okay but nothing amazing and the price is way hight but it does last a little bit since is only on your face but still expensive for my taste</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and my skin tone is showing improvement. Will update when I see more results , as I haven&#x27;t been using it for too long.</li>
            <li> Wonderful skincare product!! Worth it. My skin feels and looks better!</li>
            <li> For the first time I do notice a difference in my skin.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent. You can use it under your moisturizer cream and make up.&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent</li>
            <li> I am seeing immediate results, my skin looks great and so tight</li>
            <li> my skin, bad reatioin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.  The serum feels light on the skin and it&#x27;s absorbed quickly.  I don&#x27;t even have to use a moisturizer.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am hoping this serum delivers, although it has only been a few weeks since I started using it. It goes on nicely and is well absorbed. I apply 4-5 drops al over my face 2x/day (am and pm) and I hope my skin is reaping the benefits. Plumper and more nourished... Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I like it. So far seems to work well. 4 stars until I have used it for a month. I have used it for a week.</li>
            <li> so I took a while to post a review because I wanted to give my honest good opinion and with facial things you cant see it in one day.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, it does what it promise</li>
            <li> Nothing works in mins or overnight, but this I have noticed the last few days has began tightening the skin around my eyes and jaw.  Hoping for no more sagging.  I feel better and that&#x27;s most important! Second is that I see the results and it is taking a little time but it is worth it to me to have that healthy younger looking and feeling skin.  Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful and their customer service is awesome!! My initial shipment had a slight problem (not enough for me to contact them to replace the product or get a refund), however, they did both and gave me a full size of their wonderful cream as well.  I know I will be a customer for life !  Thank you for your sincere service and fantastic products.</li>
            <li> The is such a great serum.  It&#x27;s expensive if you are paying regular price but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I don‚Äôt know a lot about these types of products, so I can‚Äôt say whether 22 percent C serum makes a big difference from the 20 percent or less but my wife has tried this and these are her observations of the product.  She says it makes her skin glow and her skin feels nicely refreshed and hydrated and that it helped with her overall skin appearance.  The one thing she likes best about it is that it doesn‚Äôt have a bad odor like some brands of C serum.  It does not irritate or dry out her skin but she does not have sensitive skin with these types of products.  Overall she is satisfied with the product but final results will be updated over the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My skin feels so soft and it looks healthier!  It has a glow to it!  I would definately recommend this product!  Still waiting to see if it lessens the wrinkles.....</li>
            <li> I like this one better than Dr. Oz&#x27;s serum.  So far so good in terms of applicability and freshness to the face.</li>
            <li> Worked great at first, but haven&#x27;t seen any progress since then, but no regression either :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is just so nice.&lt;br /&gt;it does not burn or feels tight but you see a firm skin.</li>
            <li> The serum is deceptive, in that it looks like water. So when the directions said 5-7 drops I doubted that would be enough. But it is, because the liquid is thick and rich-feeling, going on easily. I only have two area I&#x27;m concerned about: one is my forehead and the other is under my eyes because my cheekbones have been a bit &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34;. After only one week my cheekbones are noticeably tighter which is really encouraging. It hasn&#x27;t been enough time, yet, to see much difference on my forehead but I&#x27;m motivated by these results to continue until the bottle is empty. Hopefully, my forehead will look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: this horrible stuff caused my face to literally break out in sores, turn red and become puffy. And yes, Ii&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of this product because it started about two weeks after I began using it (and it had never happened before) and quit almost immediately when I threw the damn stuff in the trash. Horrible!</li>
            <li> Love the way it easily absorbs into my skin.  People have commented on how my skin glows!  I see a visible difference in the small lines and wrinkles around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> have used this serum for about two weeks now. Mostly I like that this product helps to hydrate my skin as well as anti-aging properties. Have noticed that my skin is much more hydrated, and use less moisturizer. This serum absorbs quickly, and it has no smell. Like that it does not feel sticky or tacky. I use this twice a day on clean, slightly damp skin. Did notice that it&#x27;s helped with some of the flakiness on my forehead. I do like this product, but think it&#x27;s price point could be lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a reduced price for review.</li>
            <li> Already seeing improvement in my skin. Have tried many vit. C products with very bad reactions. Not with this product!! Soaks into skin quickly with a good results. I am very pleased. Finally a product that is good for my skin. At 68 yrs. young I want to age with beautiful skin, not skin that is shot up and looks fake. I will continue using this product and I hope that it continues to be marketed at a reasonable price! I also feel this company cares about it&#x27;s product and those who use it. Out of kindness I am receiving more of C22 on a promotion for giving an honest opinion of this product.</li>
            <li> I so appreciate that this is a serum since I just don&#x27;t react well to creams/oils.  The texture is lovely and after about a week of using it only once a day (with no other &amp;#34;leave-on&amp;#34; products) this serum has made my skin super smooth and much more even-toned - a tremendous help with the grey/shadowy look that I was left with after cancer treatments a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in the fine lines around my mouth and an overall glow since I started using this product.  A little goes a long way.  The customer service has been stellar...fast shipping and follow-up to make sure I was happy with the product/service.  And that is a definite yes!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WOW!  I am sold.  I am a pretty firm Paula&#x27;s Choice buyer because her products work.  Compared to Paula&#x27;s Choice C15 booster this one wins hands down.  I noticed in one night the difference between the products.  Thank you for your potent serum. I will repurchase!</li>
            <li> I love serumtologie Vitamin C serum. My skin is softer and amazingly fine line and wrinkles are beginning to disappear. The product goes on smoothly and my skin absorbs it wonderfully. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I do not see any difference my face still seem looks&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I need to use more 2 or 3 month and then results comi ng I don&#x27;t see anything right now Just spend money only üòÇüò¢</li>
            <li> This is the first product review I have ever done. This is hands down the most amazing product I have ever used on my middle aged, sun damaged, acne scarred skin. Love it!!!! Amazing results in less than a week of use.</li>
            <li> As a guy I bought this because I wanted something that would be good for my skin but was not pore clogging. I am young and don‚Äôt have any real wrinkles yet but am prone to the occasional breakout. I wanted something that would both make my skin look and feel better. C22 delivers on both counts. As a rule I read a lot more reviews than I write but this product is so good I felt I needed to share my feedback. I respect the science behind the formulation and found that it works in real life application. My girlfriend seems to think so too as I caught her using it the other day :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I gave it 5 Stars because it is a winner!  I saw a difference immediately and have been using it for a few months.  I&#x27;m seeing that the texture and appearance of the skin it is improving more and more over time.  It really has made a big difference in the moisture that is retained in the skin.  There was dryness and some fine lines but that has basically disappeared, this is like a Jeanie in a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with the ‚Äú100 Pure Hyaluroinc Acid Serum Acid‚Äù, ‚ÄúAvalon Organics‚Äù - Vitamin C renewal moisturizing skin cr&amp;egrave;me and I also take some collagen/hyaluroinc acid - advanced formula, type 1,2 &amp; 3 supplements by ‚Äúyoutheory‚Äù that work from within, this combination has really worked extremely well for me.  I believe that the natural way to maintain beauty is always the best way, and it really works.  You must give this a try first before you start trying to do other things that cost more, like going to a plastic surgeon, etc., which may not then be necessary.  This product is a bit pricey but since a little goes a long way it is much more cost effective than you would think.  At the rate I&#x27;m going, I think my bottle will last me about 5 - 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you may find after using this product, that the fix was more simple than you ever thought it could be to regain the youthful element and appearance of beautiful skin, I recommend this product highly!  I already look so much younger, thank-you Serumtologie!</li>
            <li> Absolutely no change in my skin.  I still have dark spots they didn&#x27;t fade at all and I didn&#x27;t notice any change in fine lines.  It&#x27;s been over a month.  Very disappointed</li>
            <li> After using for two weeks I was complimented on how smooth my skin looked. My skin feels very soft and hydrated. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Have ordered twice. Does exactly as it states! Will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;K.S</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping, but is a very gradual change.  I have purchased three times, and notice softer skin.  Will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am seeing improvement in my skin and the age spots are getting lighter.  I like your products  Thank you  MB</li>
            <li> Great product.... Have been using Obagi ,but this seems to work just as well for a lot less. I am 71 years old and have been a Obagi user for years. Order it, you will see the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and great customer service.  I&#x27;ve been using for about a week now and seems nice but need to give it more time to see results.</li>
            <li> great...just great.  i have been using this moisturizer for nearly two weeks and i have really seen quite an improvement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to give this product a poor review.  I have been using this faithfully for about a month now.  To be honest I have not seen any difference in my skin.  We are our own worst critics and people have typically guessed my age 10 years younger than I am beforehand.  I have not used any other vitamin C product prior to this.  I ordered two bottles of this and received them in a reasonable amount of time considering they were on backorder.  I will continue to use all the product I purchased but, unlike some other reviews no one seems to notice a difference nor do I.  I will give more time and then update this review. Using simple olive oil on my skin at night seems to make a wonderful difference in my skin and it is quite inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical, but lo and behold, this product is working for me!  I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about seven weeks. My skin has a nice glow and the texture is much better - pores smaller, etc.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that fine lines are decreasing and the brown spots from too much sun over the years are almost gone. I use this product both morning and evening.  In the evening I use the serum first, and then add a retinol cream and massage it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, the company has contacted me a few times by email to see how the product is working and to answer any questions.  I contacted them about using the retinol cream and the serum together and they assured me that it would be a good combination as the serum would act as a &amp;#34;delivery device&amp;#34; for the retinol cream.  I&#x27;ll be ordering my next bottle soon.  Give it a try -- I think you&#x27;ll be pleased!</li>
            <li> I might not be your ideal candidate but will still try to give the  feedback on what I have experienced.  I am in my early 30s with a pretty active/healthy lifestyle. So, I don&#x27;t  have any age spots yet (I think :P) but I do have some lines at the corners  of eyes. I thought I should start using a product now that will provide extra  nutrition to my facial skin and might help in long term.  So, I ordered the first bottle of this serum back in June. Since I ordered  the second one recently, I should say that I am not disappointed with  the results. Probably, I see some sort of radiance so thought of continuing. Also, the  price is very reasonable. However, I did notice that both the color and texture were slightly different in my two orders.  The manufacturer told that since this serum is derived from natural sources, some variation is expected.  There are no side effects so far. As such, I am giving it 5 stars and will probably continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see the results as it is definley taking longer than hoped for.</li>
            <li> I have been using a C product for several years at the urging of my dermatologist.  This was suggested to help reverse the effects of my sun damage and/or slow down (or what I call -hold at bay) the aging factor.  Since there was no financial motive from my doctor, I know  this is a good idea whether I see &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; results or not.  It&#x27;s still doing something!  When i saw the serumtologie I decided to give it a try, mainly because it has the C listed at 22% vs. the 20 that I was currently using.  The things I like about it: 1.  it doesn&#x27;t stink!  It might sound silly but I really dislike smelly products on my face. 2. The absorption rate is perfect.  I was worried that it would be watery and splat all over the place, it does not. 3. the dropper gives perfect control and it sounds weird, but a drop really will cover about half your face (unless you have a huge head I guess) ;)  4. My skin did not react and have that tight, itchy sore feeling. 5. the price.  Believe me, I&#x27;ve been there, done that, bought the t-shirt and wore it out on expensive products.  This is reasonable for this type product and i will continue to use it.  Would I recommend it?  Absolutely</li>
            <li> I love it, I really see the difference in my skin, it&#x27;s softer and the fine lines are minimized.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, it does not seem to be doing anything for my skin....sorry however  I will keep using in hopes of it helping.</li>
            <li> I love C serum 22 anti-aging serum by serumtologie. Love the way the serum feels going on, smooth and soft. As it dries, I can feel a firming of my skin. I noticed a softening of the fine lines around my eyes and my mouth within 2 weeks. Lines &amp; wrinkles are less noticeable!  C serum 22 has improved the tone, appearance and feel of my skin. I give this product 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I just received my second bottle of this serum and am on my way to order a third bottle to give you my sister..  Obviously I like it a lot since I&#x27;m continuing to reorder.  I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the sun damage/wrinkles on my face and neck.  The price can&#x27;t be beat.  Compare the ingredients to similar serum products and you will see that this is the best product for the price.  I know I want to use a serum as part of my daily skin care and have been so happy with the results I am experiencing with Serumtologie C Serum 22.</li>
            <li> sorry, I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> It surprised and exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ll order again</li>
            <li> I tried number of vitamin c serum, Hyaluronic acids, &amp; anti wrinkle face creams. But I never ever made a second purchase coz, frankly they didn&#x27;t do much difference to my skin. I have chance upon a blog that mentioned 5% Hyaluronic acid, only then did I realized Maybe I have been buying these Hyaluronic acids which claims to be pure or 100% but then why don&#x27;t I see any real effects? Finally my long search is over when I found the only brand Serumtologie C serum which has the 5% hyaluronic content. I&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it for four days but when I visited my dermatologist, she commented on my radiant &amp; poreless face. Whew! that was a first compliment I ever got from my derma which I go to almost every month. I specially love it&#x27;s gel base coz it doesn&#x27;t drip and gets absorbed easily . After years of buying online, this is my very first time to write a review. I am really very happy with the effectiveness of this serum .</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I am 60 yrs old.  Have tried all the high end products, Institute Esterderm, Skin Medica,  etc.  Serums are the most powerful , and finally this serum has the essence of Vit C.  What our skin needs.  This is a wonderful product.  You will see results in 2 weeks as promised.  I am a lifer!</li>
            <li> Great Vit. C.  I use this with other serums, VoilaVe and/or Protoxyn, so hard to tell which is better. My skin has been looking much better.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different Vitamin C serums ( including OZ Naturals and Cosmetic Skin Solutions) and have just recently found that this product seems to be the most effective for me. I love the consistency and feel of this serum, especially compared to the very watery consistencies of the previously mentioned products. I keep it in the refrigerator because my experience with the previous products was that they seemed to go bad very quickly. I have had this one for just over a month (using it night and morning) and it seems to still be viable meaning it hasn&#x27;t changed colors and no odor whatsoever. I will continue to purchase Serumtologie due to my extreme satisfaction with the results. I&#x27;m 56 years old and often get positive comments about my skin. Of course eating well and exercising are likely aiding in blood flow and better skin along with my skin regimen!   **UPDATE since my last review:  I am still am completely in love with Serumologie Vit C 22 and have not found any other product to be of the great consistent quality as Serumtologie. I now apply OZ Naturals Hyaluronic Serum to my skin regimen AFTER using Serumtologie C. Even tho OZ states there is Vitamin C in their product I don&#x27;t feel there is enough to really give anywhere near the full benefit of Serumtologie.  I want to point out that Serumtologie C is a different form of Vitamin C which I have found to be more stable and doesn&#x27;t go bad in a month like the others I&#x27;ve tried in the past! NOTE: I keep my serums in the refrigerator for storage.</li>
            <li> I  love how this makes my skin look. I use it every night and every morning. It is great under makeup. My skin is smother and less lines !  I love it ! I have found a new line of skincare !!</li>
            <li> I am 100% hooked on this product! I use it every morning and night and have noticed major improvements in my skin.  I have even stopped using make up, which is huge because I have gone through life with very troubled skin.  I especially love that no animal testing was done to create this product. Keep up the awesome work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion in return for my candid feedback.</li>
            <li> LOVE. Instant result- lines less noticeable. Feels lovely too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m hallucinating or if this serum really works. I&#x27;m quite skeptical when it comes to beauty products my my skin did start looking tighter rather quickly. I&#x27;ll have to update my review after a couple months of use. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Using it for about 1 months and loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this serum, and it seems to be working very well for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.... Have been using Obagi ,but this seems to work just as well for a lot less. I am 71 years old and have been a Obagi user for years. Order it, you will see the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for 5 days, but am noticing a change around my eye area.  I am exited to continue this product and see what it can do in 30 days.</li>
            <li> I like the way this is easy to apply and not too runny.  It is more of a gel like consistency which makes it more user friendly for me.  Really like this brand of vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not see a noticeable change in my skin.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so it may work for some but not others.  It may be that I needed to use it for a longer period of time but just never got around to ordering more.</li>
            <li> After only a few days of using 22% vitamin C serum my skin is glowing--my skin looks bright and hydrated--a gift for a mom over 40 with two young kids... People have been commenting on my glow--asking if I&#x27;ve had any spa treatments--no need--this product totally rocks--I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
            <li> I have tried to use other similar products that are less costly and I have to admit that I went back to your product because those other products don&#x27;t compare! The C serum 22 is by far a better product and you see the results. I wish I could  get maybe a larger bottle that would be more cost affective. Maybe you can think about it.  thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, I&#x27;m more of a review reader. On this product, I had to leave a review because when I first decided to purchase I was skeptical. In general, there are plenty of C-Serum products on the market. I haven&#x27;t tried any others because after the first bottle, I turned from a skeptic into happy customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product performs as explained. I&#x27;m sure there will be varying results on the anti-aging properties, so I won&#x27;t go into whether that works or not. As for the feel, oil-management, and natural skin calming properties, this product does the job well. It helps to manage oily skin, soothe redness, and give you a hydration that can help dry/flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products on Amazon can probably offer similar results, though the customer service and personal touch I received from Serumtologie definitely sets them apart. I recommend it for men who want hydration without the greasy moisturizers that are branded with luxury names that cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> It is not working!!Makes the skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is on the delicate side (to be expected after 55+ years on the planet) and C serum 22 is gentle and soothing. It cannot do plastic surgery obviously but does keep my skin smooth and young looking with fine lines virtually not visible. I&#x27;m still working on the deeper lines but they are not as bad as when I started and this is the results of only the first bottle. This is a product that will l keep using.</li>
            <li> My wife asked me to place an order for this product for her.  She hates it.  It has broken her out with whiteheads all over her checks.  At first she thought it was just a fluke and kept using the product but it has gotten worse.  She has large acne all over her checks now.  She has now stopped using it and hopes her face clears up.  She has not seen any difference in the appearance of her skin either.  She asked me to write this review as she dictated her experience to me.  Save your money.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I have spent $$$$ yes in the thousands on face products and was going to purchase the NAME BRAND with the high price tag &amp; then looked at ingredients AND THEY WERE THE SAME!! Does what it claims! I am almost 50 &amp; used app &amp;#34;HOW OLD.COM&amp;#34; pic stared I was 28!! Will purchase again &amp; again!! Why pay for a NAME when ingredients are what really matters?!?! I won&#x27;t </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this serum. I have used many other serums from high end to boutique serums. First, I appreciate the packaging of the serum in a light protective bottle. The serum is light yet, substantial. It goes on smoothly and you immediately feel a firming. The serum works well with other products including sunscreen and makeup. I use powder and am pleased with the effect. I am on my second bottle and writing this review as part of a promotional offer, but I plan to continue using this serum. The ingredients included are those I want to use and those recommended by skin care experts.  The amount of each ingredient has been perfectly balanced for me to in order to improve my skin, but not irritate it. My skin is responding with better clarity and is less blotchy.</li>
            <li> Very Nice serum. Works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Serumtologie C serum 22 for about three weeks now and I can already see a noticeable difference in my skin.  My skin feels softer, and looks fuller, making fine lines disappear.  I also have been using it on my neck and chest and I really like what I am seeing in the mirror.</li>
            <li> i love it, It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Even though I have very sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t trigger make my skin irritation or any trouble and it also make the skin bright.</li>
            <li> I do not see any difference</li>
            <li> So far I really like the product. from Chris Goodman</li>
            <li> I have been using a vitamin C product for many years - Skin by Ann Webb Vitamin C Serum. While I was happy with that product, I explored this serum which has more vitamin C and hylauronic acid. I just don&#x27;t like the feel on my skin. The Ann Webb serum goes on like a very light oil and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling great. This product is tacky and leaves my skin feeling tight, as though the product did not get absorbed. It&#x27;s effectiveness is hard to determine since I was already using vitamin C, however, I will be going back to Ann Webb as soon as I finish this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used obagi C 20 percent for 2 years and this was rated the best so I tried it. Maybe so for some but they haven&#x27;t used obagi. Obagi is the best hands down. This for me is very drying and obagi you notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> This serum soaks in really quickly. I find it does leave a strange film on my skin, most notably around my eyebrows. It definitely needs a moisturizer over it, which is how I intended to use it anyway. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using serumtologie C serum 22 for the last number of weeks. I purchased it through Amazon after reading positive reviews. I was at the Chanel counter in a major department store and the saleswoman said my skin looked &#x27;amazing&#x27;... I certainly have not heard that before! I had no irritation, and have very fair and dry skin. I was even contacted by one of the co-founders of this product personally to ask how I liked it. I generally do not leave feedback but felt this was a good product worth talking about. I have tried many different facial products over the years, and find that with this serum my skin does feel brighter, and it is a great value. She kindly offered me tips on how best to use C serum 22, recommendations on a good moisturizer and a reduction on my next purchase (which I have just ordered), simply for sharing a candid review. In this day and age, personal passion and outreach are special. I am impressed all around...great product and great people! I will certainly be purchasing more from serumtologie!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results and will continue to use the product. I&#x27;ve used the serum for about three months  Some of my finer wrinkles smoothed out and blemishes scars were reduced. What amazed me the most, my acne has cleared up.  I still have some deep wrinkles however I am 60 years old.</li>
            <li> Serumtologie&#x27;s vitamin C serum is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. My first impressions: A+ Packaging - check, Safety Sealed - check, Dark Bottle (to keep vitamin C from oxidizing) - check. Now about the serum ... product has a rich, thick consistency and glides on smoothly. Absorbs fast and instantly leaves my skin feeling tighter and noticeably more firm. 4-5 drops is all it takes ... I&#x27;ve been using it morning an night for about a month and still have a third or the bottle left. Overall my skin looks and feels smooth and more refined. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it works, haven&#x27; seen any results</li>
            <li> Great product, using it everyday.</li>
            <li> This product has improved my complexion in just 2 weeks. I will be reordering it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the possible effects of this serum, but I decided to try it after I&#x27;d heard and read so much about Vitamin C being very good for refining the skin surface. I&#x27;ve used it now for about a month, and am very happy to report that yes, it does work. I have had a couple of compliments already on how good my skin looks (and I am 60. Freaking. Years. Old.). While it hasn&#x27;t done much for the couple of laugh lines I have, it has smoothed them out just the tiniest bit, and the general texture and &#x27;look&#x27; of my skin is smoother. The elasticity of my skin seems to have improved. Even on my throat and jawline, the skin has firmed up a little and looks better. So I&#x27;ll continue to order this serum and use it.  The only downside is that when I put moisturizer/sunscreen over it (I use Cerave&#x27; daytime lotion for that) it kind of clumps up and I really have to rub it in. Also, there&#x27;s a kind of &#x27;graininess&#x27; to the feel of my skin just after the serum dries. But I&#x27;ve used it morning and night, just as the directions say, and will continue the program.</li>
            <li> This product works fantastic!  Less wrinkles.  Skin looks softer and younger. Will always use this product</li>
            <li> Did not like how my skin looked and felt after application</li>
            <li> Great serum it&#x60;s a little sticky</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and am quite impressed.  I can feel the serum going deeply into my skin and the results, after only a week of usage per the instructions (morning and night) work quite effectively.  My skin is very sensitive, but this product causes no irritation and leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome serum. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and it sure is making me look better.</li>
            <li> Not that works as advertised</li>
            <li> I have been using for over a month. I love the smoothness of my skin. Fine lines are still visible but fading. Wonderful addition to any beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: The review of this item was received as a part of a promotion in return for candid feedback of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, if I didn&#x27;t like this product I would not reorder it or spend another cent on the item, even for a promotional offer on the item.  I originally reviewed the item as prompt shipping and item as described.  I have yet to find a non-surgical related product that is a permanent cure-all for aging.  Most items temporarily tighten and firm the skin to give it a more youthful appearance.  I also try to eat healthy, live a balanced lifestyle, and exercise in moderation.  Having said all of that, I do believe that this product has helped with the overall well being and appearance of my skin.  I use it before putting on moisturizer (I live in a dry climate) and before applying a light top coat of mineral makeup on my skin.  I compared multiple reviews on similar items before buying this item. It is by the far the most affordable serum product on Amazon or elsewhere.  Since skin cells take time to rejuvenate you may need to give it a month or two to see the full results.  I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and am routinely mistaken for being in my 30&#x27;s.  I would definitely recommend this product to others for purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product, helps keep thin dry skin moist and looking nice especially under makeup!  This is a really good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times so far, my skin feels nice and soft in the morning? Haven&#x27;t used long enough to notice results.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but I do have a few blemishes and a couple small scars from dog bite, I&#x27;m wondering if this will reduce any of that, vit c is very good for skin</li>
            <li> this is better than easti lauder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for two weeks, and so far it&#x27;s working well. I have a very sensitive skin and this product is gentle enough not to cause any irritation.  This is my first time using a vitamin C serum, so I do have anything else to compare to.  My esthetician recommended Skinceuticals,  but this product is much more affordable and hopefully will provide similar results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my hyper-pigmentation. I have only been using this product for about three weeks now and I haven&#x27;t noticed much success with minimising my dark spots. I still gave it a 5 because the product did smooth and moisturize my skin. My skin is glowing more. The staff is very attentive and accommodating. This is a really good product to add into your daily routine. I will update after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I loved this serum! It leaves my skin feeling fresh and new!  In 3 days I was able to see a reduction in the fine lines I have around my eyes.  I&#x27;m anxious to see how much more improvement I see over time.  Delivery was quick and exactly as ordered. I did receive this product at a reduced price as part of a promotion but plan on continuing use it works so well!</li>
            <li> Great product. would recommend. Leaves your skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try another soon, works slowly I guess, some improvement.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to have a product that is a combination of Hyaluronic acid &amp; C serum. No more mixing. So far I like the results.  The price is very reasonable for a product containing both too.  Starting my 2nd bottle soon.  Great customer service also. Many thanks.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin looks after using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It is so silky and can be used sparingly so it lasts for so long! The serum applies smoothly and absorbs nicely. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and my make up doesn&#x27;t cake on top after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s affordable priced and shipped almost immediately. I am so pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Awesome for even sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and moist. But, to be honest I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it even a month yet but I like how it feels when applying it. I&#x27;m really hoping that it has great results.</li>
            <li> I am a faithful believer in quality skin care and every morning and evening making sure my face is cleaned, toned and moisturized. NEVER and I mean NEVER do I go to bed without taking care of my skin.  I am 60 and have many comments on how nice my skin is. But this product for sure has put a glow in my skin.  There is no bad odor and the liquid is easy to apply.  It will take a while longer to see if in fact it works in all the areas described, but i have no problem continuing to use to see if I see those results.  Thus the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and my skin is smoother and I have seen a reduction in fine lines.  I wish I would have taken a before and after picture.  Great product - highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference. I have been using this product for more than a month already</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months now and have noticed an improvement in my complexion.  Even the very stubborn dark spots on my face have lightened.</li>
            <li> I really do love this stuff.  It has made a visible difference in the depth of my wrinkles and tightness of my face.  I wish I had started it at a much younger age...the wrinkles seemed to sneak up on me all of a sudden, as I have always taken good care of my skin.  When I turned 60 it was all downhill!</li>
            <li> I ordered Serumtologie after having tried a similar product that quickly lost efficacy. I had read that Serumtologie remained stabilized as evidenced by the fact that it didn&#x27;t turn orange as the other product had. It was true. The product arrived very promptly and I noticed a difference right away in the over all evenness of my skin tone. I also noticed that it particularly works well under my eyes, dark circles lightened, firmer looking--however, it must be used with a moisturizing eye cream as it can be drying.* I have now ordered my third bottle and have recommended it to many friends. It is a really good product and at a ver reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;* I understand that they now have a companion moisturizer which I will certainly try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about a week and LOVE the way my skin feels! I also have large pores and this has made a difference that I can see!! I will continue buying this product and also had 2 of my coworkers ordering it today as they could see the difference in my complexion!</li>
            <li> My skin&lt;br /&gt;Looks better when I use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to do a comparison to ONE of the other Serum C products - Azure&#x27;s Ultimate C 22% C+ hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E + Amino Complex Professional Strength (available through Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are very similar at their core components with the same type of Vitamin C they use, but C serum 22-Max differs by few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has listed more natural  or Ayurveda/Chinese/Herbal products in it that have a vast history of various uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a smell, unlike Azure&#x27;s citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes it clear that it is not tested on animals, its vegan and its paraben free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not say that it is Made in the USA on the bottle whereas Azure has Made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are milky white clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this product it needs to be shaken each time before you get set to pull the product into the dropper that 8 drops will then be placed on the tips of one hand, you rub your fingers together and put product lightly on forehead, down next to eye (where crows feet are) then come down cheeks, across upper lip and across chin. Go back and rub the product into the skin until its absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you do - don&#x27;t forget to use a light exfoliate - I&#x27;m going to mention Oil of Olay b/c it comes with the scrubbing auto-brush and if you don&#x27;t clean your face and get the old layers off (which this product is helping to do) you will get a &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; effect along the jaw. I&#x27;d recommend ADSM&#x27;s microdermabrasion cream (which you can get on Amazon - its wonderful but buy it from ADSM as they sometimes throw in a sampler of something else- and getting something free is nice). Work w/ a clean face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle of this, using the 8 drop method, at night, every night, will last you approximately 5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a fact that all skin product needs 4 weeks of continuous work before you&#x27;ll start seeing any results - and that&#x27;s minimal as the skin cells turn over every 21 days. Its really in the 5-6 weeks that you&#x27;ll know if you&#x27;ve got a winner. As long as you don&#x27;t break out, don&#x27;t have an adverse reaction, the product hasn&#x27;t spoiled, you&#x27;re working on your skin as a project instead of slapping something on for a week and expecting to see miraculous results, keep trying and inserting a new item in your core regime. Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m updating as of July 16, 2015: I&#x27;ve dropped every other C serum and switched to this one exclusively. Even though this has 5% Hyaluronic Acid, its only 5% and its combined in the product. I&#x27;ve gone w/ASDM&#x27;s 100% Hyaluronic Acid Serum shipped by ASDM, put that one first after cleaning w/Clinique #1 and #2, then using ASDM&#x27;s 100% Hyaluronic serum (remember to let everything dry inbetween so do other things as you&#x27;re getting ready for work or school to stay on time), then use this C serum, then I use serumtologie&#x27;s Pure Whipped Moisturizer which goes w/this C and has Vit. B and is does not clog pores. After that its light foundation that doesn&#x27;t need moisturizer - it will be too much at that point. Just use a plain base foundation. Too much moisturizer and SPF might be causing acne problems - its in foundation and blush. Watch your product layering. As always - good luck.days.

            <li> My husband and I are both happy with this serum. We feel our skin is tighter, smoother and younger looking. We are both 58 and have been looking for something that works. He has just now become interested in skin care and is willing to keep trying this serum even though he prefers creams. We will be ordering more. We have been using it for about a week. Update: It has been a few months now and I am still ordering this serum. I discovered I can get this for about $5.00 cheaper on Subscribe and Save so now I am doing this. My wrinkles are less visible and my face is smoother. My husband feels the same about his Serum. We have both also figured out that 3 to 4  drops does just fine. It is not greasy, smelly or wasteful. The dropper helps to control the amount you use and so there is very little waste. When the dropper no longer pulls any serum out then you can easily just turn the bottle upside down and shake some onto your finger using the finger as a stopper so it doesn&#x27;t go everywhere.  Any serum that I have left I put on my neck. The 22% Vitamin C keeps the skin clear and the 5 percent Hyaluronic Acid helps with dead cells. It is worth the price we pay for this serum.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and am looking forward to trying your new moisturizer cream.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft, but not noticing results different from many over the counter creams I have used.  In fairness, however, I don&#x27;t use it EVERY morning and evening.  I try to be consistent, but occasionally miss an evening.  For this price, I would expect that missing an evening here and there would change the results, though.  Probably won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of serumtologie c serum 22 and really love it I can really tell a difference in my skin, it s brighter an wrinkles are less noticeable.  I have ordered others that didn&#x27;t do anything and some went bad in just a few weeks. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working... Curious about the efficacy of vitamin C in this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change but I keep trying...</li>
            <li> This serum is outstanding! It glides on smoothly, works with your skin type and makes my skin tighter.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> Using these products for just two weeks, I can see a noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> Soon I will be going on my 2nd bottle. I have seen a &amp;#34;slight&amp;#34; change. So I am going to continue use to see where it will take me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. And I can not believe how my face feels and looks after just one week, but I have been using it for months an I have friends and strangers saying truthfully how much younger I look!</li>
            <li> This is working very well for me since I&#x27;ve added it to my skin care regimen. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple days but in seems to absorb very quickly and that i understand s a good thing.  The price seems quite good for this C product.  I hope to see an improvement in my skin in the next few weeks and if so I will definitely buy again at that price.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and more smooth. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Use it under moisturizer or sunscreen to provide extra protection.  Makes my skin glow, evens out color.  I used Skinceuticals C E Ferulic for a long time, but it gets thick-ish, yellow and has a sticky finish over time.  This is lighter, soaks in better.  I am updating because I have just recommended this product to my sister and was looking over the negative reviews.  Most people complain that they haven&#x27;t seen a result in 30 days so they give up.  I wanted to offer a little education... skin cell turnover rate over age 30 is about 30 days, over age 50 can be up to 90 days.  SOOOO remember that for the first 1-3 months you are treating LAYERS of DEAD SKIN CELLS!! This is an anti-oxidant product.  It protects/nourishes the fresh new cells which are always being produced and which rise to the surface every 30 days if your 30 and every 90 days if your over 50. A vivid demonstration of  Vit C antioxidants in action: cut an apple in half- apply lemon juice to one half and let both halves sit out.  Ask yourself which complexion you want. (This doesn&#x27;t even take into account the other ingredients of this product).  I&#x27;ve been religious with Skinceuticals CE Ferulic (6 years) switching to this product (4 years)- along with SPF 50 sunscreen.  I am not at all taken in by false compliments, but recently my 21- year- old daughter and I traveled to St. Thomas and upon returning to the cruise ship we were detained by the customs official.  He did not believe my passport, did not believe I was her mother- but couldn&#x27;t figure out what my angle might be for pretending NOT to be her sister. LOL (All I could do was grin, which no doubt made him more suspicious). I did not receive this product for free.  I just know how it feels to be over 50.  It feels better to be over 50 and astonishing people that you have a 21 year old. (Oh, and as a nurse I beg you...STOP SMOKING)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now on my face, neck and hands.  I have noticed a more even tone to my skin and smoothness, and it appears the fine lines around eyes are starting to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been 3 months since using this product and I just want to say I am amazed at how soft my skin feels . The fine lines are disappearing around my eyes.  I even gave the insert to my dermatologist who said he was going to check it out as well. I use it twice a day, morning and evening.  I would encourage everyone to at least try it once.</li>
            <li> This product is an EXCELLENT product. I noticed immediate results and overtime longer lasting results. I use it morning and evening to get its maximum potential and I always apply my serum on clean skin prior to the rest of my skincare products. This serum will leave you with silky soft skin and hydration immediately after applying. Over time, I have noticed that my fine lines and wrinkles are much less noticeable. Prior to using this I had thinning of my skin under my eyes and it appears to have improved. I have been a repeat customer of this serum and have referred several friends that have also had good results. I highly recommend this serum and this seller. They follow up with an email to give you tips on how to get the best use with this serum.  They have excellent customer service. Bottom line: If you want great results, order this serum and you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Dissatisfied with this product! No noticeable change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Serumtologie Anti Aging  vitamin C serum for six months.  Notice my skin feels softer and smother.  Purchased serum for lines.  Notice little improvement in the line and no  new lines have appeared.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I liked the product. I cannot tell if I gained any youth from its use but I liked it. And it wasn&#x27;t moldy like the Vernal Hyaluronic Acid Pure Skincare Treatment that I bought afterward to try it.</li>
            <li> I like this but haven&#x27;t noticed any marked changes in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it aside from my skin seems brighter. No change in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Thank you for inviting me to write this review.  I was skeptical regarding this product.  However, I gave it a try.  I am glad I did,  Vitamin C 22 is  absolutely fabulous.  It is everything plus more.  My skin feels a lot softer, my wrinkles have somewhat diminished and that  just after three weeks of use.  The first couple od days I already saw a change in my skin texture, color and wrinkles, but after using the product for three weeks, the result are fabulous.  I also appreciate the merchant for their follow-up correspondence to inquire how I like the product.</li>
            <li> Hey! I am and Mature Man who love good skin, thinks it&#x27;s a mark of class to keep clean. USMC lol. I started recently using this product, fella&#x27;s this stuff works. I feel great going on and it visible smooth&#x27;s your skin. Suggestion: use hot washcloths to clean and soften skin. Next is Shave using a fun device and good shaving GEL. Then use another Hot washcloth, then finish with a cold washcloth. Finally you rub in the Serum 22 and after 2 or 3 days your skin looks better and in my case tightened, by 25%. Love this product, and the Company spends tons in research. Ron</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for about a week, and my skin looks great. I have very sensitive skin and had no reactions to the product (something which happens to me about a quarter of the time with what I try at the department store!) I am not sure, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like the product has extra perfumes of colors added, maybe thats the reason why. Anyway, I am 29 and don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet but I do have some discoloration from the sun. I would say that during this week those spots appear less noticeable. I am using the product preventatively so hopefully I can get a few less wrinkles then my mom had at my age. I would say my skin feels a lot more hydrated which I have heard is the key to preventing wrinkles. Moreover, it feels great on your skin, not slimy or too oily which I really like!</li>
            <li> In just a few days the texture of my skin has improved DRAMATICALLY!! I have used many other vitamin C serums and this formula leaves my skin hydrated and smoothed whereas others left it feeling dry and tight. I&#x27;ve noticed the area around my eyes has fewer fine lines and my skin is overall much smoother and glows from the extra hydration.&lt;br /&gt;You just need a tiny bit of the product so this one bottle will last a really long time, it&#x27;s an unbelievable deal for such a high quality product, I&#x27;ve spend several times as much for others that didn&#x27;t measure up to this C Serum 22!</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews on this product, I was really excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Well, after a week of usage, my skin looks worse than before.&lt;br /&gt;This product is non-comedogenic, but SOMETHING in it really irritated my skin, which is now covered in small, deep pimples.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> the serum is easy to use - and so good for the skin... I am enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, I am 58 after all. I&#x27;m lucky to be blessed with pretty good skin even though I abused it in my early years with relentless sun exposure, most people think I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  there was really no change with this product. Maybe I&#x27;m at the age where it is what it is and I should just keep taking care of my skin and be happy. We&#x27;ll see, I&#x27;m going to try Roc products it seems retinol is still the gold standard.&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve read Hyaluronic acid is somewhat of a catch phrase right now and the molecules are to large to penetrate the top layer of the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product! Sun &amp; pollution have taken a toll, but I&#x27;m seeing fewer fine lines and more lift after just a few weeks. This was a gift, but I&#x27;m sold - hope the price stays down üòâ Good job on the formula. Hope you develop a successful line.</li>
            <li> I purchased the C Serum primarily to reduce mouth lines.  After a month of use, I see little improvement but will continue to use it.  There is nothing else on the market (other than fillers) to erase those lines.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an anti aging serum and I have to say, I was presently surprised. I applied at night before bed and the next morning my skin definitely felt smoother. Will definitely keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and solid product.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this product had such high ratings. I tried this for several weeks and did not see a single change in my skin. I had previously read that this product could reduce age spots. This is also not the case for me. Every day I put a drop on a new spot that showed up on my hand and it didn&#x27;t fade or change in appearance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s good about this product? The oil did not break out my skin or cause any irritations ...so that&#x27;s a plus. I will finish my bottle and use it as a basic moisturizer but will not buy it again due to the cost and ineffective anti-aging component.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at random after seeing a Dr. Oz segment which recommended using a Vitamin C serum.  I have extremely sensitive skin so at first, I was afraid of having a reaction to the product.  However, there was nothing to worry about.  The product was very gentle on my skin and I now use it twice a day.  The product really seems to help reduce the look of lines and wrinkles (I am 63 years old.)  I am really pleased with the price/benefit ratio.</li>
            <li> Looking for a quality product with the highest % of vitamin C and not getting discoloration of the serum due to light and opening the bottle with daily use, I found this serum an excellent choice. I like the design, blue bottle for protection of serum with light, clear indication of ingredients. The price is excellent in comparison with similar vitamin C products. It leaves my skin smooth and hydrated and tighter. I also like their customer service and very efficient on time deliveries. As I love the product I have also recommended it to a friend of mine.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this serum. Seems to work well and has a lovely consistency at a good price. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am not a frequent user of any beauty or anti-aging products but now that I&#x27;m 30, I was considering something to help me with my crows feet which are slowly starting to build up, too much smiling isn&#x27;t always good... Anyway, initially the price and the eligibility for Amazon Prime put this product to the first place so I ordered it. The packaging is very nice, and serum itself makes my skin feel very smooth and fresh. In addition, this product is not tested on animals and it is Vegan! really hard to find qualities, so I definitely recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin,a little bit damaged from the sun. I read all the glowing reviews and decided to try it. The price is pretty reasonable for trial. I received it yesterday (which was really fast), applied some in the evening after washing my face, woke up to a virtually line-free face. The little furrow lines are gone. I kid you not. I&#x27;ve never had immediate results like this. It&#x27;s stunning. I am so very pleased so far. I was expecting to see results after having used it for a week, at least. And I&#x27;ve never written a review for cosmetics but was compelled to do so for this awesome [product. Also I&#x27;m a it of a skeptic, having read that no lotion really works. Well this one does. I used it this morning before sunblock and the improvement still amazes me. I suspect I&#x27;ll be amazed for some time. I&#x27;m ordering more for sure. I wish i could give more stars for this product that&#x27;s made my face ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop making this. it truly works for me (I don&#x27;t know if it would as fast on someone else). And please don&#x27;t raise the price! Pretty please?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks after having used another Vitamin C product.  This is by far the best as it seems to penetrate and work on the deeper layers of skin, not just the surface.  Will definitely stick with this superior brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for problem skin like mine. My mom got this for me as a gift, and it has been helpful to smooth my skin and make it feel refreshed. The best part is - there&#x27;s no residue! That&#x27;s one of the most important things for me in a skincare product. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I NEVER take the time to give reviews on Amazon, but I must tell you guys what an awesome company this is and their high commitment to customer service. The emails alone from Vanessa Powers - she is the co-founder I believe- are so kind and personal. I know she must send these to everyone but I had a question about the scent and usage of the product and she emailed me right away with detailed answers to my questions.  I read about her on the Serumtologie website and she is not only a beautiful reflection of her own product but a very nice lady as well. Plus I must mention that the product definitely delivers!  It&#x27;s been about a month and my skin is smooth and glowing - just as if I&#x27;ve had weekly facials!  Thank you Mrs. Powers and Serumtologie for making an awesome luxury product that is affordable!!</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what I put on my skin. It is quite acne-prone and to keep my breakouts under control, I use benzoyl peroxide which has been really effective but has left my skin very dehydrated. Add that to the constant pollution of Los Angeles along, my skin has become quite dull. After using this product for only 2 weeks, I have seen a noticeable glow from my skin and smoother texture. I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C based serums before, but they were either not concentrated enough to be effective or laced with so many other ingredients that they felt heavy on my skin. I am really excited to continue using this and seeing my skin improve even more.</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  it feels wonderful on my skin!  I haven&#x27;t been using it very long but love the ease of use and overall feel of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and I really like this serum.  I truly have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and overall appearance.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been an Obgie customer for years but when I saw this product I was interested in trying it. I am glad I did. This is a family business that makes sensational products and this one did not disappoint . My skin feels clear and bright. The price is much better than products you find in spas and it works better. Powerful ingredients but gentle. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a definite decrease of fine lines and skin tone is improving, too!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue using it.  Most important I love the seller of this product that stands behind it and answers my questions so quickly.  This is a fraction of what I have been paying for another brand and it is bottle number 2.  Waiting for an eye cream to come out from this wonderful manufacturer. I also love the customer service dept.  They always send an email making sure you use the serum properly.  The consistency is great, not too thin or too thick.  I feel even a tightening of my skin when using this product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I am 62, soon to be 63 and although people always are shocked at my age, I noticed some deeper lines and small bumps on my cheeks.  After using this product, the bumps, I noticed recently are disappearing and my skin tone looks fantastic!  There is also a visual reduction of lines.  I ordered another bottle right away just to be sure I would not run out.  By the waytry putting this on the top of your hands - you will see a difference immediately!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  The customer service is even better!  In my opinion, this company really cares about their customers, feedback and future ordering.  I am very pleased with the C serum 22 and will be trying the moisture cream.  My skin is 70 years old and needs added tender living care, and this seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> Superb serum!!! It goes on light &amp; absorbs quickly. My friends have noticed an improvement with my skin. I&#x27;m a happy customer....going to re-order more right now!!!</li>
            <li> The skin feels tight after using it but the result does not last. It has been about one month so I don&#x27;t know if you have to use it for several months before seeing results</li>
            <li> This is the first thing l have ever used that l could feel tightening my skin. I was shocked. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge improvement in my skin texture in just one week.  Love this serum!</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer after the first application and has continued to feel great for the last few weeks that I have been using this product.  My make-up seems to go on better and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m using as much foundation as did before I started using Cserum.  I will be ordering another bottle of this!</li>
            <li> This Serum makes face feel absolutely amazing and I really think I can see results..WAS skeptical at first but it really does wonders</li>
            <li> This is a great all in one serum. I use it with me when I travel when I don&#x27;t want to take 3 bottles of serum with me while I&#x27;m away from home.&lt;br /&gt;It has vit C 22%, hyaluronic acid 5%, vit E 1% and ferulic acid 1% -- everything you need for fresh - well hydrated skin. Use with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For years, my wife has purchased many different types of what she calls &amp;#34;wrinkle removers.&amp;#34;  A friend mentioned C serum 22 in her presence, so she just had to give it a try.  WOW, does she love it!!!  She&#x27;s been using it twice a day and says her skin feels &amp;#34;smoother than ever&amp;#34; and looks better than it has for years.  Looks like I&#x27;ve found good birthday and Christmas presents for years ahead !!</li>
            <li> Good product, it seemed to work right away.  I noticed a visual difference after the first couple of applications.</li>
            <li> There is a slight odor, but overall a great product!</li>
            <li> Not been using long enough to know if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!! You can see the changes in your skin very quickly!  Your pores get smaller, the skin is smoother and brighter!!  I will definitely keep ordering this and using it regularly!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for about 3 weeks and really haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my wrinkles but I do like the way my skin feels.  I will probably continue to order it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  I noticed a difference in my skin after 2 weeks using this faithfully daily.  Easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  It only gets better with use!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product; excellent service.</li>
            <li> It has 22 percent Natural Vitamin C, have noticed a visible difference after only one week of use.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely purchasing again. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous moisturizers over the years, but now that I am growing older I wanted something to prevent wrinkles as well-this product does both! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 3 weeks and unfortunately never read the directions to use the C Serum am &amp; pm. I did not read the directions because I have been using another  very expensive &amp;#34;blue bottle&amp;#34; vitamin c serum forever and used it only in the am therefore I cannot comment on your product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I like the serum.  I&#x27;ve previously used Skinceuticals CE Ferulic so my skin was already in pretty good condition.  However, I like this serum and especially like the way it feels going on my skin.  I intend to reorder.</li>
            <li> I would like to evaluate the product and the supplier.  BOTH are GREAT!!!  I received the product before expected!!! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 7 days only.  Can&#x27;t say much about it yet, but from what I could feel, my skin looks bright and hydrated. The serum feels silky on my skin and absorbs quickly. I can&#x27;t say nothing about reducing the fine lines yet, of course I have to wait a little bit more to evaluate this effect (at least 30 days!). But I am very much positive about the product results. The first impression was awesome!  I would recomend and buy it again!!! (in fact, I already did!  I persuated a friend to buy 2 bottles of the product, and she did!!!  :))</li>
            <li> I love the c 22 a lot my skin look great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written about this problem in the past it deserves every star I gives it... and the price really doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;ve tried other vitamin C serum and they just can&#x27;t compare</li>
            <li> I love this product - helps keep my skin wrinkle free and smooth.  Very reasonably priced compared to others I have tried!</li>
            <li> this is every bit as good as the $100 stuff. The 22% is considered quite strong btw, so you may need to start with a lower strength. Also, make sure that you double check before using it with other cosmetics. The Ph is important for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> I love using Best C Serum 22. It makes my face fell refresh and healthy. I only had it for 3 weeks and I already see a difference.I fell like my face is looking younger every day that goes by.  I would recommend  this product to  all women.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any change in my face. Didn&#x27;t like the eye dropper, would have liked a pump for the applicator</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I took a chance on it since D√©j√† Vu increased the price of their serum by 92%! I paid $17.90 in May, now Deja Vu wants $199.? This appears to be my new wrinkle guard, (&amp; I have skin sensitivities ) Hope this company doesn&#x27;t develope D√©j√† Vu&#x27;s greedy business policies !  Very pleased with how it makes my face &amp; neck look &amp; feel!</li>
            <li> You have to be quick to order this because it sells so quickly. I was lucky enough to be able to get a bottle with this last replenishment. I like that this product is so potent, it uses a higher level of Vitamin C than most products. But having the most isn&#x27;t always what matters because a lot of good ingredients are wasted if they don&#x27;t get into the skin on a cellular level and just sit on the surface. This product does both. I love that it is vegan and has no parabens or sulfates. Best of all, it&#x27;s available to me to buy on amazon and not at my spa with a ridiculous markup! Here&#x27;s a tip: Get 2 bottles to make sure you don&#x27;t run out in case they are out of stock.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> The best vit c serum on the market</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is easily absorbed into the skin. What I like about liquid formula is that it does not clog the pores. This serum does not have fragrance which I prefer. Some products with mild fragrance don&#x27;t bother me but there are some which are not so pleasant to my sense of smell. Therefore, no fragrance is preferable to me. I&#x27;m giving it a four-star rating because I use several other products at the same time. It may well be that all the products combined contribute to keeping my skin in good shape. I apply the serum on my face, neck and hands. The wrinkles below my eye area have become remarkably shallow. Perhaps this product helped. My hands and neck look young too. I am satisfied with this product. I have used this for about a month now and will keep it as part of my regular skin-care regimen.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum I have used.  I did have a packaging problem and the company did an excellent job in resolving it promptly.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m on my second order and will be ordering more for myself and my sister. I love the way my face feels when I put it on and I love the results I have seen in my face over time.  I continue to use this product. I tried something cheaper, but it just didn&#x27;t work, so I&#x27;m back to this one.</li>
            <li> I broke out on my chest in a rash traveling all the way to my neck.  My Dermatologyst&lt;br /&gt;recommended Retinol Serum, which I tried, but did not relieve the itching.  Since Amazon&lt;br /&gt;is one of my favorite websides I checked and found serumologie which I tried and found&lt;br /&gt;relief.  After I used the entire bottle, my skin felt so much smoother to the touch and the&lt;br /&gt;redness was going away.  I&#x27;m so greatful finding this product.  I also will tell my skin&lt;br /&gt;doctor about it.&lt;br /&gt;Please tell Vanessa Powers Buda is about 1-1/2 hrs north of San Anatonio.</li>
            <li> I like the serum but unfortunately the bottle won&#x27;t stay closed tight. I found this out the hard way after taking on vacation. Luckily I had it in a baggie. Upshot: Good serum, keep upright.</li>
            <li> I had been using another C serum and wanted to try a similar but less expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;The serumtologie C Serum 22 has been the answer for me. It spreads easier than my previous brand&lt;br /&gt;and is just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;Eva</li>
            <li> Really great product. Goes on non greasy and refreshes you through out the night. I love this stuff!!! The delivery is great!</li>
            <li> Save your money doesn&#x27;t really work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have just started using C Serum 22 and it is amazing! I have noticed within the second week my skin is smoother and softer. I have a natural glow and the dark spots are lighting up. So impressed and happy to have found a product i will continue to use. And its affordable. I am excited to try more of this line. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of serums in the past and this is the first one that doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s just water. This actually has substance to it - not oily - and I love that the ingredient list is short, potent and purposeful. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product religiously for more than 14 days now.  I like the way my skin feels tighter, wasn&#x27;t sure if there was a noticeable difference, but people have been commenting how wonderful and young I look! lol!  So, I have to say it must be working!  It is a light oil like substance that just seems to melt into your skin.  Before applying my make up I do add some good skin cream as well for a smoother application, the combination appears to be working!</li>
            <li> The serum is great; got it for my Mom and significant other as a gift (they heard about this product through word of mouth) and it&#x27;s been working slowly but steadily! Not a miracle cure as you should be wary of anything like that but even I noticed that both their faces have tightened up a bit. They have kept up their rigorous skin care regiment&#x27;s and go to the spa regularly but not any more than the past and since taking this they have stated they feel better... most likely the added vitamins that this includes in the formula which is a nice bonus if there are women who don&#x27;t take their Vita C, etc. almost makes me want to start taking it myself! But I take other supplements and don&#x27;t need to overdose... overall, recommend, will order some more to see if they can keep it up and like it. Any detriments will be updated on here (they have used two bottles over three months so far, keep wanting me to order more... from my account haha).</li>
            <li> I got the delivery. Still have to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The box got kinda beat up but the contents is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks now, and yes, I have seen&lt;br /&gt;some initial positive results. The eye-opener was when my wife looked at me&lt;br /&gt;while we were leaving in the car and said, &amp;#34;Did you go get botox and not&lt;br /&gt;tell me?&amp;#34;. I had a good laugh and knew that it was because of your product.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic, the first few days I started using it I thought I needed more than 7 drops the instructions tell you to use  to cover my face and neck, since it drys on your skin fast. So I thought I was going to ran out fast. I still use more than 7 drops to cover my face but I am dosing it a little better now&lt;br /&gt;I love the feeling of tightening of my skin&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use foundation on my face but I clean my face day and night.&lt;br /&gt;I love your product and my skin is getting already all the benefits you described.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Just got this last week and already I can see a difference. I do see a visible glow and healthy look when I apply makeup. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what this will to my skin in a few weeks and months. I gave 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! I have been using it everyday for a month and my skin is softer, smoother and blemish free!! My slim is more even tone and I feel a lot more confident!! I&#x27;m almost 40 and My skin looks like it did in my 20s! I have also noticed while in the sun my skin appears less red!! I will be recommending this to everyone I know!! I&#x27;m also elated by the fact that there are no chemicals in this product! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SERUM!!  I have tried many different brands that advertise that they help aging skin with wrinkles, skin discolorations, firmness, and the texture, but so many have failed to do anything.  This product works! I just purchased my third bottle and am very pleased with its results.  I have noticed softer, more supple, skin that is regaining some of that youthful glow it once had and am noticing a firmer texture the longer I use the product.  I will be buying more and just wish it came in a bigger bottle since I love using it on my neck and d√©colletage too.  I know we all have different needs when it comes to skin care, but after trying so many of the most popular skin care lines and seeing no results, it is really good to purchase a product that really does help my mature skin.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have not used this enough to see results, only a week. I have great hopes for it, once I have used for a longer period of time</li>
            <li> I am a skincare junkie and have tried many high-end serums - Prevage, Obagi, Skinceuticals, etc. Since I became a stay at home mom it&#x27;s been necessary to tighten our budget so I decided to try Serumtologie c22.  A friend of mine that has GORGEOUS skin told me about it and actually lent me a bottle (she bought a bunch at the launch price) so I decided to give it a try. After only one week I noticed a huge difference in the softness and texture of my skin.  I have tried numerous other products that have irritated my skin, giving me a rash or making my eyes burn. My skin feels smooth and baby soft, and the fine lines around my frown line are less noticeable. The texture and consistency of this serum are perfect- blends in right away with no oily residue or tingly irritation. To top it off, my hubby even noticed a change- now that means of course I will be a regular customer and happily buy monthly!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my skin, you don&#x27;t need much and so the bottle last a long time.  Other products such as this one burned my skin when I put it on.  This does not at all.  I have been very impressed.</li>
            <li> Love it. Haven used it long but love what I see</li>
            <li> My mother has always had very full cheeks and as she has aged, they have sagged. I gave this to her and I totally see a difference.  No, she has not reversed 10 years, but her cheeks and face look a bit more lifted and the wrinkles around her eyes look less pronounced.  She has only used it for about 2 weeks.  Can&#x27;t wait to see her in a month!</li>
            <li> I have tried other Vitamin C serums before and this is by far the best. I have already ordered again</li>
            <li> I love this product and I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I loved this serum. I liked the fact that it is a vegan product and organic. It has left my skin feeling smoother. It is easy to apply and makes my skin feel hydrated. It actually has smoothed out lines on my face over a few week period. It works! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Yes,  you  do  have a  good product.  I  am a  72 yr  old  Professor&lt;br /&gt;of  Genetics (  my  area is  mainly in  vitro  Genetic Toxicology). I&lt;br /&gt;have  taught Genetics  and  Cell/Tissue  Culture  for  over  35  years.&lt;br /&gt;So  I  am a  bit  more of a  critic  on  products  on  the market&lt;br /&gt;....and  also  more  cautious.  I  do  think  this  serum is a  plus&lt;br /&gt;for  my  Italian-American  skin....which  is  still reasonably&lt;br /&gt;good.  I  can  say  that  there  is a  difference in  the  finer&lt;br /&gt;lines  on  my  cheek  simile  area!  This serum  seems  to  make&lt;br /&gt;sense.....has  the  right  chemicals  in it.&lt;br /&gt;So  PLEASE  keep  this  product  at  reasonable  price....I have&lt;br /&gt;already  started  to  tell  friends  about  this...I think  you  have&lt;br /&gt;a  sensible, correct  formula.......and  I would  put it  right  up&lt;br /&gt;there  with other overly  expensive serums.  Keep  up  this&lt;br /&gt;excellent  chemistry!!&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I  received  this  product  as a  promotion in  return  for  my  feedback......and  I  am  so very  please  to  endorse  this  product. It  makes&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;biochemical  sense&amp;#34;....and  is a very  fine product. I  am  sincerely pleased  to  make  this strong  positive endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;AnnMarie DiLorenzo, PhD&lt;br /&gt;Professor  of  Biology&lt;br /&gt;Montclair  State University&lt;br /&gt;Montclair,  NJ  07043</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this stuff a chance to make a difference before I left a review, but honestly, I saw a pretty great difference right away. I have been using this stuff for over a month now, and my skin has only gotten better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I noticed immediately when using this serum, is that when I apply it right before my makeup, it seems to help my foundation go on much more smoothly, my pores are less noticeable, and my coverage is actually better. Basically it seems to work like a great makeup primer, but without that slippery silicon feel that always makes me think I&#x27;m clogging my pores and causing breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly longer term effects are that my skin feels much more balanced throughout the day which is great. This stuff is slightly moisturizing, but not generally enough for me. On some days I still have to apply a moisturizer over top of this, but I can do that every other day now, instead of every day, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as wrinkle reduction goes, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any of that, but I would think that would take much longer than 6 weeks. I think this is probably a wrinkle preventative more than anything else, but I plan to continue using this product, so I guess we will see!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product and I will use it for the rest of my life! For the first time in so long, I actually felt confident enough to leave my house without foundation. Men have been flirting with me everywhere I seem to go these days.  A man approached me at the grocery store and told me I was a beautiful lady and that my husband is very lucky! I thought that was a fluke until my husband and I went shopping at a bath tile company and the owner told my husband how beautiful I was and then it happened again while my husband and I were were browsing at the mall. I literally had my hair in a ponytail with no make up whatsoever and a guy still went on and on about how beautiful my skin is. I felt so uncomfortable with the attention I was getting in front of my husband but definitely flattered. I swear I am not lying. This all happened within the last two weeks. My pores are barely noticeable and my skin is glowing! I will never stop using this.  Update:4/21. Unfortunately the company has raised the price significantly so I dropped it a star. The product is still good but I am not so happy that the price went up.</li>
            <li> What better testimonial than your husband saying how young and great you are looking...  I have been using this product for a month and of course my husband would have no idea about that.  Yet this morning out of the blue my husband says how great I looked and especially that my face was more youthful than ever!  It will be my secret serum from now on.</li>
            <li> This serum has been WONDERFUL and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an enhanced glow as it has greatly helped my skin!  I have tricky/combination skin and this product isn&#x27;t greasy and hasn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and actually tightens pores just seconds after the application.  It is so incredibly easy to use and I put it on twice a day, post shower and post nightly face wash.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> After I have used it for about a week, i notice my skin is brighter, and mean while a lot of pimples popped out as well, maybe due to my late night sleep, but i do have my beauty sleep of 8 hours everyday. I hope this is sue to the detoxification process of the orange acid.</li>
            <li> again, this is a scam.  an auto delivery item that is difficult is get out of.</li>
            <li> hi I am trying your product. I love anything that is age defying. Makes my face feel tighter after it dries. I will leave feedback in a couple weeks thank you</li>
            <li> The best I have used to do the job.</li>
            <li> No rating, didn&#x27;t do anything. All wrinkles still there</li>
            <li> I found this Serum to be just OK.  I saw minimal improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Great Seller and Great Product</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month and so far so good.  My skin is soft, some fine fines are nearly gone and it seems like the age spots are getting lighter.  I have not had any breakouts from the product which often happens with other products I have tried.  I use it morning and night. I am ordering a second bottle so and will continue to monitor the results.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. Since I&#x27;ve been using it I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my skin when I&#x27;m not wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> Only have been using for two weeks and can see a difference in a brown spot.  I also see improvement in dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this for 11 days now. She feels that her skin has cleared up, firmer skin. Lines has reduced. Looking to see what happens in 30 days.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and glowing with an even, smooth surface. This is an amazing product, and I am looking forward to using the moisturizer as well, as they go &amp;#34;hand in glove&amp;#34;. This is quite revolutionary.</li>
            <li> Have been using it  as described for weeks now--cant see any improvement</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results I&#x27;m already seeing. My face is softer and I&#x27;m actually wearing less makeup!  My neck looks smoother too</li>
            <li> I have used it fro 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed slight improvement in dark circles under my eyes; however, my skin gets red and tingly in the places that I have applied it on. I give it try for another week and if the tingling and redness do not go away, I think I&#x27;m not going to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I seem to purchase new creams and lotions for my wife to try out all of the time. I guess maybe we&#x27;re all looking for the fountain of youth in a bottle. She says that she&#x27;s using 6-8 drops on her face and neck in the morning and evening right after she cleanses. It absorbs right in and even her sensitive skin has had no problems with it. I haven&#x27;t seen any real differences in her appearance yet but she hasn&#x27;t used it very long. She intends to keep using it which means that she likes it so I may just have to try it for myself. We&#x27;re both in our mid-50&#x27;s and kind of low-maintenance and no real skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; but I figure that we may as well do what we can to protect our skin.</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot.  Absorbs well and non - irritating.  Leaves your skin hydrated.  Good value for the money .&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping it will address the fine lines around my mouth area.  Time will tell.  Recommend this product to the baby boomer generation.</li>
            <li> The difference in my skin is unbelievable! Love it! Highly recommend! Kim costa</li>
            <li> this product is okay.  I see some results..</li>
            <li> I like this serum very much.  It is light and absorbs quickly, plus I&#x27;m able to wear it under makeup.  It hydrates my skin well.  I use the same brand of moisturizer over the serum, and I like the way they work together.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the combination of ingredients. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see results with this serum, and I&#x27;m a serum/moisturizer junkie.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but praises for this product. I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin. I&#x27;ve also been getting complements that I&#x27;ve been glowing, so maybe it does work! But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works quickly. Isn&#x27;t gummy. Lovely</li>
            <li> This product also came opened.  I have decided I will never order any beauty product from Amazon again because this is two products in one month that arrived with the boxes smashed and obviously opened.  The bottle had no safety covering and was only half full.  Now having said this....I have been using it on on age spots on my hands and it is working very well!  I plan to order this product from the company next time.  It is a good product!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this vitamin C serum after all of the positive reviews. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, but I was looking for a good serum to help reduce the appearance of fine lines. The first time I used it, my skin soaked this stuff up - my face felt soft and looked brighter when I woke up the next day. I used 5 drops each morning and night and on the third day my face started to break out, and began to feel more dry. I thought that it might just be my skin adjusting to the serum, so I decided to stick with it. By the fifth day I had at least 7 decent size pimples on my face (which is usually fairly clear) and the very fine lines on my forehead were MORE visible. I started doing some research and learned that sometimes high concentrations of vitamin C and &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; oils/ingredients can change the pH of the skin and cause acne and dryness. I thought about reducing the amount of the serum I was using, and reducing the frequency - but the dryness and acne were just too much to deal with. I felt like I was 15 years old and going through puberty all over again! I stopped using it and resumed my previous facial regimen. My skin still hasn&#x27;t completely recovered, but it&#x27;s starting to get better. Hopefully you won&#x27;t have the same reaction I did!</li>
            <li> This really helped with my dry skin. My skin feels more nourished. Can&#x27;t say anything about wrinkles not long enough. This product was supplied to me for free with the understanding that I made a true review how I liked the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes my skin look and feel amazing: tight, smooth, fresh. I wish it were a pump bottle to keep it from being exposed to air and light, though. When I mentioned the packaging to the company, they said the ingredients don&#x27;t require protection from air, which seems crazy to me. If most other companies strive to protect products from light and air, why shouldn&#x27;t this one? It also has a slightly strange smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering but it is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
            <li> I had this serum for 1 week. I know it takes longer to take effect. After 1 day, my lines under my eyes were more noticeable. I use it after washing my face and after toner. I apply moisturizer with sunblock after using serum . After the 1st week, there is no difference, except the more prominent under eye lines. I use it twice a day, morning and night. I use the entire bottle . I will give it a fair chance. If it don&#x27;t work, I will try something else. I will update the review every week. After 2 weeks, I still don&#x27;t see a change</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It helped to reduce the amount of foundation I normally would wear. Your skin is glowing and who would want to cover that up. Lots of compliments on my skin. If your on the fence about this product, I Say go  for it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best C serum I have used.  Immediately noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I like this serum but don&#x27;t LOVE it.  I was using something similar, but it had 15% vitamin C and the fact that this formula had 22% vitamin C was appealing.  However, I think the 15% formula produced better results on my skin.  Not to say this product doesn&#x27;t do what it promises, but the other formula worked much, MUCH better for areas of hyperpigmentation and it really helped to keep my skin firm.  I also don&#x27;t care for the thicker, more sticky feeling of this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this serum was more stable and didn&#x27;t oxidize.  It also was totally non-irritating whereas sometimes my skin would sting after using the 15% formula, especially after using Retin-A or dermarolling the night before.  It&#x27;s likely I&#x27;ll buy it again, but only use it on those occasions when my skin is too irritated to use the other Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I have not had this long enough to make a complete assessment, but for the three weeks I&#x27;ve have&lt;br /&gt;been using it, I believe it might be working on fine lines around my mouth. I believe you would have&lt;br /&gt;to use this product for many weeks to see a true difference. I will keep at it!</li>
            <li> Love the product we purchase again</li>
            <li> Soaks in very quickly and I can already see progress with the wrinkles. Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This product is more pricey but is not any better than other less expensive products.  My skin looks dry, thick and skin pores enlarged after three days using it. I would  return this product if I could find the box.</li>
            <li> The clientele service is amazing. This is a very serious company who won&#x27;t your hapiness! After 3 days of usage I already notice a difference: my skin is radiant and looks more hydrated.I love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived within a few days of placing the order, well packaged &amp; in perfect condition. Will definitely be placing a second order for this Serum as I&lt;br /&gt;am already noticing that my skin is feeling more relaxed &amp; is plumper without any swelling etc. It feels and looks great. The perfect accompaniment to my expensive skin care regime; this prodcut is well below the price I pay for my daily skin collection but is very high in ingredients &amp; its magic results. Over all; I am very pleased with the company and thier product.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of oil on my face before bedtime and the fragrance and texture of this product is pleasant ‚Ä¶ I did not notice any change in my faces texture after using the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I normally do not write reviews, but felt like the personal customer service I received from Vanessa Powers was so fantastic that I needed to. In addition to the great customer service, after using the product for over two months now, I can say that it delivers everything it says it will. After one week, my face was glowing. After two months, the skin on my face is smoother than it has been for years and still has that really nice glow to it. Since the price is so reasonable, I will be able to continue to use this product every day!</li>
            <li> This serum is a little on the sticky side. I blend it with another serum I use so it spreads easier. There is nothing about it that would compel me to order it again. However, it is reasonably priced compared to other Vitamin C serums so I will not say it is a total bust.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks there is a difference in the fine lines around the eyes and mouth. Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using this product I could notice that my skin was brightening and even my wrinkles appeared to be smoother. The product is very light weight. I have very sensitive skin and this is the first product that did not cause breakouts. I am very happy with this purchase. Especially after spending endless amounts on products that do not deliver on their promises. This one did!</li>
            <li> This is great and i am highly recomende</li>
            <li> I really love it! . I noticed my skin has become more brighter and those tiny acne in my forehead has disappeared. I finished two weeks since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I was skepical at first, and the price was a little high, but I order it anyway. It came as promised. You only need about 5 drops and right away you could feel the tighten of the skin especially around the eyes.(good right). I was pleased with the results, so I order another one. I know you think that a lot the product seller have just anyone to write a comment about their product to sell it to you, I did too, and I suppose some them do, &amp;#34;they do want you to buy&amp;#34; but this one really worked for me. I used witch hazel as my cleanser (amazing &amp; cheap) let it dry and then apply my C22 in the morning and before I go to bed at night. IT IS WORTH IT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for almost a month now.  The first a few days of using it, my face seemed dry and then I noticed some redness on my face.  I thought maybe my skin is just getting used to it?  I think it&#x27;s ok, I am willing to finish the bottle and see the results.  I only use it at night because it makes my face feel super dry and it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy it again. I don&#x27;t like the smell n it does nothing for my face</li>
            <li> not up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> nice serum, smooths in quickly. like the combo of ingredients</li>
            <li> I have been using the C serum 22 product for over one month now and have found that it truly does soften lines and has helped my skin look clearer (I had some Rosacea) and softer.  I will be ordering more of the C serum after I finish this bottle to maintain the kind of skin this product has helped me obtain.  Even though I will be part of a promotion as part of my candid feedback, I can honestly say, as a person who has researched and used every type of product on the market, both high priced and drugstore quality, that this serum is what I will stay with.</li>
            <li> I started using this immediately. Really liked the feel of this on my skin. It did not leave a tacky or oily feel. I could tell an almost immediate hydration&lt;br /&gt; My makeup went on smoothly. No tugging or pulling we noticed on my skin. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It makes my skin feel soft, more plump and look healthier. It works well as a moisturizer, as I no longer have dry flakey skin in areas I did before using. I also don&#x27;t use my face exfoliating scrub as often. I have been using it every morning for the last 4 1/2 weeks and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> After using for three weeks have noticed diminished lines and smoother skin. Plan to continue using it and also taking advantage of reduced price bottle for giving feedback.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Just bought my second bottle</li>
            <li> Excellent product love it !!</li>
            <li> Love it makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> Great serum used either by itself or by itself.</li>
            <li> Great serum! My skin is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great packaging and very easy to apply. My skin not only looks better but it feels great.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about it.  I ordered and love the results. My skin is clearer. I will order again!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, i can already see an increased smoothness in eye creases, frown lines and laugh lines and you only need to use a few drops a 2 x a day.The only issue i have is a little to much oil, since i have oily skin.Other than that i would highly recommend Poppy Austin products to anyone.Thank You.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these bottles when the product first came out since it was advertised for half the price. I see that they have since raised the price on this product. I&#x27;ve used several Vitamin C serum brands in the past and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product as a good purchase. The product doesn&#x27;t have the viscosity of most other Vitamin C serums. It looks and feels like aloe. The good thing is that it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t look feel oily and it doesn&#x27;t sting. For me, I just didn&#x27;t think it worked as well as other Vitamin C Serums I&#x27;ve used. Since the liquid is thicker, I ended up using both bottles fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, radiant, and clear. A woman at the gym told me my skin was radiant and flawless. Serumtologie C has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various Vitamin C serums for over 8 years now.  I haven&#x27;t seen the results that this serum promises, but in all fairness, I haven&#x27;t finished the bottle yet. Hopefully, when I&#x27;ve finished the bottle, I can post a most positive review.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Improvement in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> JUST RECEIVED MY ORDER AND CAN&#x27;T WAITE TO SEE WHAT IS DOES FOR ME I WILL LET YOU KNOW AFTER 30 DAYS OF USE.  Update: I have been using for about 30 days now. I am73 and recently lost 50 lbs due to an illness so I have a lot of loose wrinkly skin on my face and body, I have noticed a lightning of the age spots and It has helped the spider veins on my face and a light decrease in the fine lines.   I am lazy and do not wash my face at night so I would say this is working for me!  I just ordered my daughter one so we will see how it helps her.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see since I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time.</li>
            <li> Item as described, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff really works, I&#x27;m ordering more because now that I&#x27;ve used it, I don&#x27;t think I can live without it... well, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be happy living without it! I loved the consistancy, no odor, and no color, which is important for anyone with sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin out &amp; after using this for 2 months, the brownish skin around my mouth has brightened to my normal skintone again! No more makeup mask!! I also had 2 dark spots on my lower right cheek that are gone now too. I allowed myself to run out of this &amp; have to wait for more to arrive, I&#x27;m ordering it today, sure hope my skin doesn&#x27;t start getting that weird brown mask around my mouth before it gets here.. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s a hormone issue. I&#x27;m 51, and enjoy looking younger than my friends, but yes, I told them about this product too, so it&#x27;s their own fault if they don&#x27;t try it out, right? I did get the nicest compliment 2 weeks ago from a male nurse, he said that he couldn&#x27;t believe I was 51, and that he thought I was in my 30&#x27;s! I&#x27;m not kidding, it felt wonderful to receive such a nice compliment. Do yourself a favor and try this product out, you can always send it back if you don&#x27;t like it but I&#x27;m sure that won&#x27;t be the case.</li>
            <li> Have not really noticed any change.</li>
            <li> Again, I always wait until I have used the bulk of facial products before submitting a review.  No complaints at all but no noticeable improvements either.  I would say the product is OK.</li>
            <li> This product came up on my list as something I might like.  Price was decent so I figured why not try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and immediately noticed softer skin, and a warmer looking glow.  So far I am really impressed by this product!</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this product to any woman or man who takes care of her/his skin seriously.  One of the most important things for me is the fact that the product is 100% vegan and natural (does not contain Parabens, Sulfates, Synthetic Dyes, Aromas, GMO&#x27;s and Petrochemicals!).  Organic and safe! I am not sure about all of you, but I personally would definitely prefer to apply as few chemicals as possible.  Second of all I am truly satisfied with the results of using the product.  I am always a bit sceptical when it comes to starting using a new product as my skin is pretty sensitive but with Serumtologie C serum I did just fine which made me happy too.  I do not have too many wrinkles in general and they are not too deep as I have always been pretty religious when it come to skin care but I have noticed quite a nice difference after using the serum.  My wrinkles (lines) on my forehead are definitely less visible and those are my worst ones and my face skin seems to feel smoother (less imperfections) and softer, so the product definitely improves hydration through boosting collagen production!  In my personal opinion the product is very very honest (good value for the money too!) and it delivers EVERYTHING that promises IF used regularly.  I have been using it regularly once a day for quite a few weeks now.  I will definitely keep using it on my face!  Thank you very much Serumtologie!</li>
            <li> I rarely write a comment about a beauty product.  But I have noticed a pretty big change in my skin since using this product.  My pores seem smaller, my skin is definitely brighter and my face appears slightly lifted.  Having had a very bad experience with fillers this has really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 8 weeks and love it!  It makes my skin look and feel younger.  The product reduces the appearance of wrinkles and makes my skin look and feel firmer.  I have already purchased more of serumtologie C serum 22.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  my skin has improved a lot</li>
            <li> ‚ÄúI can&#x27;t remember what date I received the item? I do like it, only been using a week, have very sensitive skin and it feels very nice on my skin!‚Äù</li>
            <li> Love this serum and just ordered the moisturizer from the same company.</li>
            <li> Combine with a Vita &#x27;C&#x27; serum for outstanding results</li>
            <li> Product arrived in two days. I was amazed.  I have been using C serum for 4 weeks now (with a little extra around my mouth) and I felt like I saw an improvement in the texture and glow of my skin and lines around my mouth but wasn&#x27;t sure if the improvements were in my head or if my skin really did look younger at age 65.  My friends recently started to ask me if I have been doing something different with my make up or  if I have recently used fillers so I guess the improvements are real and noticeable.  I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the ingredients and its ease of use. The packaging is professional.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning and find my skin improving. Definitely much softer and pores appear smaller. I do look forward in the weeks to come to see greater results. I understand skin care takes time, and finding the right product is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> This is a simple and easy thing to do. Wash your face well, dry, and just lightly massage this serum into your face. Follow this with your moisturizer. It is a win-win situation. If you are getting to the age where you see wrinkles that didn&#x27;t use to be there, it is time to start helping your skin fight them away! Give C serum a try. I think you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectation.  Applies easily, skin is softer and looks great!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, this is the first time I have ever used something like this and it really leaves my skin soft. I have only been using it for a week and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Great...even though I use prescription Renova, this product did a better job of removing the top thin, thin layer of skin on my face and hands. If the skin isn&#x27;t gently removed, new collagen isn&#x27;t going to be made by our bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably over-did use at first and had to buy a 2nd bottle quickly.  Yes, it is pricey but so are ineffective products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also using with the Electric Auto Micro Needle Pen Skin Therapy...please see my review for the steps there on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product or any C Serum.  I particularly saw a difference in my hands immediately.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I felt a difference right away. My skin texture feels smoother. I have extremely sensitive skin and I was reluctant to use a new product, but this worked out really well. I&#x27; m looking forward to seeing the more long term effects.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working although it takes awhile to really see results.  I am happy so far with this item.</li>
            <li> I love the glow I get from this. My other products leave little goo balls under my eyes and this doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;I did get as a promotion for a disccounter price , but I will definitely order again at full price. It&#x27;s nice to wear under foundation or alone.</li>
            <li> Gentle yet effective I recently bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about.  Will not buy again.  Can get better product for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 23 days ago and am using it once a day  and sometimes twice. I am in my 60&#x27;s and  am usually skeptical of something that will truly make a difference in my skin. It really does! The biggest difference I notice is the decrease in the size of my pores, overall smoothness and a brightness, and a slight lift (tightness) of my skin. A lot of these kind of products have made my skin feel dry and this does not. I have also used many more expensive products in the past that aren&#x27;t nearly as good.  I have received my second order of C Serum 22 at a reduced price as part of a promotion after writing the above review. I am pleased to report that during my second month of using this product I have seen amazing results in my skin. The sun/aging spots that I have, significantly diminished during this time period! My skin continues to feel smooth and firmer as well. There is no doubt that I will continue this product with or without a promotional cost reduction.</li>
            <li> Seems to do everything the more expensive brands does.  Yay!</li>
            <li> i gave this item to my relative claiming liking the product. the minor issue is the drying of the skin, counter the dryness with moisturizer, problem solved.</li>
            <li> I received this order super quick! I was amazed, because I clicked on &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34; so I thought It was going to take forever to get here but it didn&#x27;t! :) I was REALLY happy about that! I tried the product and it&#x27;s a really good product, it made my skin feel cleaner and firmer. I noticed it took care of the little things that I don&#x27;t like about my face. It made my face look fresher and cleaner. I&#x27;m crazy about the ingredients, they are amazing! I know a lot about herbs and this product has the right herbs you need to beautify your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. My skin feels much softer and clearer. ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results! My skin feels softer and definitely more youthful. I am 47 and have always taken very good care of face regimen. I&#x27;ve used Olay Regenerist for several years but wanted to try this product because of consumer reviews. Very glad I did. I would be interested in the other products you recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered serumtologie on the advice of a friend, for my wife,  She loves it, it makes her skin supple and moist. I wrote an email to the company praising their product, they gave us another bottle at a great discount. My wife recommend their product if you have dry skin or your neck needs tighting.</li>
            <li> I will forever keep buying this.  It makes my fine lines disappear.</li>
            <li> Product was obtained Through I love reviews in order to review this product. I have used this for several weeks and seems to make my face smoother.  Goes on easy not greasy.  Only have to use a few drops.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I already see results!</li>
