    <ol>
            <li>This was almost perfect.  </li>
            <li>Perfect when you are on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At a great price too!</li>
            <li>I like batiste the best</li>
            <li>I used Amazon to find what shampoos at the drug store I was at would work best, and this had some of the highest reviews.  </li>
            <li>Not the best.</li>
            <li>A LOT to get the best results</li>
            <li>(I also think it would be great to take on a camping trip!)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to be able to take a shower and wash all of this out!!!  </li>
            <li>LOVED IT!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives great body and lift at the roots as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product.</li>
            <li>but I am going darker and the powder is no longer a great option.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, great product.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>What wasn&#x27;t as pleasant was the hair itself.  </li>
            <li>It freshens up the hair with a pleasant, non-overwhelming scent, and mitigates the greasy hair look.</li>
            <li>The good:  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Smells good, gets rid of the oily look, and adds body.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>It’s still a good value and does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is good for camping or staying at a hostel.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this in the mail because I got it for a great price!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the scent is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that my hair looked AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice matte finish to my hair and gives me volume.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to take on camping trips</li>
            <li>It would be nice to take on camping trips</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t you think we might have a fragrance of our own we might want to</li>
            <li>and it is noticeable {in a nice way} to others if they get close to you and you&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>It was quick and easy and worked great!</li>
            <li>This does have a strong scent, but it&#x27;s a really good one.</li>
            <li>very strong chemical smell</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Aussie line but this product is by far their best</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it works great!  </li>
            <li>Nice product but smell could be better</li>
            <li>This may be because my hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li>But holy Moses is the scent strong!</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and is easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li>am one of those people who picks a favorite but then keeps shopping for something better.  </li>
            <li>This is great for a person who&#x27;s on the go or needs a quick clean up.</li>
            <li>This brand is great, and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I love the product itself.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I personally really love it.  </li>
            <li>This is safe for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well in absorbing oil and has a great scent.  </li>
            <li>it is even more prominent.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many comments of the smell of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I personally love it.</li>
            <li>It mostly collected on my brush.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I would buy this brand again as I have one that I like better</li>
            <li>This mostly did the trick.</li>
            <li>Then I put a bit more life into it.  </li>
            <li>Out of every dry shampoo I have tried, the Aussie shampoo smells the very best.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is probably one of the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It has that signature Aussie scent that I absolutely love and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I will use it in a pinch to get through another day before washing my hair, but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The bottle is large so it’s a good bargain</li>
            <li>It has a nice grape scent that smells fresh and isn&#x27;t too floral.</li>
            <li>However, it does a good job absorbing oil from your scalp.</li>
            <li>It sprays on easily - like hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, just shake the can and spray onto the roots of your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply and is invisible on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to apply this shampoo - shake, spray and work into your hair.</li>
            <li>Has a strong but pleasent smell.</li>
            <li>(although I don&#x27;t know if the strong scent might attract bees, or bears, or something).</li>
            <li>(although I don&#x27;t know if the strong scent might attract bees, or bears, or something).</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is overly strong.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong scent of a flowery perfume type.</li>
            <li>It has quite strong smell, and the smell stays in my hair for hours.</li>
            <li>it smells pretty nice</li>
            <li>The baby powder works fine with blond hair</li>
            <li>Once I washed it out I was fine.</li>
            <li>The point of the stuff for me was to give my hair a quick &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; so I could, for example, run to the store real quick one morning without washing my hair before leaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels like a light hair spray when it goes on.  </li>
            <li>This is great for camping trips, as well as a parent or child that cannot get out of bed to regularly shower.  </li>
            <li>scent of this is the same great scent hat all Aussie products have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great temporarily fix for the rest of the day until you can get to your regular shampoo routine.</li>
            <li>It not only takes care of excess oils in hair, but it adds volume and smells great.</li>
            <li>You know the kind at fast food joints or supermarkets?  </li>
            <li>will be purchasing this soon for sure and the price is right as well.</li>
            <li>I like it,  but find the scent really strong... not a bad smell,  but not one I&#x27;d choose. ...</li>
            <li>Some dry shampoos, though, do more damage than good.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I just recently ordered more and love this product !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the late afternoon pick-me-up, after the gym or to give fine hair texture for styling.</li>
            <li>Clean hair is supposed to be shiny, isn&#x27;t it?  </li>
            <li>It smells clean, but it doesn&#x27;t feel or look clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has all of the qualities you would look for in a dry shampoo - absorbs oils, blends in super fast, adds body and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is a great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Your hair will not look clean.  </li>
            <li>Dry shampoo is a great product for those in between blow out days.  </li>
            <li>After a shampoo or a water/conditioner wash, I feel clean, and I have a bit of lift to my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t worried about smell then this is a great dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>Excellent dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave white residue all over your hair, but magically looks like you&#x27;ve washed your hair.  </li>
            <li>I put it on even freshly cleaned hair to give my fine hair some volume.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong, but I like that, and my hair looked clean for hours.</li>
            <li>This is good to have when you need to show up in public in emergency.  </li>
            <li>It says you don&#x27;t need much, but the day I was sparing with it, I ended up with oily looking hair halfway through the day, so I applied it more generously after that.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li>However, it smells overly sweet like bathroom air freshener.  </li>
            <li>hair look full, some people use it just to give there hair a thicker appearence.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo made my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li>Or just for a quick touch-up, if you need to go out and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>Or just for a quick touch-up, if you need to go out and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t give soft flow you hair, but it does feel clean to be able to go to class.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend likes to have this product around because it works great for making her hair look and feel less greasy, and she likes using it to prepare her hair for an updo.  </li>
            <li>I had straight hair, and it was very oily, shiny and strong!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is exactly like hair spray!  </li>
            <li>No exaggeration, exactly like hair spray!</li>
            <li>Maybe even better than it does after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this Aussie Dry Shampoo to my Psssssst shampoo, Aussie makes my hair look better.</li>
            <li>I thought the smell was pleasant, but read other reviews where they couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li>They say not to wash your hair everyday so this is a great in between shampoo product.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely use it because of it.</li>
            <li>I can just spray the greasy areas and run my fingers through my hair repeatedly, concentrating at the roots, and it is absorbed in no time, with no residue and no powdery look.</li>
            <li>Just spray some at the roots and just continuously run your fingers through until it is absorbed and</li>
            <li>Any residue washes out nicely with your next shower.</li>
            <li>and it leaves a fresh scent that lasts all day</li>
            <li>Overall I liked the results, gives you that fresh hair feeling if you are on a time crunch and can&#x27;t wash your hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it, and was actually pleasantly surprised as I am sensitive to a lot of product scents.</li>
            <li>I use this almost every day to give my hair  volume and a fresh look.</li>
            <li>The signature Aussie scent makes hair seem fresh.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, my hair was super greasy.  </li>
            <li>Instruction is clear and application is easy and quick.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo smells nice, just like all of the other Aussie Shampoos and conditioners, but it leaves my hair feeling as though its coated in something not so pleasant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the fragrance smells not only cheap, but also too strong.  </li>
            <li>The smell was strong, but it was a good smell at least, smelled just like their shampoo and conditioner that I use in the shower.</li>
            <li>it smells better then greasy hair, and the hair looks and feels better then dirty oily hair, I doubt I will use it often, but it looks like a good solution for emergencies like no water or no time.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is a nice emergency-fix for those days you need to wash your hair but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if I even would try another dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to style afterwards, and works much, much better than my previous emergency fix which was baby powder.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>Your hair will not be soft and smooth, as if you&#x27;d just washed it.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>If anyone knows what the hairspray smells like, this product smells exactly like that.</li>
            <li>It smelled exactly like children&#x27;s grape Dimetapp.</li>
            <li>While it did make my hair feel and look better, that only lasted for about three hours.  </li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>When I used it the first time, it dulled my hair and muted the color.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, it did a fairly decent job at making my hair look clean.</li>
            <li>Aussie&#x27;s Total Miracle Dry Shampoo works great.  </li>
            <li>It LOOKS clean, which is what this product advertised, but it&#x27;s pretty frizzy and wild.</li>
            <li>Most dry shampoos have such overwhelming fragrances... and Aussie does too.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look and feel like I have hairspray in it rather than soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This smells as fresh as their normal shampoo and conditioning products.  </li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I agree we love the smell of this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The thing that I noticed most about this dry shampoo is the scent.  </li>
            <li>It works well enough but the smell is waaaaay too strong.  </li>
            <li>It certainly worked as billed.</li>
            <li>She and I both loved the smell and she made the point that this is the only dry shampoo she has tried that didn&#x27;t leave a chalky residue over her hair after use.</li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t like it as much as another dry shampoo she uses because she says the finish is more matte.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite is also one of the cheapest: Psssssst dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not powdery, brushed out easily, and I actually could have just walked out the door as it, it created a nice amount of volume to my hair with an extra minute or two of tweaking I could have just walked out the door if I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Excellent smell, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with lots of white residue after combing it through like a lot of other dry shampoos tend to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoos, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Except you really can&#x27;t brush it out.  </li>
            <li>This product does the job but have very have smell</li>
            <li>It blends in and absorbs so much faster than any others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave reviews very often because I don&#x27;t have a lot of time, but I had to leave a review about this product.  </li>
            <li>It still looks very oily.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it as a light hairspray when I pull my bangs back.  </li>
            <li>It was very sticky and knotted up my hair.</li>
            <li>You can get ready to go in a hurry when you don’t have time to wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>You really do have to shake it  </li>
            <li>It felt like too much was coming out at one time, perhaps there is a learning curve to this.</li>
            <li>I do not really recommend this and for the price of 10.99 I feel there has got to be a better choice out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like this product if it weren&#x27;t for the scent.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my hair as light as I like, but from a visual perspective it worked well.</li>
            <li>This, is my new favorite Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>With all of this said, I must add, I love all other Aussie products.  </li>
            <li>It is a really strong and fake smelling floral fragrance that was pretty overwhelming when I first put it on and it took about an hour before it got to an acceptable level.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few different dry shampoos and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>The scent is just too strong and I would not even like it as a shampoo scent, but as dry shampoo</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t replace regular shampoo and actually washing your hair in the shower, but it&#x27;s a nice alternative to freshen up on a busy day.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have used some that seem to make my hair feel even more greasy instead of less.</li>
            <li>My hair is matte, has more volume, and definitely doesn&#x27;t look like day three since it was last washed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without dry shampoo, having fine, greasy hair.</li>
            <li>I can not believe this is so highly rated on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Just a few sprays at the hairline and my hair feels fresh and clean again.</li>
            <li>wear??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars off, one for the strong fragrance, the other for the grape.</li>
            <li>I had to immediately wash my hair with normal shampoo and water.</li>
            <li>Like most dry shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t do anything, really, that a little baby powder can&#x27;t do, but the smell and spray make it worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos over the years because I have oily hair and unless I&#x27;m washing daily, I could use a boost.</li>
            <li>only problem is that the scent is way too strong, to the point where it was really starting to irritate me throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is tolerable.</li>
            <li>This stuff not only stripped the shine right out of my hair</li>
            <li>I could spritz it with water to tame the frizz and help it curl better, but I don&#x27;t know if that would interfere with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have a teenager who loves her dry shampoo for days when she can&#x27;t do a full shampoo routine.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, curly hair that tends to look great the first day after a shampoo, decent the second and third days, and pretty rough after that, if I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but left my hair feeling gross and heavy.</li>
            <li>It simply soaks up the extra oil, making my hair bouncy and feeling clean again.</li>
            <li>The other brand that I use will give me a clean feeling all day</li>
            <li>; clean, like it claims, more like &amp;#34;second day.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair wet, like other dry shampoos do, either.</li>
            <li>As someone with fine, limp hair, I always look for volumizing products.  </li>
            <li>Just because our hair is oily doesn&#x27;t mean we stink so much that we need to mask it with strong (in this case</li>
            <li>The Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Dry Shampoo, 4.9 Fluid Ounce came in handy during a recent trip to Florida.</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff and it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It sprays out as a clear liquid, dries rapidly, and makes your hair look matte and fluffier.</li>
            <li>So much nicer than those you get from medical care companies, or the stinky stuff you get from camping supply</li>
            <li>Spray it directly onto the roots of your hair.</li>
            <li>It really changed the way my hair looked, even adding some fullness and body back into my roots.  </li>
            <li>What I do not like, aside from the lingering smell, is that hair does not feel natural and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I was overly sensitive to scented products until I tried this one.</li>
            <li>This product delivered as far as reviving my hair and making it look and feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but I think:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was young (no perms or color)</li>
            <li>It adds back quite a lot of volume to my hair, so it does not look limp and oily any more, but it also makes the hair look quite matte.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all of the good.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately she thought this one didn&#x27;t quite do as good a job as others in getting rid or or masking the grease.  </li>
            <li>Shampooing or washing with water the day after the shampoo (putting a bit of conditioner on the ends and rinse) is better, because the whole thing is that my hair is thin and like angel hair, so I need to not have product at the roots or it will get</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sickly sweet and very long lasting 2 hours after application</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;dry shampoos.&amp;#34; They never work very well, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this product.</li>
            <li>This is the first dry shampoo I ever tried so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too.  </li>
            <li>There was a slight powder in my hair, but it brushed out easily.</li>
            <li>But the hair had a lot of static electricity, and it was dry at the ends, so I took a few drops of argan oil in my palms and worked through my ends.</li>
            <li>It smells so fruity and fresh too, not like other dry shampoos that smell like straight chemicals.</li>
            <li>I should have just purchased something of higher quality and saved the $6 I spent purchasing this because you couldn&#x27;t even pay me to use this.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I ever used Dry Shampoo, I had a medical procedure and couldn&#x27;t wash my hair with water for a few days and wanted to feel clean.  </li>
            <li>While Aussie Miracle 7N1 isn&#x27;t changing the dry shampoo game, it is a great addition to the dry shampoo world.</li>
            <li>So, if I cannot wash my hair on time, I start to feel very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;There comes the dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This product is disappointing because when applied to the roots of my hair it absorbed the oils mostly</li>
            <li>It is a little strong, but if you need dry shampoo you are probably wanting to refresh the scent of your hair too.</li>
            <li>I use dry shampoo all the time and this is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with strong fragrances, so I&#x27;m not really best pleased with the odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some that worked great and smelled so bad to me, I wouldn&#x27;t use them.  </li>
            <li>In particular, a sparkling grape soda smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo product itself works well.</li>
            <li>I really wish Aussie would redo this dry shampoo with a different scent or none at all.</li>
            <li>The Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Dry Shampoo works really well.</li>
            <li>Its really the opposite of what I was looing for, it got my scalp all dry, and it makes your hair get all stiff and not natural looking and when you spray it its kinda waterish, I ll keep on using suave dry shampoo 100 times better.</li>
            <li>Also great for those who are sick or bedridden and can&#x27;t wash their hair often enough.</li>
            <li>Also great for those who are sick or bedridden and can&#x27;t wash their hair often enough.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair which I would need to wash every single day.</li>
            <li>While this dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t get my hair as clean as a regular shampoo, it does allow me to skip a day if I&#x27;m running late.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This was almost perfect.  </li>
            <li> Perfect when you are on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At a great price too!</li>
            <li> I like batiste the best</li>
            <li> I used Amazon to find what shampoos at the drug store I was at would work best, and this had some of the highest reviews.  </li>
            <li> Not the best.</li>
            <li> A LOT to get the best results</li>
            <li> (I also think it would be great to take on a camping trip!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to be able to take a shower and wash all of this out!!!  </li>
            <li> LOVED IT!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives great body and lift at the roots as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product.</li>
            <li> but I am going darker and the powder is no longer a great option.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, great product.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> What wasn&#x27;t as pleasant was the hair itself.  </li>
            <li> It freshens up the hair with a pleasant, non-overwhelming scent, and mitigates the greasy hair look.</li>
            <li> The good:  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Smells good, gets rid of the oily look, and adds body.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how good my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> It’s still a good value and does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is good for camping or staying at a hostel.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail because I got it for a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the scent is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Did I mention that my hair looked AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice matte finish to my hair and gives me volume.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to take on camping trips</li>
            <li> It would be nice to take on camping trips</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t you think we might have a fragrance of our own we might want to</li>
            <li> and it is noticeable {in a nice way} to others if they get close to you and you&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> It was quick and easy and worked great!</li>
            <li> This does have a strong scent, but it&#x27;s a really good one.</li>
            <li> very strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Aussie line but this product is by far their best</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it works great!  </li>
            <li> Nice product but smell could be better</li>
            <li> This may be because my hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li> But holy Moses is the scent strong!</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and is easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li> am one of those people who picks a favorite but then keeps shopping for something better.  </li>
            <li> This is great for a person who&#x27;s on the go or needs a quick clean up.</li>
            <li> This brand is great, and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I personally really love it.  </li>
            <li> This is safe for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well in absorbing oil and has a great scent.  </li>
            <li> it is even more prominent.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many comments of the smell of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I personally love it.</li>
            <li> It mostly collected on my brush.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I would buy this brand again as I have one that I like better</li>
            <li> This mostly did the trick.</li>
            <li> Then I put a bit more life into it.  </li>
            <li> Out of every dry shampoo I have tried, the Aussie shampoo smells the very best.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is probably one of the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It has that signature Aussie scent that I absolutely love and is really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I will use it in a pinch to get through another day before washing my hair, but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The bottle is large so it’s a good bargain</li>
            <li> It has a nice grape scent that smells fresh and isn&#x27;t too floral.</li>
            <li> However, it does a good job absorbing oil from your scalp.</li>
            <li> It sprays on easily - like hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, just shake the can and spray onto the roots of your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply and is invisible on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to apply this shampoo - shake, spray and work into your hair.</li>
            <li> Has a strong but pleasent smell.</li>
            <li> (although I don&#x27;t know if the strong scent might attract bees, or bears, or something).</li>
            <li> (although I don&#x27;t know if the strong scent might attract bees, or bears, or something).</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is overly strong.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong scent of a flowery perfume type.</li>
            <li> It has quite strong smell, and the smell stays in my hair for hours.</li>
            <li> it smells pretty nice</li>
            <li> The baby powder works fine with blond hair</li>
            <li> Once I washed it out I was fine.</li>
            <li> The point of the stuff for me was to give my hair a quick &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; so I could, for example, run to the store real quick one morning without washing my hair before leaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels like a light hair spray when it goes on.  </li>
            <li> This is great for camping trips, as well as a parent or child that cannot get out of bed to regularly shower.  </li>
            <li> scent of this is the same great scent hat all Aussie products have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great temporarily fix for the rest of the day until you can get to your regular shampoo routine.</li>
            <li> It not only takes care of excess oils in hair, but it adds volume and smells great.</li>
            <li> You know the kind at fast food joints or supermarkets?  </li>
            <li> will be purchasing this soon for sure and the price is right as well.</li>
            <li> I like it,  but find the scent really strong... not a bad smell,  but not one I&#x27;d choose. ...</li>
            <li> Some dry shampoos, though, do more damage than good.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I just recently ordered more and love this product !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for the late afternoon pick-me-up, after the gym or to give fine hair texture for styling.</li>
            <li> Clean hair is supposed to be shiny, isn&#x27;t it?  </li>
            <li> It smells clean, but it doesn&#x27;t feel or look clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has all of the qualities you would look for in a dry shampoo - absorbs oils, blends in super fast, adds body and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Your hair will not look clean.  </li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is a great product for those in between blow out days.  </li>
            <li> After a shampoo or a water/conditioner wash, I feel clean, and I have a bit of lift to my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t worried about smell then this is a great dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Excellent dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave white residue all over your hair, but magically looks like you&#x27;ve washed your hair.  </li>
            <li> I put it on even freshly cleaned hair to give my fine hair some volume.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty strong, but I like that, and my hair looked clean for hours.</li>
            <li> This is good to have when you need to show up in public in emergency.  </li>
            <li> It says you don&#x27;t need much, but the day I was sparing with it, I ended up with oily looking hair halfway through the day, so I applied it more generously after that.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> However, it smells overly sweet like bathroom air freshener.  </li>
            <li> hair look full, some people use it just to give there hair a thicker appearence.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo made my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li> Or just for a quick touch-up, if you need to go out and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Or just for a quick touch-up, if you need to go out and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t give soft flow you hair, but it does feel clean to be able to go to class.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes to have this product around because it works great for making her hair look and feel less greasy, and she likes using it to prepare her hair for an updo.  </li>
            <li> I had straight hair, and it was very oily, shiny and strong!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly like hair spray!  </li>
            <li> No exaggeration, exactly like hair spray!</li>
            <li> Maybe even better than it does after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this Aussie Dry Shampoo to my Psssssst shampoo, Aussie makes my hair look better.</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was pleasant, but read other reviews where they couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> They say not to wash your hair everyday so this is a great in between shampoo product.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely use it because of it.</li>
            <li> I can just spray the greasy areas and run my fingers through my hair repeatedly, concentrating at the roots, and it is absorbed in no time, with no residue and no powdery look.</li>
            <li> Just spray some at the roots and just continuously run your fingers through until it is absorbed and</li>
            <li> Any residue washes out nicely with your next shower.</li>
            <li> and it leaves a fresh scent that lasts all day</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the results, gives you that fresh hair feeling if you are on a time crunch and can&#x27;t wash your hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it, and was actually pleasantly surprised as I am sensitive to a lot of product scents.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day to give my hair  volume and a fresh look.</li>
            <li> The signature Aussie scent makes hair seem fresh.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, my hair was super greasy.  </li>
            <li> Instruction is clear and application is easy and quick.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo smells nice, just like all of the other Aussie Shampoos and conditioners, but it leaves my hair feeling as though its coated in something not so pleasant.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the fragrance smells not only cheap, but also too strong.  </li>
            <li> The smell was strong, but it was a good smell at least, smelled just like their shampoo and conditioner that I use in the shower.</li>
            <li> it smells better then greasy hair, and the hair looks and feels better then dirty oily hair, I doubt I will use it often, but it looks like a good solution for emergencies like no water or no time.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is a nice emergency-fix for those days you need to wash your hair but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if I even would try another dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy to style afterwards, and works much, much better than my previous emergency fix which was baby powder.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Your hair will not be soft and smooth, as if you&#x27;d just washed it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> If anyone knows what the hairspray smells like, this product smells exactly like that.</li>
            <li> It smelled exactly like children&#x27;s grape Dimetapp.</li>
            <li> While it did make my hair feel and look better, that only lasted for about three hours.  </li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> When I used it the first time, it dulled my hair and muted the color.  </li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, it did a fairly decent job at making my hair look clean.</li>
            <li> Aussie&#x27;s Total Miracle Dry Shampoo works great.  </li>
            <li> It LOOKS clean, which is what this product advertised, but it&#x27;s pretty frizzy and wild.</li>
            <li> Most dry shampoos have such overwhelming fragrances... and Aussie does too.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look and feel like I have hairspray in it rather than soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This smells as fresh as their normal shampoo and conditioning products.  </li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I agree we love the smell of this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The thing that I noticed most about this dry shampoo is the scent.  </li>
            <li> It works well enough but the smell is waaaaay too strong.  </li>
            <li> It certainly worked as billed.</li>
            <li> She and I both loved the smell and she made the point that this is the only dry shampoo she has tried that didn&#x27;t leave a chalky residue over her hair after use.</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t like it as much as another dry shampoo she uses because she says the finish is more matte.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite is also one of the cheapest: Psssssst dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not powdery, brushed out easily, and I actually could have just walked out the door as it, it created a nice amount of volume to my hair with an extra minute or two of tweaking I could have just walked out the door if I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Excellent smell, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with lots of white residue after combing it through like a lot of other dry shampoos tend to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoos, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Except you really can&#x27;t brush it out.  </li>
            <li> This product does the job but have very have smell</li>
            <li> It blends in and absorbs so much faster than any others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave reviews very often because I don&#x27;t have a lot of time, but I had to leave a review about this product.  </li>
            <li> It still looks very oily.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it as a light hairspray when I pull my bangs back.  </li>
            <li> It was very sticky and knotted up my hair.</li>
            <li> You can get ready to go in a hurry when you don’t have time to wash your hair.  </li>
            <li> You really do have to shake it  </li>
            <li> It felt like too much was coming out at one time, perhaps there is a learning curve to this.</li>
            <li> I do not really recommend this and for the price of 10.99 I feel there has got to be a better choice out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like this product if it weren&#x27;t for the scent.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair as light as I like, but from a visual perspective it worked well.</li>
            <li> This, is my new favorite Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> With all of this said, I must add, I love all other Aussie products.  </li>
            <li> It is a really strong and fake smelling floral fragrance that was pretty overwhelming when I first put it on and it took about an hour before it got to an acceptable level.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different dry shampoos and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> The scent is just too strong and I would not even like it as a shampoo scent, but as dry shampoo</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t replace regular shampoo and actually washing your hair in the shower, but it&#x27;s a nice alternative to freshen up on a busy day.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used some that seem to make my hair feel even more greasy instead of less.</li>
            <li> My hair is matte, has more volume, and definitely doesn&#x27;t look like day three since it was last washed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without dry shampoo, having fine, greasy hair.</li>
            <li> I can not believe this is so highly rated on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Just a few sprays at the hairline and my hair feels fresh and clean again.</li>
            <li> wear??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars off, one for the strong fragrance, the other for the grape.</li>
            <li> I had to immediately wash my hair with normal shampoo and water.</li>
            <li> Like most dry shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t do anything, really, that a little baby powder can&#x27;t do, but the smell and spray make it worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos over the years because I have oily hair and unless I&#x27;m washing daily, I could use a boost.</li>
            <li> only problem is that the scent is way too strong, to the point where it was really starting to irritate me throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is tolerable.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only stripped the shine right out of my hair</li>
            <li> I could spritz it with water to tame the frizz and help it curl better, but I don&#x27;t know if that would interfere with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have a teenager who loves her dry shampoo for days when she can&#x27;t do a full shampoo routine.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that tends to look great the first day after a shampoo, decent the second and third days, and pretty rough after that, if I don&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but left my hair feeling gross and heavy.</li>
            <li> It simply soaks up the extra oil, making my hair bouncy and feeling clean again.</li>
            <li> The other brand that I use will give me a clean feeling all day</li>
            <li> ; clean, like it claims, more like &amp;#34;second day.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair wet, like other dry shampoos do, either.</li>
            <li> As someone with fine, limp hair, I always look for volumizing products.  </li>
            <li> Just because our hair is oily doesn&#x27;t mean we stink so much that we need to mask it with strong (in this case</li>
            <li> The Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Dry Shampoo, 4.9 Fluid Ounce came in handy during a recent trip to Florida.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff and it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It sprays out as a clear liquid, dries rapidly, and makes your hair look matte and fluffier.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than those you get from medical care companies, or the stinky stuff you get from camping supply</li>
            <li> Spray it directly onto the roots of your hair.</li>
            <li> It really changed the way my hair looked, even adding some fullness and body back into my roots.  </li>
            <li> What I do not like, aside from the lingering smell, is that hair does not feel natural and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was overly sensitive to scented products until I tried this one.</li>
            <li> This product delivered as far as reviving my hair and making it look and feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but I think:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was young (no perms or color)</li>
            <li> It adds back quite a lot of volume to my hair, so it does not look limp and oily any more, but it also makes the hair look quite matte.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all of the good.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately she thought this one didn&#x27;t quite do as good a job as others in getting rid or or masking the grease.  </li>
            <li> Shampooing or washing with water the day after the shampoo (putting a bit of conditioner on the ends and rinse) is better, because the whole thing is that my hair is thin and like angel hair, so I need to not have product at the roots or it will get</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sickly sweet and very long lasting 2 hours after application</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;dry shampoos.&amp;#34; They never work very well, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I ever tried so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too.  </li>
            <li> There was a slight powder in my hair, but it brushed out easily.</li>
            <li> But the hair had a lot of static electricity, and it was dry at the ends, so I took a few drops of argan oil in my palms and worked through my ends.</li>
            <li> It smells so fruity and fresh too, not like other dry shampoos that smell like straight chemicals.</li>
            <li> I should have just purchased something of higher quality and saved the $6 I spent purchasing this because you couldn&#x27;t even pay me to use this.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I ever used Dry Shampoo, I had a medical procedure and couldn&#x27;t wash my hair with water for a few days and wanted to feel clean.  </li>
            <li> While Aussie Miracle 7N1 isn&#x27;t changing the dry shampoo game, it is a great addition to the dry shampoo world.</li>
            <li> So, if I cannot wash my hair on time, I start to feel very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;There comes the dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is disappointing because when applied to the roots of my hair it absorbed the oils mostly</li>
            <li> It is a little strong, but if you need dry shampoo you are probably wanting to refresh the scent of your hair too.</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo all the time and this is by far my least favorite.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with strong fragrances, so I&#x27;m not really best pleased with the odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some that worked great and smelled so bad to me, I wouldn&#x27;t use them.  </li>
            <li> In particular, a sparkling grape soda smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo product itself works well.</li>
            <li> I really wish Aussie would redo this dry shampoo with a different scent or none at all.</li>
            <li> The Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Dry Shampoo works really well.</li>
            <li> Its really the opposite of what I was looing for, it got my scalp all dry, and it makes your hair get all stiff and not natural looking and when you spray it its kinda waterish, I ll keep on using suave dry shampoo 100 times better.</li>
            <li> Also great for those who are sick or bedridden and can&#x27;t wash their hair often enough.</li>
            <li> Also great for those who are sick or bedridden and can&#x27;t wash their hair often enough.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair which I would need to wash every single day.</li>
            <li> While this dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t get my hair as clean as a regular shampoo, it does allow me to skip a day if I&#x27;m running late.  </li>
            <li> So I have to not other brush it through, but blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair red and as I have oily hair, I&#x27;ve been looking for dry shampoos to use between actual washes to make the color last longer.  </li>
            <li> So I like to make a blowout last as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> so I would suggest only blonde&#x27;s and grey hair people use it.</li>
            <li> This particular dry shampoo comes out a little white</li>
            <li> It adds fullness and lifts flat hair.  </li>
            <li> I only use it when I can&#x27;t shower and my hair is feeling greasy (the day after I wash it or at the end of a long night).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll give this dry shampoo three stars, because it works as advertised, or close enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll give this dry shampoo three stars, because it works as advertised, or close enough.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is something that is versatile because it can be used for different reasons.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling dry, damaged and tangled.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about the dry shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s better than the super hair-spray scent that dry shampoos often have, but this sickening artificial grape scent isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li> This is to review Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Dry Shampoo, 4.9 Fluid Ounce, not the other Aussie</li>
            <li> My hair is dark, so you can definitely tell if it doesn&#x27;t all absorb - it will look like white powdery gunk on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this would degrease without the grey hair look the powder gives.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts a long while.</li>
            <li> Its not soft, touchable or even brushable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave your hair soft but it felt a bit heavy on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair.</li>
            <li> i was curious to see how Aussie compared since it is one of the shampoo brands in my regular washing rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear my hair long and wavy.  </li>
            <li> Super disappointed about the smell because it seemed to soak up the oil in my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> all dry shampoos, the finish is matte - you won&#x27;t look freshly showered and shiny, but nor will you look tired and greasy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much and one bottle will last for at least a couple months if it&#x27;s used every other day.</li>
            <li> It is a wet formula, which feels very strange and actually requires the product to dry.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I thought I had done something wrong, so I washed the next morning, and the day after that I tried again because I wanted to give it a second try.  </li>
            <li> Helps my dyed-red hair color last due to limiting the water-washing.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair white like other dry shampoos</li>
            <li> Aussie&#x27;s 7n1 Dry Shampoo works, yes.</li>
            <li> and I recommend to anyone who uses dry shampoos or has thought about using one.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and purchase a nicer dry shampoo like Klorane or Batiste.</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t these companies realize that we might not all want to smell like the dry shampoo we just applied?</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried just about every dry shampoo on the market:</li>
            <li> and you have to let it dry before rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan both of Aussie products and dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I also dry my hair after I spray it and brush through it to evenly distribute the dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will now be using both of these dry shampoos depending on what I am trying to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend trying this Aussie Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> In those cases, I like to have a dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Minimal white (powder) shows vs some other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoos should be dry!</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, and this left no visible residue.</li>
            <li> I usually use the more expensive brands too, like Ojon, Alterna, Oscar Blandi etc.</li>
            <li> Unlike other dry shampoos that I have tried, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a chalky residues over the hair.</li>
            <li> ; look that some other dry shampoos seem to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at least 10 times so far</li>
            <li> This comes out wet</li>
            <li> It goes on wet and then dries once on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Unlike other dry shampoos, it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of dry shampoo in the past and this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused about all of the positive reviews for this product...</li>
            <li> I just wish they don&#x27;t include any fragrance at all because it just overpowers the fragrance from other products.</li>
            <li> My hair was neither freshened nor pretty after using-- a weird grayish looking residue was on my hair after use.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I suggest you try other brands.</li>
            <li> If you have limp hair, you will benefit from a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It did seem to fluff up my unwashed hair, but it felt a little oily overall, so I am not sure how my hair would look at the end of the day as I ended up washing it out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a visible residue in my dark brown hair and does what it promises.</li>
            <li> I do not see any residue, but my hair is not that dark, so I did not expect to see any.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s one of those that you either love or hate the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this is considered a dry shampoo since you spray it on.  </li>
            <li> One of the seven benefits claimed by this product is \\&quot;matte finish\\&quot; which struck me as odd.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously one of the grossest products I have ever used on my hair in my entire life.</li>
            <li> It did feel slightly tangly when I tried to run my fingers through my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend in place of showering, as your hair is still a little greasy, but we keep some in our 72 hour kits, as well as our camping backpacks.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just something about it that makes me a little nauseous.</li>
            <li> I do wish it made styling a little easier, though.</li>
            <li> I do wish it made styling a little easier, though.</li>
            <li> This Dry Shampoo is a total miss for me, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo worked pretty well, although I felt it gave me a slight oily look at the base of my roots</li>
            <li> Seriously, I don&#x27;t need to be reminded of applying dry shampoo all day.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, I swear my hair looks greasier than before I used it.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my hair and it takes a few seconds to sink in</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t mind a heavy floral scent, this may be one that you can try.  </li>
            <li> Ends up stiff like hair spray and dried out the hair</li>
            <li> Oddly though, it smells like grape!</li>
            <li> It will feel a little rough and textured, not exactly pleasant to the touch.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> Alterna Caviar, Tigi Oh Bee Hive, Dove, Batiste, Not Your Mother&#x27;s, Tresemme, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Bumble and Bumble, and Amika are just a sampling of the myriad of dry shampoos I&#x27;ve use.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaves hair a little sticky feeling which makes my hair difficult to style.  </li>
            <li> have in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it did to my hair besides make it smell like cotton candy-- even after shampooing, some of the smell remained.  </li>
            <li> hair is very oily, and I wash it daily or it starts to look horrible.</li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant, but it&#x27;s mattifying power beats any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Aussie is the only one that made me itch so badly I had to wash my hair - over the course of about 20 hours it went from a slight itch which I initially simply attributed to dirty hair, to feeling like bugs were crawling over my scalp.</li>
            <li> Then to the bad, just like hair spray, it completely coated my hair</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why this is the cheapest on Amazon: it sucks.</li>
            <li> Too much harsh chemical smell, comes out too wet, and is impossible to brush through.</li>
            <li> If only it didn&#x27;t smell so bad.</li>
            <li> but the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> It was almost impossible to brush my hair after I sprayed the dry shampoo in it.  </li>
            <li> product seems to work, and didn&#x27;t leave a white powder in my hair (yay), but the scent is driving me crazy!</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, it also thickens our hair too making you&#x27;re</li>
            <li> When I used it again, that all got worse.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t live without it or risk shocking myself and everything in my path during the winter.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Aussie, get over your &amp;#34;Ausse-some scent&amp;#34; self.</li>
            <li> Just be wary of</li>
            <li> And the scent is weirdly chemical-like.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell, so I never feel like I can use it...</li>
            <li> It is awful and definitely not &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Even though I finally brushed it all, my hair still feels nasty, like a matted rat&#x27;s nest.</li>
            <li> but when I am ill or traveling sometimes that doesn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely awful dry shampoo, and here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I just could not get past that horrible artificial grape fragrance....</li>
            <li> Just be wary of the smell!</li>
            <li> I have also used some from Suave Professionals that weren&#x27;t bad either, but this one from Aussie takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Remarkably bad product.</li>
            <li> I bought it for that reason and I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product</li>
            <li> The scent is horrible and over-powering.</li>
            <li> This made my hair sticky and awful feeling</li>
            <li> This product is awful.</li>
            <li> , it was so terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this is considered a dry shampoo since you spray it on.  It works well enough but the smell is waaaaay too strong.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> very strong chemical smell</li>
            <li> While this dry shampoo doesn&#x27;t get my hair as clean as a regular shampoo, it does allow me to skip a day if I&#x27;m running late.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair white like other dry shampoos have in the past.</li>
            <li> The good:  it smells pretty nice and it&#x27;s not powdery.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s all of the good.  One of the seven benefits claimed by this product is \\&quot;matte finish\\&quot; which struck me as odd.  Clean hair is supposed to be shiny, isn&#x27;t it?  Well, they are not kidding about the matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels like a light hair spray when it goes on.  You are supposed to work it into your hair and then brush it out. Except you really can&#x27;t brush it out.  It&#x27;s like having millions of tiny invisible particles clinging to your hair.  It smells clean, but it doesn&#x27;t feel or look clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of those people who picks a favorite but then keeps shopping for something better.  I have tried lots of Aussie hair care products in my time.  It&#x27;s quite telling that three of them are still my go-to&#x27;s:  Hair Insurance, Spray Mousse with Leave-In Conditioner, and 2-in-1 shampoos.  This Dry Shampoo is a total miss for me, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This product does the job but have very have smell and I rarely use it because of it.</li>
            <li> This is great for a person who&#x27;s on the go or needs a quick clean up. I use it at work towards the end of the day because conditioner makes my hair so greasy but I can&#x27;t live without it or risk shocking myself and everything in my path during the winter. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> This is great for camping trips, as well as a parent or child that cannot get out of bed to regularly shower.  So much nicer than those you get from medical care companies, or the stinky stuff you get from camping supply stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend in place of showering, as your hair is still a little greasy, but we keep some in our 72 hour kits, as well as our camping backpacks.  This brand is great, and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Has a strong but pleasent smell. Holds hair similar to hairspray.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but left my hair feeling gross and heavy.</li>
            <li> Aussie&#x27;s 7n1 Dry Shampoo works, yes. But holy Moses is the scent strong! And they tout it as one of the 7 bonuses of using the product, go figure. It&#x27;s sickly sweet and very long lasting 2 hours after application and I still can&#x27;t stand the smell of myself. My hair is matte, has more volume, and definitely doesn&#x27;t look like day three since it was last washed. If only it didn&#x27;t smell so bad. Sorry, Aussie, get over your &amp;#34;Ausse-some scent&amp;#34; self.</li>
            <li> This was almost perfect.  Out of every dry shampoo I have tried, the Aussie shampoo smells the very best.  I&#x27;ve tried some that worked great and smelled so bad to me, I wouldn&#x27;t use them.  This smells as fresh as their normal shampoo and conditioning products.  It definitely worked and spruced up hair that maybe coulda shoulda had it washed.  What wasn&#x27;t as pleasant was the hair itself.  It left a sticky residue.  If I&#x27;d been styling my hair anyway, I would not have minded.  But, that not being that case, I did find the tackiness of the hair off putting by a margin.  AND YET.... I would still choose this product over the others that I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is good to have when you need to show up in public in emergency.  Instruction is clear and application is easy and quick.  Perfect when you are on the run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the fragrance smells not only cheap, but also too strong.  I just wish they don&#x27;t include any fragrance at all because it just overpowers the fragrance from other products.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself. It does exactly what it needs to do. Gives you an extra day before you have to wash your hair. I have naturally oily hair which I would need to wash every single day. This product is a time saver. Just spray it on and brush it through and you&#x27;re good to go. Leaves a nice matte finish to my hair and gives me volume. However, I cannot get passed the smell. There&#x27;s just something about it that makes me a little nauseous. And the smell lasts ALL day. Maybe it&#x27;s because I can&#x27;t stand it... But it never goes away. If you aren&#x27;t worried about smell then this is a great dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;dry shampoos.&amp;#34; They never work very well, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this product. Much to my surprise, it did a fairly decent job at making my hair look clean. It did have some issues, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to shake it thoroughly, but don&#x27;t spray it onto your hand, like you would with mousse. Spray it directly onto the roots of your hair. Lift your hair up with your fingers, to ensure you get everywhere. Give it a minute while it evaporates, then brush your hair. The grease will vanish, leaving your hair looking as if you&#x27;d washed it recently. Maybe not &amp;#34;first day&amp;#34; clean, like it claims, more like &amp;#34;second day.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair wet, like other dry shampoos do, either. Once it evaporates, which is within seconds, your hair will be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, don&#x27;t expect miracles! Your hair will not be soft and smooth, as if you&#x27;d just washed it. It will feel a little rough and textured, not exactly pleasant to the touch. Your hair won&#x27;t style as if you&#x27;d just washed it, either. I have thick, curly hair that tends to look great the first day after a shampoo, decent the second and third days, and pretty rough after that, if I don&#x27;t wash it. When I used this stuff, it removed the shiny, greasy look from my roots, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair any easier to style. It LOOKS clean, which is what this product advertised, but it&#x27;s pretty frizzy and wild. I could spritz it with water to tame the frizz and help it curl better, but I don&#x27;t know if that would interfere with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Note: If you have sensitivities to odors or fragrances, you might want to avoid this product. It has a very strong smell to it. My husband says it smells like a hair salon, with all the chemicals in the air. The smell fades eventually, but it takes about ten to fifteen minutes, and if you shake your head, the smell will rise up again. I have trouble with strong fragrances, so I&#x27;m not really best pleased with the odor. My husband doesn&#x27;t care for it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give this dry shampoo three stars, because it works as advertised, or close enough. I do wish it made styling a little easier, though. Hesitantly recommended for anyone who can&#x27;t wash their hair as often as they like. It would be nice to take on camping trips (although I don&#x27;t know if the strong scent might attract bees, or bears, or something). Also great for those who are sick or bedridden and can&#x27;t wash their hair often enough. Or just for a quick touch-up, if you need to go out and don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair. Just be wary of the smell!y husband doesn&#x27;t care for it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give this dry shampoo three stars, because it works as advertised, or close enough.

            <li> This dry shampoo is probably one of the best I have ever used. It blends in and absorbs so much faster than any others that I have tried. I usually use the more expensive brands too, like Ojon, Alterna, Oscar Blandi etc. I have also used some from Suave Professionals that weren&#x27;t bad either, but this one from Aussie takes the cake. I don&#x27;t even have to rub it in. I can just spray the greasy areas and run my fingers through my hair repeatedly, concentrating at the roots, and it is absorbed in no time, with no residue and no powdery look. My hair is dark, so you can definitely tell if it doesn&#x27;t all absorb - it will look like white powdery gunk on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives great body and lift at the roots as well. Dry shampoo is something that is versatile because it can be used for different reasons. You can freshen up your hair, get rid of any grease/oils or use it just for the volume and body. If you have limp hair, you will benefit from a dry shampoo. Just spray some at the roots and just continuously run your fingers through until it is absorbed and you can just watch the body build up at the roots. It can also add some bulk or texture on the length as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this is the same great scent hat all Aussie products have. That sort of grape-ish smell that reminds me of junior high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. It has all of the qualities you would look for in a dry shampoo - absorbs oils, blends in super fast, adds body and smells wonderful. At a great price too!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today.  LOVED IT!  Not powdery, brushed out easily, and I actually could have just walked out the door as it, it created a nice amount of volume to my hair with an extra minute or two of tweaking I could have just walked out the door if I wanted.  What a time saver on those work days where you&#x27;re running behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the Aussie line but this product is by far their best and I recommend to anyone who uses dry shampoos or has thought about using one.  They say not to wash your hair everyday so this is a great in between shampoo product.  I will not be running out of this stuff!</li>
            <li> The scent is horrible and over-powering.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is a nice emergency-fix for those days you need to wash your hair but can&#x27;t. It has a nice grape scent that smells fresh and isn&#x27;t too floral. It sprays on easily - like hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray it on your roots, brush out your hair, and the oily look is gone leaving a matte finish and no itchy scalp. My hair is dark brown, and this left no visible residue. It does tend to make my hair feel like I used a *lot* of hairspray. But it&#x27;s easy to style afterwards, and works much, much better than my previous emergency fix which was baby powder. It says you don&#x27;t need much, but the day I was sparing with it, I ended up with oily looking hair halfway through the day, so I applied it more generously after that. Any residue washes out nicely with your next shower.</li>
            <li> This made my hair sticky and awful feeling I like batiste the best</li>
            <li> I got this product to replace putting baby powder in my hair to make it last a day longer without shampooing.  The baby powder works fine with blond hair but I am going darker and the powder is no longer a great option.  I thought this would degrease without the grey hair look the powder gives.  I was pleasantly surprised that it works great!  Smells good, gets rid of the oily look, and adds body.  My only complaint is that it leaves hair a little sticky feeling which makes my hair difficult to style.  Otherwise, great product.  Would recommend to anyone trying to extend shampoo life!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works great. Comparable price to buying locally.</li>
            <li> This is to review Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Dry Shampoo, 4.9 Fluid Ounce, not the other Aussie products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to work, and didn&#x27;t leave a white powder in my hair (yay), but the scent is driving me crazy! I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s better than the super hair-spray scent that dry shampoos often have, but this sickening artificial grape scent isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
            <li> If you can picture hair spray mixed with white talcum powder and your grandmothers perfume then you&#x27;ll know what you are getting with this.  This stuff not only stripped the shine right out of my hair but it made my hair sticky and prematurely gray looking.  The point of the stuff for me was to give my hair a quick &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; so I could, for example, run to the store real quick one morning without washing my hair before leaving. It actually did the opposite by forcing me to wash my hair after application.  The smell alone was enough that I would not have gone out in public but the tacky white film it sprayed on my hair topped the cake. Take my word for it...you&#x27;ll want to pass on this one ladies.</li>
            <li> This does have a strong scent, but it&#x27;s a really good one. It doesn&#x27;t leave a visible residue in my dark brown hair and does what it promises.</li>
            <li> This is a great dry shampoo. Excellent smell, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with lots of white residue after combing it through like a lot of other dry shampoos tend to do. It also lasts a long while. I&#x27;ve used it at least 10 times so far and it seems like there&#x27;s still over 75% of the bottle left. If anyone knows what the hairspray smells like, this product smells exactly like that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave reviews very often because I don&#x27;t have a lot of time, but I had to leave a review about this product.  I can not believe this is so highly rated on Amazon.  I recently dyed my hair red and as I have oily hair, I&#x27;ve been looking for dry shampoos to use between actual washes to make the color last longer.  I used Amazon to find what shampoos at the drug store I was at would work best, and this had some of the highest reviews.  I should have just purchased something of higher quality and saved the $6 I spent purchasing this because you couldn&#x27;t even pay me to use this.  The first time I used it, I thought I had done something wrong, so I washed the next morning, and the day after that I tried again because I wanted to give it a second try.  I regret it.  It is absolutely awful dry shampoo, and here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) It is a wet formula, which feels very strange and actually requires the product to dry.  So I have to not other brush it through, but blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.) The smell of this product is overly strong.  Even after washing it in the shower, I could STILL smell the product after washing with my shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Your hair will not look clean.  It still looks very oily.&lt;br /&gt;4.) It doesn&#x27;t do anything to help the color or volume in your hair.  As someone with fine, limp hair, I always look for volumizing products.  This did not deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, don&#x27;t use this.  Save your money and purchase a nicer dry shampoo like Klorane or Batiste.</li>
            <li> I like it,  but find the scent really strong... not a bad smell,  but not one I&#x27;d choose. ... would rather it be unscented.</li>
            <li> Not the best. But considering it was like $3 I guess it&#x27;s okay. Smells and feels like hairspray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dry shampoos over the years because I have oily hair and unless I&#x27;m washing daily, I could use a boost. Most dry shampoos have such overwhelming fragrances... and Aussie does too. Oddly though, it smells like grape! In particular, a sparkling grape soda smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry shampoo product itself works well. It sprays out as a clear liquid, dries rapidly, and makes your hair look matte and fluffier. Five stars for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the grape fragrance? Why don&#x27;t these companies realize that we might not all want to smell like the dry shampoo we just applied? Just because our hair is oily doesn&#x27;t mean we stink so much that we need to mask it with strong (in this case candy) fragrance. Seriously, I don&#x27;t need to be reminded of applying dry shampoo all day. And don&#x27;t you think we might have a fragrance of our own we might want to wear??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars off, one for the strong fragrance, the other for the grape. But hey, if you want to smell like grape soda, the actual product works like advertised.</li>
            <li> This, is my new favorite Dry Shampoo.  The scent is the traditional scent and it is noticeable {in a nice way} to others if they get close to you and you&#x27;ve used it.  Helps my dyed-red hair color last due to limiting the water-washing. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair.  My hair gets oily and this doesn&#x27;t help that.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried just about every dry shampoo on the market: Alterna Caviar, Tigi Oh Bee Hive, Dove, Batiste, Not Your Mother&#x27;s, Tresemme, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Bumble and Bumble, and Amika are just a sampling of the myriad of dry shampoos I&#x27;ve use.  Aussie is the only one that made me itch so badly I had to wash my hair - over the course of about 20 hours it went from a slight itch which I initially simply attributed to dirty hair, to feeling like bugs were crawling over my scalp. Once I washed it out I was fine.</li>
            <li> It works well enough and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of product to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that the scent is way too strong, to the point where it was really starting to irritate me throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is tolerable. It won&#x27;t give soft flow you hair, but it does feel clean to be able to go to class.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo I ever tried so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too.  I personally really love it.  The first time I tried it, my hair was super greasy.  It needed shampooing but since I just got this, I decided to try it.  It worked wonders!  If I had to, I would&#x27;ve gone out.  That&#x27;s how good my hair looked.  It has that signature Aussie scent that I absolutely love and is really easy to use.  It even gives my hair some volume.  I sometimes use it as a light hairspray when I pull my bangs back.  It has some hold to it but not too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t know if I even would try another dry shampoo.  This product seems to do everything I need and then some.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 0 stars. This product is awful. I have used many different brands of dry shampoo in the past and this is by far the worst. The texture created by just one or two sprays is almost like hairspray. Its not soft, touchable or even brushable. And the scent is weirdly chemical-like. After a few hours, I swear my hair looks greasier than before I used it. A total miss on every level! Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little confused about all of the positive reviews for this product... I bought it for that reason and I&#x27;m really disappointed. I use dry shampoo all the time and this is by far my least favorite. It makes my hair look and feel like I have hairspray in it rather than soft and clean. It was very sticky and knotted up my hair. The only good thing about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo. It smells so fruity and fresh too, not like other dry shampoos that smell like straight chemicals. I sprayed it on my hair and it takes a few seconds to sink in and it definitely lasts for another couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this soon for sure and the price is right as well.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell, so I never feel like I can use it...</li>
            <li> Not sure what it did to my hair besides make it smell like cotton candy-- even after shampooing, some of the smell remained.  My hair was neither freshened nor pretty after using-- a weird grayish looking residue was on my hair after use.  This is seriously one of the grossest products I have ever used on my hair in my entire life.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this in the mail because I got it for a great price! I thought, &amp;#34;hey it&#x27;s Aussie, I don&#x27;t see why they would fragrance this like grapes... I wonder if it&#x27;s that bad&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, it was so terrible. It smelled exactly like children&#x27;s grape Dimetapp. I had to immediately wash my hair with normal shampoo and water. The scent was STILL there! Super disappointed about the smell because it seemed to soak up the oil in my hair pretty well. I just could not get past that horrible artificial grape fragrance.... I really wish Aussie would redo this dry shampoo with a different scent or none at all.</li>
            <li> Nice product but smell could be better</li>
            <li> Dry shampoos should be dry! This comes out wet and you have to let it dry before rubbing it in. Ends up stiff like hair spray and dried out the hair like I poured rubbing alcohol on it. Worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Use on my bangs almost daily (I always get my lotion in them!)  Works well without the powdery residue.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells like hairspray. Can&#x27;t even brush my hair after spraying this stuff. It is awful and definitely not &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend likes to have this product around because it works great for making her hair look and feel less greasy, and she likes using it to prepare her hair for an updo.  It won&#x27;t replace regular shampoo and actually washing your hair in the shower, but it&#x27;s a nice alternative to freshen up on a busy day.</li>
            <li> Remarkably bad product. I&#x27;ve been a fan both of Aussie products and dry shampoo. There&#x27;s a reason why this is the cheapest on Amazon: it sucks. Too much harsh chemical smell, comes out too wet, and is impossible to brush through. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, just shake the can and spray onto the roots of your hair.  Then comb through and style.  It adds fullness and lifts flat hair.  You can get ready to go in a hurry when you don’t have time to wash your hair.  This is safe for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave your hair soft but it felt a bit heavy on my hair.  This may be because my hair is very fine.  The bottle is large so it’s a good bargain and it leaves a fresh scent that lasts all day, however I wasn’t that fond of the heaviness or the smell which reminded me of watermelons or bubble gum.  That’s the reason I gave it four stars.  It’s still a good value and does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> We have a teenager who loves her dry shampoo for days when she can&#x27;t do a full shampoo routine.  Unfortunately she thought this one didn&#x27;t quite do as good a job as others in getting rid or or masking the grease.  She and I both loved the smell and she made the point that this is the only dry shampoo she has tried that didn&#x27;t leave a chalky residue over her hair after use.</li>
            <li> The Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Dry Shampoo works really well. It&#x27;s easy to use. It freshens up the hair with a pleasant, non-overwhelming scent, and mitigates the greasy hair look. It&#x27;s a great temporarily fix for the rest of the day until you can get to your regular shampoo routine. Unlike other dry shampoos that I have tried, this one doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a chalky residues over the hair. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ever used Dry Shampoo, I had a medical procedure and couldn&#x27;t wash my hair with water for a few days and wanted to feel clean.  This stuff is exactly like hair spray!  No exaggeration, exactly like hair spray! It was almost impossible to brush my hair after I sprayed the dry shampoo in it.  Even though I finally brushed it all, my hair still feels nasty, like a matted rat&#x27;s nest. I can&#x27;t wait to be able to take a shower and wash all of this out!!!  With all of this said, I must add, I love all other Aussie products.  I have used Aussie shampoo and conditioner for years and they are the highest quality shampoo and conditioner you can buy for the lower price.  The smell was strong, but it was a good smell at least, smelled just like their shampoo and conditioner that I use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I&#x27;ve tried many other dry shampoos, and this is my favorite. It not only takes care of excess oils in hair, but it adds volume and smells great. Doesn&#x27;t leave any white, frosty residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is disappointing because when applied to the roots of my hair it absorbed the oils mostly but it left my hair feeling dry, damaged and tangled. Also my dad said it had the scent of urinal cleaner! I&#x27;m very unhappy with this product</li>
            <li> Works well in absorbing oil and has a great scent.  Minimal white (powder) shows vs some other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different dry shampoos and I like this one the best. You really do have to shake it  A LOT to get the best results, if I don&#x27;t shake it enough, it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb the oil as well. I also dry my hair after I spray it and brush through it to evenly distribute the dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dyed blue and there is no white residue</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before so I was excited to try it. Overall I liked the results, gives you that fresh hair feeling if you are on a time crunch and can&#x27;t wash your hair. (I also think it would be great to take on a camping trip!) I thought the smell was pleasant, but read other reviews where they couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. I guess it&#x27;s one of those that you either love or hate the smell. I loved it, and was actually pleasantly surprised as I am sensitive to a lot of product scents. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t fond of was the output of the product. It felt like too much was coming out at one time, perhaps there is a learning curve to this. I would recommend this to anyone needing something on hand for a go to product to give their hair a boost without washing.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day to give my hair  volume and a fresh look. I just recently ordered more and love this product !</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo smells nice, just like all of the other Aussie Shampoos and conditioners, but it leaves my hair feeling as though its coated in something not so pleasant.  It feels chalky or something....I do like the way it smells, but I think I&#x27;ll be saving this for when I run out of the &amp;#34;Good Stuff&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo worked pretty well, although I felt it gave me a slight oily look at the base of my roots but the smell is not good. It has a strong scent of a flowery perfume type. The scent is just too strong and I would not even like it as a shampoo scent, but as dry shampoo it is even more prominent. It did seem to fluff up my unwashed hair, but it felt a little oily overall, so I am not sure how my hair would look at the end of the day as I ended up washing it out. I do not really recommend this and for the price of 10.99 I feel there has got to be a better choice out there. I did like that it was a spray though.</li>
            <li> Excellent dry shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave white residue all over your hair, but magically looks like you&#x27;ve washed your hair.  The signature Aussie scent makes hair seem fresh.  It&#x27;s much better than other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of dry shampoo. I have long curly hair. And when I straighten it, it takes forever. So I like to make a blowout last as long as possible.  Dry shampoo is a great product for those in between blow out days.  Some dry shampoos, though, do more damage than good. I have used some that seem to make my hair feel even more greasy instead of less. Aussie&#x27;s Total Miracle Dry Shampoo works great.  Just a few sprays at the hairline and my hair feels fresh and clean again. Unlike other dry shampoos, it does not weigh my hair down. It simply soaks up the extra oil, making my hair bouncy and feeling clean again. And of course, it has that trademark Aussie grape scent. I love it. I&#x27;ve gotten many comments of the smell of my hair.  This product also does not leave that &amp;#34;gray hair&amp;#34; look that some other dry shampoos seem to do. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply and is invisible on my hair.  It really changed the way my hair looked, even adding some fullness and body back into my roots.  However, it smells overly sweet like bathroom air freshener.  You know the kind at fast food joints or supermarkets?  Oh yeah, this stuff smells just like that stuff.  I&#x27;d really like this product if it weren&#x27;t for the scent.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without dry shampoo, having fine, greasy hair. While Aussie Miracle 7N1 isn&#x27;t changing the dry shampoo game, it is a great addition to the dry shampoo world. Just shake shake shake and spray on your roots. Run your fingers through your hair or brush the product in and you are done. The tapioca soaks up oil and your hair looks refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all dry shampoos, the finish is matte - you won&#x27;t look freshly showered and shiny, but nor will you look tired and greasy. It&#x27;s perfect for the late afternoon pick-me-up, after the gym or to give fine hair texture for styling. The scent is pretty strong, but I like that, and my hair looked clean for hours. Like most dry shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t do anything, really, that a little baby powder can&#x27;t do, but the smell and spray make it worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I agree we love the smell of this dry shampoo. It goes on wet and then dries once on your scalp. My daughter doesn&#x27;t like it as much as another dry shampoo she uses because she says the finish is more matte. However, it does a good job absorbing oil from your scalp. It doesn&#x27;t take much and one bottle will last for at least a couple months if it&#x27;s used every other day.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of dry shampoo. I only use it when I can&#x27;t shower and my hair is feeling greasy (the day after I wash it or at the end of a long night). I have tried about 6-7 different brands. My absolute favorite is also one of the cheapest: Psssssst dry shampoo. i was curious to see how Aussie compared since it is one of the shampoo brands in my regular washing rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the scent is AMAZING. It is a little strong, but if you need dry shampoo you are probably wanting to refresh the scent of your hair too. I personally love it. This dry shampoo made my hair look amazing! It did feel slightly tangly when I tried to run my fingers through my hair after using it. I kept brushing it and lessened the tangles, but eventually decided to deal with them. There was a slight powder in my hair, but it brushed out easily. It mostly collected on my brush. Did I mention that my hair looked AMAZING. Maybe even better than it does after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this Aussie Dry Shampoo to my Psssssst shampoo, Aussie makes my hair look better. However, I like the way the Psssssst makes my hair feel. I will now be using both of these dry shampoos depending on what I am trying to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this Aussie Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about the dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very oily, and I wash it daily or it starts to look horrible. So, if I cannot wash my hair on time, I start to feel very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;There comes the dry shampoo. It has quite strong smell, and the smell stays in my hair for hours. I like how easy it is to apply this shampoo - shake, spray and work into your hair. It adds back quite a lot of volume to my hair, so it does not look limp and oily any more, but it also makes the hair look quite matte. What I do not like, aside from the lingering smell, is that hair does not feel natural and soft to the touch. I do not see any residue, but my hair is not that dark, so I did not expect to see any.&lt;br /&gt;But it smells better then greasy hair, and the hair looks and feels better then dirty oily hair, I doubt I will use it often, but it looks like a good solution for emergencies like no water or no time.</li>
            <li> The thing that I noticed most about this dry shampoo is the scent.  It is a really strong and fake smelling floral fragrance that was pretty overwhelming when I first put it on and it took about an hour before it got to an acceptable level.  I usually wash my hair everyday but when I am ill or traveling sometimes that doesn&#x27;t happen.  In those cases, I like to have a dry shampoo handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A plus for this shampoo is that it was not at all powdery - it went on like hair spray.  Then to the bad, just like hair spray, it completely coated my hair and I could feel it rather than having a feeling that my hair was cleaner.  While it did make my hair feel and look better, that only lasted for about three hours.  The other brand that I use will give me a clean feeling all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would buy this brand again as I have one that I like better but if you are looking for a product that make your hair look cleaner for several hours and you don&#x27;t mind a heavy floral scent, this may be one that you can try.  Otherwise, I suggest you try other brands.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was overly sensitive to scented products until I tried this one. The smell left me with a headache/nausea combination that lasted throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing is they have a money back guarantee, so I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> Works really well! If you have thin hair, it also thickens our hair too making you&#x27;re hair look full, some people use it just to give there hair a thicker appearence. This particular dry shampoo comes out a little white so I would suggest only blonde&#x27;s and grey hair people use it.</li>
            <li> This product delivered as far as reviving my hair and making it look and feel cleaner.  I didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance, but the matte finish was the deal breaker for me.  When I used it the first time, it dulled my hair and muted the color.  When I used it again, that all got worse.  I will use it in a pinch to get through another day before washing my hair, but I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was something of an experiment for me. My skin has been getting drier than I want, and I decided to try to reduce the frequency of showers to see if it helped. (It did!) But I needed some way of freshening my hair, which tends to get &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; about 48 hours after regular washing. This mostly did the trick. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair as light as I like, but from a visual perspective it worked well.</li>
            <li> The Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Dry Shampoo, 4.9 Fluid Ounce came in handy during a recent trip to Florida. It certainly worked as billed. It has a nice scent and is easy to apply and use. It was quick and easy and worked great!</li>
            <li> Its really the opposite of what I was looing for, it got my scalp all dry, and it makes your hair get all stiff and not natural looking and when you spray it its kinda waterish, I ll keep on using suave dry shampoo 100 times better.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff and it&#x27;s so hard to find. I put it on even freshly cleaned hair to give my fine hair some volume.</li>
            <li> The smell is unpleasant, but it&#x27;s mattifying power beats any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. If they change the scent, I&#x27;d buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> My color-treated hair is the likely suspect why this didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shook the can vigorously as directed - squirted it on my roos and rubbed it in.  I lightly brushed the hair away from my scalp.  There was a bit of dandruff, but it was just a bit.  I wear my hair long and wavy.  I put water on my hands and scrunched the hair to put a bounce in it.  But the hair had a lot of static electricity, and it was dry at the ends, so I took a few drops of argan oil in my palms and worked through my ends. Then I put a bit more life into it.  It&#x27;s soft, but I think:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is good for camping or staying at a hostel.&lt;br /&gt;2. When the water goes out - and it does a lot here.&lt;br /&gt;3. Shampooing or washing with water the day after the shampoo (putting a bit of conditioner on the ends and rinse) is better, because the whole thing is that my hair is thin and like angel hair, so I need to not have product at the roots or it will get flat.&lt;br /&gt;4. After a shampoo or a water/conditioner wash, I feel clean, and I have a bit of lift to my hair.  Until the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was young (no perms or color) I had straight hair, and it was very oily, shiny and strong!  This product would have been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this on occasion.</li>
