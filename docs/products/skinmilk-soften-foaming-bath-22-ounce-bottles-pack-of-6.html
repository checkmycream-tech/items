            <li>My husband will love his bubblebaths with this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>One capful (My water pressure is pretty good</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Really nice foam and leaves the skin very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Skin Milk is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin really smooth, which is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Makes great bubbles and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff so much, I put it on my subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li>This product is so nice and soft in the bath water.  </li>
            <li>Great value compared to other body washes.</li>
            <li>The bubbles last for the whole bath and it feels great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I opened it right away .</li>
            <li>Since I use it almost daily, I got the box of six bottles and did the subscribe thing to get more every 3 months or so.  </li>
            <li>, if your water pressure is low it may take more than a capful.)</li>
            <li>Algemarin was better in one bottle than this is in an entire case.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle (I like long baths), and smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a wonderful soft smell, it is very thick and creamy and I would give it 10 stars if I could,</li>
            <li>I was going to order the 6 pack based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>So for about the price of a large fancy coffee you can soak in luxurious bubbles every day for a month.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell too perfumey, which can a lot of times be a turn off when something is really over powering.</li>
            <li>I have been using this great bubble bath for many years and just recently have been unable to find it at my local stores.</li>
            <li>one of the bottle caps was loose and leaked lucky</li>
            <li>I used to get this at a Walgreen&#x27;s in Ft Lauderdale, but I live in PA, and there is no Walgreen&#x27;s near me.  </li>
            <li>I live this soap and I would recommend it to anyone who loves feeling silky soft after a shower or bath.</li>
            <li>The bubbles are huge and they last a really long time.</li>
            <li>Smells great too; not an overpowering artificial smell.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much and it continues to bubble after you are in the bath for a while and turn the jets back on.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This company&#x27;s social policies, practices and performance place it among the worst/bottom 20% of companies rated by GoodGuide.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its anything great at all, I&#x27;m disappointed after all the hype.</li>
            <li>Free shipping, and the price is the same (or a little less) than Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li> skinmilk is the best milk bath ever.  It makes a ton of long lasting bubbles and softens your skin.  I have only one complaint and that is all the stores around here quit carrying it!!  Order it by the case now and can&#x27;t keep it stocked still. absolutely the best product</li>
            <li> smells great, works well.</li>
            <li> The best.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding this and I love it.  You don&#x27;t need to use much and it continues to bubble after you are in the bath for a while and turn the jets back on.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I used to get this at a Walgreen&#x27;s in Ft Lauderdale, but I live in PA, and there is no Walgreen&#x27;s near me.  Since I use it almost daily, I got the box of six bottles and did the subscribe thing to get more every 3 months or so.  Free shipping, and the price is the same (or a little less) than Walgreen&#x27;s.  It is very gentle (I like long baths), and smells lovely.  Not a flowery or fruity smell, either, so for you men out there who like baths (OK, bubbles) you needn&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll smell girly.  Try it!!</li>
            <li> My favorite bubble bath.  It&#x27;s hard to buy this product locally, so I buy it by the 6/case through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this bubble bath for over a year but when I ran out, I couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  I was excited to see it on Amazon.  The bubbles last for the whole bath and it feels great on the skin.  Smells great too; not an overpowering artificial smell.</li>
            <li> Best foaming bath around.  I would recommend SkinMilk to anyone who like to take a nice relaxing Bubble Bath.&lt;br /&gt;Also leaves your skin feeling really good.</li>
            <li> I was going to order the 6 pack based on the positive reviews.  I searched all over the net to find the ingredients since they  are not listed ??? I finally found them here:  [...]    Sodium Sesquicarbonate    Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate    Fragrance    Isopropyl Palmitate    Silica    Lactose    Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein Hydroxypropyl Polysiloxane    Vitamin D3    Vitamin E Acetate    Retinol Palmitate    Methyl Paraben    DMDM Hydantoin    See package label ingredients    Several are of health concern and it turns out that  \\&quot;Society:  This company&#x27;s social policies, practices and performance place it among the worst/bottom 20% of companies rated by GoodGuide.\\&quot;  I have decided not to purchase based on the above...you may choose to re-think this too.</li>
            <li> Skin Milk is fantastic. It makes loads of bubbles and foam without having to pour half the bottle in like with some bubble bath products. It smells delicious - like sweet, creamy milk - and it makes my skin feel soft and silky. I really love this stuff so much, I put it on my subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li> I have bought this in the Dallas area for several years, but it is difficult to find at the places that used to carry it.  It is a great skin softener and bubble bath, all at once.  Loved it before I moved back to Dallas, and it&#x27;s just as wonderful as always!</li>
            <li> My husband had very dry skin after his heart surgery and this helped him. He always took this if we went anywhere even to spend one night.</li>
            <li> I live this soap and I would recommend it to anyone who loves feeling silky soft after a shower or bath. I have been using this for over two years and I love , love, love it.</li>
            <li> Great bubbles, horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Wish I could still get this product.  Really nice foam and leaves the skin very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I buy this by the case, is the only bubble bath I have used for years.  Makes great bubbles and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best bubble bath I have ever used. The bubbles are huge and they last a really long time. I also really like the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell too perfumey, which can a lot of times be a turn off when something is really over powering. It also leaves my skin really smooth, which is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have been using this great bubble bath for many years and just recently have been unable to find it at my local stores. I was so excited to find it on Amazon! This is the best bubble bath I have ever used....At any price.  One capful (My water pressure is pretty good, if your water pressure is low it may take more than a capful.) gives me luxurious thick bubbles that last throughout the bath. I think a bottle lasts me about a month.  Guests even say it is good in the shower.  So for about the price of a large fancy coffee you can soak in luxurious bubbles every day for a month.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s had to find in the stores but I love the perfect bubble bath and this is it.</li>
            <li> This product is so nice and soft in the bath water.  I would definitely recommend and will be buying again soon...have to budget my money though, as it is not cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this product....</li>
            <li> I cannot find at any store and must purchase  online.&lt;br /&gt;This foaming bath makes me happier than the white rain product I used for a while.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful soft smell, it is very thick and creamy and I would give it 10 stars if I could,</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was so glad I had found it I was unhappy with the way it was shipped I received a damaged leaking box</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying in store, we use this instead of the big brand body washes in the market. They work great for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed. It has good reviews and that is why I bought it, everyone said it had good bubbles...blah, blah, blah....No, it doesn&#x27;t! It has mediocre bubbles! And it puts a soapy film in your tub that is soapy white. Sadly I am frugal and it was cheaper by the bottle to buy the case so I now have six bottles of this stuff to use up. I don&#x27;t think its anything great at all, I&#x27;m disappointed after all the hype. But isn&#x27;t it just always so? When EVERYONE says something is good, you expect it to be so and then it isn&#x27;t? Algemarin was better in one bottle than this is in an entire case.</li>
            <li> one of the bottle caps was loose and leaked lucky I opened it right away .</li>
            <li> Does not leave a soap feeling on your skin. Leaves you feeling very clean. Great value compared to other body washes.</li>
            <li> My husband will love his bubblebaths with this product.</li>
