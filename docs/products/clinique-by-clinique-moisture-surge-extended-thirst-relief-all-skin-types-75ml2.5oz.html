            <li>Love this face creme.  </li>
            <li>vendor is fast, well-packed, and good price.</li>
            <li>However, the product that i received has a strong plastic odor.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was going to be fine -</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t greasy, leaves skin feeling dewy and gives you tons of moisture, no harsh ingredients and is PERFECT for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise fantastic.</li>
            <li>This can also be applied lightly over makeup--</li>
            <li>It is oil free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight and fun to use.</li>
            <li>but this proved to be worth the risk.</li>
            <li>This soaks in right away</li>
            <li>Love this for summer especially.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smooth and keeps my skin hydrated especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li>it woke the whole cheek area up</li>
            <li>The color of the cream is solid light pink instead of a more transparent light pink.....</li>
            <li>I had a nice, quiet remission from rosacea and then bought this because during the winter my face seemed dry from a heater in the office.  </li>
            <li>NEW IN BOX.</li>
            <li>This was just what I was expecting, occasionally I have purchased this product from retailers and it has been very watery</li>
            <li>I keep her supplied year &#x27;round, nice little gift for Surprises...  </li>

            <li> Bought this from Buying Choices for a bargain.  Took over a week to ship and the product is not authentic.  Different color, texture,feel and smell.  Wanted to return but dropped it on the floorðŸ˜£</li>
            <li> One of my favorite moisturizers.  It goes on pretty smooth and keeps my skin hydrated especially during the winter.  Only thing lacking is SPF.  Otherwise fantastic.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. I&#x27;ve always had very dry skin that begins to peel just hours after putting on lotion in the morning. This soaks in right away and I&#x27;ve noticed substantially less flaking of my skin throughout the day! This can also be applied lightly over makeup--I keep one in my purse and dab a little on my nose/chin partway through the day if needed. It has also helped to reduce some visible wrinkle lines on my forehead. Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough!</li>
            <li> Smells like plastic. Nothing like its usual smell.</li>
            <li> my face feels so refreshed and supple! love it</li>
            <li> I had a nice, quiet remission from rosacea and then bought this because during the winter my face seemed dry from a heater in the office.  It is oil free so I thought it was going to be fine - it woke the whole cheek area up and now it&#x27;s red, inflammed and has bumps.  Sigh - watch out.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s number one crÃ¨me...  universal, hands, body... I keep her supplied year &#x27;round, nice little gift for Surprises...  vendor is fast, well-packed, and good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!  My mom loves it!!</li>
            <li> Came just as described.  NEW IN BOX.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every facial moisturizer you can think of. I love this. It&#x27;s so lightweight and fun to use. Isn&#x27;t greasy, leaves skin feeling dewy and gives you tons of moisture, no harsh ingredients and is PERFECT for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super disappointed! the product that i received looks exactly like the Clinique moisture surge that I have been using for the past 2 years. However, the product that i received has a strong plastic odor. It is not something that I would try to put on my face! The color of the cream is solid light pink instead of a more transparent light pink..... I want to rate zero star!</li>
            <li> Love this face creme.  Goes into skin without leaving a film on the surface.  Love this for summer especially.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was expecting, occasionally I have purchased this product from retailers and it has been very watery, I was a little hestitate to purchase on-line but this proved to be worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your face feeling greasy like some moisturizers</li>
            <li> excellente, very good</li>
