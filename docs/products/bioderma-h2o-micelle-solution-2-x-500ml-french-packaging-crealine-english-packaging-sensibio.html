            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This was one of my favorite beauty discoveries of 2013.</li>

            <li>I learned of this product fromhe famous makeup artist Lisa Eldridge on line tutorials because she uses it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much more dirt was on the pad.</li>
            <li>Simply the best.  </li>
            <li>so glad I can find this here.</li>
            <li>i love the bioderma crealine h2o...</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>...will be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And a lot of makeup artist and models use this and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am writing now. :)</li>
            <li>One of my girlfriends says this product feels pretty much good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful, gentle product that removes my make-up at the end of the day followed by a pure olive oil bar cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for an awesome fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is amazing for removing all traces of makeup easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>After I finished the Bioderma I&#x27;d purchased in Paris, I was looking to find out where to get it the most cheaply in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>Love it Very good for sensitive skin , gentle , can&#x27;t count how many bottle I been using this product.</li>
            <li>Just soak a cotton ball, leave over your eyes for twenty secs and all your makeup will easily come off.  </li>
            <li>product has a slightly strong chemical scent to it, but it goes away very quickly</li>
            <li>Most effective and gentle makeup remover</li>
            <li>did not breakout kept face clean helped make me feel more refreshed.</li>
            <li>just tried and this company in France sent me very quick way faster than their estimate</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most gentle (yet effective) makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>As soon as I&#x27;m about to run out I will certainly order more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, as it&#x27;s gentle and works  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed because the product felt only like water.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful makeup remover - it thoroughly cleanses the skin sans leaving dryness or an oily mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>But a lot of people have skin problem because they wash too much and break their own barrier</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was anything special, but when I went away and forgot to bring it with me, boy did I miss it!  </li>
            <li>gentle, effective and does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>I do this before cleansing at night also great when you are on the road to have some of this in a smaller bottle for make up fixes or just a way to clean your face when  you have no bathroom access.</li>
            <li>But man, it is worth it!</li>
            <li>If you are going to Europe, it is worth stock them up in your suitcase!</li>
            <li>It feels so lovely on my skin and really does cleanse!  </li>
            <li>Give me feel so clean and fresh !</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t give my any acne problem but clean up my makeup</li>
            <li>clean make up by one movement.</li>
            <li>(I have to use stronger remover for that), but it leaves my face feeling just absolutely clean.</li>
            <li>I used it to remove eye makeup, specially mascara.</li>
            <li>got super excited because I know a lot of youtube beauty gurus have been raving about this product.</li>
            <li>I first purchased it because of all the great reviews at different online sites/youtube, even though it is shipped overseas and you have to pay a lot for shipping.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>It is simple, nice and easy.</li>
            <li>If you want a really clean face with a gentle product, try this!</li>
            <li>the funny thing is that my baby had an eye infection, the doctor said I should clean only with warm water, it lasted forever</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is still worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth a reorder because of the price</li>
            <li>Worth the wait and</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>(I, personally, avoid products that must be scrubbed or rubbed into my skin to work effectively.)</li>
            <li>I found this brand in Hong Kong occasionally and fell in love with it after my first try!!</li>
            <li>Really soft and fresh!!</li>
            <li>I generally can remove all of my make up with one moistened cotton, making it more economical than seemingly cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>When it ran out I was happy to find a vendor that sells it, although it is much more expensive in the states.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle yet it removes all of my make up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup on a daily basis, but this product also works very well on special occasions when I wear a lot more.</li>
            <li>I bought the two-pack in October and I am still on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>thanks bioderma !</li>
            <li>Thanks to my aesthetician for the tip!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I needed from it.</li>
            <li>Initially, I bought this in Paris and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I just received my first Bioderma and I couldn&#x27;t help myself from not using the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it does the trick, I don&#x27;t think it is any better than an American made makeup wipe.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey</li>
            <li>I have super duper sensitive skin and it takes eye makeup,lipstick and face makeup off without stripping the skin in a harsh manner and cleans the face amazingly well!</li>
            <li>the product showed up a little ealier than we expected, and my girlfriend was very happy.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup, so I&#x27;m not sure how it does with that, but it is by far the most effective eye makeup remover for sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Gotta hand it to the French, this really works and lifts dirt better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It is really gentle and works really good even remove heavy waterproof make up.</li>
            <li>I got the large bottle and now that I know about this I will never use any other kind.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this is take it off really easily, but get the same results with Neutrogena or even Target brand makeup wipes.  </li>
            <li>I use it alone in the winter as a cleanser with just a cotton pad so that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, and then as just a makeup remover in the Summer when I&#x27;m a bit more oily and need a real cleanser. 1</li>
            <li>Even though I use a makeup remover first for makeup and mascara and such, I use this to feel clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li>feels very synthetic on skin.</li>
            <li>And it feels like you are using water in terms of how gentle it is.  </li>
            <li>beauty products on Amazon before, but it appears MiaDerma sells the real thing.  </li>
            <li>My face look really clean...love it....</li>
            <li>It really removes all the make up without letting my skin oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Bioderma and my skin feels cleansed and refreshed, ready for makeup application if i need to.</li>
            <li>I really recommended this product.</li>
            <li>What I received is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about this product that I just had to try it.  </li>
            <li>(Gentle cleansers like Cetiphil that have been recommended to me are gentle but don&#x27;t remove all the makeup and leave a film on my skin.)  </li>
            <li>gentle keep going until</li>
            <li>It really cleans my skin well.</li>
            <li>Really like it</li>
            <li>but this solution really feels so soothing - I have used it now for a couple of years and have had not problems with it.</li>
            <li>Hey really love this product but when yesterday I got this there is one empty bottle.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very gentle...feels like water.</li>
            <li>-Very gentle&lt;br /&gt;-Fragrance-free</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only downside is its inability to fully remove euro sunscreens (like its own Bioderma PhotoMax Lait), so following up with a trusted cleanser is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very gentle on skin but removes makeup completely!</li>
            <li>This price is a good deal compared with other sellers for the same product.</li>
            <li>As someone with dry, very sensitive skin I tried this product about a year ago and fell in LOVE.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to buy it during fashion week in NYC, the shelves are left bare</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, never irritates my skin and actually works like a great toner too because my skin is calmer and less red after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the shipping, which came directly from France, was fast as all heck!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty natural</li>
            <li>Completely unscented, leaves no residue, and feels exactly like water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than any other products that i have used and you can&#x27;t miss it!</li>
            <li>I hope amazon will start selling the new bioderma packaging with the pump!  </li>
            <li>Extremely gentle on my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this makeup remover.</li>
            <li>: A little bit goes a long way for light, non-waterproof makeup; I gently swipe (i.e., no rubbing or scrubbing) saturated cotton pads on my face, eyes, lips and neck area - and makeup is easily removed.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no scent, no weird residue left from the product and your eyes actually feel CLEAN.</li>
            <li>far, I really really like this product.</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong with this product if your looking for a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I normally wash my face after using makeup remover</li>
            <li>and we all easily committed to this simple daily regimen.  </li>
            <li>and  as soon as I started using this product to clean my baby&#x27;s eyes they suddenly felt better, no more eye infection !</li>
            <li>This is a new type of cleanser that I discovered by accident.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist based in New York.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wish it was more readily available in the USA and not so expensive, but I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li>I have very, very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>remove makeup easily！suitable for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>After my first bottle, I went back to my Target&#x27;s Sonia Kashuk but realized that it didn&#x27;t work as well as the bioderma.  </li>
            <li>The product is also available at Canadian pharmacies (for a bit less, per bottle) -</li>
            <li>I used to live in France , I have tried all ranges of product, my skin is sensitive and so are my eyes, I always suffer to remove make up, but since I started this product I am so happy, I brought amany botteles with me to USA, since they dont have it in store, I was sad when my stock was over, fortunatly, Amazon has almost everything !</li>
            <li>Clearly cleaned &#x27;n made my skin softy.</li>
            <li>Clear Bottle-</li>
            <li>At least I can say that  it&#x27;s ok for people with sensitive skin to use it.</li>
            <li>and I have acne skin, feel soft</li>
            <li>but it is gentle, especially for removing waterproof mascara</li>
            <li>so gentle…I use this on my 4 years old as well...</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t have to take that second step with this product.  </li>
            <li>just run the cotton pad around the face to remove face makeup... then rinse or wash with a gentle facial soap or foam...</li>
            <li>It removes any residue that is left and is gentle to my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no problems with this product</li>
            <li>but it was sensitive</li>
            <li>a bit expensive, mostly because of shipping costs, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use this product in the mornings to clean my face without harsh tap water, followed by Skinceuticals CE Ferulic or another C serum, then a euro sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s a lot of products out there that are gentle and work but not nearly as pricey.  </li>
            <li>I am taking medication for acne which makes my skin very, very unusually sensitive and reactive, and this is the only makeup removers I have found that is gentle enough</li>
            <li>Shipping is a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Not sure why it is so special, it just is.</li>
            <li>it does not dry my skin!</li>
            <li>Arrived a little later than promised (1 day), but other than that it was fine.</li>
            <li>Not that I would want to waste it, because it isn&#x27;t cheap due to it being an import.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after watching one of Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s videos on YouTube since I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much clearer and less prone to blemishes now.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and dry</li>
            <li>First heard of this prduct from a make up artist that swears by it you can use it as much as you need and never have to worry about it irritating your skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive red acne-prone oily skin that also gets very dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li>I have acquired a whole new sense of intensified allergies these past two years and this Bioderma product has been a savior of sorts!</li>

            <li> and I actually love it.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with bioderma when I traveled to France</li>
            <li> As soon as I wipe my face with Bioderma, my skin feels instantly refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This was one of my favorite beauty discoveries of 2013.</li>
            <li> It has zero smell and if you didn&#x27;t know better, you would think it was water</li>

            <li> I learned of this product fromhe famous makeup artist Lisa Eldridge on line tutorials because she uses it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much more dirt was on the pad.</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  </li>
            <li> so glad I can find this here.</li>
            <li> i love the bioderma crealine h2o...</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>

            <li> /&gt;And a lot of makeup artist and models use this and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I am writing now. :)</li>
            <li> One of my girlfriends says this product feels pretty much good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful, gentle product that removes my make-up at the end of the day followed by a pure olive oil bar cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for an awesome fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is amazing for removing all traces of makeup easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> After I finished the Bioderma I&#x27;d purchased in Paris, I was looking to find out where to get it the most cheaply in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> Love it Very good for sensitive skin , gentle , can&#x27;t count how many bottle I been using this product.</li>
            <li> Just soak a cotton ball, leave over your eyes for twenty secs and all your makeup will easily come off.  </li>
            <li> product has a slightly strong chemical scent to it, but it goes away very quickly</li>
            <li> Most effective and gentle makeup remover</li>
            <li> did not breakout kept face clean helped make me feel more refreshed.</li>
            <li> just tried and this company in France sent me very quick way faster than their estimate</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most gentle (yet effective) makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> As soon as I&#x27;m about to run out I will certainly order more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, as it&#x27;s gentle and works  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed because the product felt only like water.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful makeup remover - it thoroughly cleanses the skin sans leaving dryness or an oily mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> But a lot of people have skin problem because they wash too much and break their own barrier</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was anything special, but when I went away and forgot to bring it with me, boy did I miss it!  </li>
            <li> gentle, effective and does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I do this before cleansing at night also great when you are on the road to have some of this in a smaller bottle for make up fixes or just a way to clean your face when  you have no bathroom access.</li>
            <li> But man, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> If you are going to Europe, it is worth stock them up in your suitcase!</li>
            <li> It feels so lovely on my skin and really does cleanse!  </li>
            <li> Give me feel so clean and fresh !</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t give my any acne problem but clean up my makeup</li>
            <li> clean make up by one movement.</li>
            <li> (I have to use stronger remover for that), but it leaves my face feeling just absolutely clean.</li>
            <li> I used it to remove eye makeup, specially mascara.</li>
            <li> got super excited because I know a lot of youtube beauty gurus have been raving about this product.</li>
            <li> I first purchased it because of all the great reviews at different online sites/youtube, even though it is shipped overseas and you have to pay a lot for shipping.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> It is simple, nice and easy.</li>
            <li> If you want a really clean face with a gentle product, try this!</li>
            <li> the funny thing is that my baby had an eye infection, the doctor said I should clean only with warm water, it lasted forever</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> but it is still worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth a reorder because of the price</li>
            <li> Worth the wait and</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> (I, personally, avoid products that must be scrubbed or rubbed into my skin to work effectively.)</li>
            <li> I found this brand in Hong Kong occasionally and fell in love with it after my first try!!</li>
            <li> Really soft and fresh!!</li>
            <li> I generally can remove all of my make up with one moistened cotton, making it more economical than seemingly cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> When it ran out I was happy to find a vendor that sells it, although it is much more expensive in the states.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle yet it removes all of my make up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup on a daily basis, but this product also works very well on special occasions when I wear a lot more.</li>
            <li> I bought the two-pack in October and I am still on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> thanks bioderma !</li>
            <li> Thanks to my aesthetician for the tip!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I needed from it.</li>
            <li> Initially, I bought this in Paris and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I just received my first Bioderma and I couldn&#x27;t help myself from not using the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it does the trick, I don&#x27;t think it is any better than an American made makeup wipe.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey</li>
            <li> I have super duper sensitive skin and it takes eye makeup,lipstick and face makeup off without stripping the skin in a harsh manner and cleans the face amazingly well!</li>
            <li> the product showed up a little ealier than we expected, and my girlfriend was very happy.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup, so I&#x27;m not sure how it does with that, but it is by far the most effective eye makeup remover for sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Gotta hand it to the French, this really works and lifts dirt better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It is really gentle and works really good even remove heavy waterproof make up.</li>
            <li> I got the large bottle and now that I know about this I will never use any other kind.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this is take it off really easily, but get the same results with Neutrogena or even Target brand makeup wipes.  </li>
            <li> I use it alone in the winter as a cleanser with just a cotton pad so that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, and then as just a makeup remover in the Summer when I&#x27;m a bit more oily and need a real cleanser. 1</li>
            <li> Even though I use a makeup remover first for makeup and mascara and such, I use this to feel clean afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup very well.</li>
            <li> feels very synthetic on skin.</li>
            <li> And it feels like you are using water in terms of how gentle it is.  </li>
            <li> beauty products on Amazon before, but it appears MiaDerma sells the real thing.  </li>
            <li> My face look really clean...love it....</li>
            <li> It really removes all the make up without letting my skin oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Bioderma and my skin feels cleansed and refreshed, ready for makeup application if i need to.</li>
            <li> I really recommended this product.</li>
            <li> What I received is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this product that I just had to try it.  </li>
            <li> (Gentle cleansers like Cetiphil that have been recommended to me are gentle but don&#x27;t remove all the makeup and leave a film on my skin.)  </li>
            <li> gentle keep going until</li>
            <li> It really cleans my skin well.</li>
            <li> Really like it</li>
            <li> but this solution really feels so soothing - I have used it now for a couple of years and have had not problems with it.</li>
            <li> Hey really love this product but when yesterday I got this there is one empty bottle.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very gentle...feels like water.</li>
            <li> -Very gentle&lt;br /&gt;-Fragrance-free</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only downside is its inability to fully remove euro sunscreens (like its own Bioderma PhotoMax Lait), so following up with a trusted cleanser is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very gentle on skin but removes makeup completely!</li>
            <li> This price is a good deal compared with other sellers for the same product.</li>
            <li> As someone with dry, very sensitive skin I tried this product about a year ago and fell in LOVE.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to buy it during fashion week in NYC, the shelves are left bare</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, never irritates my skin and actually works like a great toner too because my skin is calmer and less red after I use it.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the shipping, which came directly from France, was fast as all heck!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty natural</li>
            <li> Completely unscented, leaves no residue, and feels exactly like water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than any other products that i have used and you can&#x27;t miss it!</li>
            <li> I hope amazon will start selling the new bioderma packaging with the pump!  </li>
            <li> Extremely gentle on my sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this makeup remover.</li>
            <li> : A little bit goes a long way for light, non-waterproof makeup; I gently swipe (i.e., no rubbing or scrubbing) saturated cotton pads on my face, eyes, lips and neck area - and makeup is easily removed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no scent, no weird residue left from the product and your eyes actually feel CLEAN.</li>
            <li> far, I really really like this product.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product if your looking for a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I normally wash my face after using makeup remover</li>
            <li> and we all easily committed to this simple daily regimen.  </li>
            <li> and  as soon as I started using this product to clean my baby&#x27;s eyes they suddenly felt better, no more eye infection !</li>
            <li> This is a new type of cleanser that I discovered by accident.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist based in New York.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish it was more readily available in the USA and not so expensive, but I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> remove makeup easily！suitable for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> After my first bottle, I went back to my Target&#x27;s Sonia Kashuk but realized that it didn&#x27;t work as well as the bioderma.  </li>
            <li> The product is also available at Canadian pharmacies (for a bit less, per bottle) -</li>
            <li> I used to live in France , I have tried all ranges of product, my skin is sensitive and so are my eyes, I always suffer to remove make up, but since I started this product I am so happy, I brought amany botteles with me to USA, since they dont have it in store, I was sad when my stock was over, fortunatly, Amazon has almost everything !</li>
            <li> Clearly cleaned &#x27;n made my skin softy.</li>
            <li> Clear Bottle-</li>
            <li> At least I can say that  it&#x27;s ok for people with sensitive skin to use it.</li>
            <li> and I have acne skin, feel soft</li>
            <li> but it is gentle, especially for removing waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> so gentle…I use this on my 4 years old as well...</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t have to take that second step with this product.  </li>
            <li> just run the cotton pad around the face to remove face makeup... then rinse or wash with a gentle facial soap or foam...</li>
            <li> It removes any residue that is left and is gentle to my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had no problems with this product</li>
            <li> but it was sensitive</li>
            <li> a bit expensive, mostly because of shipping costs, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the mornings to clean my face without harsh tap water, followed by Skinceuticals CE Ferulic or another C serum, then a euro sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a lot of products out there that are gentle and work but not nearly as pricey.  </li>
            <li> I am taking medication for acne which makes my skin very, very unusually sensitive and reactive, and this is the only makeup removers I have found that is gentle enough</li>
            <li> Shipping is a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is so special, it just is.</li>
            <li> it does not dry my skin!</li>
            <li> Arrived a little later than promised (1 day), but other than that it was fine.</li>
            <li> Not that I would want to waste it, because it isn&#x27;t cheap due to it being an import.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after watching one of Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s videos on YouTube since I have dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much clearer and less prone to blemishes now.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and dry</li>
            <li> First heard of this prduct from a make up artist that swears by it you can use it as much as you need and never have to worry about it irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive red acne-prone oily skin that also gets very dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> I have acquired a whole new sense of intensified allergies these past two years and this Bioderma product has been a savior of sorts!</li>
            <li> star off for the high prices online compared to any ordinary French pharmacy...</li>
            <li> takes off all my make-up, even the stuff left over after washing my face, cleanses my skin making it feels refreshed, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> For someone using bioderma every single night, this dispenser makes a big difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it did&#x27;nt take so long to get here</li>
            <li> I have used for makeup remove for a long time.</li>
            <li> and I think it does help the skin heal or at least calm down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other cleansing waters and nothing compares to this,</li>
            <li> Iove this stuff, never going back to any other make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Also, since it comes from France and it wasn&#x27;t delivered to my doorstep without a signature and had to make a trip to the post office - not a big deal but a slight inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store here in the US</li>
            <li> negative is that it is way more expensive here in the US than in Europe</li>
            <li> it is so widely used.</li>
            <li> , I only need a few drops on 1 cotton pad.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much product I use, I have not experienced any skin irritation (i.e., no redness, no itching, no stinging, no skin bumps and so forth).</li>
            <li> gentle and non irritating yet removes ALL your makeup without having to reapply over and over again.</li>
            <li> also hate paying any kind of shipping</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try Bioderma makeup remover due to seeing it hyped up by the youtube beauty community.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an extreme stance on animal testing, but prefer to not support companies who do.  </li>
            <li> no more traces of makeup/dirt are left.  </li>
            <li> I had recently been given a small bottle of Bioderma from a friend who had been to Paris on vacation.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to break out after using Bioderma for a few days or if my skin is going to dry out.</li>
            <li> No use rubbing hard, you will only irritate your skin with the friction.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of Bioderma, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Only negative point is the price.  </li>
            <li> you need to put some on a cotton pad and hold it to the eye with the eye closed for a few seconds</li>
            <li> The only major downsides are: can&#x27;t buy it in local stores; shipping is expensive; product is expensive and you have to use enough product to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t have to use as much as other removers because it works so well!</li>
            <li> I have now bought about a half dozen bottles of Bioderma.</li>
            <li> but u just soak ur heavy mascara a little bit longer with the wet cotton pad then TADA!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> Some said this item might not work well for heavy mascara</li>
            <li> When I wash with water and cleansers it seems to make the dryness worse but it has always been the only way to get all the makeup off my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Less than 5 days I received it!</li>
            <li> It works when I take off heavy eye makeup or when Im too lazy to wash my face.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I purchased Liquid Push Down</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of mascara and some of them are like waterproof, so a little hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> Use this everyday to remove eye makeup or face make up when I&#x27;m too tired to use my other routine.</li>
            <li> I also use this as a cleanser in the morning or when I am feeling a bit lazy.</li>
            <li> 500ML lasts me for at LEAST 3 months.</li>
            <li> , I saw other reviews indicating that people received fake products from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Though Sears now carries it, the markup is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> And I think it&#x27;s a little expensive here in U.S.A</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to rub my eyes very hard to remove the mascara.  </li>
            <li> It gets off all of my eye make up, INCLUDING waterproof mascara, without irritating my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Does not immediately cure acne, but doesn&#x27;t make it worse</li>
            <li> Expensive though, wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> know some people feel weird wiping face without washing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally like I just washed my face with cold water.</li>
            <li> (However you will have a pile of dirty cotton balls when you are done.  </li>
            <li> it is very expensive in NY</li>
            <li> Smells bad, although it says it has no smell.</li>
            <li> :( (After I started using Bioderma,I don&#x27;t get that</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my favorite item. It is simple, nice and easy. I love it so much. 2X500ml is good deal.</li>
            <li> Bioderma is a very good product. I like it very much!!!! Is the best product to take of the make up.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive skin and this is the only thing i have found that allows me to take my makeup off without leaving my face redder, and there&#x27;s no need to tug. it&#x27;s like magic in a bottle. a bit expensive, mostly because of shipping costs, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love it use that I have oily skin and I have acne skin, feel soft and I still buy</li>
            <li> No wonders, no effect. Smells bad, although it says it has no smell. Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup very well. feels very synthetic on skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I bought the two-pack in October and I am still on my first bottle.  This is stuff is authentic Bioderma and the product itself is amazing for removing makeup.  Use it on a cottonpad every night.  I also bought travel containers at the container store so I can bring this stuff with me on trips...it is THAT good.  Would recommend this seller and product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best gentle cleanser EVER!!! Wish it was easier to get in the States!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! Removes even my mascara.</li>
            <li> remove makeup easily！suitable for sensitive skin! I bought it in China before. And I think it&#x27;s a little expensive here in U.S.A</li>
            <li> Ordered two received just one...?</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching one of Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s videos on YouTube since I have dry and sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t sell this in the U.S. because it takes off makeup SO MUCH better than any makeup remover (oil based or wipes). I use it alone in the winter as a cleanser with just a cotton pad so that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out, and then as just a makeup remover in the Summer when I&#x27;m a bit more oily and need a real cleanser. 1 500ML lasts me for at LEAST 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have now bought about a half dozen bottles of Bioderma. It removes all of my make up, including waterproof mascara, without rubbing, dryness, irritation, stinging or redness. I generally can remove all of my make up with one moistened cotton, making it more economical than seemingly cheaper brands. I also use this as a cleanser in the morning or when I am feeling a bit lazy. There is no scent. It works like a dream. This is why I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for cleaning my face each night.</li>
            <li> Literally the best make up remover there is. Discovered it while vacationing in Spain and had to find it again stateside. One cotton ball doused in bioderma and all my eye makeup is magically gone...Liner, mascara, shadow.  It takes it all off, swipe, swipe.  And it feels like you are using water in terms of how gentle it is.  I could pour this in my eye and it wouldn&#x27;t irritate me.  Not that I would want to waste it, because it isn&#x27;t cheap due to it being an import.  But man, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I really love this product, it is so gentle and best of all it does not dry my skin! Gets all the makeup off and leaves my face feeling nice and fresh, but most importantly CLEAN :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to everybody that i know :)</li>
            <li> After I finished the Bioderma I&#x27;d purchased in Paris, I was looking to find out where to get it the most cheaply in the U.S.  Though Sears now carries it, the markup is ridiculous.  I&#x27;ve been burned buying &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; beauty products on Amazon before, but it appears MiaDerma sells the real thing.  Still more expensive than buying it in Europe, but I guess it&#x27;s cheaper when you factor in the cost of airfare. ;-)</li>
            <li> I am using this product for over 10 years and nothing comes close to it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a great value for your money</li>
            <li> This price is a good deal compared with other sellers for the same product. I&#x27;ve used this for several years. The quality is good.</li>
            <li> i feel really comfortable after using it! fantastic! it&#x27;s better than any other products that i have used and you can&#x27;t miss it!</li>
            <li> I used to live in France , I have tried all ranges of product, my skin is sensitive and so are my eyes, I always suffer to remove make up, but since I started this product I am so happy, I brought amany botteles with me to USA, since they dont have it in store, I was sad when my stock was over, fortunatly, Amazon has almost everything ! the funny thing is that my baby had an eye infection, the doctor said I should clean only with warm water, it lasted forever and  as soon as I started using this product to clean my baby&#x27;s eyes they suddenly felt better, no more eye infection ! thanks bioderma !</li>
            <li> When I visited Paris a local gave me this beauty tip. Never wash your face with soap or cleanser again once you have this product. Use a cosmetic pad and wipe away makeup (eyes too). It is the best! You won&#x27;t be able to buy it during fashion week in NYC, the shelves are left bare it is so widely used. I bought it for my daughters and we all easily committed to this simple daily regimen.  None of us are fashion models, either. We just care about our skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it when I saw it in YouTube. I sent one one to my sis also. We have different type of skin. Both of us love it. I think it is extremely gorgeous. I love this water type of makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful makeup remover - it thoroughly cleanses the skin sans leaving dryness or an oily mess. Especially welcome for sensitive or reactive skin. It is pricey, but worth it. My skin is so much clearer and less prone to blemishes now. Thanks to my aesthetician for the tip!</li>
            <li> This is a new type of cleanser that I discovered by accident.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  The water really is a wonderful cleanser and easy&lt;br /&gt;to use.  I use it every morning and night on a cotton pad</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I needed from it. First heard of this prduct from a make up artist that swears by it you can use it as much as you need and never have to worry about it irritating your skin. Takes ALL make-up off. I do this before cleansing at night also great when you are on the road to have some of this in a smaller bottle for make up fixes or just a way to clean your face when  you have no bathroom access.</li>
            <li> nothing else works for me</li>
            <li> After I got them.... My face look really clean...love it....</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 years. It won&#x27;t give my any acne problem but clean up my makeup</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there to remove makeup and just the grimm from your day. Wish it did&#x27;nt take so long to get here but it is still worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Clearly cleaned &#x27;n made my skin softy.Also smells good.It can be the best remover I&#x27;ve ever used.I really love it,thx:)</li>
            <li> I have acquired a whole new sense of intensified allergies these past two years and this Bioderma product has been a savior of sorts! There&#x27;s no scent, no weird residue left from the product and your eyes actually feel CLEAN. Beautiful packaging. Not to mention the shipping, which came directly from France, was fast as all heck! Less than 5 days I received it!</li>
            <li> I saw this product being used (and raved about) on You Tube and decided to get it.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, as it&#x27;s gentle and works  but there&#x27;s a lot of products out there that are gentle and work but not nearly as pricey.  I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s worth a reorder because of the price but it is gentle, especially for removing waterproof mascara (and I use a ton of wp mascara!).  Also, since it comes from France and it wasn&#x27;t delivered to my doorstep without a signature and had to make a trip to the post office - not a big deal but a slight inconvenience.  The biggest prohibition on this product is the price.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever.  Takes off makeu-up.  No break outs.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> clean make up by one movement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 15 days now. It really removes all the make up without letting my skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simply great! Going to keep purchasing this product for sure!</li>
            <li> This company never sent me the product. After a month and a half,I ask for my money back. It took a while for this company to knowledge my complains.</li>
            <li> Its great at removing eye makeup without rubbing at your eyes. Does not leave any oily film on the eyes. I have repurchased this product, which says it all!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Very gentle on skin but removes makeup completely! My makeup kit is never without this now.</li>
            <li> Love it Very good for sensitive skin , gentle , can&#x27;t count how many bottle I been using this product.</li>
            <li> The best makeup remover!! Initially, I bought this in Paris and fell in love with it. When it ran out I was happy to find a vendor that sells it, although it is much more expensive in the states. I have never has a makeup remover not sting and also remove all my makeup, this is amazing.  Just soak a cotton ball, leave over your eyes for twenty secs and all your makeup will easily come off.  I have tried all types of make up removers, oils, Vaseline, ponds, and so on but this beats it all!</li>
            <li> Edited Review:  I went from 2 stars to 5 stars.  I am still on my 2nd bottle and I actually love it.  After my first bottle, I went back to my Target&#x27;s Sonia Kashuk but realized that it didn&#x27;t work as well as the bioderma.  I went back to the 2nd bottle.  I only had the issue of my eyes stinging a couple of times (hence the 2 star review) but I haven&#x27;t had the issue since, even when I rub around my eye to remove my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also hate paying any kind of shipping but after doing the math the sonia kashuk is $0.078/ml vs bioderm is $0.054/ml.&lt;br /&gt;Buying 2 pack is the cheapest I have seen online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this makeup remover. I hope amazon will start selling the new bioderma packaging with the pump!  In the mean time I purchased Liquid Push Down Alcohol Dispenser- Clear Bottle- Labeled - 9 Oz Bottle on amazon which has been a life saver!  For someone using bioderma every single night, this dispenser makes a big difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Post:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of this.  I bought this after recommendation from a make-up guru on youtube.  I think it&#x27;s pretty natural but it stings my eye when I remove my eye makeup.  I have 2 big bottles that will probably last me several months so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I&#x27;ll be going back to my holy grail makeup remover from Sonia Kashuk at Target.  Oh well.....</li>
            <li> love love love!!!  takes off all my make-up, even the stuff left over after washing my face, cleanses my skin making it feels refreshed, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I use it morning and night!</li>
            <li> so gentle…I use this on my 4 years old as well...</li>
            <li> There are a lot of fakes out there but this product is not one of them. Same packaging, same scent and takes off your makeup the same way! I fell in love with bioderma when I traveled to France and I&#x27;d be heartbroken if I didn&#x27;t find a seller on amazon who sells it. I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Arrived a little later than promised (1 day), but other than that it was fine.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday to remove eye makeup or face make up when I&#x27;m too tired to use my other routine. It never leaves my skin red. It&#x27;s gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> I just received my first Bioderma and I couldn&#x27;t help myself from not using the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered Bioderma on the 7th, and on Amazon, it said that the estimated delivery date will be sometime during Jan 28th to Feb 9th. And I got my package today! (Jan 15th). Thank you so much for an awesome fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got super excited because I know a lot of youtube beauty gurus have been raving about this product. So as soon as I got the package, I opened it and I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a slightly strong chemical scent to it, but it goes away very quickly so I don&#x27;t have a problem with it. As soon as I wipe my face with Bioderma, my skin feels instantly refreshing. It&#x27;s literally like I just washed my face with cold water. And it gets rid of all the make up I had on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination, acne-prone skin. So I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m going to break out after using Bioderma for a few days or if my skin is going to dry out. (Hopefully not!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I really really like this product. Maybe I&#x27;ll write another review of it after using this for the rest of the month and see how my face is.</li>
            <li> This removes all of my eye and face make up. It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes like other products I have used. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It has not made me break out. I take this with me camping and I don&#x27;t worry about washing my face with water. I use Bioderma and my skin feels cleansed and refreshed, ready for makeup application if i need to. I love this product. Shipping is a little pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best make up remover I have ever used, and the bottles are HUGE!  It gets off all of my eye make up, INCLUDING waterproof mascara, without irritating my eyes.  Even though it&#x27;s a pain to try and find, I will always try and get this stuff when I can.</li>
            <li> This was one of my favorite beauty discoveries of 2013. It is amazing for removing all traces of makeup easily and quickly. It has zero smell and if you didn&#x27;t know better, you would think it was water (although I got it on my lips once and it does not taste like water -- bleh). Full disclosure: I don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup, so I&#x27;m not sure how it does with that, but it is by far the most effective eye makeup remover for sensitive eyes I have ever tried. It does not leave an oily residue, either, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try Bioderma makeup remover due to seeing it hyped up by the youtube beauty community.  I just had PRK (Lasik) surgery on my eyes, so I wanted a really effective makeup remover so I didn&#x27;t have to rub my eyes very hard to remove the mascara.  While it does the trick, I don&#x27;t think it is any better than an American made makeup wipe.  I wear a lot of mascara and some of them are like waterproof, so a little hard to get off.  I was expecting this is take it off really easily, but get the same results with Neutrogena or even Target brand makeup wipes.  I will used both bottles happily, but won&#x27;t repurchase.  There is zero scent, which is a plus for me.  The consistency is watery, but since it works, it&#x27;s not a problem.  I also found out from a friend that Bioderma tests on animals.  I don&#x27;t have an extreme stance on animal testing, but prefer to not support companies who do.  I have not found any solid proof on the internet yet that they do....</li>
            <li> Gotta hand it to the French, this really works and lifts dirt better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. I used it to remove eye makeup, specially mascara. It does the trick. But it can be used for entire face and neck. I used it also after the gym.</li>
            <li> This is the best product which I used it.It is really gentle and works really good even remove heavy waterproof make up.My skin is sensitive and dry and I can use it for my face and eyes.I really recommended this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best!!! Believe me!!!! I found this brand in Hong Kong occasionally and fell in love with it after my first try!! Really soft and fresh!! Can remove make ups really quick!!</li>
            <li> Most effective and gentle makeup remover I have ever used.  I cannot believe how well it works.  I normally wash my face after using makeup remover but I really don&#x27;t have to take that second step with this product.  A side note, I saw other reviews indicating that people received fake products from Amazon.  I did not have that problem.  What I received is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effectively wear my make up off. Some said this item might not work well for heavy mascara but u just soak ur heavy mascara a little bit longer with the wet cotton pad then TADA!</li>
            <li> As someone with dry, very sensitive skin I tried this product about a year ago and fell in LOVE. Its magic water, never irritates, breaks me out or burns my hypersensitive skin. It works when I take off heavy eye makeup or when Im too lazy to wash my face. You cannot go wrong with this product if your looking for a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I love Bioderma skin cleanser, it is the best!  You don&#x27;t have to wash your face and it takes mascara off like a dream!  It&#x27;s a great product that doesn&#x27;t break your bank!</li>
            <li> Very good! Recommend.</li>
            <li> One of my girlfriends says this product feels pretty much good. That&#x27;s why I bought it. I don&#x27;t use it very often. At least I can say that  it&#x27;s ok for people with sensitive skin to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product while in Paris last year. I forgot to pack my eye makeup remover, so I decided to give it a try to this one. It&#x27;s very gentle, but incredible effective in removing every bit of makeup. I&#x27;m happy that Amazon sells it. I will never use another eye makeup remover again! You will love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product , it really clean your skin very good I will raccomand it to every lady that wants to have beautiful skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this product that I just had to try it.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure it was anything special, but when I went away and forgot to bring it with me, boy did I miss it!  I had to use several makeup remover pads to get my eye makeup off and with this, I only need a few drops on 1 cotton pad.  It really is great, now that I&#x27;ve done a real comparison.  I will probably repurchase.  I wish it was easier to buy in the US, that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I love Bioderma.  I first purchased it because of all the great reviews at different online sites/youtube, even though it is shipped overseas and you have to pay a lot for shipping.  I have very sensitive red acne-prone oily skin that also gets very dry and flaky.  When I wash with water and cleansers it seems to make the dryness worse but it has always been the only way to get all the makeup off my oily skin.  (Gentle cleansers like Cetiphil that have been recommended to me are gentle but don&#x27;t remove all the makeup and leave a film on my skin.)  I was skeptical of Bioderma, but it works very well.  Removes all makeup.  (However you will have a pile of dirty cotton balls when you are done.  No use rubbing hard, you will only irritate your skin with the friction.  Just thoroughly soak each cotton ball and gentle keep going until no more traces of makeup/dirt are left.  Works for all makeup, even waterproof.)  It is very gentle, never irritates my skin and actually works like a great toner too because my skin is calmer and less red after I use it.  Does not immediately cure acne, but doesn&#x27;t make it worse and I think it does help the skin heal or at least calm down.  The only major downsides are: can&#x27;t buy it in local stores; shipping is expensive; product is expensive and you have to use enough product to get the job done.  Summary of pros: removes all makeup/dirt; doesn&#x27;t irritate skin; calms skin and helps it heal and lessens redness.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product fromhe famous makeup artist Lisa Eldridge on line tutorials because she uses it.This stuff is amazing! I have super duper sensitive skin and it takes eye makeup,lipstick and face makeup off without stripping the skin in a harsh manner and cleans the face amazingly well! I got the large bottle and now that I know about this I will never use any other kind.</li>
            <li> This is a thumbs up for me. I use it as a make remover or just a refresher. It really cleans my skin well. I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product. I have cleaned my face with my electronic cleaner and re-cleaned it with some Crealine on a cotton pad. I was amazed at how much more dirt was on the pad. If you want a really clean face with a gentle product, try this!</li>
            <li> The best makeup remover ever!&lt;br /&gt;So gentle, effective and does not leave a residue.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I found this in France about three years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using this since. This is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve found/tried. It is so gentle yet it removes all of my make up quickly.  Only negative point is the price.  A Two-bottle set only costs about 10 euros in France.  If you are going to Europe, it is worth stock them up in your suitcase!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! Expensive though, wish it was cheaper. Removed makup wonderfully and FRESH.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I have used for makeup remove for a long time. Really like it</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  I&#x27;ve tried several other cleansing waters and nothing compares to this, so glad I can find this here.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye remover</li>
            <li> i love the bioderma crealine h2o... it removes eye and face makeup with ease and does not sting... you need to put some on a cotton pad and hold it to the eye with the eye closed for a few seconds so the solution softens the eye makeup and then just wipe it off.... just run the cotton pad around the face to remove face makeup... then rinse or wash with a gentle facial soap or foam... love it and will be reordering when i finish it....</li>
            <li> Beaty experts rave about this and I can see why. Not sure why it is so special, it just is. Not the best for my waterproof mascara removal (I have to use stronger remover for that), but it leaves my face feeling just absolutely clean. Worth the wait and well worth the price. You need this.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product... I love it. Even though I use a makeup remover first for makeup and mascara and such, I use this to feel clean afterwards.  It removes any residue that is left and is gentle to my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  I love this...will be purchasing more.  Wish it was sold in the USA.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly in removing makeup.</li>
            <li> I discovered this amazing cleanser from watching beauty expert Lisa Eldrige&#x27;s video tips.  It feels so lovely on my skin and really does cleanse!  I have very sensitive skin but this solution really feels so soothing - I have used it now for a couple of years and have had not problems with it.</li>
            <li> Hey really love this product but when yesterday I got this there is one empty bottle. I want you to deal with this either resend me one or return my money.</li>
            <li> Amazing product to remove makeup. It&#x27;s pretty pricey but I definitely recommend it!  I have sensitive skin and had no problems with this product, it&#x27;s very gentle...feels like water.</li>
            <li> I am taking medication for acne which makes my skin very, very unusually sensitive and reactive, and this is the only makeup removers I have found that is gentle enough that doesn&#x27;t make my skin sting.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Love this Micelle Solution...wouldn&#x27;t be caught without a bottle and a spare!!</li>
            <li> Great face cleanser and makeup remover. Good to use when you don&#x27;t want to put water on your face example patient in hospital. Used it on my face and body when I was in the hospital  did not breakout kept face clean helped make me feel more refreshed. Some face wipes make me feel sticky after use but not this.</li>
            <li> -Very gentle&lt;br /&gt;-Fragrance-free&lt;br /&gt;-non oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff takes it all off, even waterproof makeup. I wish it was more readily available in the USA and not so expensive, but I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard good things about Bioderma Crealine H2O from a colleague who is originally from France. Her mother ships several bottles at a time, and my colleague offered to give me one. At first I wasn&#x27;t too impressed because the product felt only like water. I then realized that is precisely what makes this product so awesome. It feel likes water (hence, the H2O) yet it effortlessly and effectively removes makeup. Best of all, it is incredibly gentle. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup on a daily basis, but this product also works very well on special occasions when I wear a lot more.* No matter how much product I use, I have not experienced any skin irritation (i.e., no redness, no itching, no stinging, no skin bumps and so forth). The product is also available at Canadian pharmacies (for a bit less, per bottle) - but I&#x27;m very happy it is also available on Amazon (two bottles at time!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: A little bit goes a long way for light, non-waterproof makeup; I gently swipe (i.e., no rubbing or scrubbing) saturated cotton pads on my face, eyes, lips and neck area - and makeup is easily removed. For heavy or waterproof makeup, I douse a cotton pad, hold the saturated cotton pad over my eye for several minutes, and (again) gently swipe. No scrubbing is ever required. (I, personally, avoid products that must be scrubbed or rubbed into my skin to work effectively.)</li>
            <li> I had recently been given a small bottle of Bioderma from a friend who had been to Paris on vacation.  I instantly became hooked.  This is the best price I came across, and the bottles are huge!</li>
            <li> Great!!! Cleanser I use after I wash my face or alone and cleans all the make up. Too bad I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a store here in the US</li>
            <li> I use this product in the mornings to clean my face without harsh tap water, followed by Skinceuticals CE Ferulic or another C serum, then a euro sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful, gentle product that removes my make-up at the end of the day followed by a pure olive oil bar cleanser.  Bioderma removes makeup with some patience--saturate the cotton pad and press it against your skin for up to 30 seconds rather than rubbing immediately.  It&#x27;s only downside is its inability to fully remove euro sunscreens (like its own Bioderma PhotoMax Lait), so following up with a trusted cleanser is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off for the high prices online compared to any ordinary French pharmacy...</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I kind of doubted it would be as good as everyone&#x27;s been saying but it totally is. It&#x27;s the most gentle (yet effective) makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever tried. Completely unscented, leaves no residue, and feels exactly like water. I would definitely recommend this to anyone-- if nothing else, you&#x27;ll probably appreciate the novelty of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond in love with the products I received! The seller is truly wonderful! As soon as I&#x27;m about to run out I will certainly order more!</li>
            <li> Best makeup remover with cotton rounds. Works great and is good for your skin. If you do not believe it, try this after you use your make up remover wipes, and you will see all the stuff that is still left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that it is way more expensive here in the US than in Europe</li>
            <li> the product showed up a little ealier than we expected, and my girlfriend was very happy. she loves this product and was also happy with the price.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product! gentle and non irritating yet removes ALL your makeup without having to reapply over and over again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best make-up remover I have ever used.  Extremely gentle on my sensitive skin!  Effective for all types of make-up be it stage make-up my daughter uses for show choir or waterproof mascara.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but you don&#x27;t have to use as much as other removers because it works so well!</li>
            <li> wonderful product for removing makeup, also leaves my face completely clean and prevents breakouts, use this before going to bed and my skin looks wonderful the next morning!</li>
            <li> Great for removing my eye make-up with out hurting my eyes.  Iove this stuff, never going back to any other make-up remover.</li>
            <li> Give me feel so clean and fresh !</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist based in New York.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use this product for 10years. After I changed my face washing style with Bioderma. I don&#x27;t get any problem on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a lot of makeup artist and models use this and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I know some people feel weird wiping face without washing.But a lot of people have skin problem because they wash too much and break their own barrier function.&lt;br /&gt;I have nice skin but it was sensitive and I used to get rash when season was changing.:( (After I started using Bioderma,I don&#x27;t get that anymore.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is very expensive in NY and I was using different stuff after I moved to NY.&lt;br /&gt;Recently my friend told me that I can get by Amazon.com and cheaper than store in NY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried and this company in France sent me very quick way faster than their estimate date.(2 weeks earlier)&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed and happy and wanted to say Thank you! and I am writing now. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order again when I finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love!!</li>
