            <li> I love this product more than any shampoo that was ever put out. I hope I can get this for a long time. I would highly recommend to anyone. Just a dime size in the palm of your hand and it lathers up awesome. One bottle last a long time. THE BEST!!!!</li>
            <li> The handle broke by the 7th use. But overall it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> Lots of sudsy lather. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> I rotate using this shampoo throughout the years.  It suds up really well and smells really really good - which I would commend over other shampoos.  Seems to clean like most of the other salon brands that I use - I have no complaints.  Price was much cheaper hear after looking in stores and I got the exact same product and same size.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My girl likes it just fine. What else is there to say about it? It&#x27;s shampoo and does what its advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo for my blond highlights.  Smells great, is lightweight and keeps my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep it stocked in my shower.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for a great product.</li>

            <li> Love this dumb blonde shampoo. Great for colored hair! Leaves it soft and manageable. I use it with the conditioner after I have my hair colored.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and its perfect for my hair. I highlight my hair on a regular basis and this helps keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde with some assistance from my hairdresser and most shampoos can make it brassy by the end of the bottle.  I need to be careful when making a purchase but thankfully, this shampoo keeps me vibrant blonde without any dullness or color change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use [[ASIN:B005MIFIWK John Frieda Sheer Blonde Color Renew Tone, Restoring Shampoo, 8.45 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]], a cheaper option which does a great job of maintaining my color between salon visits.  I find that alternating between these two shampoos yields the greatest results.  I wash my hair every day and also throw a shine enhancer shampoo into the rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quarter sized amount of shampoo does the job.  It does not provide a lot suds which is a good thing.  It rinses easily and I usually use the corresponding conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo keeps my blondness fresh between salon visits and keeping my tresses vibrant without going brassy is worth the price listed.</li>
            <li> Wrong picture of the product. I ordered the pink bottle. Got a white one.</li>
            <li> perfect for highlighted hair. The smell is wonderful and refreshing. I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you have had any chemical processes done to your hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  I was aiming to keep using the one I have at home, the one in the photo.  That is NOT the one they are sending out.  The one sent has a similar name, but is a different formula, different scent, and a different shampoo, still by TIGI.  I have tried both in the past, am allergic to the one they are sending out, and wanted the one in the photo. Had recently bought the photographed one, and returned it, thinking may as well since this one was a little cheaper, and I was buying something else on amzn anyway.  I received the one that makes me sick instead.  Feel totally gyped, and don&#x27;t want to pay more money to send it back.  Wish the advertising was legit, but they are sending out a different shampoo than the one photographed.  Seller - please update your photo for this item description.  Completely false.  Same line - Dumb Blonde, but wrong item from the Dumb Blonde line - received ColourLockdown one, not the purple one with the pineapple scent.</li>
            <li> i love everything about it!!!! ive used this product before i just ordered here because my local stores didnt have it on hand. hands down , when i have highlights this is the product to use!</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this shampoo and really works well for color treated blond hair that does not fade! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and smells like sherbert!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this shampoo, and how clean it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Buy bed head products from your local salon or beauty supply store. This was watered down cheap shampoo. The labeling was even incorrect.</li>
            <li> Bed Head Dumb Blonde Shampoo is my favorite shampoo. My hair is bleached blonde,very dry, brittle,breaking. most shampoos feel the same when they promise to moisturize dry-damage hair. My hair always felt dry after shampooing. I tried Dumb Blonde Shampoo and it made my hair silky-soft the second i rub it into my hair. It balances out the moisture in your hair. It left my hair feeling like i just conditioned it. I followed up with the Dumb Blonde reconstructor in the yellow bottle,it was fantastic. I&#x27;m so happy i purchased both. My bleached blonde hair now is silky soft, shiny, manageable, and no breakage. the smell is sweet  like cherry candy. I love this shampoo can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;now my blonde highlights are silky soft.</li>
            <li> Works on any color hair! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo may work for natural blondes but I have damaged highlighted hair and it dried it out even further. My hair felt like straw and I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo, its got such a silky feeling to it. It smells nice and doesnt tangle my long hair.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great size and product!</li>
