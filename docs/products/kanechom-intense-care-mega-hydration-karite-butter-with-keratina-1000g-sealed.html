            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff helps with dry hair.</li>
            <li>Okay, but I did not notice much of a difference in my hair after treatment.  </li>
            <li>the hair was soft like butter and very easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>The silicone left my hair dull and dry...but the kanechom alone was most excellent.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the kanechom intense care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it comes in such a big tub because this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>WHEN I OPEN THE BOX, BOTH ITEMS WERE WRAPPED IN THEIR OWN PACKAGING &amp; AN AIR-BAG; THE KANECHOM WAS WRAPPED IN &amp;#34;GREEN BUBBLE WRAP&amp;#34; AND SECURED WITH CLEAR SHIPPING TAPE...</li>
            <li>I use a small amount as a leave in with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the kanechom with the silicone</li>
            <li>IT IS WONDERFUL, BUT I AM UNHAPPY WITH LOSING SO MUCH OF IT IN SHIPPING; AND RETURNING</li>
            <li>This leaves your hair very soft&amp;supple.....</li>
            <li>Did not expect much</li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>THE LID IS NOT A PROPER FIT FOR THE CONTAINER..</li>
            <li>Kanechom Intense Care Mega Hydration Karite Butter with Keratina</li>
            <li>This product is very beneficial especially for super kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>I was able to blow dry my hair in half the time and was able to flat iron like a breeze...</li>
            <li>cover and keep in a cool dry place for storage.  </li>
            <li>my hair feels SUPER soft after I deep condition and it is a detangling Godsend for naturally kinky hair!</li>
            <li>I wonder what alien technology is used in this product because it gives great slip and conditioning for such a low price and a LOT of product!</li>
            <li>Paired this with Silicon Mix and it revitalized my sew-in weave and my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>but it also did not give me that soft shiny texture that naturals crave.</li>
            <li>leaves your hair soft</li>
            <li>my hair is low porosity a and little fine.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this one and they sent the one in the pink jug that is NOT and intense treatment at all but a conditioning creme, so I will be sending it back ASAP</li>

            <li> I enjoy using the kanechom intense care. It hydrates my hair with minimal effort. I use a small amount as a leave in with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the kanechom with the silicone but I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected.  The silicone left my hair dull and dry...but the kanechom alone was most excellent.</li>
            <li> This leaves your hair very soft&amp;supple.....my hair is low porosity a and little fine.  Awesome bounce &amp; management.</li>
            <li> This product ROCKS! I wonder what alien technology is used in this product because it gives great slip and conditioning for such a low price and a LOT of product! I&#x27;m about to order a second bottle and guaranteed this will be a staple in my hair care arsenal.  I&#x27;m african american with kinky/frizzy hair and it helps with detangling, slip and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great, worth every penny . Did not expect much but this product exceeded all my expectations and then some. Absolutely.</li>
            <li> Love it , love it, love it.  More bang for the buck. Now I know why you tube is  pack with its praises.</li>
            <li> Paired this with Silicon Mix and it revitalized my sew-in weave and my natural hair.  Felt good with plenty of slip and great conditioning</li>
            <li> Better than the reviews and youtube videos!! I will be buying this product again!  And will try other versions too!</li>
            <li> I ordered this one and they sent the one in the pink jug that is NOT and intense treatment at all but a conditioning creme, so I will be sending it back ASAP</li>
            <li> I heard girls rave about this product on youtube and how it makes their hair feel like butter but after using this product, I can honestly say that I have had better. it didn&#x27;t damage or dry my hair out but it also did not give me that soft shiny texture that naturals crave. I do not recommend this product to naturals.</li>
            <li> MY ORDER JUST CAME IN AND I RUSHED TO OPEN IT, MINE CAME WITH ANOTHER ITEM I HAD PURCHASED AND BOTH WERE TOGETHER IN A BOX.. WHEN I OPEN THE BOX, BOTH ITEMS WERE WRAPPED IN THEIR OWN PACKAGING &amp; AN AIR-BAG; THE KANECHOM WAS WRAPPED IN &amp;#34;GREEN BUBBLE WRAP&amp;#34; AND SECURED WITH CLEAR SHIPPING TAPE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT DURING TRANSIT, THE LID MANAGED TO COME UNDONE EVEN WITH ALL THAT WRAP AND TAPE, SO SOME OF THE PRODUCT WAS LOST; IT LOOKS LIKE THE LID IS NOT A PROPER FIT FOR THE CONTAINER.. I TOOK IT TO THE SINK AND WASHED OFF THE CONTAINER AND SALVAGED WHAT I COULD...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THE PRODUCT IT IS WONDERFUL, BUT I AM UNHAPPY WITH LOSING SO MUCH OF IT IN SHIPPING; AND RETURNING IT WAS NOT AN OPTION FOR ME... I WILL BE ORDERING THIS PRODUCT AGAIN AND I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESPECTFULLY, MIN.TRACEY ESTES</li>
            <li> I like this one the best of all Kanechom masks. It&#x27;s intense moisturizing and great scent. The product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Did not condition as well as a drug store brand.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great stuff helps with dry hair. Keeps my curls under control</li>
            <li> leaves your hair soft</li>
            <li> This product is very beneficial especially for super kinky hair.  When combined with Silicon treatment the benefits is much greater..I was able to blow dry my hair in half the time and was able to flat iron like a breeze...the hair was soft like butter and very easy to manage.  Any hair type can benefit from this line of product and a little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t waste it.  This size will probably last a very long time so don&#x27;t contaminate your product by digging your hands in it(has I&#x27;ve seen lots of people do)which is unsanitary, instead use a spatula and put the amount you need in plastic or glass container...cover and keep in a cool dry place for storage.  ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. It works great for my 4b hair. It softens it so well. Will but again</li>
            <li> Kanechom Intense Care Mega Hydration Karite Butter with Keratina 1000g does what it says. Wish i had known about this product before. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Okay, but I did not notice much of a difference in my hair after treatment.  Maybe after a few uses, I finally see a difference!</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with the Silicon Mix and all the rave reviews are correct when they say this stuff is the bomb dot com! my hair feels SUPER soft after I deep condition and it is a detangling Godsend for naturally kinky hair! I&#x27;m glad it comes in such a big tub because this stuff is amazing. I have heat damage and this is actually helping repair my hair in the healing process. I have less shedding since I&#x27;ve started deep conditioning with this. I love it. I have seen a couple people comment though, that this stuff only cost like $5 over in Brazil so America is taking our money! grrr! lol but I will still buy it. It&#x27;s great. Two thumbs up over here.</li>
