            <li>and I have to say that I totally love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I will be investing in more Sigma brushes over time.</li>
            <li>Not only is this brush great for blending out my shadows I have used this brush to conceal under my eyes and use as a highlighter brush!</li>
            <li>It works great for blending your eye shadows and since it is tapered it gets in the crease &amp; blends that out very well.</li>
            <li>and my Sigma E40 is the one I reach for the most.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>

            <li>and I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>If you look at the top by the price, under the words In Stock, where it says \\&quot;Sold By\\&quot;, NG,Inc is not an Authorized Retailer for Sigma.</li>
            <li>I love this brush</li>
            <li>it will give you more control verse</li>
            <li>so it is defiantly authentic.</li>
            <li>Why spend a lot more many if the chipper brushes do better job?</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but but you can have something more practical</li>
            <li>Love love this brush :)</li>

            <li>Sigma is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I want to love this brand, but I passed the booth up at IMATS after this experience.  </li>

            <li>This brush is more than perfection for blending all types of eye shadow looks.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased most of the brushes that Sigma has made and absolutely love them.  </li>

            <li>I will probably get 2 more.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s so soft, it picks up color beautifully, blends eyeshadow like a dream.</li>
            <li>When I first received this brush I loved its shape and feel, however, with every use it sheds.  </li>
            <li>Really nice brush and received it quick.</li>
            <li>It sheds, is not very dense, and my $3 ELF flawless concealer brush works a thousand times better.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check the Sigma website to see who their authorized sellers are on Amazon so you are sure to get a genuine product.</li>
            <li>The brush is great for blending and very soft.</li>
            <li>Great blending brush &amp; so soft !</li>
            <li>love it love it the best hands down</li>
            <li>It allows for seamless blending and is great for creating a blown out smoky look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good quality blending brush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>(: if your looking for a good quality reasonably priced brush or brushes, i recommend you check out sigmabeauty.com</li>
            <li>the hype is TRUE!</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly how it appears on the website and all around I love it!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this brush because I have another sigma brush (contour) that I love.  </li>
            <li>This brush is by far and away the most superior of the bunch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve used to blend transitional colors onto my crease or blending a dark color to smoke out my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been waiting to purchase my first Sigma brush and to be quite honest</li>
            <li>but this is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>this was my first sigma brush it blends so well and great quality, funny thing is when i clean the bristles comes off sometimes, but overall great quality blends well</li>
            <li>The brush is very sturdy and does exactly what it is designed to do very effectively.  </li>
            <li>Even after washing it, the thing collects dust like no other makeup brush I own!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really expect much but this is great.</li>
            <li>Shpping was fast and brush came nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>this brush is great especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>but I still enjoy using it to blend out my crease shadow.</li>
            <li>but these things were always thoughtfully placed in their spot...</li>
            <li>It is still a nice brush, but when you are paying this much money for a Sigma brush you deserve a Sigma brush.  </li>
            <li>This product was great like all the Sigma brushes I have bought, but was too similar to another brush I already have.</li>
            <li>They confirmed that all Sigma brushes will now be made synthetically.</li>
            <li>Wonderful at blending out harsh eyeshadow lines.</li>
            <li>It feels cheap.</li>
            <li>when i hear it being talked about, it sounds really fluffy and awesome</li>
            <li>It makes blending a breeze and is a fantastic time saver when blending to perfection.</li>
            <li>Fantastic blending brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is fabulous and a fraction of the cost of it&#x27;s MAC rival.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great blending eye shadow brush than look no further!</li>
            <li>Such a great brush.  </li>
            <li>I think all of the Sigma brushes I have are fabulous except for this one.</li>
            <li>As for the actual blending, flawless; the quality of the brush really shows through application.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think I can own enough of them.</li>
            <li>I realize many people may have never owned any of Sigmas older brushes and although it is well known throughout the beauty industry that Sigma went to plastic handles and mostly all synthetic fibers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>This is not the original sigma.</li>
            <li>but this is NOT THE ORIGINAL E40 brush..</li>
            <li>but it is sooo worth it!</li>
            <li>and it most definitely is a MUST have if you love creating smokey eyes or looks that involve blending in your crease!</li>
            <li>It is not as close to the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fluffier, bigger and better - but most importantly CHEAPER!  </li>
            <li>I have long heard great things about Sigma&#x27;s quality and prices and let me say, the Sigma Tapered Blending - E40 brush did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed and It is very soft and nice.</li>
            <li>So soft and blends even the most stubborn of colors!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s so right!</li>
            <li>For the first time I ordered Sigma brushes because I heard good reviews about them, And I am soo loving them, I used it today, it is so soft, big enough for a fast blend of shadow on my eyelid, really great product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more than I would have liked to pay, but it does the job!  </li>
            <li>Order also got her sooner then expected which is also a great plus.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and blends out your eye makeup amazingly.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have finally purchased my first Sigma brush and know that I will be purchasing many more until I get the full array.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it..</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it would work so well, since the bristles are so long, but it is really nice!</li>
            <li>I love this brush, but it got really funked up through shipping.</li>
            <li>real techniques eco tools or sephoras travel sets are better for beginners.</li>
            <li>Love this brush and the whole sigma line.</li>
            <li>Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>Takes me half the time and works beautifully</li>
            <li>The brush itself is large and perfect for a transition Shade and blending out harsh lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use two eyeshadows effectively before to give a little depth to my lids, but this brush makes it easy.</li>
            <li>First time using Sigma and to be honest I think this is as good as any of my Mac brushes and way less money!</li>
            <li>This seller that I ordered it from was SO quick in getting it shipped out to me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it overall!</li>
            <li>I really love MAC brushes but it is difficult to justify the cost when there are great quality Sigma and MakeupGeek brushes for a much better price</li>
            <li>Beautiful, fluffy, quality.  </li>
            <li>Love it and couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I can honesly say that I would not be able to live without this in my brush collection.</li>
            <li>i love this for a well blended and more natural look because gentle blending makes a more professional and well done eye look.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what all the reviewers say it does!</li>
            <li>It came relatively quickly because I ordered right after Christmas time.</li>
            <li>the one from sigma is way shinier and you can really see the color changes with the reflection of the light.</li>
            <li>IT WAS CHEAP AND DOESN&#x27;T LOSE AS MUCH HAIR</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased off of Amazon, but this time, I have found it to not be the same amazing quality as the 1st 1 I received.</li>
            <li>It works very well with the light powder under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>U Will B Completely 100% SATISFIED</li>
            <li>I love using this brush to blend my eyeshadow seamlessly together.</li>
            <li>This brush lives up to its intended purpose, it just doesn&#x27;t fulfill my own personal needs.</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S DEFINITELY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and easy to keep clean and disinfected.</li>
            <li>It is Worth the price</li>
            <li>They are so worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money you will pay.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite brush in my collection.</li>
            <li>I still use a smaller tapered blending brush for the crease, but it&#x27;s a nice all over blender.</li>
            <li>It came timely and the brush is quite useful.</li>
            <li>I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this brush, it has just made my eye shadow application so much faster in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I love how it feathers out my eye shadow and blends to a seamless finish.  </li>
            <li>I was definitely not using the right kind of brush.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can get multiple uses out of this brush is worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and such good quality, specially for the price.</li>
            <li>Sigma brushes are super high quality and better then some high brand companies.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li>As soon as I used this brush, it didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>They are just the right density and give the correct amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>I used this brush at my friends house after I had over applied my crease color, it blended out the colors just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I have been looking at these brushes for a while and was waiting for the right time to purchase.</li>
            <li>Is also great for small detailing on the face (contouring).</li>
            <li>I also use Ecotools, which are all incredibly soft, hold up fantastically through many washings and are very high quality for a fraction of the price of Sigma.</li>
            <li>Super high quality, washes well, &amp; works like a dream!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to get professional looking shadow now.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and such good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice and fluffy and diffuses the color very well.</li>
            <li>This item came earlier than expected in good condition!</li>
            <li>Cannot tell if it better compared to MAC or eco tools brand, it&#x27;s just all had similar results.</li>
            <li>I buy online all the time, but this is the first time I&#x27;m writing a review.</li>
            <li>So inexpensive for a brush that I&#x27;ve heard so much about!</li>
            <li>This is the first Sigma brush I purchased after seeing all the rave reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Prompt service and the brush arrived exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>No it&#x27;s not fake</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely get a lot of use out of it and am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this brush.</li>
            <li>I see so many gurus on YouTube rave about this so obviously I had to try it.</li>
            <li>so i cant give any first hand knowledge</li>
            <li>when i first used it it shed a lot.</li>
            <li>While the company is transitioning, there may still be some natural hair brushes available.</li>
            <li>The hairs in the brush started coming out after the first use.</li>
            <li>have gotten Sigma brushes from Amazon, and they are the exact same as what I get from the Sigma website because I always make sure the seller is correct.  </li>
            <li>Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I cleaned them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be looking forward to purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it&#x27;s the 2nd 1</li>
            <li>And this brush actually feels more like a splurge than a save.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely looove this blending brush!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too flimsy not my first pick for this purpose.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite eyeshadow brushes; I use it for the upper eyelid to blend the transition color with the crease color, not</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s just the one that I received, but I&#x27;ve tried everything and have come to realize that I won&#x27;t be able to use this one for anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a good contouring brush</li>
            <li>It is great for blending product and although it is very fluffy, it has a very controlled blend.</li>
            <li>I am trying the new amazon prime trial and so far I love it</li>
            <li>love how soft this blending r even if it kinda big for blending small areas, I use them for the higlight under my eyebrows, its amazing brush, love it</li>
            <li>The brush that is being sold as the E40 is all synthetic and not nearly as fluffy as the original, if you are looking for a dupe to MAC&#x27;s 224</li>
            <li>After using one I honestly don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any other brand.</li>
            <li>I have the original E40 direct from Sigma and this is just a dupe.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought a back up!</li>
            <li>Super soft!</li>
            <li>Super soft!</li>
            <li>i think i will just pay the full price and order sigma directly.</li>
            <li>I was replacing my old version which is much fluffier, kind of like the photo you see here on the product listing (the photo shown appears to be a new one, but the ones they sell are not so fluffy and rounded on top as the one presented here on Amazon).</li>
            <li>The actual brush works fine, it&#x27;s just not as pretty as I would like it to be for the price.</li>
            <li>They are more than aware people consider their brushes to be similar to MAC and that they offer quite a few MAC dupes, it is, after all, how Sigma managed to become famous before they launched their F80 series that they are more currently known for!  </li>
            <li>Super soft and glides well..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been washed a good hand full of times and I&#x27;ve never experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li>Though it is large, the brush has lost it&#x27;s famed fluffiness.</li>
            <li>This brush is my new holy grail for blending!!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and the brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>The brush is good, very soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable compared to other brands, and the quality is comparable or better than higher costed brands.</li>
            <li>But overall this brush is amazing and it will last forever!</li>
            <li>I appreciate the fast shipment and quality of Sigma&#x27;s product(s).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I got the real e40.</li>
            <li>it could be real and just not the quality that I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I paid almost $20 after shipping and will never pay this much for a brush again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had lots of blending brushes, but none of them really worked as blending brushes.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so much easier and effortless since I started buying these.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I really like your eye makeup, its blended out perfectly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t end up using it much.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Sigma E40 brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I forgot how much I missed this blending brush.  </li>
            <li>so much is because it&#x27;s fluffier than the mac 224.</li>
            <li>it really helps blend everything together and holds product really well.  </li>
            <li>If you are used to real Sigma quality brushes you will immediately notice the difference.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Sigma blending brush is a must have for blending and defining today&#x27;s eye styles in make up, you can be intense or non-descriptive, but always fashionable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it and order a real one from Sigma website</li>
            <li>It blends my shadows very well.</li>
            <li>Real ones are way fluffier</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I really like them.</li>
            <li>i dont think these are really sigma brushes they work well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to exchange it.</li>
            <li>I really wish I could give this brush a million stars</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a whole set</li>
            <li>I really like the way the brush works.</li>
            <li>Absolutely AMAZING!!!ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>blending is so much easier for me now.</li>
            <li>I lose the one; I like it that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having trouble getting that nice \\&quot;blended\\</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more from Sigma Beauty again to complete the rest of my makeup brush collection.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to purchasing more Sigma products in the near future!</li>
            <li>I seriously use it every single time I do my makeup, it blends eyeshadow perfect!!</li>
            <li>Super easy for blending with or without heavy hand.</li>
            <li>What else can I say other than I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>have taken off 3 stars because this brush is not the same as the original E40.</li>
            <li>I am furious that they would make such a drastic change to a brush and sell it without any information or even a footnote acknowledging this is not like the original brush.</li>
            <li>I have many different blending brushes from MAC down to the cheap ones you can buy on Ebay for .99</li>
            <li>I have other blending brushes but this one is one of a kind, blending comes so easy with this brush with less amount of force.</li>
            <li>My drugstore brushes work better and cost half as much.  </li>
            <li>first off I&#x27;d like to clear</li>
            <li>The brush is larger than I expected, but I love it anyway!</li>
            <li>I heard sigma is good quality and this brush is definitely not good quality.</li>
            <li>The only thing I thought could be improved was the amount of bristles; it isn&#x27;t as full as it could be.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more sigma brushes in the future!</li>
            <li>I never purchased one of the older E40</li>
            <li>Overal it&#x27;s a decent brush.</li>
            <li>The brush head is also big enough so that the eye shadow looks more diffused instead of it being too concentrated on my lid.  </li>
            <li>The brush on the left is a real sigma e40 and the brush on the right</li>
            <li>I like the length of the brush itself and would highly recommend purchasing it to blend out those eyeshadow edges.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for your blending needs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The brush picks up color like a dream high end eyeshadow and drug store.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for your makeup brush kit.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush and seller.</li>
            <li>love love love this for blending out my eye shadow, the only problem i DO have with it, is that the E40 on the sigma site (and even in the picture for the brush here) looks different than the one i recieved, it&#x27;s not as fluffy or round as the pictures here, but it does the job</li>
            <li>The head flared out and it&#x27;s far too large for me to blend with.</li>
            <li>I finally found exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!!</li>
            <li>For some reason the bristles feel a little more flimsy.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft and gentle on your skin as well.  </li>
            <li>It is not thick or densely packed with bristles.</li>
            <li>Its worth the extra $10-15.</li>
            <li>I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not.</li>
            <li>My favorite everyday blending brush.</li>
            <li>The version they are sending customers is tapered, but the top is more blunt cut rather than carefully trimmed and slightly rounded like the full, fluffy, brush you expect to receive.</li>
            <li>The list of Authorized Retailers for Sigma can be found on Sigma&#x27;s website, there is an upper right tab that says Authorized Retailers.</li>
            <li>Better than anything one could buy at even Sephora or any high end brushes you ordinarily buy</li>
            <li>This is my first introduction to breakage and fallout and I never thought it would be with such a highly recommended brush.  </li>
            <li>I am new to using brushes, so I have been buying alot of them.</li>
            <li>The real e40 is fluffy and applies color lightly.</li>
            <li>Hopefully you ladies will have better luck with the new brushes but I will be turning to Bdellium and Zoeva for my future brushes due to the price increase and quality decrease of Sigma.</li>
            <li>With a gift card I had received for my birthday, and even then I was surprised by the price!</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this brush is a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or if the quality just isn&#x27;t what I was expecting (since I have never owned an authentic E40 before to compare it to).</li>
            <li>I had been on the fence about purchasing this brush as I was trying to make do with what I had, but wow what a difference!</li>
            <li>I completely agree!</li>
            <li>it came EXACTLY the same when I ordered sigma online.</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed the Sigma brushes because the are not to soft yet not to thick and they blend the eyeshadow to perfection.</li>
            <li>I can go on and on of why I love this brush however if your eye shape is smaller then average I would skip on this brush or if you are also new to eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sad day when a Sonia Kashuik brush I bought 8 years ago is still a better quality than a Sigma brush purchased today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who recommended Sigma brushes to me swore up and down that they were among her favorite, but when I told her I had breakage, shedding, and fallout on the first use, she had no defense.  </li>
            <li>I use them for applying when I want a soft, subtle wash of colour on my eyes and to blend and blow out more intense eye looks.</li>
            <li>The handle is the same size all the way down, top to bottom which got my attention.</li>
            <li>I am not happy with sigma brushes, I defiantly will say that ECO tools are better quality than Sigma!</li>
            <li>there is such a wide variety to choose from; and because they are all so useful, I wanted to take my time picking the first one out.  </li>
            <li>Be aware, when I washed it the first time the water turned a bit black.</li>
            <li>This brush is great to put down a nice base color in your crease.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is it had a tremendous amount of fall out, even after several washes.</li>
            <li>Now that i used it a bunch more times it only sheds a little here &amp; there.</li>
            <li>Soft and does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as soft either.</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and its a all around sturdy brush.</li>
            <li>So soft and it grabs a lot of product onto the brush.</li>
            <li>and it was soft as described.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as soft as I hoped.</li>
            <li>This brush is nothing like the one I had purchased directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li>I ordered the e40 from sigma and it was not fluffy at all and did not blend well.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>My gripe is that they are very splayed out and won&#x27;t go back into the shape they should be.</li>
            <li>You would be safer ordering directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li>It sheds, the bristles actually brake and fall out, I have had the brush for about a year now and did&#x27;t use it very often</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li>Flimsy and the brush is not fluffy at all.</li>
            <li>Exceptionally soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li>I am including a photo I found online of the old E40 compared with a MAC 224</li>
            <li>I am including a photo I found online of the old E40 compared with a MAC 224</li>
            <li>Has completely lost its shape and density.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect blend of fluffy, firm and stiff.  </li>
            <li>only recently have I decided to get higher end brushes.</li>
            <li>but it is now half way bold.</li>
            <li>bristles are long enough, but not too long to blend smoothly.</li>
            <li>The sets should be pink, purple, and a light blue and smaller in size I think.</li>
            <li>I was hoping after a few washed the shedding would cool it</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my new favourite brushes.</li>
            <li>I compared it to my actual real ones I have from the actual sigma store.</li>
            <li>The hairs are completely different because they are way too stiff and a lot longer than the original.</li>
            <li>Not stiff enough in my opinion to work color in your crease</li>
            <li>This brush is too soft to actually blend anything.</li>
            <li>I had wanted a sigma brush but really didn&#x27;t want to spent it amount on the sigma website</li>
            <li>apparently my wife ordered this on my account</li>
            <li>Brush barely works.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast and it came 3 hours before expected.</li>
            <li>I honestly believe this is a fake.</li>
            <li>For the money was not very impressed, sedona lace brush is just as good and can  be purchased for half the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned cheap brushes from my youth and purchased expensive brushes in my prime, but this thing sheds more than a white cat on a black couch even after 3 uses.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go with this one because it&#x27;s less expensive and have heard great things about it.  </li>
            <li>, I can define the intensity I want or need, or I can be subtle, all without lines!  :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more firm than my natural hair Sigma brushes and is rather flat now as opposed to round.</li>
            <li>but the brush i got was really dense and stiff, not fluffy.</li>
            <li>Not a real sigma product when I compared it to 2 others of the same brush that were actually ordered from the real sigma website.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but it&#x27;s definitely not up to the quality I expected for sigma being so high priced.</li>
            <li>It has a very long handle with extremely soft bristles.</li>
            <li>but no, alas, every time I try to use this I get black hairs all over my face.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for the past few months and I am absolutely IN LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>This brush can blend just about any eye shadow, regardless of how good or bad quality it is.</li>

            <li> it truly does make a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I love this brush...</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more brushes soon and diffrent products.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just look into brushes more before I purchase from sigma again.</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t love it as much as I love my MAC 217.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great blending brush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyeshadow look significantly better.</li>
            <li> It applies so evenly, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just using my boyfriend&#x27;s account :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The brush is made very well and does a great job with eye shadow.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sigma brushes that I use all the time for blending.</li>
            <li> Affordable prices and excellent quality, will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I totally love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I will be investing in more Sigma brushes over time.</li>
            <li> Not only is this brush great for blending out my shadows I have used this brush to conceal under my eyes and use as a highlighter brush!</li>
            <li> It works great for blending your eye shadows and since it is tapered it gets in the crease &amp; blends that out very well.</li>
            <li> and my Sigma E40 is the one I reach for the most.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Brush has a lot more shedding than the sigma E25 blending brush.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and all of their brushes.</li>
            <li> Most of my brush collection is from sigma.</li>
            <li> Love this brush need me about two more to add to my collection</li>
            <li> I love this brush for putting all over color on the crease and up to the brow bone.</li>
            <li> I have washed it more than once</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after reading numerous reviews and its the best addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> and I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> If you look at the top by the price, under the words In Stock, where it says \\&quot;Sold By\\&quot;, NG,Inc is not an Authorized Retailer for Sigma.</li>
            <li> I love this brush</li>
            <li> it will give you more control verse</li>
            <li> so it is defiantly authentic.</li>
            <li> Why spend a lot more many if the chipper brushes do better job?</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but but you can have something more practical</li>
            <li> Love love this brush :)</li>
            <li> This brush is great for blending in the crease area as well as blending the whole look together.</li>
            <li> I love Sigma, always have and always will.</li>
            <li> I feel for the price I paid this is an okay brush not the softest</li>
            <li> I have a MAC brush 224 which is softer and hold its shape better after washing.</li>
            <li> I love love this brush.</li>
            <li> love the service and product</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>

            <li> Love this brush blends eyeshadow well.</li>
            <li> Love the brush, not the price.</li>
            <li> I love Sigma.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is an authentic brush.</li>
            <li> Sigma is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I want to love this brand, but I passed the booth up at IMATS after this experience.  </li>
            <li> They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> This brush is more than perfection for blending all types of eye shadow looks.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased most of the brushes that Sigma has made and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast/reliable shipping, Authentic product.</li>
            <li> Most of my brush collection is from sigma.</li>
            <li> It cones with sigma &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; sticker :) love the brush</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a GREAT brush to make blending out eye shadow much easier and faster, go buy the</li>
            <li> I have seen many YouTube make-up tutorials featuring this brush but was debating whether to go with a Sigma or MAC brush.  </li>
            <li> I will probably get 2 more.  </li>
            <li> I love the brush set up (the length of the handle, the way it feels in hands, etc.), and I love the way it applies.</li>
            <li> is way better.</li>
            <li> In love with this brush</li>
            <li> Love this sigma blending brush</li>
            <li> Very gentle but really smothes and blends wonderfully.</li>
            <li> They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good brush and the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft, it picks up color beautifully, blends eyeshadow like a dream.</li>
            <li> When I first received this brush I loved its shape and feel, however, with every use it sheds.  </li>
            <li> Really nice brush and received it quick.</li>
            <li> It sheds, is not very dense, and my $3 ELF flawless concealer brush works a thousand times better.</li>
            <li> Be sure to check the Sigma website to see who their authorized sellers are on Amazon so you are sure to get a genuine product.</li>
            <li> The brush is great for blending and very soft.</li>
            <li> Great blending brush &amp; so soft !</li>
            <li> love it love it the best hands down</li>
            <li> It allows for seamless blending and is great for creating a blown out smoky look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good quality blending brush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> (: if your looking for a good quality reasonably priced brush or brushes, i recommend you check out sigmabeauty.com</li>
            <li> the hype is TRUE!</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly how it appears on the website and all around I love it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this brush because I have another sigma brush (contour) that I love.  </li>
            <li> This brush is by far and away the most superior of the bunch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve used to blend transitional colors onto my crease or blending a dark color to smoke out my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to purchase my first Sigma brush and to be quite honest</li>
            <li> but this is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> this was my first sigma brush it blends so well and great quality, funny thing is when i clean the bristles comes off sometimes, but overall great quality blends well</li>
            <li> The brush is very sturdy and does exactly what it is designed to do very effectively.  </li>
            <li> Even after washing it, the thing collects dust like no other makeup brush I own!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect much but this is great.</li>
            <li> Shpping was fast and brush came nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> this brush is great especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> but I still enjoy using it to blend out my crease shadow.</li>
            <li> but these things were always thoughtfully placed in their spot...</li>
            <li> It is still a nice brush, but when you are paying this much money for a Sigma brush you deserve a Sigma brush.  </li>
            <li> This product was great like all the Sigma brushes I have bought, but was too similar to another brush I already have.</li>
            <li> They confirmed that all Sigma brushes will now be made synthetically.</li>
            <li> Wonderful at blending out harsh eyeshadow lines.</li>
            <li> It feels cheap.</li>
            <li> when i hear it being talked about, it sounds really fluffy and awesome</li>
            <li> It makes blending a breeze and is a fantastic time saver when blending to perfection.</li>
            <li> Fantastic blending brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is fabulous and a fraction of the cost of it&#x27;s MAC rival.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great blending eye shadow brush than look no further!</li>
            <li> Such a great brush.  </li>
            <li> I think all of the Sigma brushes I have are fabulous except for this one.</li>
            <li> As for the actual blending, flawless; the quality of the brush really shows through application.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think I can own enough of them.</li>
            <li> I realize many people may have never owned any of Sigmas older brushes and although it is well known throughout the beauty industry that Sigma went to plastic handles and mostly all synthetic fibers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> This is not the original sigma.</li>
            <li> but this is NOT THE ORIGINAL E40 brush..</li>
            <li> but it is sooo worth it!</li>
            <li> and it most definitely is a MUST have if you love creating smokey eyes or looks that involve blending in your crease!</li>
            <li> It is not as close to the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fluffier, bigger and better - but most importantly CHEAPER!  </li>
            <li> I have long heard great things about Sigma&#x27;s quality and prices and let me say, the Sigma Tapered Blending - E40 brush did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed and It is very soft and nice.</li>
            <li> So soft and blends even the most stubborn of colors!</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s so right!</li>
            <li> For the first time I ordered Sigma brushes because I heard good reviews about them, And I am soo loving them, I used it today, it is so soft, big enough for a fast blend of shadow on my eyelid, really great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more than I would have liked to pay, but it does the job!  </li>
            <li> Order also got her sooner then expected which is also a great plus.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and blends out your eye makeup amazingly.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have finally purchased my first Sigma brush and know that I will be purchasing many more until I get the full array.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it..</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it would work so well, since the bristles are so long, but it is really nice!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, but it got really funked up through shipping.</li>
            <li> real techniques eco tools or sephoras travel sets are better for beginners.</li>
            <li> Love this brush and the whole sigma line.</li>
            <li> Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> Takes me half the time and works beautifully</li>
            <li> The brush itself is large and perfect for a transition Shade and blending out harsh lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use two eyeshadows effectively before to give a little depth to my lids, but this brush makes it easy.</li>
            <li> First time using Sigma and to be honest I think this is as good as any of my Mac brushes and way less money!</li>
            <li> This seller that I ordered it from was SO quick in getting it shipped out to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it overall!</li>
            <li> I really love MAC brushes but it is difficult to justify the cost when there are great quality Sigma and MakeupGeek brushes for a much better price</li>
            <li> Beautiful, fluffy, quality.  </li>
            <li> Love it and couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I can honesly say that I would not be able to live without this in my brush collection.</li>
            <li> i love this for a well blended and more natural look because gentle blending makes a more professional and well done eye look.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what all the reviewers say it does!</li>
            <li> It came relatively quickly because I ordered right after Christmas time.</li>
            <li> the one from sigma is way shinier and you can really see the color changes with the reflection of the light.</li>
            <li> IT WAS CHEAP AND DOESN&#x27;T LOSE AS MUCH HAIR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased off of Amazon, but this time, I have found it to not be the same amazing quality as the 1st 1 I received.</li>
            <li> It works very well with the light powder under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> U Will B Completely 100% SATISFIED</li>
            <li> I love using this brush to blend my eyeshadow seamlessly together.</li>
            <li> This brush lives up to its intended purpose, it just doesn&#x27;t fulfill my own personal needs.</li>
            <li> so worth it.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S DEFINITELY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and easy to keep clean and disinfected.</li>
            <li> It is Worth the price</li>
            <li> They are so worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money you will pay.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite brush in my collection.</li>
            <li> I still use a smaller tapered blending brush for the crease, but it&#x27;s a nice all over blender.</li>
            <li> It came timely and the brush is quite useful.</li>
            <li> I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this brush, it has just made my eye shadow application so much faster in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I love how it feathers out my eye shadow and blends to a seamless finish.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely not using the right kind of brush.</li>
            <li> The fact that I can get multiple uses out of this brush is worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and such good quality, specially for the price.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are super high quality and better then some high brand companies.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
            <li> As soon as I used this brush, it didn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> They are just the right density and give the correct amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> I used this brush at my friends house after I had over applied my crease color, it blended out the colors just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at these brushes for a while and was waiting for the right time to purchase.</li>
            <li> Is also great for small detailing on the face (contouring).</li>
            <li> I also use Ecotools, which are all incredibly soft, hold up fantastically through many washings and are very high quality for a fraction of the price of Sigma.</li>
            <li> Super high quality, washes well, &amp; works like a dream!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to get professional looking shadow now.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and such good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice and fluffy and diffuses the color very well.</li>
            <li> This item came earlier than expected in good condition!</li>
            <li> Cannot tell if it better compared to MAC or eco tools brand, it&#x27;s just all had similar results.</li>
            <li> I buy online all the time, but this is the first time I&#x27;m writing a review.</li>
            <li> So inexpensive for a brush that I&#x27;ve heard so much about!</li>
            <li> This is the first Sigma brush I purchased after seeing all the rave reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Prompt service and the brush arrived exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> No it&#x27;s not fake</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely get a lot of use out of it and am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this brush.</li>
            <li> I see so many gurus on YouTube rave about this so obviously I had to try it.</li>
            <li> so i cant give any first hand knowledge</li>
            <li> when i first used it it shed a lot.</li>
            <li> While the company is transitioning, there may still be some natural hair brushes available.</li>
            <li> The hairs in the brush started coming out after the first use.</li>
            <li> have gotten Sigma brushes from Amazon, and they are the exact same as what I get from the Sigma website because I always make sure the seller is correct.  </li>
            <li> Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li> It was the first time I cleaned them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be looking forward to purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s the 2nd 1</li>
            <li> And this brush actually feels more like a splurge than a save.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely looove this blending brush!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too flimsy not my first pick for this purpose.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite eyeshadow brushes; I use it for the upper eyelid to blend the transition color with the crease color, not</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s just the one that I received, but I&#x27;ve tried everything and have come to realize that I won&#x27;t be able to use this one for anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a good contouring brush</li>
            <li> It is great for blending product and although it is very fluffy, it has a very controlled blend.</li>
            <li> I am trying the new amazon prime trial and so far I love it</li>
            <li> love how soft this blending r even if it kinda big for blending small areas, I use them for the higlight under my eyebrows, its amazing brush, love it</li>
            <li> The brush that is being sold as the E40 is all synthetic and not nearly as fluffy as the original, if you are looking for a dupe to MAC&#x27;s 224</li>
            <li> After using one I honestly don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any other brand.</li>
            <li> I have the original E40 direct from Sigma and this is just a dupe.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought a back up!</li>
            <li> Super soft!</li>
            <li> Super soft!</li>
            <li> i think i will just pay the full price and order sigma directly.</li>
            <li> I was replacing my old version which is much fluffier, kind of like the photo you see here on the product listing (the photo shown appears to be a new one, but the ones they sell are not so fluffy and rounded on top as the one presented here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> The actual brush works fine, it&#x27;s just not as pretty as I would like it to be for the price.</li>
            <li> They are more than aware people consider their brushes to be similar to MAC and that they offer quite a few MAC dupes, it is, after all, how Sigma managed to become famous before they launched their F80 series that they are more currently known for!  </li>
            <li> Super soft and glides well..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been washed a good hand full of times and I&#x27;ve never experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> Though it is large, the brush has lost it&#x27;s famed fluffiness.</li>
            <li> This brush is my new holy grail for blending!!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and the brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> The brush is good, very soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> The price is very affordable compared to other brands, and the quality is comparable or better than higher costed brands.</li>
            <li> But overall this brush is amazing and it will last forever!</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fast shipment and quality of Sigma&#x27;s product(s).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I got the real e40.</li>
            <li> it could be real and just not the quality that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I paid almost $20 after shipping and will never pay this much for a brush again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of blending brushes, but none of them really worked as blending brushes.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on so much easier and effortless since I started buying these.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I really like your eye makeup, its blended out perfectly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using it much.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Sigma E40 brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I forgot how much I missed this blending brush.  </li>
            <li> so much is because it&#x27;s fluffier than the mac 224.</li>
            <li> it really helps blend everything together and holds product really well.  </li>
            <li> If you are used to real Sigma quality brushes you will immediately notice the difference.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Sigma blending brush is a must have for blending and defining today&#x27;s eye styles in make up, you can be intense or non-descriptive, but always fashionable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning it and order a real one from Sigma website</li>
            <li> It blends my shadows very well.</li>
            <li> Real ones are way fluffier</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I really like them.</li>
            <li> i dont think these are really sigma brushes they work well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to exchange it.</li>
            <li> I really wish I could give this brush a million stars</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a whole set</li>
            <li> I really like the way the brush works.</li>
            <li> Absolutely AMAZING!!!ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> blending is so much easier for me now.</li>
            <li> I lose the one; I like it that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble getting that nice \\&quot;blended\\</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more from Sigma Beauty again to complete the rest of my makeup brush collection.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to purchasing more Sigma products in the near future!</li>
            <li> I seriously use it every single time I do my makeup, it blends eyeshadow perfect!!</li>
            <li> Super easy for blending with or without heavy hand.</li>
            <li> What else can I say other than I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> have taken off 3 stars because this brush is not the same as the original E40.</li>
            <li> I am furious that they would make such a drastic change to a brush and sell it without any information or even a footnote acknowledging this is not like the original brush.</li>
            <li> I have many different blending brushes from MAC down to the cheap ones you can buy on Ebay for .99</li>
            <li> I have other blending brushes but this one is one of a kind, blending comes so easy with this brush with less amount of force.</li>
            <li> My drugstore brushes work better and cost half as much.  </li>
            <li> first off I&#x27;d like to clear</li>
            <li> The brush is larger than I expected, but I love it anyway!</li>
            <li> I heard sigma is good quality and this brush is definitely not good quality.</li>
            <li> The only thing I thought could be improved was the amount of bristles; it isn&#x27;t as full as it could be.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more sigma brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> I never purchased one of the older E40</li>
            <li> Overal it&#x27;s a decent brush.</li>
            <li> The brush head is also big enough so that the eye shadow looks more diffused instead of it being too concentrated on my lid.  </li>
            <li> The brush on the left is a real sigma e40 and the brush on the right</li>
            <li> I like the length of the brush itself and would highly recommend purchasing it to blend out those eyeshadow edges.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for your blending needs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The brush picks up color like a dream high end eyeshadow and drug store.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for your makeup brush kit.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush and seller.</li>
            <li> love love love this for blending out my eye shadow, the only problem i DO have with it, is that the E40 on the sigma site (and even in the picture for the brush here) looks different than the one i recieved, it&#x27;s not as fluffy or round as the pictures here, but it does the job</li>
            <li> The head flared out and it&#x27;s far too large for me to blend with.</li>
            <li> I finally found exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!!</li>
            <li> For some reason the bristles feel a little more flimsy.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft and gentle on your skin as well.  </li>
            <li> It is not thick or densely packed with bristles.</li>
            <li> Its worth the extra $10-15.</li>
            <li> I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not.</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday blending brush.</li>
            <li> The version they are sending customers is tapered, but the top is more blunt cut rather than carefully trimmed and slightly rounded like the full, fluffy, brush you expect to receive.</li>
            <li> The list of Authorized Retailers for Sigma can be found on Sigma&#x27;s website, there is an upper right tab that says Authorized Retailers.</li>
            <li> Better than anything one could buy at even Sephora or any high end brushes you ordinarily buy</li>
            <li> This is my first introduction to breakage and fallout and I never thought it would be with such a highly recommended brush.  </li>
            <li> I am new to using brushes, so I have been buying alot of them.</li>
            <li> The real e40 is fluffy and applies color lightly.</li>
            <li> Hopefully you ladies will have better luck with the new brushes but I will be turning to Bdellium and Zoeva for my future brushes due to the price increase and quality decrease of Sigma.</li>
            <li> With a gift card I had received for my birthday, and even then I was surprised by the price!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this brush is a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or if the quality just isn&#x27;t what I was expecting (since I have never owned an authentic E40 before to compare it to).</li>
            <li> I had been on the fence about purchasing this brush as I was trying to make do with what I had, but wow what a difference!</li>
            <li> I completely agree!</li>
            <li> it came EXACTLY the same when I ordered sigma online.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed the Sigma brushes because the are not to soft yet not to thick and they blend the eyeshadow to perfection.</li>
            <li> I can go on and on of why I love this brush however if your eye shape is smaller then average I would skip on this brush or if you are also new to eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sad day when a Sonia Kashuik brush I bought 8 years ago is still a better quality than a Sigma brush purchased today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who recommended Sigma brushes to me swore up and down that they were among her favorite, but when I told her I had breakage, shedding, and fallout on the first use, she had no defense.  </li>
            <li> I use them for applying when I want a soft, subtle wash of colour on my eyes and to blend and blow out more intense eye looks.</li>
            <li> The handle is the same size all the way down, top to bottom which got my attention.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with sigma brushes, I defiantly will say that ECO tools are better quality than Sigma!</li>
            <li> there is such a wide variety to choose from; and because they are all so useful, I wanted to take my time picking the first one out.  </li>
            <li> Be aware, when I washed it the first time the water turned a bit black.</li>
            <li> This brush is great to put down a nice base color in your crease.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is it had a tremendous amount of fall out, even after several washes.</li>
            <li> Now that i used it a bunch more times it only sheds a little here &amp; there.</li>
            <li> Soft and does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft either.</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and its a all around sturdy brush.</li>
            <li> So soft and it grabs a lot of product onto the brush.</li>
            <li> and it was soft as described.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as soft as I hoped.</li>
            <li> This brush is nothing like the one I had purchased directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li> I ordered the e40 from sigma and it was not fluffy at all and did not blend well.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> My gripe is that they are very splayed out and won&#x27;t go back into the shape they should be.</li>
            <li> You would be safer ordering directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li> It sheds, the bristles actually brake and fall out, I have had the brush for about a year now and did&#x27;t use it very often</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and the brush is not fluffy at all.</li>
            <li> Exceptionally soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li> I am including a photo I found online of the old E40 compared with a MAC 224</li>
            <li> I am including a photo I found online of the old E40 compared with a MAC 224</li>
            <li> Has completely lost its shape and density.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect blend of fluffy, firm and stiff.  </li>
            <li> only recently have I decided to get higher end brushes.</li>
            <li> but it is now half way bold.</li>
            <li> bristles are long enough, but not too long to blend smoothly.</li>
            <li> The sets should be pink, purple, and a light blue and smaller in size I think.</li>
            <li> I was hoping after a few washed the shedding would cool it</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my new favourite brushes.</li>
            <li> I compared it to my actual real ones I have from the actual sigma store.</li>
            <li> The hairs are completely different because they are way too stiff and a lot longer than the original.</li>
            <li> Not stiff enough in my opinion to work color in your crease</li>
            <li> This brush is too soft to actually blend anything.</li>
            <li> I had wanted a sigma brush but really didn&#x27;t want to spent it amount on the sigma website</li>
            <li> apparently my wife ordered this on my account</li>
            <li> Brush barely works.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast and it came 3 hours before expected.</li>
            <li> I honestly believe this is a fake.</li>
            <li> For the money was not very impressed, sedona lace brush is just as good and can  be purchased for half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned cheap brushes from my youth and purchased expensive brushes in my prime, but this thing sheds more than a white cat on a black couch even after 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go with this one because it&#x27;s less expensive and have heard great things about it.  </li>
            <li> , I can define the intensity I want or need, or I can be subtle, all without lines!  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more firm than my natural hair Sigma brushes and is rather flat now as opposed to round.</li>
            <li> but the brush i got was really dense and stiff, not fluffy.</li>
            <li> Not a real sigma product when I compared it to 2 others of the same brush that were actually ordered from the real sigma website.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but it&#x27;s definitely not up to the quality I expected for sigma being so high priced.</li>
            <li> It has a very long handle with extremely soft bristles.</li>
            <li> but no, alas, every time I try to use this I get black hairs all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the past few months and I am absolutely IN LOVE with it.</li>
            <li> This brush can blend just about any eye shadow, regardless of how good or bad quality it is.</li>
            <li> Its big fluffy and very soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused if this is original or not..</li>
            <li> Mine has the appearance of being flat rather than rounded.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, although the bristles might be a little too rough for me.</li>
            <li> a while back, they should still provide a reasonably similar design of the brush they claim to be selling customers or, at the very least, provide  a disclaimer explaining the brush has been changed to the point that it no longer retains the same function of the original brush they previously marketed as their E40...</li>

            <li> My only complaint is how much shipping is...</li>
            <li> big dense and soft fluffy brush for blending out the crease and outer edge of the eye.</li>
            <li> I wash all my brushes carefully, as to not get water inside the adhesive, and I don&#x27;t have this problem with any of my other Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what they sent me because i follow plenty of you tubers and they all use the e40 and one in particular</li>
            <li> Soft hairs work well on your eyelids without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this Sigma blending brush for a long time.  </li>
            <li> brush was purchased from Sigma through Amazon, I felt I should clear up the questions for those who were wondering if the other sellers were responsible for the poor quality of these brushes by selling fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little stiff, but I think after a few washes, it&#x27;ll become softer and a bit more fluffy.</li>
            <li> I have the e35, which compared to this one is bigger and fluffier, but it is supposed to be the other way around.</li>
            <li> said herself that the one she bought separately as appose to the one with a with other brushes ( set) ,was not the same</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this for so long!</li>
            <li> so you can see the difference compared to all the photos other reviewers posted of the one they currently sell...</li>
            <li> so you can see the difference compared to all the photos other reviewers posted of the one they currently sell...</li>
            <li> I have heard numerous praises from other makeup artists and I want to see and try them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soft, very fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> and I thought that it&#x27;d be a great multi-purpose brush, but the bristles are the worst that I&#x27;ve ever had on any makeup brush -- they are very coarse and splay everywhere.  </li>
            <li> The shipping took longer than I expected, but not too long.  </li>
            <li> Not the same as my other sigma e40!</li>
            <li> The brush hairs are cut differently and bleed black when washed.</li>
            <li> it doesnt blend my crease well it actually makes it look like a mess.</li>
            <li> This brush is similar but has a different design, the bristles are longer so there is a little less control.  </li>
            <li> I hate the price of this brush because there are others out there just as amazing that last forever just like this one, but cost way less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a little larger than I expected, so I don&#x27;t use it to apply shadow.</li>
            <li> This brush was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> It applies a giant amount of shadow that ends up looking messy &amp; all over the place.</li>
            <li> Work well for wide eye lid blending.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected</li>
            <li> TOO BIG AND FLUFFY</li>
            <li> SPENT ALMOST 400 DOLLARS ON MY MAC BRUSHES BUT FROM NOW</li>
            <li> When I received it I noticed some of the bristles were straggly and it was rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> After I blend my eye shadow on there are a few stray brush hairs left on my eye lid.  </li>
            <li> The brush I received had minimal shedding, and it achieved blending without the scratchy feeling some brushes give.</li>
            <li> Just an empty wrapper for the brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems in shipping.</li>
            <li> I am especially attracted to how fluffy this brush is.  </li>
            <li> Then, I fluff off the excess shadow from my lid with the brush.</li>
            <li> The one I got is no where near as thick as the other ones.</li>
            <li> Now, with the second brush just as bad as the first, I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s an actual problem with the manufacturing of this brush.</li>
            <li> it is a sigma brush sigma is listed and the branding is the same the reason why people think it&#x27;s fake is because it&#x27;s the new E40, sigma redesigned it thats why it&#x27;s different than ones some people had previously bought the newer ones have longer and less dense bristles.</li>
            <li> It says made in China, but all of my other sigma brushes say made in PRC.</li>
            <li> this is a fake brush, I was very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Blends and buffs extremely well.  </li>
            <li> It lives up to the hype from all of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Extremely dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t fluffy at all, it just sort of bent on my eye because the bristles were so long.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, the bristles smelled funny and were very dusty.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the $5 I paid for shipping either.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin and not fluffy and sheds.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this bruch, it&#x27;s too soft and thin.</li>
            <li> I wash my brushes and hang them upside down on my benjabelle flower tree which is basically a makeup brush drying rack</li>
            <li> I wash my brushes and hang them upside down on my benjabelle flower tree which is basically a makeup brush drying rack</li>
            <li> I have other sigma brushes that I use everyday, and they do not shed.</li>
            <li> I have a few other brushes but the quality of this one</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews about this brush not being &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Why mess with perfection??</li>
            <li> Nothing really shows, but it lays down a base to blend Urban Decay Buck under and slightly across where the hood of my lid folds down.</li>
            <li> There a little pricy but</li>
            <li> Now I know why all You Tubers rave about this little brush.</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH IT IS A LITTLE</li>
            <li> A little pricey for one brush</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to ANYONE because even if you are looking for a brush to throw a little color in your crease and run out the door...</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a little softer bristles.</li>
            <li> Smashbox and Mac brushes a little nicer.</li>
            <li> but i washed them a few times and now all the little hairs are wonkey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dense as it should be and not as fluffy.</li>
            <li> It is to big,bulky &amp; round for the precision i wanted to achieve in my crease.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday at the start of my eye makeup routine to define my crease.</li>
            <li> These brushes have completely changed my eyeshadow game!</li>
            <li> It always sheds a few hairs each time I wash it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday.  </li>
            <li> The quality is poor and I definitely regret purchasing.</li>
            <li> so the edges blend together almost imperceptibly.  </li>
            <li> I always have a problem blending out harsh lines with my eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The picture is not accurate at all.</li>
            <li> The first one was just as bad, but I figured I had just gotten a defective one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they have changed it.</li>
            <li> This e40 is small.</li>
            <li> I have quite small eyes</li>
            <li> I have small eyes</li>
            <li> Not cute.</li>
            <li> you will be picking 20 small bristles off of your eyes.  </li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who wears smokey eyes everyday or at anytime!</li>
            <li> The sad thing is, the brush I have now was a replacement for another one of the same E40.</li>
            <li> This brush, along with my E25 and E35 are usually all I need to create any eye look.</li>
            <li> i have washed it quite a few times and it hasn&#x27;t shed on me yet!</li>
            <li> I even usually use this one to blend out colors that I&#x27;ve applied with another brush.  </li>
            <li> This one that I purchased from amazon is so narrow and not a good blending brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain, but when I&#x27;m apply shadow in my crease area, it&#x27;s not as smoothe of an application.</li>
            <li> Pure crap.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who got this brush and it&#x27;s sheds like crazy?</li>
            <li> 6 months and 5 washes later this brush is still shedding on me like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use them and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now I understand what make-up artists mean when they say &amp;</li>
            <li> This is NOT a genuine Sigma brush!!  </li>
            <li> Not sure how I managed without it before!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for at least six months, and it still sheds like crazy every single time I use it or wash it.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> its seriously one of those brushes i reach for since i do alot of smoky eyes</li>
            <li> It is so stiff and won&#x27;t blend anything!!</li>
            <li> The quality of this brush is definitely not as good as MAC.</li>
            <li> It makes it very difficult to blend because of the shape which seems to drag shadow rather than blending out into a diffused look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a manufacturing flaw or a fake brush</li>
            <li> Shape is off, the hairs are different, overall unhappy with it! &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> It sheds a little but nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m confused..</li>
            <li> Not one stray bristle, or broken handle.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use with Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Brightening Powder.</li>
            <li> A poor quality one at that.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that I feel as though it is a fake :(.</li>
            <li> , I just wanted another brush to add a base color all over my lid and help lay my transition color down in the crease.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s useless for blending.</li>
            <li> the is it fake or not?</li>
            <li> I either got a defected Sigma e40 Brush or I was given a fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but don&#x27;t get this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> so I feel that I got a fake on from this seller..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not happy!</li>
            <li> This fake e40 that I was sent is dense, applies the color heavier, and is identical to the e35.</li>
            <li> Forget the expensive MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> Fake Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a FAKE</li>
            <li> Fake brushes buyers beware.</li>
            <li> Fake sigma e40.</li>
            <li> This brush is fake.</li>
            <li> I swear you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it was a fake brush.</li>
            <li> I bought brushes from the Sigma website and found out this brush was absolutely a fake.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if you get a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brush,</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of brushes on the inexpensive - expensive spectrum.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> Beware fake Sigma.</li>
            <li> The brush I received was obviously a fake.</li>
            <li> So upset this brush ended up being fake.</li>
            <li> The brush I received is definitely a fake.</li>
            <li> I hope this is not a real sigma brush cause its terrible quality.</li>
            <li> This brush is hard and scratchy!!!</li>
            <li> This brush was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was afraid at the shedding reviews I had seen on here, but I have got three now from Etailz here on Amazon and none of them have shed when washing or using yet.</li>
            <li> Brush was shedding and stiff from the beginning, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The item is 100% Fake!</li>
            <li> I think I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> I think I got a bad one.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to receive a synthetic version of this brush and promptly contacted Sigma&#x27;s customer service department.</li>
            <li> After being so disappointed with this brush I looked up pictures of it online.</li>
            <li> So disappointed :(</li>
            <li> For the price it is I&#x27;m honestly disappointed.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY or you will be so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed that this brush sheds like the dickens.  </li>
            <li> This is a crap brush over all</li>
            <li> I gave this brush 3 stars because I hate it as a blending/transition shadow brush.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> i am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this brush.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Got this for my girl. Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints she loves it give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> After hearing a ton of reviews about how awesome Sigma brushes are, I caved and bought two. I was so excited to use them and was very disappointed. This brush is too soft to actually blend anything. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the brush is good quality but it&#x27;s useless for blending. My drugstore brushes work better and cost half as much.  Update: After being so disappointed with this brush I looked up pictures of it online. I&#x27;m pretty sure the brush I got is a knock off. The one I got is no where near as thick as the other ones. It&#x27;s not as dense as it should be and not as fluffy. I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> This brush was a disappointment. It is to big,bulky &amp; round for the precision i wanted to achieve in my crease. It applies a giant amount of shadow that ends up looking messy &amp; all over the place. I went to MAC &amp; bought the 217 brush &amp; couldn&#x27;t be happier.i wish i would&#x27;ve done that in the 1st place instead of wasting my $ on the Sigma e40. Its worth the extra $10-15. I use the e40 to do an all over shadow blend @the end of my shadow application. I hope this helps anyone who&#x27;s looking for precision application.</li>
            <li> I love this brush... It is great for blending product and although it is very fluffy, it has a very controlled blend.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Soft and does what it claims to do. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, a must have!</li>
            <li> Work well for wide eye lid blending. Cannot tell if it better compared to MAC or eco tools brand, it&#x27;s just all had similar results.</li>
            <li> Love this brush best blending brush I have!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. Great for blending eye shadow.</li>
            <li> My brush was shedding a lot of hair almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fast shipment and quality of Sigma&#x27;s product(s). I will continue to shop with Sigma Beauty in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a good quality blending brush at a reasonable price. I finally found exactly what I was looking for! I look forward to collecting more of these great brushes!</li>
            <li> I buy online all the time, but this is the first time I&#x27;m writing a review. I don&#x27;t think I got the real e40. I&#x27;m not sure if they have changed it. I supposedly got it from an authorized retailer. I have the e35, which compared to this one is bigger and fluffier, but it is supposed to be the other way around. This e40 is small. It&#x27;s not as soft either. It says made in China, but all of my other sigma brushes say made in PRC. As soon as I used this brush, it didn&#x27;t feel right. The quality wasn&#x27;t there. So disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I just received this brush and I love it! I&#x27;ve been having trouble getting that nice \\&quot;blended\\&quot; look in the crease area. This brush makes it so easy to blend shadows! I will definitely be purchasing more sigma brushes in the future!</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!! I ordered this product. With a gift card I had received for my birthday, and even then I was surprised by the price! So inexpensive for a brush that I&#x27;ve heard so much about! It came relatively quickly because I ordered right after Christmas time. The brush is beautiful. It has a very long handle with extremely soft bristles. My only complaint is how much shipping is... All in all did is is a great item!</li>
            <li> The Sigma E40 brush is one of the best blending brushes, and it can be used in many ways. It can be used to put eye shadow into the crease, and it can also be used to blend out shadows and blend shadows together. Anyone into makeup should have a brush like this in their collection. The price is very affordable compared to other brands, and the quality is comparable or better than higher costed brands.</li>
            <li> This is not the original sigma. I opened the bag and the item immediately broke. I heard sigma is good quality and this brush is definitely not good quality. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Lovely blending brush fits perfectly into the crease area and the results are perfect. Bristles are soft and its a all around sturdy brush. Shpping was fast and brush came nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Sigma has done it again! This brush is amazing! Soft hairs work well on your eyelids without being too harsh. I like the length of the brush itself and would highly recommend purchasing it to blend out those eyeshadow edges.</li>
            <li> All Makeup Enthusiast, lol, THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!! I Promise U, U Will B Completely 100% SATISFIED</li>
            <li> This brush works well! It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve used at blending eyeshadow and does not shed. I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this brush is a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or if the quality just isn&#x27;t what I was expecting (since I have never owned an authentic E40 before to compare it to). The issue is that it lacks fluffiness and the bristles sort of go &amp;#34;straight up&amp;#34; rather than fluffing out at the end (see attached picture). It makes it very difficult to blend because of the shape which seems to drag shadow rather than blending out into a diffused look. If you are contemplating purchasing from this site I would advise you to stay away and get one straight from Sigma for a few extra dollars just to be safe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I purchased this from the seller &amp;#34;NetGear&amp;#34; who Sigma listed as an authorized dealer on their website, so who knows-- it could be real and just not the quality that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Love how soft the brush is, great quality and at great price. Will be ordering more brushes soon and diffrent products. Thank you</li>
            <li> Everyone raves about the Sigma brushes, so I needed to try them out. They are now my go-to brushes! They are just the right density and give the correct amount of pressure. Now I understand what make-up artists mean when they say &amp;#34;let the brush do the work for you&amp;#34;. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Amazing eyeshadow blending brush!! Super high quality, washes well, &amp; works like a dream!</li>
            <li> This is the first Sigma brush I purchased after seeing all the rave reviews on YouTube. I paid almost $20 after shipping and will never pay this much for a brush again. It sheds, is not very dense, and my $3 ELF flawless concealer brush works a thousand times better. I also use Ecotools, which are all incredibly soft, hold up fantastically through many washings and are very high quality for a fraction of the price of Sigma. If this is representative of Sigma quality, I&#x27;ll stick with &amp;#34;low-end&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had lots of blending brushes, but none of them really worked as blending brushes. Or to my satisfaction I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are long enough, but not too long to blend smoothly. I&#x27;d definitely call this a must have brush for all brush collections.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it.. I like it though. It does the job, but it&#x27;s definitely not up to the quality I expected for sigma being so high priced. It frays at the ends, and after one washed it did shed quite a lot which sucked. Other than that it&#x27;s a good brush. I&#x27;ll just look into brushes more before I purchase from sigma again.</li>
            <li> I received my brush, it is a good quality brush but this is NOT THE ORIGINAL E40 brush.. this is a fake brush, I was very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful!  It provides a wonderful diffused look to my eye makeup without over-blending and muddying up the colors.</li>
            <li> the hype is TRUE! this brush is great especially considering the price. I highly recommend it for your blending needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this Sigma blending brush after seeing someone use it in a tutorial and I&#x27;m so glad I did!! I love using this brush to blend my eyeshadow seamlessly together. I would buy from this seller again! Prompt service and the brush arrived exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush to blend out shadows in the crease and make them look more diffused</li>
            <li> I bought this because make-up girls on Youtube said it was awesome.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it would work so well, since the bristles are so long, but it is really nice!</li>
            <li> I thought this brush was going to go into my daily rotation but I just don&#x27;t love it as much as I love my MAC 217.  This brush is similar but has a different design, the bristles are longer so there is a little less control.  I bought this knowing it wasn&#x27;t going to replace my 217, I just wanted another brush to add a base color all over my lid and help lay my transition color down in the crease.  This brush had so many amazing reviews for both of those purposes so I pulled the trigger.  While the brush is well made and has a great construction and weight to it, I still reach for my MAC 21 instead.  I just feel the bristles on the E40 are too floppy to work in the way I want them to work.  This brush lives up to its intended purpose, it just doesn&#x27;t fulfill my own personal needs.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush! It blends so well!!</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. What else can I say other than I love these brushes. They are wonderful brushes. My makeup goes on so much easier and effortless since I started buying these. There a little pricy but so worth it. I have several but I am in the process of replacing all y brushes with sigma brushes. I&#x27;d like to have them all!!!!!</li>
            <li> Again another wonderful brush!!</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for blending out eyeshadow or even putting setting powder under the eyes! Must have! Its big fluffy and very soft!</li>
            <li> first off I&#x27;d like to clear the is it fake or not? No it&#x27;s not fake it is a sigma brush sigma is listed and the branding is the same the reason why people think it&#x27;s fake is because it&#x27;s the new E40, sigma redesigned it thats why it&#x27;s different than ones some people had previously bought the newer ones have longer and less dense bristles. I like it I never purchased one of the older E40 only recently have I decided to get higher end brushes. but it&#x27;s a good brush gets the job done but if your looking to get one is suggest one from the travel sets that are colored. The sets should be pink, purple, and a light blue and smaller in size I think. I&#x27;ve heard the E40 in those is fluffier and denser hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brushes. I use it everyday at the start of my eye makeup routine to define my crease. It&#x27;s very nice and fluffy and diffuses the color very well. Love it and couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for. It allows for seamless blending and is great for creating a blown out smoky look. The brush is larger than I expected, but I love it anyway! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great blending brush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> All of their brushes are the best. Better than anything one could buy at even Sephora or any high end brushes you ordinarily buy</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT fluffer!  Blends great!  First time using Sigma and to be honest I think this is as good as any of my Mac brushes and way less money!</li>
            <li> I either got a defected Sigma e40 Brush or I was given a fake. But this is definitely not a Sigma e40. It&#x27;s not as fluffy or as big as the real one. I&#x27;m sorry but don&#x27;t get this brush. It&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> Now I know why all You Tubers rave about this little brush. All makeup lovers need this blending brush in thier collection.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup junkie.  This brush is the perfect size, shape, and softness for blending and using it as a &amp;#34;windshield&amp;#34; brush.  Makes my eyeshadow look significantly better.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!! I had wanted a sigma brush but really didn&#x27;t want to spent it amount on the sigma website this was perfect!!! :)</li>
            <li> big dense and soft fluffy brush for blending out the crease and outer edge of the eye. i love this for a well blended and more natural look because gentle blending makes a more professional and well done eye look. a great brush for your eyeshadow brush set</li>
            <li> I used this brush at my friends house after I had over applied my crease color, it blended out the colors just the right amount. Later that night I got a complement from a friends saying, \\&quot;I really like your eye makeup, its blended out perfectly\\&quot;. After that I saw the need for a blending brush in any girls makeup bag. Furthermore these brushes remind me of the mac ones and are just really good quality!</li>
            <li> I want all brushes made by Sigma--- best makeup brushes on the market</li>
            <li> I have other blending brushes but this one is one of a kind, blending comes so easy with this brush with less amount of force.</li>
            <li> Shipped early and quality was great !  Can&#x27;t ask for more !</li>
            <li> Best blending brush ever!!!</li>
            <li> So soft and it grabs a lot of product onto the brush. It applies so evenly, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the past few months and I am absolutely IN LOVE with it. I have quite small eyes and this brush is the perfect size for them, in my opinion. As for the actual blending, flawless; the quality of the brush really shows through application.</li>
            <li> love how soft this blending r even if it kinda big for blending small areas, I use them for the higlight under my eyebrows, its amazing brush, love it</li>
            <li> For the first time I ordered Sigma brushes because I heard good reviews about them, And I am soo loving them, I used it today, it is so soft, big enough for a fast blend of shadow on my eyelid, really great product!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brush. Blends beautifully. I use it to blend eyeshadow (obviously) and sometimes contour my nose. I hate the price of this brush because there are others out there just as amazing that last forever just like this one, but cost way less. But overall this brush is amazing and it will last forever!</li>
            <li> Nice tapered blending brush. The handle is the same size all the way down, top to bottom which got my attention. I&#x27;m use to a tapered handle, that is easier on the handling. The brush is good quality, length, etc. The only thing I thought could be improved was the amount of bristles; it isn&#x27;t as full as it could be. Mine has the appearance of being flat rather than rounded. It blends well enough.</li>
            <li> I had been on the fence about purchasing this brush as I was trying to make do with what I had, but wow what a difference! I am a fan of beauty blogger Jaclyn Hill and bought this brush (and the E25) from her recommendation. These brushes have completely changed my eyeshadow game! It&#x27;s so easy to get professional looking shadow now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only just started out in make up, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend Â£20 on a make up brush incase I didn&#x27;t end up using it much. This brush is so soft and such good quality, specially for the price. I&#x27;ll definitely get a lot of use out of it and am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Exactly as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused if this is original or not.. I just received 3 brushes from the official sigma website.. so I took the E-40 that I got from here and compared it.. I compared the imprint on the handle and the one from sigma is way shinier and you can really see the color changes with the reflection of the light. so I just considered that maybe because it&#x27;s 2weeks older(I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference) so then I compared the metal part.. and the engraving is really different. the one from sigma is deeper and clearer.. so I feel that I got a fake on from this seller.. I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m confused..&lt;br /&gt;-by the way I&#x27;m kristine, I&#x27;m just using my boyfriend&#x27;s account :)</li>
            <li> I Love the sigma E40 brush !!! It is perfect for what I needed !!! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush on a Wednesday and received it on Saturday! Super fast shipping and the brush is so soft. This brush is exactly how it appears on the website and all around I love it!</li>
            <li> When doing an eye shadow look it is always important to blend it out, this brush is perfect for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Not the same as my other sigma e40! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a manufacturing flaw or a fake brush but I&#x27;m not happy! The brush on the left is a real sigma e40 and the brush on the right is what this seller sent me. The real e40 is fluffy and applies color lightly. This fake e40 that I was sent is dense, applies the color heavier, and is identical to the e35.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best brushes you could own for your eyes! I am so glad I bought it. I could never get my shadow to blend properly or to define the outer corners of my eyes, and now I see why. I was definitely not using the right kind of brush. I purchased this because I have heard great things about Sigma and I heard correctly. The brush is made very well and does a great job with eye shadow. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Super soft! A lot larger than I had anticipated though. This is really a huge brush!!!! It does work to help blend the edges of your eyeshadow out though. It always sheds a few hairs each time I wash it. Overall, I do like this brush quite a bit!</li>
            <li> This is not the real Sigma E40 brush. The brush hairs are cut differently and bleed black when washed. Do not buy this brush here.</li>
            <li> MY E40 TAPERED BLENDING BRUSH IS GREAT!  ALTHOUGH IT IS A LITTLE TOO BIG AND FLUFFY FOR MY EYES, I&#x27;VE BEEN USING IT FOR CONTOURING MY CHEEKS INSTEAD.  IT WAS CHEAP AND DOESN&#x27;T LOSE AS MUCH HAIR AS SOME OF MY MAC BLENDING BRUSHES. IT&#x27;S DEFINITELY WORTH IT. I&#x27;VE SPENT ALMOST 400 DOLLARS ON MY MAC BRUSHES BUT FROM NOW ON I WILL BE PURCHASING FROM SIGMA.</li>
            <li> Forget the expensive MAC brushes. These are awesome and all I use now. I&#x27;ve had my sigma brushes for almost a year and they&#x27;re still holding their shape. Not one stray bristle, or broken handle. Great quality!&lt;br /&gt;I have beautifully applied makeup and I&#x27;m not broke. Win-win.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite sigma brushes that I use all the time for blending. So happy I got this and recommend it to all of my friends</li>
            <li> Great make up brushes, my daughter loves them and uses them all the time. Affordable prices and excellent quality, will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Awesome blending brush! It works perfectly and need to by another one to have it for back up LOVE It!</li>
            <li> This is a great blending brush, the price is right and with this tool you can use any makeup to create a beautifully blended look.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, excellent product!</li>
            <li> Very good quality at a great price.  Soft bristles and easy to keep clean and disinfected. Super easy for blending with or without heavy hand. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this brush. I see so many gurus on YouTube rave about this so obviously I had to try it. When I received it I noticed some of the bristles were straggly and it was rough to the touch. I washed it with Dawn dish soap, baby shampoo, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil and it was soft as described. Blends really beautifully though!</li>
            <li> I used to have the MAC equivalent of this brush for years and never replaced it.  I heard this is a great dupe and I have to say that I totally love this brush.  I forgot how much I missed this blending brush.  I have been using it everyday.  I have small eyes but I still enjoy using it to blend out my crease shadow.</li>
            <li> I love this brush it Meets expectation and Does the job perfectly . It is Worth the price it is</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as soft as I hoped. For the price it is I&#x27;m honestly disappointed.</li>
            <li> A great blending and crease brush.  The quality of this brush has been amazing.</li>
            <li> Fake Sigma brushes. Don&#x27;t buy!!!</li>
            <li> Best blending brush I have ever had. I will be investing in more Sigma brushes over time. Be sure to check the Sigma website to see who their authorized sellers are on Amazon so you are sure to get a genuine product.</li>
            <li> I loved it....blends the colors nicely and gives great results...and gives a flawless look on the crease without any sharp lines</li>
            <li> This brush is my new holy grail for blending!! The bristles are soft and easy to work with. I am trying the new amazon prime trial and so far I love it, I got the brush when it said I would receive it, no complaints!</li>
            <li> This brush can blend just about any eye shadow, regardless of how good or bad quality it is. I am in love, and would recommend Sigma brushes to anyone! They are so worth the money.</li>
            <li> This brush is nothing like the one I had purchased directly from Sigma. It does not look like the picture. The reason I like the E40 so much is because it&#x27;s fluffier than the mac 224. This one that I purchased from amazon is so narrow and not a good blending brush. Shape is off, the hairs are different, overall unhappy with it! &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This Sigma E40 is a great transition brush! Picks up product really well and distributes it on the lid beautifully! Extremely soft and gentle on your skin as well.  It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> apparently my wife ordered this on my account so i cant give any first hand knowledge but i can say that i havent heard her complain about it so i assume she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she actually made a big deal about these things and i saw her putting a lot of effort into keeping them in good shape by washing and taking care of them... which ive never seen her do with anything else, including the bathroom sink area which is constantly a disaster with all her products everywhere... but these things were always thoughtfully placed in their spot... like things should be so... it appears that she loves them.</li>
            <li> Not only is this brush great for blending out my shadows I have used this brush to conceal under my eyes and use as a highlighter brush! The fact that I can get multiple uses out of this brush is worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these brushes ever since i seen it being used on Youtube. So i could not wait to get it. A little pricey for one brush but it is sooo worth it! One thing i did not like when i first used it it shed a lot. Now that i used it a bunch more times it only sheds a little here &amp; there. It works great for blending your eye shadows and since it is tapered it gets in the crease &amp; blends that out very well. I dont know what i did without this brush in my HUGE collection of brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotten a brush like this sooner-- it truly does make a huge difference! I really like this brush, although the bristles might be a little too rough for me. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I&#x27;m going to check out MAC&#x27;s and Sephora&#x27;s brushes.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH!!!!! Lauren Curtis from youtube got me started on it and it most definitely is a MUST have if you love creating smokey eyes or looks that involve blending in your crease!</li>
            <li> This brush is great to put down a nice base color in your crease.  Blends and buffs extremely well.  I use it to start and finish a look...it really helps blend everything together and holds product really well.  Glides over your eye nicely too.  I would recommend this brush to ANYONE because even if you are looking for a brush to throw a little color in your crease and run out the door...THIS IS THE BRUSH FOR YOU!!  Beautiful application!</li>
            <li> I ordered the e40 from sigma and it was not fluffy at all and did not blend well. Im not sure what they sent me because i follow plenty of you tubers and they all use the e40 and one in particular said herself that the one she bought separately as appose to the one with a with other brushes ( set) ,was not the same, btw this was after the fact that i purchased the brush.</li>
            <li> LOVE all my Sigma brushes! This one in particular does a magnificent job blending out my creases. Super soft and glides well..in love with this line!! TRY the F80 kabuki!!</li>
            <li> 5 Star Blending Brush!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is NOT a genuine Sigma brush!!  If you are used to real Sigma quality brushes you will immediately notice the difference.  It is still a nice brush, but when you are paying this much money for a Sigma brush you deserve a Sigma brush.  If you want cheaper brushes give Coastal Scents a try.  They are not as nice as Sigma but still good quality.  Please beware of this seller.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to have this brush!</li>
            <li> This product was great like all the Sigma brushes I have bought, but was too similar to another brush I already have. I returned this brush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect much but this is great. Very gentle but really smothes and blends wonderfully. Don&#x27;t hesitate. Just get it.</li>
            <li> Perfect blending brush, soft, no issues with shedding when washed and blends eyeshadow like a dream. This is well worth the money you will pay. I have many different blending brushes from MAC down to the cheap ones you can buy on Ebay for .99 and then everything in between and my Sigma E40 is the one I reach for the most. I love it so much I bought a back up!</li>
            <li> This is a really great brush for applying eye shadow!  It&#x27;s a little more than I would have liked to pay, but it does the job!  I&#x27;ve been using the brush for a week and none of the bristles have fallen out.  Super soft!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the shedding during washes. It blends my eyeshadow very well and fits perfect on the eye. For the price it&#x27;s a steal over MAC brushes ( they shed also).</li>
            <li> This brush is made with unicorn hair. It has to be! I could apply my eyeshadow left-handed and then go in with this brush and blend it out, and you&#x27;d never know. Amazing, beautiful, soft, fluffy, best eye brush I own!</li>
            <li> ATTENTION LADIES (AND GENTLEMEN): Sigma Beauty is now using synthetic bristles in their brushes. I was shocked to receive a synthetic version of this brush and promptly contacted Sigma&#x27;s customer service department. They confirmed that all Sigma brushes will now be made synthetically. I am a strict vegetarian and wholeheartedly believe that synthetic brushes should be used when possible. This is not the case with Sigma E40. Though it is large, the brush has lost it&#x27;s famed fluffiness. It&#x27;s much more firm than my natural hair Sigma brushes and is rather flat now as opposed to round. This is because of the cut and the material. While the company is transitioning, there may still be some natural hair brushes available. I ordered from Etailz who only carried the synthetic now. Hopefully you ladies will have better luck with the new brushes but I will be turning to Bdellium and Zoeva for my future brushes due to the price increase and quality decrease of Sigma.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for blending out my eyeshadows and applying it to the area above the crease very nicely. It doesn&#x27;t shed and It is very soft and nice. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Sigma blending brush is a must have for blending and defining today&#x27;s eye styles in make up, you can be intense or non-descriptive, but always fashionable.  I love it, I can define the intensity I want or need, or I can be subtle, all without lines!  :)</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Brush has a lot more shedding than the sigma E25 blending brush. Also lost its shape after the third wash.</li>
            <li> It was a knock off... Not a real sigma product when I compared it to 2 others of the same brush that were actually ordered from the real sigma website. Brush barely works.</li>
            <li> This is the worst brush ever. It&#x27;s not the actual sigma brush it&#x27;s thin and not fluffy and sheds. DONT BUY or you will be so disappointed. Might as well go to the sigma site and buy this brush. It&#x27;s a FAKE</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing! Jaclyn Hill inspired me to get this and she&#x27;s so right! The is a must have for life!</li>
            <li> I love it. Does what it&#x27;s suppose too.</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely perfect for blending. The brush is so soft. I love this brand and all of their brushes.</li>
            <li> Most of my brush collection is from sigma. Great quality but for some reason this brush is not shedding but there are flakes coming out of the brush. I believe it&#x27;s glue. I wash my brushes and hang them upside down on my benjabelle flower tree which is basically a makeup brush drying rack so I don&#x27;t understand why the glue is coming out of this brush. I did purchase this from instyle. I think I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite brush in my collection. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soft, very fluffy brush. It&#x27;s also a little larger than I expected, so I don&#x27;t use it to apply shadow. It does blend out harsh lines very well. I still use a smaller tapered blending brush for the crease, but it&#x27;s a nice all over blender.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to the more expensive MAC brush and I guess the bottom line is you get what you pay for.  The quality of this brush is definitely not as good as MAC. The hairs in the brush started coming out after the first use. After I blend my eye shadow on there are a few stray brush hairs left on my eye lid.  Can&#x27;t recommend this product. It was not worth the $5 I paid for shipping either.</li>
            <li> This brush is the BEST blending brush I have ever used. I honestly don&#x27;t think I can own enough of them. I was afraid at the shedding reviews I had seen on here, but I have got three now from Etailz here on Amazon and none of them have shed when washing or using yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. It works best applying all over color to the lid.  Not stiff enough in my opinion to work color in your crease</li>
            <li> Wonderful at blending out harsh eyeshadow lines. Not sure how I managed without it before! Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really nice brush and received it quick. Only thing is that I feel as though it is a fake :(. But regardless it is a very good brush and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this brush need me about two more to add to my collection</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this brush because I have another sigma brush (contour) that I love.  I was extremely disappointed that this brush sheds like the dickens.  I was hoping after a few washed the shedding would cool it but no, alas, every time I try to use this I get black hairs all over my face.  Not cute.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for putting all over color on the crease and up to the brow bone. This brush is great quality. I have washed it more than once and I never lose hairs from the brush.</li>
            <li> As many makeup artist will tell you, its all about the brushes to get a good makeup look. I completely agree! I bought this brush after reading numerous reviews and its the best addition to my collection. I use it to apply the \\&quot;All Over\\&quot; eyeshadow color on my lids. It picks up just enough color but with the same brush you can build on it. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop reading and just buy it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and blends out eyeshadow perfectly. It&#x27;s also good for blending out concealer as well!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. The shipping took longer than I expected, but not too long.  The brush is great for blending and very soft.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, but it got really funked up through shipping. The bristles are lopsided and flattened, so i&#x27;m hoping it returns to it&#x27;s shape after I was it. Also, there was a crack in the finish of the handle. This ticked me off, but I called Amazon customer service and they discounted my purchase since it was damaged. The actual brush works fine, it&#x27;s just not as pretty as I would like it to be for the price. The one I received is authentic, always remember to check the seller!</li>
            <li> this product came very quickly, i loved the packaging and the cards that come with the makeup brush to explain how to clean the brush and what to use it for. very good quality and I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Hey Guys.  For all the reviews that say they don&#x27;t like this brush because it feels like a dupe, that&#x27;s because it probably is a dupe. If you look at the top by the price, under the words In Stock, where it says \\&quot;Sold By\\&quot;, NG,Inc is not an Authorized Retailer for Sigma. The list of Authorized Retailers for Sigma can be found on Sigma&#x27;s website, there is an upper right tab that says Authorized Retailers. Just choose your country and you&#x27;ll see the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten Sigma brushes from Amazon, and they are the exact same as what I get from the Sigma website because I always make sure the seller is correct.  Check this from now on and you will always get authentic Sigma brushes on Amazon!</li>
            <li> beautiful brush - amazing application</li>
            <li> Great brush for blending eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> My product arrived on time and packaged perfectly.  Blends okay and good brush for beginners. I recommend if your a newbie at learning to apply and blend eye shadow.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good brush and the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I am new to using brushes, so I have been buying alot of them. I really have enjoyed the Sigma brushes because the are not to soft yet not to thick and they blend the eyeshadow to perfection. I totally recommend Sigma brushes. I am sticking with this brand!</li>
            <li> This is a really great brush- it&#x27;s so soft, it picks up color beautifully, blends eyeshadow like a dream.</li>
            <li> perfect for blending eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Works great at blending. I had heard rave reviews on YouTube and thought I would give it a try. I do wish it had a little softer bristles.</li>
            <li> Fake brushes buyers beware.</li>
            <li> This brush is a fake, the brushes arent the same as the authentic brushes. This brush is hard and scratchy!!!</li>
            <li> Best brushes, love Sigma products because they keep their shape!</li>
            <li> I bought two of this brush. I use them for applying when I want a soft, subtle wash of colour on my eyes and to blend and blow out more intense eye looks. My gripe is that they are very splayed out and won&#x27;t go back into the shape they should be. *sigh* Maybe I need to buy Brush Guards for them...</li>
            <li> It came timely and the brush is quite useful. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Very good for blending shadow, however not my favorite.</li>
            <li> FAKE BRUSH EVERYONE!!! It is so stiff and won&#x27;t blend anything!! the bristles poke my eyelids all the time and IT HURTSSSSS!!! I&#x27;m returning it and order a real one from Sigma website</li>
            <li> I honestly believe this is a fake. It feels cheap. It is not thick or densely packed with bristles. You would be safer ordering directly from Sigma.</li>
            <li> Best blending brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I love this brush it came in the cutest packing with a review gide of all of sigma brushes. I can go on and on of why I love this brush however if your eye shape is smaller then average I would skip on this brush or if you are also new to eyeshadow. I would start with a brush with a shorter handle it will give you more control verse a longer handle like this sigma E40 brush for example real techniques eco tools or sephoras travel sets are better for beginners. The brush itself is large and perfect for a transition Shade and blending out harsh lines. I&#x27;ve had my brush for awhile it&#x27;s been washed a good hand full of times and I&#x27;ve never experienced any shedding. The brush picks up color like a dream high end eyeshadow and drug store. I am very pleased with my purchased and will be buying more brushes from sigma.</li>
            <li> No issues with this order, it arrived on time</li>
            <li> Excellent blending brush - I almost prefer it over my MAC blending brushes.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  Brush works great. The blend ability is beyond what I thought.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one who got this brush and it&#x27;s sheds like crazy? Got it on Sigma site so it is defiantly authentic. I found this brush the worst brush of my collection! It sheds, the bristles actually brake and fall out, I have had the brush for about a year now and did&#x27;t use it very often but it is now half way bold. I am not happy with sigma brushes, I defiantly will say that ECO tools are better quality than Sigma! Why spend a lot more many if the chipper brushes do better job?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful product</li>
            <li> This brush was a gift for my best friend and she seemed pleased with it. She said Sigma is a reputable brand with great brushes and she was happy to add this to her collection.</li>
            <li> its okay but but you can have something more practical so get the ultimate use of it.</li>
            <li> The perfect brush for applying eyeshadow base and blending! Love love this brush :)</li>
            <li> Love this brush and the whole sigma line. Makes all the difference when putting on my make up.</li>
            <li> 6 months and 5 washes later this brush is still shedding on me like crazy. I hope this is not a real sigma brush cause its terrible quality. It definitely seems like a dupe.</li>
            <li> love love love this for blending out my eye shadow, the only problem i DO have with it, is that the E40 on the sigma site (and even in the picture for the brush here) looks different than the one i recieved, it&#x27;s not as fluffy or round as the pictures here, but it does the job so that&#x27;s why i kept it!</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush and I am impressed. The bristles are so soft. It blends my shadows very well. This is a must have for every make up lover.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for blending in the crease area as well as blending the whole look together. Very happy with my purchase. Order also got her sooner then expected which is also a great plus. Would recommend to any girl who needs a good blending brush. Definitely one of my new favourite brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!! I have already brought another sigma brush. If you haven&#x27;t tried a sigma brush you should!</li>
            <li> The brush I received had minimal shedding, and it achieved blending without the scratchy feeling some brushes give. Overall, I like it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush!</li>
            <li> Fake sigma e40. This is not what e40s look like at all. Real ones are way fluffier</li>
            <li> I love Sigma, always have and always will. The quality is good and it&#x27;s a cheaper alternative to MAC. Plus, the fur is much softer and it comes in many varieties of colors. I love how this eye shading brush is soft and it picks up a lot of color pigment. Definitely going to purchase more of Sigma products.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this bruch, it&#x27;s too soft and thin. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This brush is fake. It is not as close to the original. The hairs are completely different because they are way too stiff and a lot longer than the original. Do not purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I have wanted it for quite some time after seeing reviews on the internet. It is a little stiff, but I think after a few washes, it&#x27;ll become softer and a bit more fluffy. I&#x27;m very pleased with it overall!</li>
            <li> Perfect for blending shadows.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, but the bristles keep falling out for me! I wash all my brushes carefully, as to not get water inside the adhesive, and I don&#x27;t have this problem with any of my other Sigma brushes. But the brush is perfect for blending out eyeshadows, and it&#x27;s affordable. I may consider buying a duplicated, just to see if the one I had was defective.</li>
            <li> this was my first sigma brush it blends so well and great quality, funny thing is when i clean the bristles comes off sometimes, but overall great quality blends well</li>
            <li> I feel for the price I paid this is an okay brush not the softest but it will do. I have a MAC brush 224 which is softer and hold its shape better after washing.</li>
            <li> I needed good blending brushes but I canâ€™t afford a 25-35$ for a mac brush. So I asked around and seen that sigma are as good as mac but cheaper so I got the E35,E25 E30 E55 E45 and the E40. They are very good and soft, very easy to use and clean. Shipping was fast and I really like them. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5, when I washed them some of the hair came out. It was the first time I cleaned them.  I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s normal or not. I havenâ€™t tried cleaning them again Iâ€™m scared.</li>
            <li> This brush is everything! It blends and diffuses makeup lines effortlessly. I think I use this everytime I apply makeup.. The packaging was great and they even gave me a bonus eyeliner brush. Very pleased with this purchase:)</li>
            <li> Great for a flawless blending on the crease</li>
            <li> Great blending brush! Will purchase more!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It lives up to the hype from all of the other reviews. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> love it love it the best hands down</li>
            <li> I love love this brush. It applied eyeshadow fantastically. Only downside is it had a tremendous amount of fall out, even after several washes.</li>
            <li> when i hear it being talked about, it sounds really fluffy and awesome but the brush i got was really dense and stiff, not fluffy. it doesnt blend my crease well it actually makes it look like a mess. im going to try to roughen it up a bit..but everytime i used it, i did not like the way it applied my eye shadow...i am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> love the service and product</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Great for just applying a wash of color or blending. Well constructed as well.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an authentic sigma brush. DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, fluffy, quality.  I just bought another one of these.  It helps to blow out the crease when putting in transition shades.  Is also great for small detailing on the face (contouring).</li>
            <li> For the money was not very impressed, sedona lace brush is just as good and can  be purchased for half the price.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are super high quality and better then some high brand companies. I highly recommend these brushes to everyone.</li>
            <li> its fake not reall!!!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as MAC brushes!! I love how soft it is and the shape is perfect for the crease.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what all the reviewers say it does!</li>
            <li> This item came earlier than expected in good condition! I&#x27;ll definitely be looking forward to purchasing more. I have been wanting this for so long! I thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Love this brush blends eyeshadow well.</li>
            <li> Love the brush, not the price.</li>
            <li> Like this brush a lot, great for blending and getting into the crease.</li>
            <li> Not a Sigma brush. Flimsy and the brush is not fluffy at all. Extremely dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I love all the Sigma brushes! They are just as good as mac brushes and the price is perfect. I WANT to buy them all.</li>
            <li> Sigma has wondeful brushes!  I swear you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.  They have quality brushes that are affordable.  I will continue to buy there line of brushes.</li>
            <li> i dont think these are really sigma brushes they work well but i washed them a few times and now all the little hairs are wonkey. i think i will just pay the full price and order sigma directly.</li>
            <li> Sadly it was a fake brush. I bought brushes from the Sigma website and found out this brush was absolutely a fake. Be careful!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this brush! It makes blending a breeze and is a fantastic time saver when blending to perfection.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s the 2nd 1 I&#x27;ve purchased off of Amazon, but this time, I have found it to not be the same amazing quality as the 1st 1 I received. I&#x27;d really like to exchange it. For some reason the bristles feel a little more flimsy. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but when I&#x27;m apply shadow in my crease area, it&#x27;s not as smoothe of an application. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, if you get a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brush, it&#x27;s great. Maybe I just got a dud. I highly recommend this for your makeup brush kit. Use it daily. I love Sigma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a good contouring brush but this is hands down the best! Takes me half the time and works beautifully</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is an authentic brush. The quality is poor and I definitely regret purchasing.</li>
            <li> Best eye blending brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Comparable to MAC but way cheaper.  Considering buying another one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!! I seriously use it every single time I do my makeup, it blends eyeshadow perfect!!</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday blending brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for people with a lot of lid space. It applies transition shadows so well, which makes blending easier.</li>
            <li> Pure crap. Received the packaging FOR the brush but not the actual brush. Just an empty wrapper for the brush. So disgusted with this!</li>
            <li> Great brush! Worth every penny</li>
            <li> The best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> OMG the best blending brush I ever had.</li>
            <li> This brush is just perfect! Sigma is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Fantastic blending brush. Great for concealer too. Exceptionally soft and no shedding. I really love MAC brushes but it is difficult to justify the cost when there are great quality Sigma and MakeupGeek brushes for a much better price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****ALERT****&lt;br /&gt;My brush was purchased from Sigma through Amazon, I felt I should clear up the questions for those who were wondering if the other sellers were responsible for the poor quality of these brushes by selling fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;I have taken off 3 stars because this brush is not the same as the original E40. I was replacing my old version which is much fluffier, kind of like the photo you see here on the product listing (the photo shown appears to be a new one, but the ones they sell are not so fluffy and rounded on top as the one presented here on Amazon). The brush that is being sold as the E40 is all synthetic and not nearly as fluffy as the original, if you are looking for a dupe to MAC&#x27;s 224 this is NO LONGER the one. I am furious that they would make such a drastic change to a brush and sell it without any information or even a footnote acknowledging this is not like the original brush. This is a crap brush over all and it does not perform the way you would expect the brush advertised on this site to perform. The version they are sending customers is tapered, but the top is more blunt cut rather than carefully trimmed and slightly rounded like the full, fluffy, brush you expect to receive. They are more than aware people consider their brushes to be similar to MAC and that they offer quite a few MAC dupes, it is, after all, how Sigma managed to become famous before they launched their F80 series that they are more currently known for!  They produced good quality dupes of the most popular MAC brushes at greatly discounted prices, most looked practically identical too. I realize many people may have never owned any of Sigmas older brushes and although it is well known throughout the beauty industry that Sigma went to plastic handles and mostly all synthetic fibers a while back, they should still provide a reasonably similar design of the brush they claim to be selling customers or, at the very least, provide  a disclaimer explaining the brush has been changed to the point that it no longer retains the same function of the original brush they previously marketed as their E40...it is obviously a completely different brush, period. I am including a photo I found online of the old E40 compared with a MAC 224 so you can see the difference compared to all the photos other reviewers posted of the one they currently sell...full disclosure is a hallmark of any good company with an ounce of integrity and Sigma seems to have forgotten a lot of what made them so popular to begin with.plastic handles and mostly all synthetic fibers a while back, they should still provide a reasonably similar design of the brush they claim to be selling customers or, at the very least, provide  a disclaimer explaining the brush has been changed to the point that it no longer retains the same function of the original brush they previously marketed as their E40...it is obviously a completely different brush, period.

            <li> This review is for the Sigma Tapered Blending Brush - E40.  I&#x27;ve owned cheap brushes from my youth and purchased expensive brushes in my prime, but this thing sheds more than a white cat on a black couch even after 3 uses.  This is my first introduction to breakage and fallout and I never thought it would be with such a highly recommended brush.  I want to love this brand, but I passed the booth up at IMATS after this experience.  It&#x27;s a sad day when a Sonia Kashuik brush I bought 8 years ago is still a better quality than a Sigma brush purchased today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The person who recommended Sigma brushes to me swore up and down that they were among her favorite, but when I told her I had breakage, shedding, and fallout on the first use, she had no defense.  Maybe I received a brush from the reject pile?  I want to believe this is just a cruel joke.</li>
            <li> This brush is fabulous and a fraction of the cost of it&#x27;s MAC rival.  Trust me ladies, save the $$ and go Sigma.  It&#x27;s fluffier, bigger and better - but most importantly CHEAPER!  Who doesn&#x27;t want to save money?  Seriously.  And this brush actually feels more like a splurge than a save.  Buy one.  Buy two!  They are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of brushes on the inexpensive - expensive spectrum.  This brush is by far and away the most superior of the bunch.  I purchased this on recommendation of a friend and I would do it in a heart beat.  It&#x27;s the perfect blend of fluffy, firm and stiff.  It hold the product well but doesn&#x27;t scatter it all over your face.  I really wish I could give this brush a million stars but I have to stop at 5.  This brush is more than perfection for blending all types of eye shadow looks.  From simple eye shadow to in depth smokey eyes.  You will be so happy with the results you achieve when using this brush.</li>
            <li> I have purchased most of the brushes that Sigma has made and absolutely love them.  When I first received this brush I loved its shape and feel, however, with every use it sheds.  Not just one bristle but many!!  With one make up application you will be picking 20 small bristles off of your eyes.  Horrible brush.  Has completely lost its shape and density.  Stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely looove this blending brush! It blends so perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who wears smokey eyes everyday or at anytime! The quality of the brush is awesome too, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the hair bristles on the brush falling out. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better blending brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s a must-have for your makeup bag.</li>
            <li> This brush blends like a dream!! I love it so much, I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> Fast/reliable shipping, Authentic product. I gave this brush 3 stars because I hate it as a blending/transition shadow brush. It&#x27;s too flimsy not my first pick for this purpose. The only use I have for it is contouring my nose. Overal it&#x27;s a decent brush.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased or used a Sigma brush and I&#x27;ve seen that they are great quality on YouTube. I didn&#x27;t need a whole set so I got this eye blending brush. I really like the way the brush works. I would highly recommend this brush and seller. Absolutely no problems in shipping.</li>
            <li> All Sigma brushes are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for at least six months, and it still sheds like crazy every single time I use it or wash it. I like the size for blending, but I just can&#x27;t handle the shedding. The sad thing is, the brush I have now was a replacement for another one of the same E40. The first one was just as bad, but I figured I had just gotten a defective one. Now, with the second brush just as bad as the first, I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s an actual problem with the manufacturing of this brush. I have other sigma brushes that I use everyday, and they do not shed. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best blending brush ever. It is so soft and blends out your eye makeup amazingly. It sheds a little but nothing too crazy. I will never get another blending brush besides the E40.</li>
            <li> I definitely love it! But it&#x27;s somewhat expensive. Works great</li>
            <li> I use this every time I do my eye makeup. It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve used to blend transitional colors onto my crease or blending a dark color to smoke out my eyes.</li>
            <li> Most of my brush collection is from sigma. Great quality but for some reason this brush is not shedding but there are flakes coming out of the brush. I believe it&#x27;s glue. I wash my brushes and hang them upside down on my benjabelle flower tree which is basically a makeup brush drying rack so I don&#x27;t understand why the glue is coming out of this brush. I did purchase this from instyle seller. I still use it. I think I got a bad one.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews about this brush not being &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34;. But I can assure you it is, when I received my package it came EXACTLY the same when I ordered sigma online. It cones with sigma &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34; sticker :) love the brush and I recommend.</li>
            <li> Beware fake Sigma. The brush I received was obviously a fake. Not happy with it. Compared to MAC brushes Sigmas are not comparable.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a GREAT brush to make blending out eye shadow much easier and faster, go buy the Sigma Tapered Blending E-40 brush NOW!  I cannot say enough good things about this brush, it has just made my eye shadow application so much faster in the morning.  I can honesly say that I would not be able to live without this in my brush collection. This seller that I ordered it from was SO quick in getting it shipped out to me, I think I had it in my mailbox within 2-3 days!  SIGMA all the way and I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to purchase my first Sigma brush and to be quite honest there is such a wide variety to choose from; and because they are all so useful, I wanted to take my time picking the first one out.  I have long heard great things about Sigma&#x27;s quality and prices and let me say, the Sigma Tapered Blending - E40 brush did not disappoint.  The price was really great and the quality is everything they raved about in the reviews I have read.  The brush is very sturdy and does exactly what it is designed to do very effectively.  The brush seems to have a lot of durability.  The softness and the fact that it does not shed are also big pluses.  I am so glad to have finally purchased my first Sigma brush and know that I will be purchasing many more until I get the full array. After using one I honestly don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing any other brand.</li>
            <li> Great blending brush &amp; so soft ! I would totally recommend this brush ! Great for price &amp; better than a Mac brush!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite eyeshadow brushes; I use it for the upper eyelid to blend the transition color with the crease color, not so they become one, but so the edges blend together almost imperceptibly.  Or if you&#x27;re using just one color, it&#x27;s great for smoothing that color all over the lid and blending.  This brush, along with my E25 and E35 are usually all I need to create any eye look. I love, love Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great blending eye shadow brush than look no further! The bristles are soft and such good quality for the price. I will definitely be ordering more from Sigma Beauty again to complete the rest of my makeup brush collection.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this Sigma blending brush for a long time.  I have seen many YouTube make-up tutorials featuring this brush but was debating whether to go with a Sigma or MAC brush.  I decided to go with this one because it&#x27;s less expensive and have heard great things about it.  I always have a problem blending out harsh lines with my eye make-up.  I am especially attracted to how fluffy this brush is.  After receiving it today, I immediately tried it out and it has exceeded my expectations!  I love how it feathers out my eye shadow and blends to a seamless finish.  The brush head is also big enough so that the eye shadow looks more diffused instead of it being too concentrated on my lid.  I am looking forward to purchasing more Sigma products in the near future!</li>
            <li> Such a great brush.  I plan to keep buying these for my kit.  I will probably get 2 more.  A definite buy.</li>
            <li> Great for blending to avoid a muddy look when creating a Smokey eye look with matte shadow.</li>
            <li> I love the brush set up (the length of the handle, the way it feels in hands, etc.), and I love the way it applies. It&#x27;s an amazing crease brush, but, oh man, does it shed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely AMAZING!!!ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> This brush does its job, but I wish it was softer</li>
            <li> A blending brush is essential when applying eyeshadow, especially when experimenting. This brush was a huge disappointment. When I opened it, the bristles smelled funny and were very dusty. Even after washing it, the thing collects dust like no other makeup brush I own! Plus, it does not hold it&#x27;s shape. The head flared out and it&#x27;s far too large for me to blend with. Waste of money. I even tried using it to set my under eye concealer with powder but ti&#x27;s too scratchy for regular use.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at these brushes for a while and was waiting for the right time to purchase. I have heard numerous praises from other makeup artists and I want to see and try them. Flawless!!</li>
            <li> amazing blend really nice good quality keep it up recommend it hold the product really good and also very smooth and blend great</li>
            <li> i adore this brush so much, great for blending and packing on color! its seriously one of those brushes i reach for since i do alot of smoky eyes (: if your looking for a good quality reasonably priced brush or brushes, i recommend you check out sigmabeauty.com they have amazing brushes!!</li>
            <li> Good brush for the money.  Smashbox and Mac brushes a little nicer.</li>
            <li> Geat brush, works just as well as the MAC 224 brush but chepaer!! i have washed it quite a few times and it hasn&#x27;t shed on me yet!</li>
            <li> So soft and blends even the most stubborn of colors! Love this brush!</li>
            <li> this is the best blending brush i own.  I have a few other brushes but the quality of this one is way better.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use with Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Brightening Powder. It works very well with the light powder under my eyes. It could definitely be used as a blending brush as well. Be aware, when I washed it the first time the water turned a bit black. Since then, no color change in the water and nothing showed on the makeup or under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up for anybody thinking you received fakes. Sigma changed the e40. I emailed sigma myself to check and they did!! Why mess with perfection?? Who knows!</li>
            <li> I was very, very disappointed in this brush.  It looks perfect and I thought that it&#x27;d be a great multi-purpose brush, but the bristles are the worst that I&#x27;ve ever had on any makeup brush -- they are very coarse and splay everywhere.  It&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s just the one that I received, but I&#x27;ve tried everything and have come to realize that I won&#x27;t be able to use this one for anything.</li>
            <li> In love with this brush</li>
            <li> lo que yo esperaba y me funciona sigma es lo mejor, y llego a tiempo, y escuchado tanto acerca de este producto que supero mis espectativas, viva sigma</li>
            <li> So upset this brush ended up being fake. The picture is not accurate at all. You can feel it in the weight. I compared it to my actual real ones I have from the actual sigma store. So disappointed!</li>
            <li> If you want your eye makeup to look flawlessly blended, you need this brush!  It&#x27;s bigger and fluffier than a lot of eyeshadow blending brushes, and it gets the job done.  Just do windshield wiper motions across the eyelid and voila!  Perfectly blended shadow.  I even usually use this one to blend out colors that I&#x27;ve applied with another brush.  I never do a look without this brush.  I will be purchasing backups!</li>
            <li> This brush is great quality at an amazing price.  Will recommend this product, and similar products to everyone!  Will be purchasing similar products immediately!</li>
            <li> Love this sigma blending brush</li>
            <li> Nice and good quality</li>
            <li> Perfect blender brush</li>
            <li> I dont know what i would do with out this brush...blending is so much easier for me now.</li>
            <li> I think all of the Sigma brushes I have are fabulous except for this one. Maybe I got a defected one but it wasn&#x27;t fluffy at all, it just sort of bent on my eye because the bristles were so long. I couldn&#x27;t blend with it.</li>
            <li> The brush I received is definitely a fake. I have the original E40 direct from Sigma and this is just a dupe. A poor quality one at that.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast and it came 3 hours before expected. The brush is good, very soft and fluffy. I recommend !</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this no stars! The item is 100% Fake! Don&#x27;t not by this! U are wasting your money u can&#x27;t wash this brush or it will fall apart. Buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!! I didn&#x27;t realize until using this brush, what a difference it makes blending out your eyeshadow. This brush is top quality!</li>
            <li> Loooove this brush. Blends nicely. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> Brush was shedding and stiff from the beginning, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I lack skill at makeup. This brush works like a charm. Urban Decay Foxy matches my skin, so I lavish it all over from lashline to brow. Nothing really shows, but it lays down a base to blend Urban Decay Buck under and slightly across where the hood of my lid folds down. I load the brush with Buck, tap off the excess, distribute the shadow into the brush by swishing it in a circle inside the cap of the eyeshadow container, and then apply. Then, I fluff off the excess shadow from my lid with the brush. I&#x27;ve never been able to use two eyeshadows effectively before to give a little depth to my lids, but this brush makes it easy. A smudge of eyeliner and a sweep of mascara, and I look kind of like I knew what I was doing. I&#x27;m buying another one of these brushes just in case I lose the one; I like it that much.</li>
