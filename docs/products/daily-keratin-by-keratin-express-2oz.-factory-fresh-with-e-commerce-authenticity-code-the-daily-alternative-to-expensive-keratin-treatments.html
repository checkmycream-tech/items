            <li>Perfect size for traveling</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Best stuff I&#x27;ve tried for hair smoothing</li>
            <li>The style stayed wonderfully through a day at the pool/jacuzzi and two showers!  </li>
            <li>and my hair still looks good!</li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>This tames the frizz/curls and a side benefit, smells good.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I could never find a good hair product to help keep my hair from curling or becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li>but I love this product I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Always love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>make it look healthy.</li>
            <li>I was recommended to this product by my hairdresser and was glad to fund it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Could not ask for more.  </li>
            <li>Found a much better price on Amazon than what I could get in the salon.</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic.</li>
            <li>However, this product has helped to protect my hair and I often find myself running my fingers through it, quite pleased with the soft/smooth condition and healing effects I&#x27;ve attained.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use,great results</li>
            <li>It only takes a pea size amount and your hair feels great.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>frizz free.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;(all the tiny fly away</li>
            <li>Since being pregnant I had to stop my keratin express smoothing treatment</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, cheaper to purchase online rather than salon.</li>
            <li>It does not make your hair greasy nor does it make it too flat as many Keratin products often do.</li>
            <li>I wish it really would have softened my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>and it does it job very well, the whole humid summer my hair was</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length curly hair, that I like to wear straight.  </li>
            <li>I live in Texas, hot and humid</li>
            <li>Although the tube is small (and I thought I&#x27;d go through it quickly), a nickel-sized squeeze is plenty ample for the job and does not weigh down my fine hair (a huge plus).</li>
            <li>I have medium length, fine frizzy hair and, due to the \\&quot;melting\\&quot; effect has become a mullet</li>
            <li>Not even humid weather could destroy the smooth look.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old doesn&#x27;t have a relaxer</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, and this daily treatment does help with humidity and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair straight for days and only using a little bit each time.</li>

            <li> It keeps my hair straight for days and only using a little bit each time.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used a tiny pea size amount on my hair and then blew it dry.</li>

            <li> My new stylist (who has helped to correct a serious color issue and the \\&quot;melting\\&quot; of my hair by another stylist) recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> The size is extremely small, much smaller than I realized</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My only negative comment is that it has a smell which isn&#x27;t bad, but somehow a little masculine (sort of reminiscent of lime oil based men&#x27;s colognes), which took me a bit to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Keratin for a few months and noticed a change in the feel and shine of my hair.</li>
            <li> Used a dime size of this and fully dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I got this to tame my hair</li>
            <li> My hair would frizz in the least bit of rain or moisture in the air.  </li>
            <li> otherwise I&#x27;d look a horrible mess.  </li>

            <li> The size is extremely small, much smaller than I realized but I love this product I have been using it for years. It does not make your hair greasy nor does it make it too flat as many Keratin products often do. I love it!</li>
            <li> Always love this stuff.  It only takes a pea size amount and your hair feels great.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so smooth and silky. I also purchased for my mother and she swears by it. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Did not do what I thought it was supposed to..... My hair was no smoother than it already was. I wish it really would have softened my hair.</li>
            <li> You only need samll amount to apply on the end of your hair. apply heat on your hair such blow dryer ot iron. It protect your hair woth no damage. And the Keratin will penatrate into your hair. make it look healthy.</li>
            <li> I could never find a good hair product to help keep my hair from curling or becoming frizzy. I live in Texas, hot and humid, I can fix my hair with this product and go outside in the summer and my hair still looks good! Worth the money, cheaper to purchase online rather than salon.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling</li>
            <li> This cream is a dream. Makes my hair silky without weighing it down. I have a lot of wiry greys and dry bleached hair. This tames them.</li>
            <li> I have been using Keratin for a few months and noticed a change in the feel and shine of my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I live in Florida, and this daily treatment does help with humidity and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Awsome product! Easy to use,great results</li>
            <li> Since being pregnant I had to stop my keratin express smoothing treatment so I got this to tame my hair and it does it job very well, the whole humid summer my hair was frizz free.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I was recommended to this product by my hairdresser and was glad to fund it on amazon. Helps reduce the frizz even in humid weather. All you need is about a nickel size. It was less expensive than my hairdresser and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve tried for hair smoothing</li>
            <li> Used a dime size of this and fully dried my hair.  The style stayed wonderfully through a day at the pool/jacuzzi and two showers!  Could not ask for more.  I have shoulder length curly hair, that I like to wear straight.  This product does it for me.</li>
            <li> My hair would frizz in the least bit of rain or moisture in the air.  My hairstylist used this on my hair and I loved it.  And, I just had to buy some for myself.  I would recommend it to anyone who need to fight the &amp;#34;frizzes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of this.  My hairdresser had used it on me, so I bought some.  This tames the frizz/curls and a side benefit, smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It keeps my hair straight for days and only using a little bit each time. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used a tiny pea size amount on my hair and then blew it dry. My hair actually dried faster and was much smoother&lt;br /&gt;(all the tiny fly away ends were gone). Not even humid weather could destroy the smooth look. Found a much better price on Amazon than what I could get in the salon. Love it!</li>
            <li> The Bomb. This stuff is like magic. My 5 year old doesn&#x27;t have a relaxer and I usecthis in her frizzy hair and her hair turns out silky straight.it last for weeks as well.</li>
            <li> My new stylist (who has helped to correct a serious color issue and the \\&quot;melting\\&quot; of my hair by another stylist) recommended this product.  I have medium length, fine frizzy hair and, due to the \\&quot;melting\\&quot; effect has become a mullet a&#x27; la Joan Jett in her Runaways days.  While I previously only used a blow dryer to blow it straight, due to the multiple lengths of broken hair, I have had to start using a flat iron also -- otherwise I&#x27;d look a horrible mess.  However, this product has helped to protect my hair and I often find myself running my fingers through it, quite pleased with the soft/smooth condition and healing effects I&#x27;ve attained.  My only negative comment is that it has a smell which isn&#x27;t bad, but somehow a little masculine (sort of reminiscent of lime oil based men&#x27;s colognes), which took me a bit to get used to.
