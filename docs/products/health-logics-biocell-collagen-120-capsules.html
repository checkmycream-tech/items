            <li> I have leukemia (chronic) and my bones and joints hurt so bad because of illness and chemo. This helps so much. Nothing will cure the damage but this makes it tolerable</li>
            <li> Made me brake out so I stopped using them did not help me at all I was hoping it would</li>
            <li> I took these as directed on the bottle and did not notice even the slightest improvement . But I had to at least try,</li>
            <li> I am pleased with these supplements.  I take them for my hands and knees, and Have noticed that my skin looks a little firmer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I noticed anything significant.</li>
            <li> Realy relieves all my joints!!!!!!!! Love this product! Can&#x27;t live without! Plus the collagen is giving me great results wonderfully</li>
            <li> I did not have any noticeable change with this product.</li>
            <li> Like product. Helps with joint mobility. Patented products are for real. This one is. Trusted to deliver what it claims.</li>
            <li> Biocell helped me to start walking alittle better and to take my knee  pain away alot, i have no cartliedge in my knee..... enjoy &#x27; you&#x27;r day!üòÅ</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t taken this long enough to be able to tell if it is working or not. It looks like a well produced item. Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I hate taking pills.  I felt light headed if I didn&#x27;t eat a large meal before taking.  I switched to powder and I make smoothies for my collagen needs.  It works.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but my fingers are feeling much better.</li>
            <li> Wife loves these. She is bouncing around happy.</li>
            <li> I am using this in conjunction with other products to improve my skin. I plan on using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> everything went as planned i am very happy with this product as well. thank you for all your good work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using BioCell for about 90 days and it just now seems to be working. My nails seem stronger. I take the recommended dosage three times per day. Just FYI, you MUST drink plenty of water with this product or you risk the possibility of breaking out. If you don&#x27;t care for water, I&#x27;d stay away.</li>
            <li> It feels very pure and agrees with me. I imagine very good results with this product. Several people have said it works quite well. Thank You.</li>
            <li> My skin looks good and my left knee doesn&#x27;t hurt as much, especially if you are a dancer.&lt;br /&gt;Very please.</li>
            <li> Good product but I gave me tons of breakouts:(</li>
            <li> Well I was doing Jusuru liquid biocell and saw this and decided to try it that I haven&#x27;t seen any different.</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair and nails are growing faster. I like the fact that is has Chondrointin in it for my joints. Now I don&#x27;t have to take a separate pill for them too.  I do think the fine lines in my face are better as will. I would recommend this product. bottle last a long time because I don&#x27;t take the 4 pills a day recommend. I take one maybe 2 a day.</li>
            <li> The pain in my arthritic hands has greatly improved. It took 3 weeks to start to notice a difference but after a month I knew it was working.</li>
