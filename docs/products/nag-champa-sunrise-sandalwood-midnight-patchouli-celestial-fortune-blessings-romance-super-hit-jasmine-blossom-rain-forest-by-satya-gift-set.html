            <li>I loved the smell and the fact that each incense stick lasts about two hours.</li>
            <li>the price is good,  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good</li>

            <li>love all the scents they are so relaxing to me.</li>
            <li>The fragrances are lovely if you leave Jasmine Blossom off the list.</li>
            <li>Just for added measure I ordered a couple samples from Shoyeido&#x27;s website to see if its just what I purchased or if, possibly, I&#x27;m more a candle type person.</li>
            <li>Most smelled like burning soap.</li>

            <li>These are simply the best.</li>
            <li>Plus, the after smell from the cheap stuff is not that nice either.</li>
            <li>top qulity.</li>
            <li>I think she&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>Love the variety</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I have mostly given up candles in favor of incense.  </li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>so you are paying the price of 5 boxes and getting 7 free!</li>
            <li>Love the fragrances will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li>mm so sophisticated smelling</li>
            <li>i love them all</li>
            <li>Some smell better than others, of course, but overall i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I feel more relaxed and serene when I use them.</li>
            <li>Very unique scent.</li>
            <li>and I have discovered some great new ones!</li>
            <li>The cats litter box seemed to smell pretty good compared to most of these scents.</li>
            <li>Each box has maybe 17-20 sticks, I&#x27;m guessing because I counted from boxes that I&#x27;ve already used from, but it&#x27;s certainly a decent quantity per box and a great variety.</li>
            <li>Great variety for the price, highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good smell though, has very much a feminine flowery type quality to it...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try out a couple of them so far, but they&#x27;re been wonderful, and the ones I havn&#x27;t had a chance to use yet still smell great in their boxes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are long burning and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>these smell wonderful, burn for a long time, and the scent lingers in the air even after it is finished burning.</li>
            <li>This is higher quality incense - good place to start.</li>
            <li>; it literally smells like a cool rain of some kind...</li>
            <li>it smells warm woodsy and sweet...  </li>
            <li>but the rest were a beautiful natural aroma.</li>
            <li>Awesome set of scents which has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, and give me plenty of good smelling options.</li>
            <li>and I got 12 boxes of incense, the first of which smells good</li>
            <li>Great price and a good bunch of different incense to try and also, enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Fine product for those who love exotic incense.</li>
            <li>One or two of the scents didn&#x27;t smell good, but I liked them overall and they make my living room smell great, thanks!</li>
            <li>well worth the price!!</li>
            <li>This a great set to give as a gift or to try out if new to the use of incense.</li>
            <li>My favorite is Romance, it is not floral but has a strong spiced scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed them all and haven&#x27;t had any that are too strong.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried Super Hits, you get two packages in this deal, so that was nice.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and pleasant scents.</li>
            <li>: Warm, mild spice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also love how strong and long-lasting the smell is.</li>
            <li>I know that the Super Hit is popular</li>
            <li>Super hit smells like candy, so I kind of burned through them</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to receive such a nice variety of incense!  </li>
            <li>This incense pack is fantastic, it brings 12 different and all incredible smells and feel!</li>
            <li>Seriously LOVE this collection, every single one smells wonderful and it is a STRONG incense.</li>
            <li>Really nice aroma, and I clearly have many more to enjoy!!</li>
            <li>I love the variety, but it would also be nice to be able to select exactly which aromas I recieve in bulk.</li>
            <li>We have had fun trying them all out and figuring out which ones we love!</li>
            <li>but they are all wonderful and fill up the entire room, great for having quiet times and just meditating :)</li>
            <li>love these scents mostly the Sandlewood and original Nag champa</li>
            <li>They are amazing and exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>A GREAT value on a product I frequently buy at a brick-and-mortar store.</li>
            <li>the smell is amazing...much better than the cheap $1 stuff....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything else ranged from OK to fantastic.</li>
            <li>some are great and some smell like old lady perfume...</li>
            <li>The incense is fresh and the sticks are in perfect condition, do not flake, and are not crushed.  </li>
            <li>So far they smell great.</li>
            <li>The smell was so overwhelming I had to throw it out before I could even light any of them.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, packaged nicely, good price.  </li>
            <li>She loved them so much she has me buy them for her again</li>
            <li>Nice set, worth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Some are stronger and more pungent (some say &amp;#34;soap/detergent&amp;#34;) but these are all nice in there own right.</li>
            <li>Some scents light more easily than others (seems like some are coated with an oil that makes them burn better), but all light and burn well.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing set, very affordable, really adds to the environment and nice touches to the room, all the smells are lovely and aromatic!</li>
            <li>: Mild, warm sweetness- light scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortune:</li>
            <li>They smell great and shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>You may get lucky and enjoy them all, as I do! :-)</li>
            <li>This is a great collection of the company&#x27;s various offerings, the scents are a very pleasant and relaxing combination of essential oils that is never overbearing or &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li>these are great, and while I liked some scent better than others, they are all very nice and reasonably long lasting</li>
            <li>I love love love this set so much!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the deal what a great deal this will last me for a long time if I run out</li>
            <li>Always did Sai Baba Nag Champa, but these other scents are wonderful as well!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love all the unique smells.</li>
            <li>I love the original Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love the original Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>Either you love the original Nag Champa and trust the brand</li>
            <li>some were better than others, patchouli forest and the original nag champ flavors were my favorite, but overall was a great buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, and I love how there is a big variety of scents included.</li>
            <li>a great deal on scents recommend this i was worried about how many sticks would be in each box but once open i was no longer got like 15 or 20 sticks or some thing</li>
            <li>Of course after burning one of these incenses my house gets filled with smoke but better than being filled with fish smelling smoke.  </li>
            <li>and I got it very quick.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of incense, but it can be heavy at times, so a variety pack is perfect.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly with no damages.</li>
            <li>This variety is amazing, it&#x27;s such a good deal that it&#x27;s going to be a while until i need to order again</li>
            <li>The scent is strong (not overpowering).  </li>
            <li>some smells are too strong for my taste, but</li>
            <li>These guys are so so strong.</li>
            <li>the smells are strong and do not fade away,  </li>
            <li>The company is good but this particular item I will not reorder.</li>
            <li>Some are the fragrance smell too strong.</li>
            <li>These are way too strong.</li>
            <li>Strong scent on some</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for very much, but it let me experiment on which ones I liked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these before and they seem to be very good quality and reasonably long buring.</li>
            <li>They both have a very good, rich, and refined quality (although neither smell like traditional sandalwood or patchouli).</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are cheap, but they don&#x27;t really smell good, like cheap soap or something.</li>
            <li>Nag Champa makes the best incense I have ever smelt hands down.</li>
            <li>but they burn fine</li>
            <li>To be honest though, none of these really smells great besides normal Nag Champa and Super Hits.</li>
            <li>My previous purchase of &#x27;Set of 6&#x27; was wonderful</li>
            <li>but, again Nag Champa, Super Hit and Sandalwood ROCK!  </li>
            <li>Sweet, very sweet - strong scent, is rather overbearing...</li>
            <li>The sticks were all good quality long burners with wonderful lasting aromas.</li>
            <li>Thanks I love it!</li>
            <li>I would recommend burning when u definitely plan on being another room but its really strong because they&#x27;re floral but still great</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, was packaged nicely, and it was fresh.</li>
            <li>There are better quality collections available, but for the money this is adequate.</li>
            <li>A very worthwhile collection of classic Indian scents.</li>
            <li>Not one smell of fire either, just pure and amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love incense samplers, as I tend to get used to/tired of a particular fragrance if burned for too long, so sets like this are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Being able to sample so many kinds is a plus, and all are great quality for burning slow and providing a good scent without too much smoke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nag Champa anything.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase, all of these arrived fresh and packaged professionally.</li>
            <li>great quality, wide variety, lovely smell, unbeatable price.</li>
            <li>I enjoy all the different smells and think this is a great value.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>That desperately cheap sting-y perfumey smell?...</li>
            <li>When the box arrives you can smell it before you even open it, great value for the price cant beat it.</li>
            <li>Romance smells like some sort of cheap, store-bought fragrance.</li>
            <li>WASN&#x27;T SO CHEAP LOOKING AND CHEAP SMELLING.</li>
            <li>This incense is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>A great collection for trying out different smells.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t actually count them but was happy that they didn&#x27;t scimp</li>
            <li>Great deal on the only incense I burn.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>you will enjoy all.&lt;br /&gt;Nag</li>
            <li>Worth trying if you aren&#x27;t sure which fragrance to buy.</li>
            <li>all were filled with smoke.</li>
            <li>All of these smell awesome and stick around for a few days after being burned.</li>
            <li>The sticks light and burn well.</li>
            <li>The smell is distinct and lingers for awhile compared to most sticks.</li>
            <li>Also these incense do not give me a headache like a lot of these cheap incense sold today</li>
            <li>One thing I didn&#x27;t enjoy is that some of the incense have flying particles and cause me to sneeze.</li>
            <li>Fantastic variety and</li>
            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>iT GIVES OUR HOUSE, A SCENT OF BEING IN A MAGIC LAND FAR AWAY, IT GIVES YOU A INNER PEACE AND TAKES YOU TO A WONDERFUL STATE OF NIRVANA</li>
            <li>I enjoy all the scents.  </li>
            <li>Great choice of different incenses!</li>
            <li>Great smells that last all day even when incense is burnt out.</li>
            <li>the cheap stuff produces when you light them up.</li>
            <li>Most of the boxes smell very similar, its not the biggest deal because they do smell quite good.</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t smell anywhere near as good as Wildberry incense, I&#x27;m gonna stick with those.</li>
            <li>Bought it because i loved Nag Champa and wanted to get some more of the same type.</li>
            <li>The variety is nice, but so far they all smell like Nag Champa to me, which is what is sold in most head shops.</li>
            <li>Nearly all of these scents are nice, although you may not be able to distinguish them all.</li>
            <li>but these are good quality so far</li>
            <li>They all smell great and burn long and strong.</li>
            <li>Love the Set, Buying another set one, right now.</li>
            <li>the coffin is a wonderful idea to keep from making a mess!</li>
            <li>Buy the package, sit back, and enjoy the essence of aroma!!!</li>
            <li>I would describe it as a light weight original nag champa scent.</li>
            <li>Some of these actually smell pretty good and are nice for a change.  </li>
            <li>most reviews of it are pretty accurate...</li>
            <li>so it was nice having a decent selection to introduce me.</li>
            <li>The first one I opened was Super Hit and it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Burns fast very strong...</li>
            <li>I love Nag Champa &amp; the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It smells like a citrusy cologne, and I enjoyed it very much.  </li>
            <li>The scents are true - they do not smell like &amp;#34;scorch&amp;#34; like some cheap incenses do.  </li>
            <li>For the price being cheap, this is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed once I had the opportunity to get them all lit.</li>
            <li>While none of them can hold a candle to Nag Champa, I am not disappointed with this purchase or with any of scents I received.</li>
            <li>Love love love how it came in a package of all different scents!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the amount I paid, though!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered, and I love the scents.</li>
            <li>They also sent mine in a larger nag champa box that held all 12 scents, which I never received before so it was nice to have a box to keep them organized &amp; advertised what they were!</li>
            <li>I would purchase again because, even with this one exception, the bulk is worth the price!</li>
            <li>this is worth it!  </li>
            <li>but well worth the money I spend!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive these.</li>
            <li>However, they are a bit smkey when first lit but other than, wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Good fragrance, general woody incense smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I love having a large variety to fit my moods or change the atmosphere before a party.  </li>
            <li>Their scents are pretty strong so just putting a box in the cleaning supply closet or shoe cabinet makes the whole space smell nice.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoy the scents, super hit, and the original nag champa have been my favorites</li>
            <li>Came packaged in a 2012 edition box instead of a bunch of loose boxes (which I was expecting), so I was very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Romance has a clean rose-like scent.</li>
            <li>Clean portapotty</li>
            <li>Clean smell, but not what id want from incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the ones saying they smell &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; there are two that do give off that clean soap smell</li>
            <li>Actually the rest of them were extremely pleasant.</li>
            <li>Definitely not incense to buy if you are looking for a calming, relaxing and pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>This box was such a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Although they are intact and fresh and the sent is definitely strong.</li>
            <li>Not only are these incense sticks a very good price, but they are high quality and richly scented.</li>
            <li>but I used them up pretty quickly because I love the nag champa scents.</li>
            <li>I loved most of the scents, only two (romance &amp; rain forest) smelled VERY soapy, like cheap soap at that...</li>
            <li>every scent is a good one, and everybody who comes over to my house wants to light a new scent.</li>
            <li>If you are uncertain about getting the sampler pack I suggest starting with Nag Champa or Super Hit as these are two of their most popular fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so very much!!!</li>
            <li>But being an avid and experienced user of incense, these are very very low quality compared to the hundreds of others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I purchased this sampler simply because it offered a great, convenient, and affordable way to experience for the first time all the SATYA SAI BABA incenses that I have repeatedly seen glowing reviews for.</li>
            <li>The signature incense, and for good reason, light, spicy, long burning</li>
            <li>Scents are great they just dont stay lit, have to relight them like they are wet</li>
            <li>This is twelve full size boxes.  </li>
            <li>I am good on incense for several months.  </li>
            <li>: ) Thanks  </li>
            <li>Some of them smell good like sandlewood but the nag champa smells like somebody was smoking in the house, GROSS!</li>
            <li>It smells so good but lasts only like 10 min.</li>
            <li>Crossed my fingers and hoped they&#x27;d smell good, I bought them and have worked my way through the entire box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Musty earth with tinge of sweet - medium scent</li>
            <li>It was all worth it to light blessings.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep all the varieties straight, but you&#x27;re sure to find something you like in this pack.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>What I received was a mix of good quality and low quality incense.</li>
            <li>scent comes individually packaged in its own box, and all of them are contained within another larger box - great for shipping and for storage.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that I liked all of the included scents.  </li>
            <li>also way too nausea inducing sweet.</li>
            <li>It is one of the most zen habits I started years ago, thanks to the impact of yoga and meditation in my life</li>
            <li>Its a good way to sample all the different scents.</li>
            <li>They have many different kinds I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll enjoy it.</li>
            <li>alot of the flavors suck not bad tho</li>
            <li>These are by far my favorite brand of incense, I&#x27;ve tried many others and the scent is either too strong or they burn out too fast.</li>
            <li>They have a strong scent, but I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Truly a fantastic value, and the price is right on.</li>
            <li>The super hit scent is the only one the is unique and also happens to be the best smelling in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li>They each had their own sweet and unique aroma to be enjoyed not going to buy any other brands</li>
            <li>Some of these scents are winners (midnight, for example) and some are not such good winners in my opinion, but I love having the chance to try so many different scents out!</li>
            <li>So many different incense scents to smell and see if I like, I really love Midnight, it calms the room and can be used at any time of the year and it will feel right!</li>
            <li>This incense is fine quality and priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li>These smell distinct and rich.</li>
            <li>such an awesome variety,  wow fast ship too!  </li>
            <li>So it was great to try this value pack and try a bunch of other scents.</li>
            <li>This set is a great way for someone who is new to burning incense to see if this is a way to enjoy fragrance, and to sample different scents.</li>
            <li>WOW WOW I am so happy and grateful to find this.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal nag champa person</li>
            <li>you have to either choose to get the pack that includes midnight or super hit...</li>
            <li>The sticks are well made and smell extraordinary.</li>
            <li>It included Nag Champa, Sandalwood, Celestial, Patchouli Forest, Super Hit, and Sunrise.</li>
            <li>I received this item quickly from Tom&#x27;s Incense.  </li>
            <li>They do burn quickly, though.</li>
            <li>Each pack is sealed in original plastic bags inside of the original packaging and looks exactly as described and pictured.  </li>
            <li>The jasmine sticks are quit flammable and will char when you are lighting them if you do not blow them out quickly.</li>
            <li>Romance nag champa super hit and blessings are my favs</li>
            <li>It came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>The person that I gifted this to really enjoyed all of the different aromas.</li>
            <li>Burns rather quickly compared to the rest.</li>
            <li>The surprise of the pack for me was that I do not care for the Super Hit at all-</li>
            <li>stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before having purchased this set from Amazon, I had tried Nag Champa, Super Hit and Celestial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;these arrive quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Super Hit&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>First off I am a huge fan of Nag Champa by Satya Sai Baba.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed most except for the Romance, Jasmine, and Rain Forest scents that became quickly/intensely cloying and overwhelmingly sweet and floral; lingered for too long.</li>
            <li>The only positive is if you do happen to like the smell, they are VERY strong, I didn&#x27;t even light one and they smelled up the room they were in!</li>
            <li>Burned two one at a time today and it filled the entire place (one bedroom apartment) with very strong aroma.</li>
            <li>but half of them are great and the rest are just ehh.</li>
            <li>and I guarantee you&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>Will definitely reorder when I need more!</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t deliver exactly what they say you are going to get!</li>
            <li>A great way to try new scents without having to pay for each individually.</li>
            <li>The only ones I liked were the sandalwood and super hit</li>
            <li>they are easy to burn and they have so many different fragrances to choose from.</li>
            <li>😕&lt;br /&gt;But more than half smelled really nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a variety of incense including some &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; products from smaller, cultural shops and Satya brand has consistently been the absolute best on the market.</li>
            <li>A good starting point for somebody looking to try new scents, or just aiming to have a variety of choices available.</li>
            <li>I love keeping a few burning most of the day!  </li>
            <li>I ran through the Nag Champa, Super Hit and Sandalwood pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in sampling more scents from Sai Baba&#x27;s line of incense.</li>
            <li>the batch is fresh, genuine or whatever&amp;#34; it has this warm toasty, simple, pure, somewhat uncomplicated &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa and Super Hit incense, so this assortment was an affordable way to try other fragrances.</li>
            <li>I do believe you will enjoy this collection as much as I have.</li>
            <li>Amazing value for the variety, definitely ordering again.</li>
            <li>Amazing scents last forever, and I&#x27;ve gotten raves when folks enter my home and take a sniff.</li>
            <li>and all have amazing different smells.</li>
            <li>I love incense and burn it frequently.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far is Romance</li>
            <li>Far better scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Have fun.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far is the Sandalwood</li>
            <li>Each scent is discernible from the last and each offer their own &amp;#34;character&amp;#34; when lit.</li>
            <li>as most of it reminds me of a mix of dimestore incense and old lady perfume.  </li>
            <li>But for the price they are worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fun to have a variety.</li>
            <li>nice aroma especially when I cook fish or chiken</li>
            <li>And incense is a fair option to my wife&#x27;s love of candles which are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>Fabulous Selection....will be back for more...</li>
            <li>Champa: So this is the famous Naga Champa, Wow</li>
            <li>Definitely worth getting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy opposed to flowery fragrances, but most of the flowery ones here completely overdo it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to try them all.</li>
            <li>Some of the others are nice, and some just not offensive enough to throw away.</li>
            <li>But you will find you like that old Nag a lot more than some of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I thought the set will give me a nice variety to the same ol</li>
            <li>Offensive and powerful smell without even opening the boxes.  </li>
            <li>Its fun</li>
            <li>They smell incredible and burn slow.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed exploring the different scents, but many were much too perfumey for my tastes.</li>
            <li>To buy all of these at the candle shop near my house it would have cost me $40 or more.</li>
            <li>It was fun for our family to anticipate the smell on the stick/burn fragrance of each scent.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>the more i smell the more i feel empowered to breathe into the deep deep spaces between us and our love.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It is the only incense I&#x27;ve ever used that I liked the smell and wasn&#x27;t obnoxious with the smoke.</li>
            <li>They all kind of smell the same.</li>
            <li>It comes packaged in a nice box with the twelve scents in individual boxes within the outer packaging.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a purchase if you&#x27;re unsure about what scents you might enjoy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE Nag Champa so much I was very excited to get the entire collection.  </li>
            <li>These are our favorite incense, try to keep them in stock even for our back deck near the hot tub :)!</li>
            <li>unique enough to keep inthe collection, I remember liking it for sure.  </li>
            <li>Still none are better than the original blue box Nag Champa, but that one is included, too.</li>
            <li>First of all, I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this product was delivered.</li>
            <li>I will be back to purchase more as soon as this healthy batch is all used up in prayers that linger all day long in a fragrance you will keep enjoying.</li>
            <li>-- If you&#x27;re on a real budget and just want consistent good, a low tolerance for risk you might try the variety pack of 6..</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 12 scents, as the description states; some I&#x27;m familiar with, others not so much.  </li>
            <li>Comparing what I have smelled compared to some of the other reviews, I have to say that some of the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ones are really good, like Fortune.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Midnight- Very soothing and rich scent.</li>
            <li>Tried other ones and some are so so and some are good.</li>
            <li>if your looking for quality this is not the right product</li>
            <li>Sandalwood to me, done right....</li>
            <li>I got these because of what someone else said in their review and boy they were right.</li>
            <li>Has plenty of variety for picking the right scent for each occasion.</li>
            <li>They were right on time too.</li>
            <li>Romance was pretty good, imagine what the color pink smells like to you, does it smell like cotton candy?</li>
            <li>The price is so low that it&#x27;s worth it to get a few boxes of scents that you don&#x27;t really enjoy as much, but most of them are very nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying them so much, I haven&#x27;t even been able to open them fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My absolute new favorite is fortune, and even my room mate who has asthma says he enjoys them a lot.</li>
            <li>I love Nag Champa, especially Fortune, Super Hits, and</li>
            <li>The variety pack has several traditional favorites and others that are unique and pleasant to smell.  </li>
            <li>I was worried at first given how it was packaged that I got a massive box of super hit only, but was happy to see it was just how it was packaged.  </li>
            <li>I was worried because incense can either smell really awesome or just be terrible and so far the scents in this set and WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>(not that you should be in a small or medium room by yourself burning incense no matter what scent, but I&#x27;m just giving an example lol).</li>
            <li>Great fragrance however, they have small stems</li>
            <li>I mean,  a lot and the scents,  are beautiful smells,  they burn well,  a nice long burn,  and</li>
            <li>These incense seriously smell so good!</li>
            <li>sometimes when I buy Patchouli they don&#x27;t have a particular smell, but these Patchouli&#x27;s all have a unique smell.  </li>
            <li>Lots of different nice scents at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It was great to sample the different scents, but i should have stayed with the basic Agarbatti.</li>
            <li>There are roughly 120 of these, I haven&#x27;t exactly counted, they range in scents, most of which are not really scents, but names that look cool, they still do burn for about an hour each, and give off a good amount of scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jasmine Blossom - clear plastic - Strong floral scent - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli forest - opaque plastic - Patchouli and Nag Champa - crumbly</li>
            <li>The auromas are also very pungeant and kind of all similar.</li>
            <li>Suffice to say eight out of twelve (for my fickle nose) is a pretty great turnout on a small investiture.</li>
            <li>I previously bought the Set of 6 x 15g Boxes Incense, and I loved them.</li>
            <li>When some (about half of the incense scents) are lit, it burns differently and does not smell as pleasant, having more of a &amp;#34;fire burn&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>such variety and such a great price will buy again</li>
            <li>Smells great and useful in a small room or to freshen up a large one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each offers their own little twist on a great smell that last!</li>
            <li>I mean they will singe your nose hairs and give you the fabulous illusion that your room smells good</li>
            <li>but I feel like these are the reject packs and maybe the actual scents smell a little better and more authentic.</li>
            <li>My favorite right now is the nag champa sticks in the blue box</li>
            <li>These light easy and burn long.  </li>
            <li>Very much a scent that stands out on</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I recommend this very much.</li>
            <li>I began smudging with White Sage and found I liked the smell, so I tried another product (Wild African Violet) and found I liked that smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have my old burner boxed up and living in my new bedroom, something was missing incense and a perfect burner.  </li>
            <li>One of the things I like the most about it is that it does not have what to my nose is the sharp, cheap, headache inducing chemical-like smell of lots of the inexpensive incense you&#x27;ll find around.</li>
            <li>Nag Champa is a winner, and we love opening the new packs for something new.  </li>
            <li>There are a few that are trash worthy right away, but the ones that hit (Celestial, Fortune, etc.) are really nice.</li>
            <li>It all kind of smell the same except for a few really distinctive one, but overall a very good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>first time i have seen a variety pack, love all the different choices.</li>
            <li>Love it and will be back!</li>
            <li>but all really do smell alike, and some just smell like a soap bar!</li>
            <li>Great product long lasting burn time</li>
            <li>Better than aerosol spray to freshen up a room and the sent last longer as well.</li>
            <li>I tend to like stronger scents (I know many people are the opposite) and</li>
            <li>pleased with the overall Promptness of delivery and packaging.</li>
            <li>Most of the scents having the same urinal like odor.</li>
            <li>I have used many of the different scents by now.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>seems like all of them smell the same, smells like soap more than anything else.</li>
            <li>comes with the afore mentioned first 7 fragrances...</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Satya&amp;#34; kind are harder to find.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance - clear - cheap hotel soap - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessing</li>
            <li>Making it seem well worth the extremely reasonably priced purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of the 12 different boxes of incense, I&#x27;ve enjoyed all but two.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed these and I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I was able to sample all the different smells.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast!  </li>
            <li>I love ordering this big 12 pack of incense.  </li>
            <li>They remain a favorite whether purchased at the local Indo-Pak grocery store or on-line</li>
            <li>Would recommend this set to anyone who is interested in incense but don&#x27;t know quite what they like.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy these again.</li>
            <li>I decided this time around to expand my horizons and try more &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; from the same company.</li>
            <li>And definitely continue buying more.</li>
            <li>Watch out, some of them are pretty crumbly and opening the package will cover your life in pleasantly-scented dust.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>love the different scents.</li>
            <li>The perfumes are relaxing, peacefully, and makes you quite.</li>
            <li>These burn slowly and offer great scents.</li>
            <li>I burn incense every day so being able to change the mood with just a change of a box is simple and neat.</li>
            <li>Many of the scents smell similar but I like them all</li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Most scents smelled the same - soapy.</li>
            <li>the money, I&#x27;m not sure there are many better options than Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>Bought these for a friend but decided to try them out first.</li>
            <li>will be buying again soon, I love all the varieties of different smells.</li>
            <li>It makes my living spaces amazingly peaceful.</li>
            <li>First time purchasing this brand.</li>
            <li>I love them all and these will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more of these.</li>
            <li>love all the different smells.</li>
            <li>and it really does smell like jasmine blossoms, to a tee!</li>
            <li>More incense then you could every possibly need at one point in time.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the blue box Nag Champa!</li>
            <li>Over the years I have burndt many different sticks and cones and none have stopped burning almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as i named this review is how my house smells, \\&quot;Romance\\&quot; tells me on the box</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>So well worth the money I saved so much</li>
            <li>This set of 12 Satya Sai incense packs is my ultimate favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is my first review</li>
            <li>I got it around the same time and use it way more than these.  </li>
            <li>They come in such a great variety and ship fast, I have ordered them several times and don&#x27;t buy from anywhere else</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the various smells.</li>
            <li>love all the different scents!</li>
            <li>but like how they last longer than most incense.</li>
            <li>I only have tried 2 types (Nag Champa and Midnight) and were always my favorite</li>
            <li>I mean everything else is great, but I&#x27;m just not cray about 8 out of 12 of the smell, but it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>Ships fast, and I always get the right order.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not stinging your nostrils with a sharp flowery smell, it&#x27;s...kind of a warm reassuring hug...</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have smelled them like other incense I have bought.  </li>
            <li>On par with the original nag champa as far as enjoyment of scent and..</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll probably find a handful of new flavors that you like, as well as come away with a new appreciation for just how good the standard stuff really is.</li>
            <li>I would say that about 8 of these are good enough to use regularly.</li>
            <li>This is a real deal incense...way better than anything that you will get at big box stores or convenience stores.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely cent get enough :)</li>
            <li>The three major exceptions: Blessings, Rainforest, and Jasmine Blossom smell like cheap soap.</li>
            <li>The scents are pleasant and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>Nag Champa is my all time favorite, but I enjoy discovering the different  scents in different moods or rooms of my house.</li>
            <li>Got here early snd has the full variety.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not sure about which scent you like, this is a good variety of which to sample.</li>
            <li>They are girly, loud and sweet smelling incense.</li>
            <li>One stick of most of these varieties is enough to give decent fragrance to a room about 20ft x 20ft.</li>
            <li>My personal favorite incense set, usually better than what you can find at head shops or any other place that would have incense.</li>
            <li>LOL not a pleasant sounding word to use in describing a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It smells exactly like those cheap white bars of hotel</li>
            <li>Soft, but didn&#x27;t linger as long as i would&#x27;ve liked after burning out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ended throwing this one out along with Romance simply because of it&#x27;s overbearing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance: Floral - strong and overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually could not even keep the box in the house because of the strong smell.  </li>
            <li>These are strong, burn around 30-45 minutes, and actually smell like what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li>Burn a little quickly, but they are potent.</li>
            <li>Incredibly pure smelling incense</li>
            <li>Includes large amount of incense of each type.  </li>
            <li>Certainly a lot of product for the money.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ve opted to just buy a large box of that one going forward.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a pure Nag Champa fan and have been nothing but</li>
            <li>Comes in a large box</li>
            <li>Already shared a few with my friends and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be buying some soon!</li>
            <li>Until this purchase I had heard only of Nag Champa (my favorite since hippie-hood) and Super Hit(discovered much later in life).</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>This is my first time coming across high quality incense</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent deal a little over a $1 a box, but I will just stick to the same ol blue box Nag Champa.</li>
            <li>The price is okay for how much you get but some of them don&#x27;t stay lit or are hard to light.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast also</li>
            <li>ENJOY #simple</li>
            <li>Sometimes incense sticks smell very well straight out of the box, but when burned they don&#x27;t smell quite as well, but</li>
            <li>I got more than I expected.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a couple of the scents I really do not like, but that still leaves 9-10 scents that I absolutely DO love.</li>
            <li>Fast on time delivery will order again.</li>
            <li>Not too much to say about these.</li>
            <li>kinda burn fast though..</li>
            <li>I was paying almost $3 per box at the mall...and found this set for so much cheaper here...</li>
            <li>You almost get too much product.  </li>
            <li>And those two that I didn&#x27;t really care for</li>
            <li>I WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have much fragrance in them.</li>
            <li>Really like fortune, midnight, blessings, superhit, sandalwood, and celestial.</li>
            <li>Maybe be a bit more careful than me</li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I thought, gee, this smells mostly like fire and not a very woman-like scent</li>
            <li>Some let off a whole lot of smoke.</li>
            <li>For the money, you can&#x27;t really beat the variety or amount of incense you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re too much for my liking.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not getting much variety.</li>
            <li>if its not broken, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li>hey, who really cares if there is a lot of &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; in the packet.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and could smell them thru the box.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had a chance to smell all of them yet, but I highly recommend this product to anyone who is wanting to venture out into the world of incense!</li>
            <li>so i can light one up to get my house is a completely different mood!</li>
            <li>I did not care much for the soapy, floral scents.</li>
            <li>Vey reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>I really like the selection this set provides.</li>
            <li>I ordered without really taking the time to read the description</li>
            <li>but it really is an affordable alternative to candles.</li>
            <li>Satya Sai, with their cult-classic Nag Champa in the blue box, is a brand I have trusted for decades to smell fantastic, each and every</li>
            <li>It got here fast.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t burn too fast &amp; I luv the variety of scents</li>
            <li>Much cheaper here than in stores.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li>Fast ship.</li>
            <li>I have bought incense before but none have come strait out of the box with as much smell as this set did.  </li>
            <li>so i took a chance with the whole set.</li>
            <li>- clear - light lemon - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortune - clear - minty - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise - opaque - cedar and Nag - crumbly</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of regular Nag Champa, but most of these smell like an old women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>quality incense sticks, they do not leave that &amp;#34;burning wood&amp;#34; smell that low quality incense do, such as the kind purchasable at walmarts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Paying a few cents more for this brand is worth it.</li>
            <li>These incense sticks smell nice but are a bit too uneven &amp; flimsy</li>
            <li>All the different scents were nice, only 1 that I did not like.</li>
            <li>This is a good introduction to the other incense Shrinivas Sugandhalaya has to offer and anyone who enjoys blue box</li>
            <li>If you love Nag Champa as much as I do, chances are, you too, may be sickened by these other fragrances.</li>
            <li>I really like the Nag Champa products and fragrences better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have some other incense that smell good prior to burning, but while burning, they smell nothing like it.</li>
            <li>Jasmine blossom can be overwhelming in a small area but is very well suited for more open spaces.</li>
            <li>so I was stoked to see the &amp;#34;bargain buy&amp;#34; (you will easily pay triple for all these individually at a local store) with new scents I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li>it was rich smelling but appears unavailable for individual purchase.</li>
            <li>Now I like a lot more scents other then just the patchouli.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sai Baba Nag Champa Incense and decided to try some of their other scents.</li>
            <li>If you love this Nag Champa and you think you&#x27;d like to experiment with some other</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of the original Nag Champa (blue box) incense, there&#x27;s all the varieties in this package.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am sure to recommend them to friends and relatives.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t find a single one that was anything less than great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set of 12 to anyone looking to find which kind of incense they like or simply someone looking for a lot of high quality incense that will last them quite a while.</li>
            <li>Each box smells amazing to me and they last twice as long as than the ones I buy from Walmart.</li>
            <li>Decent selection, but some of the varieties are very soapy and smokey.  </li>
            <li>Like maybe something that would be good to freshen up a 1000 year old public out-house in Mumbai or someplace, where the over-powering smell of soap is needed to beat back the funk of a 1000 year old mixture of turds.  </li>
            <li>My dad goes to India frequently and brings back incense, and last time he gave me a sandalwood incense that was really nice.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was oily around the actual burner, but when I attempted to clean, noticed under incense holder, it was fine, but where smoke touched table and white ledge, it took off wood finish and discolored the white to beige.</li>
            <li>Extremely high quality, not like the sickeningly sweet American &#x27;incenses, one would find at &#x27;snoke shops&#x27;</li>
            <li>the only thing is I wish it burned longer and last a litlle longer other than that I am happy I will be getting these again</li>
            <li>That would explain everything smelling more or less the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>#34;better ones&amp;#34; being --- sandalwood, celestial, sunrise, super hit, nag champa, midnight, and patchouli forest -- these 7 have a similar powdery smell and feel &amp;</li>
            <li>OR you could just buy a big thing of super hit...</li>
            <li>Must admit, Nag Champa and Super Hit are the only ones I would buy again, the others too perfumy.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the creative spicy mixture of Nag Champa is no where to be found in most of the rest of the set.  </li>
            <li>Such smooth, natural, concentrated, and lingering scents.</li>
            <li>Find a local incense dealer, you&#x27;re better off, as all of the scents are basically the same.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the different scents available.  </li>
            <li>but the woody fragrance is overpowering any possibility of a decent fragrance.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this particular brand.</li>
            <li>Especially Jasmine Blossom and Super Hit.</li>
            <li>I can see this entire pack lasting me a year or more.</li>
            <li>I bought this package to explore incense, and I couldn&#x27;t even open the box before my entire house was permeated with the overwhelming smell of patchouli oil and dreadlocks.</li>
            <li>- This &#x27;Set of 12&#x27; just added 5 SOAPY smelling odors that we had to throw away - They truly smell like burning soap - These include the following: Romance, Fortune, Rain Forest, Jasmine Blossom, Blessings - The &#x27;6 Set&#x27;, Nag Champa, Sunrise, Sandalwood, Midnight (or Super Hit), Patchouli, Celestial</li>
            <li>These sticks are a bit stronger than what I&#x27;m used to, though some scents are stronger than others, and need to be placed further away or even in a different room to get a more balanced strength.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t a smell I disliked but there were a few that I liked more than others, the rain scent was by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>Given that, incense is not expensive, Nag Champa is very slow burning, and the fragrances are wonderful and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I highly suggest giving this incense a try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomment.</li>
            <li>Also, the insense itself is high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li>These are high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the &amp;#34;Midnight&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>I threw them away, but I highly recommend the Nag Champa, Sandalwood, and Patchouli Forest.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these incents.</li>
            <li>Im starting to realize from the other comments about some smelling like soaps or bathrooms but to be honest they are made of woods  </li>
            <li>Mild sweet with earth tones, slow burning - moderate light scent</li>
            <li>By something a little more higher-quality</li>
            <li>it comes in cute little packages for each smell.</li>
            <li>I love Nag Champa and this set allows you to change it up a little without losing the quality.</li>
            <li>do recommend this for anyone new to incense or this particular brand</li>
            <li>Complete order, fast delivery</li>
            <li>lol - sorry...</li>
            <li>so far we really  like these.</li>
            <li>Love the scents and they last long.</li>
            <li>For $15 its worth trying 12 different scents.</li>
            <li>She had sampled a few too many perfumes.</li>
            <li>Others seem to work normally</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying all these different kinds of incense and so far the Super Hit and Romance are two that I like.</li>
            <li>The aroma is out of this world, full bodied and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>The scents are a little odd, but still very nice.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve liked all the different scents, but one smelled EXACTLY like a dirty ferret, so we threw that one out :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a nice variety of scents, each stick is about 10 inches long, and they burn slower than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>They made my house smell sweet and clean and burned slowly, def would buy again.</li>
            <li>You may as well light firecrackers with all that other garbage.</li>
            <li>I was new to incense and didn&#x27;t know what I would like.</li>
            <li>Variety allowed me to try new scents.  </li>
            <li>I got a gift card for my birthday and a new burner</li>
            <li>And, if you are new to this, don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li>Also, some of the sticks burn up very quickly and put up a lot of black smoke.</li>
            <li>These also let off a black trail of carbon when on fire, that smells strongly of chemicals and nastiness.</li>
            <li>I have been burning Nag Champa for years, and was excited to try the other scents offered by the company.</li>
            <li>If I find that I was the one in error I will come back and modify this rating to higher</li>
            <li>The reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is that some of the scents are pretty gross.  </li>
            <li>All four smell exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I use it just for a few minutes and is more than enough to cover the whole house.</li>
            <li>These were old!  </li>
            <li>Buy these, last much longer than candles and don&#x27;t cost a fortune!</li>
            <li>I love the smell it leaves behind and much cleaner smelling  for much longer than a candle.  </li>
            <li>All in all well worth the purchase, if for no other reason than to discover your personal favorites.</li>
            <li>Really worth the money spent, we highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The rainforest scent is more like an overwhelming soap scent that I can taste, which I find unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t fit in my incense burner which is the black triple dragon one that&#x27;s sold here on amazon.</li>
            <li>Each stick lasts about half an hour, and they smell cheap.</li>
            <li>Nt only do these last longer than some of the cheaper ones, but they are true to smell</li>
            <li>I always have a stick burning when I have someone over, and have only received positive feedback.</li>
            <li>#34;the stick has a velvety deer antler feel whereas the remaining other are more dry and compressed&amp;#34;  So those first seven are closer to the quality of nag champa whereas the remaining others....almost smell as though they were made by a different manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will last you a long time, and some of them are really unique.</li>
            <li>I have a large, open house and all of the scents work well in my home.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not used to it, then you should only burn about 1/3 of each incense for a relatively large room and let yourself grow used to it.</li>
            <li>But the scent just doesn&#x27;t last near as long nor is it as developed and rich.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sandalwood - clear - sandalwood and spice - crumbly</li>
            <li>WOW WOW</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I will buy again, at least the ones that I like the most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used up 3 packages so far.</li>
            <li>Still plenty left on the incense itself but it may be a sign they can&#x27;t keep up with the orders and rush out product that isn&#x27;t ready yet.</li>
            <li>a soft one...  </li>
            <li>My hubby is a practicing Buddhist and was pleasantly surprised with the purchase as he now has a plethora of incense to choose from for his evening prayers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite the connoisseur of all things incense and have been purchasing since I was a young teenager.</li>
            <li>Next time I think I am just going to order the 6 pack as the ones I really like are all in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My least favorite being blessings.</li>
            <li>This is by far my fav.</li>
            <li>5 of the 12 boxes are non natural incenses.  </li>
            <li>They all smelled like soap and they were really crumbly, several stripped in shipping.</li>
            <li>Tons of quality incense for the price, much cheaper than you could get it at a smoke shop or similar place.  </li>
            <li>Completely changed the way I saw incense.</li>
            <li>The sticks burn for a reasonable amount of time; Ive never actually kept track</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised at the quality of these.</li>
            <li>So old, in fact - they were crumbling.  </li>
            <li>what I do is, stick 3 or 4 different ones and leave it in the bathroom and it masks the smells very well.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m an old man</li>
            <li>This is a really inexpensive way to sample tons of different scents.  </li>
            <li>The Nag Champa scent is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>You get at least a dozen, and usually more in each box.  </li>
            <li>I wrote a note into the seller, they clarified that I had to open the outside of the box and sure enough there were 12 different scents.  </li>
            <li>I love them, I used one everyday in different parts of the house.  </li>
            <li>Im not a big incense person but something about the nag champa incense that puts the mind right and just smells divine, not like a stoner house, like a spiritual clenasing.</li>
            <li>The flavors are not overwhelmingly strong but leave a lasting exotic scent for quite some time after a burn.</li>
            <li>Not the typical sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It really is a great value buy and cannot go wrong with it!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve experimented with several different brands and homemade ones to no avail, and like a boomerang i&#x27;ve come back full circle.</li>
            <li>Super Hit says it decreases the negative and increases the positive for all zodiac signs.</li>
            <li>I love Nag Champa and it&#x27;s usually the only thing I will ever burn.</li>
            <li>Only a couple smelled decent</li>
            <li>I ordered two different assortments and when I received them, everything smelled exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I will stick to their classic nag champa in the future!</li>
            <li>Not only does the smell kill off any other undesirable smells and scents, but it is mesmerizing to watch the smoke rise from the incense into the air - it has the calming meditative effect of wine!</li>
            <li>First time I buy these and definitely will get them again, the fragrance is not as intense as some other brands that I have try</li>
            <li>Nag Champa is one of the few authentic incense brands people use - many go for the cheap crap you get at wal-mart or</li>
            <li>My living room area is open and with high ceilings and the smell still lingers for hours...</li>
            <li>I normally burn the far more subtle Japanese style incense, so each of the following was a brand new experience for me.  </li>
            <li>Got exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>We wanted to try this set out because there are a few scents - especially the regular nag champa - that we&#x27;ve gotten separately and really enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>While some of the names of the scents leave you guessing as to what they are supposed to imitate, the low price on this large quantity of incense was enough to get me to purchase.</li>
            <li>They are small but very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I usually only buy the sandlewood and nag champa fragrances, but decided to try some new ones.  </li>
            <li>When I first received it, was not clear that there were actually 12 different scents in the exterior box.  </li>
            <li>There are a few scents that are bold.</li>
            <li>After a single burn of 5 of the scents they went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>I merely need to pick a fragrance to fit my daily mood, to open my window and to light a stick before setting off to go about my housechores, work or hobbies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rest aren&#x27;t nearly as bad though and you have a great variety to choose from.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t generally care for Satya&#x27;s flora incense.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tried the patchouli and romance.</li>
            <li>, my&#x27; initial impression is it had a masculine men&#x27;s cologne smell to it?</li>
            <li>I have an old used up Glade candle with some wax left and</li>
            <li>I really like all of the difference scents, they burn evenly and i do not need to watch them as carefully as scented candles</li>
            <li>Because it seems to burn fast, and because its still is not really the smell I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>Nag Champa brand is mass-produced; sometimes you get poor batches, but most of the time, you get top-quality scents.</li>
            <li>Some are good, some not that much... :(</li>
            <li>I made this purchase because I am new to incense and wanted to smell the different types before settling in on a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lit \\&quot;Celestial\\&quot; last night</li>
            <li>You get about 15 grams per little box, you get 12 of those boxes which total up to around 180 grams,  If most of these scents are new and you can accept possibly not liking a few....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn these as much as I used to, but they last decently long, and smell up the entire house.</li>
            <li>Difficult to light and didn&#x27;t make much smoke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this bundle of incense as a gift for a frequent incense user twice; the second time it was actually a request!  </li>
            <li>Use caution when opening the bag containing the sticks within the box; a decent amount of loose incense residue will be in there and can be pretty messy if you pull a bundle of the sticks out at once from the bag (this is no fault of the manufacturer but just a result of the nature of the product, there will still ample incense material left on all of the sticks).</li>
            <li>I like all of them except for Blessings, which smells like an old lady perfume and will linger on for so long that I end up with a headache (already in the trash can).</li>
            <li>Mild earth tones, a little superficial compared to other brands I have burned, slow burning - light scent, lingers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain</li>
            <li>Every scent is quite unique, although many of them similar base ingredients (patchouli, sandalwood, etc).  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this product in the past and it&#x27;s money well spent, if you enjoy incense.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews have to be from the owners or folks who are either olfactorily challenged or never experienced a pure product</li>
            <li>The original Nag Champa is still my favorite but the other scents arnt bad.</li>
            <li>I live in New York City and usually buy incense from local Indian stores.</li>
            <li>as described, incense is very strong smelling , some good, some of the incense smells terrible ,i usually buy  </li>
            <li>I cant decide if thats a good thing or a bad thing.  </li>

            <li> Nag Champa will be sure to love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of incense.</li>
            <li> I just love these incenses, they smell fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled upon&#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Supplier company was outstandingly prompted.</li>
            <li> but there okay.</li>
            <li> Okay, this is just my&#x27; opinion..</li>
            <li> sure and give it a place in my&#x27; collection but by no means is it something i&#x27;ll ever order on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t LOVE it...</li>
            <li> More specifically it does indeed &amp;#34;like the color of the box&amp;#34</li>
            <li> honestly it&#x27;s my&#x27; favorite in this variety pack...</li>
            <li> you decide that for yourselves... most prefer nag champa over everything I&#x27;ve come to notice...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled sticks of this though that were more akin to a damp campfire ...</li>
            <li> those are the scents which are closer to nag champa...since everyone seems to love it the most.  </li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa and even that scent was off.</li>
            <li> All of the scents are lovely.</li>

            <li> Love the variety</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I have mostly given up candles in favor of incense.  </li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> so you are paying the price of 5 boxes and getting 7 free!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrances will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> mm so sophisticated smelling</li>
            <li> i love them all</li>
            <li> Some smell better than others, of course, but overall i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I feel more relaxed and serene when I use them.</li>
            <li> Very unique scent.</li>
            <li> and I have discovered some great new ones!</li>
            <li> The cats litter box seemed to smell pretty good compared to most of these scents.</li>
            <li> Each box has maybe 17-20 sticks, I&#x27;m guessing because I counted from boxes that I&#x27;ve already used from, but it&#x27;s certainly a decent quantity per box and a great variety.</li>
            <li> Great variety for the price, highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good smell though, has very much a feminine flowery type quality to it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try out a couple of them so far, but they&#x27;re been wonderful, and the ones I havn&#x27;t had a chance to use yet still smell great in their boxes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are long burning and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> these smell wonderful, burn for a long time, and the scent lingers in the air even after it is finished burning.</li>
            <li> This is higher quality incense - good place to start.</li>
            <li> ; it literally smells like a cool rain of some kind...</li>
            <li> it smells warm woodsy and sweet...  </li>
            <li> but the rest were a beautiful natural aroma.</li>
            <li> Awesome set of scents which has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, and give me plenty of good smelling options.</li>
            <li> and I got 12 boxes of incense, the first of which smells good</li>
            <li> Great price and a good bunch of different incense to try and also, enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Fine product for those who love exotic incense.</li>
            <li> One or two of the scents didn&#x27;t smell good, but I liked them overall and they make my living room smell great, thanks!</li>
            <li> well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> This a great set to give as a gift or to try out if new to the use of incense.</li>
            <li> My favorite is Romance, it is not floral but has a strong spiced scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed them all and haven&#x27;t had any that are too strong.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Super Hits, you get two packages in this deal, so that was nice.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and pleasant scents.</li>
            <li> : Warm, mild spice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also love how strong and long-lasting the smell is.</li>
            <li> I know that the Super Hit is popular</li>
            <li> Super hit smells like candy, so I kind of burned through them</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to receive such a nice variety of incense!  </li>
            <li> This incense pack is fantastic, it brings 12 different and all incredible smells and feel!</li>
            <li> Seriously LOVE this collection, every single one smells wonderful and it is a STRONG incense.</li>
            <li> Really nice aroma, and I clearly have many more to enjoy!!</li>
            <li> I love the variety, but it would also be nice to be able to select exactly which aromas I recieve in bulk.</li>
            <li> We have had fun trying them all out and figuring out which ones we love!</li>
            <li> but they are all wonderful and fill up the entire room, great for having quiet times and just meditating :)</li>
            <li> love these scents mostly the Sandlewood and original Nag champa</li>
            <li> They are amazing and exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> A GREAT value on a product I frequently buy at a brick-and-mortar store.</li>
            <li> the smell is amazing...much better than the cheap $1 stuff....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything else ranged from OK to fantastic.</li>
            <li> some are great and some smell like old lady perfume...</li>
            <li> The incense is fresh and the sticks are in perfect condition, do not flake, and are not crushed.  </li>
            <li> So far they smell great.</li>
            <li> The smell was so overwhelming I had to throw it out before I could even light any of them.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, packaged nicely, good price.  </li>
            <li> She loved them so much she has me buy them for her again</li>
            <li> Nice set, worth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Some are stronger and more pungent (some say &amp;#34;soap/detergent&amp;#34;) but these are all nice in there own right.</li>
            <li> Some scents light more easily than others (seems like some are coated with an oil that makes them burn better), but all light and burn well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing set, very affordable, really adds to the environment and nice touches to the room, all the smells are lovely and aromatic!</li>
            <li> : Mild, warm sweetness- light scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortune:</li>
            <li> They smell great and shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> You may get lucky and enjoy them all, as I do! :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great collection of the company&#x27;s various offerings, the scents are a very pleasant and relaxing combination of essential oils that is never overbearing or &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li> these are great, and while I liked some scent better than others, they are all very nice and reasonably long lasting</li>
            <li> I love love love this set so much!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the deal what a great deal this will last me for a long time if I run out</li>
            <li> Always did Sai Baba Nag Champa, but these other scents are wonderful as well!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love all the unique smells.</li>
            <li> I love the original Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the original Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> Either you love the original Nag Champa and trust the brand</li>
            <li> some were better than others, patchouli forest and the original nag champ flavors were my favorite, but overall was a great buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, and I love how there is a big variety of scents included.</li>
            <li> a great deal on scents recommend this i was worried about how many sticks would be in each box but once open i was no longer got like 15 or 20 sticks or some thing</li>
            <li> Of course after burning one of these incenses my house gets filled with smoke but better than being filled with fish smelling smoke.  </li>
            <li> and I got it very quick.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of incense, but it can be heavy at times, so a variety pack is perfect.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly with no damages.</li>
            <li> This variety is amazing, it&#x27;s such a good deal that it&#x27;s going to be a while until i need to order again</li>
            <li> The scent is strong (not overpowering).  </li>
            <li> some smells are too strong for my taste, but</li>
            <li> These guys are so so strong.</li>
            <li> the smells are strong and do not fade away,  </li>
            <li> The company is good but this particular item I will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Some are the fragrance smell too strong.</li>
            <li> These are way too strong.</li>
            <li> Strong scent on some</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for very much, but it let me experiment on which ones I liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before and they seem to be very good quality and reasonably long buring.</li>
            <li> They both have a very good, rich, and refined quality (although neither smell like traditional sandalwood or patchouli).</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are cheap, but they don&#x27;t really smell good, like cheap soap or something.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa makes the best incense I have ever smelt hands down.</li>
            <li> but they burn fine</li>
            <li> To be honest though, none of these really smells great besides normal Nag Champa and Super Hits.</li>
            <li> My previous purchase of &#x27;Set of 6&#x27; was wonderful</li>
            <li> but, again Nag Champa, Super Hit and Sandalwood ROCK!  </li>
            <li> Sweet, very sweet - strong scent, is rather overbearing...</li>
            <li> The sticks were all good quality long burners with wonderful lasting aromas.</li>
            <li> Thanks I love it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend burning when u definitely plan on being another room but its really strong because they&#x27;re floral but still great</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, was packaged nicely, and it was fresh.</li>
            <li> There are better quality collections available, but for the money this is adequate.</li>
            <li> A very worthwhile collection of classic Indian scents.</li>
            <li> Not one smell of fire either, just pure and amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love incense samplers, as I tend to get used to/tired of a particular fragrance if burned for too long, so sets like this are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Being able to sample so many kinds is a plus, and all are great quality for burning slow and providing a good scent without too much smoke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nag Champa anything.  </li>
            <li> Great purchase, all of these arrived fresh and packaged professionally.</li>
            <li> great quality, wide variety, lovely smell, unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> I enjoy all the different smells and think this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> That desperately cheap sting-y perfumey smell?...</li>
            <li> When the box arrives you can smell it before you even open it, great value for the price cant beat it.</li>
            <li> Romance smells like some sort of cheap, store-bought fragrance.</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T SO CHEAP LOOKING AND CHEAP SMELLING.</li>
            <li> This incense is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> A great collection for trying out different smells.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t actually count them but was happy that they didn&#x27;t scimp</li>
            <li> Great deal on the only incense I burn.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> you will enjoy all.&lt;br /&gt;Nag</li>
            <li> Worth trying if you aren&#x27;t sure which fragrance to buy.</li>
            <li> all were filled with smoke.</li>
            <li> All of these smell awesome and stick around for a few days after being burned.</li>
            <li> The sticks light and burn well.</li>
            <li> The smell is distinct and lingers for awhile compared to most sticks.</li>
            <li> Also these incense do not give me a headache like a lot of these cheap incense sold today</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t enjoy is that some of the incense have flying particles and cause me to sneeze.</li>
            <li> Fantastic variety and</li>
            <li> Fabulous.</li>
            <li> iT GIVES OUR HOUSE, A SCENT OF BEING IN A MAGIC LAND FAR AWAY, IT GIVES YOU A INNER PEACE AND TAKES YOU TO A WONDERFUL STATE OF NIRVANA</li>
            <li> I enjoy all the scents.  </li>
            <li> Great choice of different incenses!</li>
            <li> Great smells that last all day even when incense is burnt out.</li>
            <li> the cheap stuff produces when you light them up.</li>
            <li> Most of the boxes smell very similar, its not the biggest deal because they do smell quite good.</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t smell anywhere near as good as Wildberry incense, I&#x27;m gonna stick with those.</li>
            <li> Bought it because i loved Nag Champa and wanted to get some more of the same type.</li>
            <li> The variety is nice, but so far they all smell like Nag Champa to me, which is what is sold in most head shops.</li>
            <li> Nearly all of these scents are nice, although you may not be able to distinguish them all.</li>
            <li> but these are good quality so far</li>
            <li> They all smell great and burn long and strong.</li>
            <li> Love the Set, Buying another set one, right now.</li>
            <li> the coffin is a wonderful idea to keep from making a mess!</li>
            <li> Buy the package, sit back, and enjoy the essence of aroma!!!</li>
            <li> I would describe it as a light weight original nag champa scent.</li>
            <li> Some of these actually smell pretty good and are nice for a change.  </li>
            <li> most reviews of it are pretty accurate...</li>
            <li> so it was nice having a decent selection to introduce me.</li>
            <li> The first one I opened was Super Hit and it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Burns fast very strong...</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa &amp; the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It smells like a citrusy cologne, and I enjoyed it very much.  </li>
            <li> The scents are true - they do not smell like &amp;#34;scorch&amp;#34; like some cheap incenses do.  </li>
            <li> For the price being cheap, this is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed once I had the opportunity to get them all lit.</li>
            <li> While none of them can hold a candle to Nag Champa, I am not disappointed with this purchase or with any of scents I received.</li>
            <li> Love love love how it came in a package of all different scents!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the amount I paid, though!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered, and I love the scents.</li>
            <li> They also sent mine in a larger nag champa box that held all 12 scents, which I never received before so it was nice to have a box to keep them organized &amp; advertised what they were!</li>
            <li> I would purchase again because, even with this one exception, the bulk is worth the price!</li>
            <li> this is worth it!  </li>
            <li> but well worth the money I spend!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these.</li>
            <li> However, they are a bit smkey when first lit but other than, wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Good fragrance, general woody incense smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I love having a large variety to fit my moods or change the atmosphere before a party.  </li>
            <li> Their scents are pretty strong so just putting a box in the cleaning supply closet or shoe cabinet makes the whole space smell nice.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoy the scents, super hit, and the original nag champa have been my favorites</li>
            <li> Came packaged in a 2012 edition box instead of a bunch of loose boxes (which I was expecting), so I was very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Romance has a clean rose-like scent.</li>
            <li> Clean portapotty</li>
            <li> Clean smell, but not what id want from incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the ones saying they smell &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; there are two that do give off that clean soap smell</li>
            <li> Actually the rest of them were extremely pleasant.</li>
            <li> Definitely not incense to buy if you are looking for a calming, relaxing and pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> This box was such a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Although they are intact and fresh and the sent is definitely strong.</li>
            <li> Not only are these incense sticks a very good price, but they are high quality and richly scented.</li>
            <li> but I used them up pretty quickly because I love the nag champa scents.</li>
            <li> I loved most of the scents, only two (romance &amp; rain forest) smelled VERY soapy, like cheap soap at that...</li>
            <li> every scent is a good one, and everybody who comes over to my house wants to light a new scent.</li>
            <li> If you are uncertain about getting the sampler pack I suggest starting with Nag Champa or Super Hit as these are two of their most popular fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so very much!!!</li>
            <li> But being an avid and experienced user of incense, these are very very low quality compared to the hundreds of others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sampler simply because it offered a great, convenient, and affordable way to experience for the first time all the SATYA SAI BABA incenses that I have repeatedly seen glowing reviews for.</li>
            <li> The signature incense, and for good reason, light, spicy, long burning</li>
            <li> Scents are great they just dont stay lit, have to relight them like they are wet</li>
            <li> This is twelve full size boxes.  </li>
            <li> I am good on incense for several months.  </li>
            <li> : ) Thanks  </li>
            <li> Some of them smell good like sandlewood but the nag champa smells like somebody was smoking in the house, GROSS!</li>
            <li> It smells so good but lasts only like 10 min.</li>
            <li> Crossed my fingers and hoped they&#x27;d smell good, I bought them and have worked my way through the entire box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Musty earth with tinge of sweet - medium scent</li>
            <li> It was all worth it to light blessings.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep all the varieties straight, but you&#x27;re sure to find something you like in this pack.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> What I received was a mix of good quality and low quality incense.</li>
            <li> scent comes individually packaged in its own box, and all of them are contained within another larger box - great for shipping and for storage.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that I liked all of the included scents.  </li>
            <li> also way too nausea inducing sweet.</li>
            <li> It is one of the most zen habits I started years ago, thanks to the impact of yoga and meditation in my life</li>
            <li> Its a good way to sample all the different scents.</li>
            <li> They have many different kinds I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll enjoy it.</li>
            <li> alot of the flavors suck not bad tho</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite brand of incense, I&#x27;ve tried many others and the scent is either too strong or they burn out too fast.</li>
            <li> They have a strong scent, but I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Truly a fantastic value, and the price is right on.</li>
            <li> The super hit scent is the only one the is unique and also happens to be the best smelling in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> They each had their own sweet and unique aroma to be enjoyed not going to buy any other brands</li>
            <li> Some of these scents are winners (midnight, for example) and some are not such good winners in my opinion, but I love having the chance to try so many different scents out!</li>
            <li> So many different incense scents to smell and see if I like, I really love Midnight, it calms the room and can be used at any time of the year and it will feel right!</li>
            <li> This incense is fine quality and priced very reasonably.</li>
            <li> These smell distinct and rich.</li>
            <li> such an awesome variety,  wow fast ship too!  </li>
            <li> So it was great to try this value pack and try a bunch of other scents.</li>
            <li> This set is a great way for someone who is new to burning incense to see if this is a way to enjoy fragrance, and to sample different scents.</li>
            <li> WOW WOW I am so happy and grateful to find this.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal nag champa person</li>
            <li> you have to either choose to get the pack that includes midnight or super hit...</li>
            <li> The sticks are well made and smell extraordinary.</li>
            <li> It included Nag Champa, Sandalwood, Celestial, Patchouli Forest, Super Hit, and Sunrise.</li>
            <li> I received this item quickly from Tom&#x27;s Incense.  </li>
            <li> They do burn quickly, though.</li>
            <li> Each pack is sealed in original plastic bags inside of the original packaging and looks exactly as described and pictured.  </li>
            <li> The jasmine sticks are quit flammable and will char when you are lighting them if you do not blow them out quickly.</li>
            <li> Romance nag champa super hit and blessings are my favs</li>
            <li> It came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> The person that I gifted this to really enjoyed all of the different aromas.</li>
            <li> Burns rather quickly compared to the rest.</li>
            <li> The surprise of the pack for me was that I do not care for the Super Hit at all-</li>
            <li> stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before having purchased this set from Amazon, I had tried Nag Champa, Super Hit and Celestial.</li>
            <li> /&gt;these arrive quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Super Hit&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> First off I am a huge fan of Nag Champa by Satya Sai Baba.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed most except for the Romance, Jasmine, and Rain Forest scents that became quickly/intensely cloying and overwhelmingly sweet and floral; lingered for too long.</li>
            <li> The only positive is if you do happen to like the smell, they are VERY strong, I didn&#x27;t even light one and they smelled up the room they were in!</li>
            <li> Burned two one at a time today and it filled the entire place (one bedroom apartment) with very strong aroma.</li>
            <li> but half of them are great and the rest are just ehh.</li>
            <li> and I guarantee you&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Will definitely reorder when I need more!</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t deliver exactly what they say you are going to get!</li>
            <li> A great way to try new scents without having to pay for each individually.</li>
            <li> The only ones I liked were the sandalwood and super hit</li>
            <li> they are easy to burn and they have so many different fragrances to choose from.</li>
            <li> 😕&lt;br /&gt;But more than half smelled really nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of incense including some &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; products from smaller, cultural shops and Satya brand has consistently been the absolute best on the market.</li>
            <li> A good starting point for somebody looking to try new scents, or just aiming to have a variety of choices available.</li>
            <li> I love keeping a few burning most of the day!  </li>
            <li> I ran through the Nag Champa, Super Hit and Sandalwood pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in sampling more scents from Sai Baba&#x27;s line of incense.</li>
            <li> the batch is fresh, genuine or whatever&amp;#34; it has this warm toasty, simple, pure, somewhat uncomplicated &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa and Super Hit incense, so this assortment was an affordable way to try other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I do believe you will enjoy this collection as much as I have.</li>
            <li> Amazing value for the variety, definitely ordering again.</li>
            <li> Amazing scents last forever, and I&#x27;ve gotten raves when folks enter my home and take a sniff.</li>
            <li> and all have amazing different smells.</li>
            <li> I love incense and burn it frequently.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far is Romance</li>
            <li> Far better scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Have fun.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far is the Sandalwood</li>
            <li> Each scent is discernible from the last and each offer their own &amp;#34;character&amp;#34; when lit.</li>
            <li> as most of it reminds me of a mix of dimestore incense and old lady perfume.  </li>
            <li> But for the price they are worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fun to have a variety.</li>
            <li> nice aroma especially when I cook fish or chiken</li>
            <li> And incense is a fair option to my wife&#x27;s love of candles which are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Selection....will be back for more...</li>
            <li> Champa: So this is the famous Naga Champa, Wow</li>
            <li> Definitely worth getting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy opposed to flowery fragrances, but most of the flowery ones here completely overdo it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to try them all.</li>
            <li> Some of the others are nice, and some just not offensive enough to throw away.</li>
            <li> But you will find you like that old Nag a lot more than some of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I thought the set will give me a nice variety to the same ol</li>
            <li> Offensive and powerful smell without even opening the boxes.  </li>
            <li> Its fun</li>
            <li> They smell incredible and burn slow.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed exploring the different scents, but many were much too perfumey for my tastes.</li>
            <li> To buy all of these at the candle shop near my house it would have cost me $40 or more.</li>
            <li> It was fun for our family to anticipate the smell on the stick/burn fragrance of each scent.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> the more i smell the more i feel empowered to breathe into the deep deep spaces between us and our love.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It is the only incense I&#x27;ve ever used that I liked the smell and wasn&#x27;t obnoxious with the smoke.</li>
            <li> They all kind of smell the same.</li>
            <li> It comes packaged in a nice box with the twelve scents in individual boxes within the outer packaging.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a purchase if you&#x27;re unsure about what scents you might enjoy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE Nag Champa so much I was very excited to get the entire collection.  </li>
            <li> These are our favorite incense, try to keep them in stock even for our back deck near the hot tub :)!</li>
            <li> unique enough to keep inthe collection, I remember liking it for sure.  </li>
            <li> Still none are better than the original blue box Nag Champa, but that one is included, too.</li>
            <li> First of all, I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this product was delivered.</li>
            <li> I will be back to purchase more as soon as this healthy batch is all used up in prayers that linger all day long in a fragrance you will keep enjoying.</li>
            <li> -- If you&#x27;re on a real budget and just want consistent good, a low tolerance for risk you might try the variety pack of 6..</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 12 scents, as the description states; some I&#x27;m familiar with, others not so much.  </li>
            <li> Comparing what I have smelled compared to some of the other reviews, I have to say that some of the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ones are really good, like Fortune.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Midnight- Very soothing and rich scent.</li>
            <li> Tried other ones and some are so so and some are good.</li>
            <li> if your looking for quality this is not the right product</li>
            <li> Sandalwood to me, done right....</li>
            <li> I got these because of what someone else said in their review and boy they were right.</li>
            <li> Has plenty of variety for picking the right scent for each occasion.</li>
            <li> They were right on time too.</li>
            <li> Romance was pretty good, imagine what the color pink smells like to you, does it smell like cotton candy?</li>
            <li> The price is so low that it&#x27;s worth it to get a few boxes of scents that you don&#x27;t really enjoy as much, but most of them are very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying them so much, I haven&#x27;t even been able to open them fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My absolute new favorite is fortune, and even my room mate who has asthma says he enjoys them a lot.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa, especially Fortune, Super Hits, and</li>
            <li> The variety pack has several traditional favorites and others that are unique and pleasant to smell.  </li>
            <li> I was worried at first given how it was packaged that I got a massive box of super hit only, but was happy to see it was just how it was packaged.  </li>
            <li> I was worried because incense can either smell really awesome or just be terrible and so far the scents in this set and WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> (not that you should be in a small or medium room by yourself burning incense no matter what scent, but I&#x27;m just giving an example lol).</li>
            <li> Great fragrance however, they have small stems</li>
            <li> I mean,  a lot and the scents,  are beautiful smells,  they burn well,  a nice long burn,  and</li>
            <li> These incense seriously smell so good!</li>
            <li> sometimes when I buy Patchouli they don&#x27;t have a particular smell, but these Patchouli&#x27;s all have a unique smell.  </li>
            <li> Lots of different nice scents at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It was great to sample the different scents, but i should have stayed with the basic Agarbatti.</li>
            <li> There are roughly 120 of these, I haven&#x27;t exactly counted, they range in scents, most of which are not really scents, but names that look cool, they still do burn for about an hour each, and give off a good amount of scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jasmine Blossom - clear plastic - Strong floral scent - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli forest - opaque plastic - Patchouli and Nag Champa - crumbly</li>
            <li> The auromas are also very pungeant and kind of all similar.</li>
            <li> Suffice to say eight out of twelve (for my fickle nose) is a pretty great turnout on a small investiture.</li>
            <li> I previously bought the Set of 6 x 15g Boxes Incense, and I loved them.</li>
            <li> When some (about half of the incense scents) are lit, it burns differently and does not smell as pleasant, having more of a &amp;#34;fire burn&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> such variety and such a great price will buy again</li>
            <li> Smells great and useful in a small room or to freshen up a large one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each offers their own little twist on a great smell that last!</li>
            <li> I mean they will singe your nose hairs and give you the fabulous illusion that your room smells good</li>
            <li> but I feel like these are the reject packs and maybe the actual scents smell a little better and more authentic.</li>
            <li> My favorite right now is the nag champa sticks in the blue box</li>
            <li> These light easy and burn long.  </li>
            <li> Very much a scent that stands out on</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I recommend this very much.</li>
            <li> I began smudging with White Sage and found I liked the smell, so I tried another product (Wild African Violet) and found I liked that smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have my old burner boxed up and living in my new bedroom, something was missing incense and a perfect burner.  </li>
            <li> One of the things I like the most about it is that it does not have what to my nose is the sharp, cheap, headache inducing chemical-like smell of lots of the inexpensive incense you&#x27;ll find around.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is a winner, and we love opening the new packs for something new.  </li>
            <li> There are a few that are trash worthy right away, but the ones that hit (Celestial, Fortune, etc.) are really nice.</li>
            <li> It all kind of smell the same except for a few really distinctive one, but overall a very good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> first time i have seen a variety pack, love all the different choices.</li>
            <li> Love it and will be back!</li>
            <li> but all really do smell alike, and some just smell like a soap bar!</li>
            <li> Great product long lasting burn time</li>
            <li> Better than aerosol spray to freshen up a room and the sent last longer as well.</li>
            <li> I tend to like stronger scents (I know many people are the opposite) and</li>
            <li> pleased with the overall Promptness of delivery and packaging.</li>
            <li> Most of the scents having the same urinal like odor.</li>
            <li> I have used many of the different scents by now.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> seems like all of them smell the same, smells like soap more than anything else.</li>
            <li> comes with the afore mentioned first 7 fragrances...</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Satya&amp;#34; kind are harder to find.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance - clear - cheap hotel soap - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessing</li>
            <li> Making it seem well worth the extremely reasonably priced purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of the 12 different boxes of incense, I&#x27;ve enjoyed all but two.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed these and I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I was able to sample all the different smells.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast!  </li>
            <li> I love ordering this big 12 pack of incense.  </li>
            <li> They remain a favorite whether purchased at the local Indo-Pak grocery store or on-line</li>
            <li> Would recommend this set to anyone who is interested in incense but don&#x27;t know quite what they like.</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy these again.</li>
            <li> I decided this time around to expand my horizons and try more &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; from the same company.</li>
            <li> And definitely continue buying more.</li>
            <li> Watch out, some of them are pretty crumbly and opening the package will cover your life in pleasantly-scented dust.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> love the different scents.</li>
            <li> The perfumes are relaxing, peacefully, and makes you quite.</li>
            <li> These burn slowly and offer great scents.</li>
            <li> I burn incense every day so being able to change the mood with just a change of a box is simple and neat.</li>
            <li> Many of the scents smell similar but I like them all</li>
            <li> Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Most scents smelled the same - soapy.</li>
            <li> the money, I&#x27;m not sure there are many better options than Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a friend but decided to try them out first.</li>
            <li> will be buying again soon, I love all the varieties of different smells.</li>
            <li> It makes my living spaces amazingly peaceful.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this brand.</li>
            <li> I love them all and these will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy more of these.</li>
            <li> love all the different smells.</li>
            <li> and it really does smell like jasmine blossoms, to a tee!</li>
            <li> More incense then you could every possibly need at one point in time.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the blue box Nag Champa!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have burndt many different sticks and cones and none have stopped burning almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as i named this review is how my house smells, \\&quot;Romance\\&quot; tells me on the box</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> So well worth the money I saved so much</li>
            <li> This set of 12 Satya Sai incense packs is my ultimate favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is my first review</li>
            <li> I got it around the same time and use it way more than these.  </li>
            <li> They come in such a great variety and ship fast, I have ordered them several times and don&#x27;t buy from anywhere else</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the various smells.</li>
            <li> love all the different scents!</li>
            <li> but like how they last longer than most incense.</li>
            <li> I only have tried 2 types (Nag Champa and Midnight) and were always my favorite</li>
            <li> I mean everything else is great, but I&#x27;m just not cray about 8 out of 12 of the smell, but it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Ships fast, and I always get the right order.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not stinging your nostrils with a sharp flowery smell, it&#x27;s...kind of a warm reassuring hug...</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have smelled them like other incense I have bought.  </li>
            <li> On par with the original nag champa as far as enjoyment of scent and..</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll probably find a handful of new flavors that you like, as well as come away with a new appreciation for just how good the standard stuff really is.</li>
            <li> I would say that about 8 of these are good enough to use regularly.</li>
            <li> This is a real deal incense...way better than anything that you will get at big box stores or convenience stores.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely cent get enough :)</li>
            <li> The three major exceptions: Blessings, Rainforest, and Jasmine Blossom smell like cheap soap.</li>
            <li> The scents are pleasant and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my all time favorite, but I enjoy discovering the different  scents in different moods or rooms of my house.</li>
            <li> Got here early snd has the full variety.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure about which scent you like, this is a good variety of which to sample.</li>
            <li> They are girly, loud and sweet smelling incense.</li>
            <li> One stick of most of these varieties is enough to give decent fragrance to a room about 20ft x 20ft.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite incense set, usually better than what you can find at head shops or any other place that would have incense.</li>
            <li> LOL not a pleasant sounding word to use in describing a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It smells exactly like those cheap white bars of hotel</li>
            <li> Soft, but didn&#x27;t linger as long as i would&#x27;ve liked after burning out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended throwing this one out along with Romance simply because of it&#x27;s overbearing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance: Floral - strong and overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually could not even keep the box in the house because of the strong smell.  </li>
            <li> These are strong, burn around 30-45 minutes, and actually smell like what they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> Burn a little quickly, but they are potent.</li>
            <li> Incredibly pure smelling incense</li>
            <li> Includes large amount of incense of each type.  </li>
            <li> Certainly a lot of product for the money.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve opted to just buy a large box of that one going forward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a pure Nag Champa fan and have been nothing but</li>
            <li> Comes in a large box</li>
            <li> Already shared a few with my friends and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be buying some soon!</li>
            <li> Until this purchase I had heard only of Nag Champa (my favorite since hippie-hood) and Super Hit(discovered much later in life).</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> This is my first time coming across high quality incense</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent deal a little over a $1 a box, but I will just stick to the same ol blue box Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> The price is okay for how much you get but some of them don&#x27;t stay lit or are hard to light.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast also</li>
            <li> ENJOY #simple</li>
            <li> Sometimes incense sticks smell very well straight out of the box, but when burned they don&#x27;t smell quite as well, but</li>
            <li> I got more than I expected.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a couple of the scents I really do not like, but that still leaves 9-10 scents that I absolutely DO love.</li>
            <li> Fast on time delivery will order again.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say about these.</li>
            <li> kinda burn fast though..</li>
            <li> I was paying almost $3 per box at the mall...and found this set for so much cheaper here...</li>
            <li> You almost get too much product.  </li>
            <li> And those two that I didn&#x27;t really care for</li>
            <li> I WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have much fragrance in them.</li>
            <li> Really like fortune, midnight, blessings, superhit, sandalwood, and celestial.</li>
            <li> Maybe be a bit more careful than me</li>
            <li> really.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I thought, gee, this smells mostly like fire and not a very woman-like scent</li>
            <li> Some let off a whole lot of smoke.</li>
            <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t really beat the variety or amount of incense you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re too much for my liking.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not getting much variety.</li>
            <li> if its not broken, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> hey, who really cares if there is a lot of &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; in the packet.  </li>
            <li> Arrived fast and could smell them thru the box.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had a chance to smell all of them yet, but I highly recommend this product to anyone who is wanting to venture out into the world of incense!</li>
            <li> so i can light one up to get my house is a completely different mood!</li>
            <li> I did not care much for the soapy, floral scents.</li>
            <li> Vey reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> I really like the selection this set provides.</li>
            <li> I ordered without really taking the time to read the description</li>
            <li> but it really is an affordable alternative to candles.</li>
            <li> Satya Sai, with their cult-classic Nag Champa in the blue box, is a brand I have trusted for decades to smell fantastic, each and every</li>
            <li> It got here fast.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t burn too fast &amp; I luv the variety of scents</li>
            <li> Much cheaper here than in stores.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li> Fast ship.</li>
            <li> I have bought incense before but none have come strait out of the box with as much smell as this set did.  </li>
            <li> so i took a chance with the whole set.</li>
            <li> - clear - light lemon - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortune - clear - minty - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise - opaque - cedar and Nag - crumbly</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of regular Nag Champa, but most of these smell like an old women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> quality incense sticks, they do not leave that &amp;#34;burning wood&amp;#34; smell that low quality incense do, such as the kind purchasable at walmarts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Paying a few cents more for this brand is worth it.</li>
            <li> These incense sticks smell nice but are a bit too uneven &amp; flimsy</li>
            <li> All the different scents were nice, only 1 that I did not like.</li>
            <li> This is a good introduction to the other incense Shrinivas Sugandhalaya has to offer and anyone who enjoys blue box</li>
            <li> If you love Nag Champa as much as I do, chances are, you too, may be sickened by these other fragrances.</li>
            <li> I really like the Nag Champa products and fragrences better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have some other incense that smell good prior to burning, but while burning, they smell nothing like it.</li>
            <li> Jasmine blossom can be overwhelming in a small area but is very well suited for more open spaces.</li>
            <li> so I was stoked to see the &amp;#34;bargain buy&amp;#34; (you will easily pay triple for all these individually at a local store) with new scents I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li> it was rich smelling but appears unavailable for individual purchase.</li>
            <li> Now I like a lot more scents other then just the patchouli.  </li>
            <li> I love the Sai Baba Nag Champa Incense and decided to try some of their other scents.</li>
            <li> If you love this Nag Champa and you think you&#x27;d like to experiment with some other</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of the original Nag Champa (blue box) incense, there&#x27;s all the varieties in this package.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am sure to recommend them to friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t find a single one that was anything less than great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set of 12 to anyone looking to find which kind of incense they like or simply someone looking for a lot of high quality incense that will last them quite a while.</li>
            <li> Each box smells amazing to me and they last twice as long as than the ones I buy from Walmart.</li>
            <li> Decent selection, but some of the varieties are very soapy and smokey.  </li>
            <li> Like maybe something that would be good to freshen up a 1000 year old public out-house in Mumbai or someplace, where the over-powering smell of soap is needed to beat back the funk of a 1000 year old mixture of turds.  </li>
            <li> My dad goes to India frequently and brings back incense, and last time he gave me a sandalwood incense that was really nice.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was oily around the actual burner, but when I attempted to clean, noticed under incense holder, it was fine, but where smoke touched table and white ledge, it took off wood finish and discolored the white to beige.</li>
            <li> Extremely high quality, not like the sickeningly sweet American &#x27;incenses, one would find at &#x27;snoke shops&#x27;</li>
            <li> the only thing is I wish it burned longer and last a litlle longer other than that I am happy I will be getting these again</li>
            <li> That would explain everything smelling more or less the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> #34;better ones&amp;#34; being --- sandalwood, celestial, sunrise, super hit, nag champa, midnight, and patchouli forest -- these 7 have a similar powdery smell and feel &amp;</li>
            <li> OR you could just buy a big thing of super hit...</li>
            <li> Must admit, Nag Champa and Super Hit are the only ones I would buy again, the others too perfumy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the creative spicy mixture of Nag Champa is no where to be found in most of the rest of the set.  </li>
            <li> Such smooth, natural, concentrated, and lingering scents.</li>
            <li> Find a local incense dealer, you&#x27;re better off, as all of the scents are basically the same.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the different scents available.  </li>
            <li> but the woody fragrance is overpowering any possibility of a decent fragrance.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this particular brand.</li>
            <li> Especially Jasmine Blossom and Super Hit.</li>
            <li> I can see this entire pack lasting me a year or more.</li>
            <li> I bought this package to explore incense, and I couldn&#x27;t even open the box before my entire house was permeated with the overwhelming smell of patchouli oil and dreadlocks.</li>
            <li> - This &#x27;Set of 12&#x27; just added 5 SOAPY smelling odors that we had to throw away - They truly smell like burning soap - These include the following: Romance, Fortune, Rain Forest, Jasmine Blossom, Blessings - The &#x27;6 Set&#x27;, Nag Champa, Sunrise, Sandalwood, Midnight (or Super Hit), Patchouli, Celestial</li>
            <li> These sticks are a bit stronger than what I&#x27;m used to, though some scents are stronger than others, and need to be placed further away or even in a different room to get a more balanced strength.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t a smell I disliked but there were a few that I liked more than others, the rain scent was by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> Given that, incense is not expensive, Nag Champa is very slow burning, and the fragrances are wonderful and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I highly suggest giving this incense a try.</li>
            <li> I would highly recomment.</li>
            <li> Also, the insense itself is high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> These are high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the &amp;#34;Midnight&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> I threw them away, but I highly recommend the Nag Champa, Sandalwood, and Patchouli Forest.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these incents.</li>
            <li> Im starting to realize from the other comments about some smelling like soaps or bathrooms but to be honest they are made of woods  </li>
            <li> Mild sweet with earth tones, slow burning - moderate light scent</li>
            <li> By something a little more higher-quality</li>
            <li> it comes in cute little packages for each smell.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa and this set allows you to change it up a little without losing the quality.</li>
            <li> do recommend this for anyone new to incense or this particular brand</li>
            <li> Complete order, fast delivery</li>
            <li> lol - sorry...</li>
            <li> so far we really  like these.</li>
            <li> Love the scents and they last long.</li>
            <li> For $15 its worth trying 12 different scents.</li>
            <li> She had sampled a few too many perfumes.</li>
            <li> Others seem to work normally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying all these different kinds of incense and so far the Super Hit and Romance are two that I like.</li>
            <li> The aroma is out of this world, full bodied and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> The scents are a little odd, but still very nice.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve liked all the different scents, but one smelled EXACTLY like a dirty ferret, so we threw that one out :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a nice variety of scents, each stick is about 10 inches long, and they burn slower than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They made my house smell sweet and clean and burned slowly, def would buy again.</li>
            <li> You may as well light firecrackers with all that other garbage.</li>
            <li> I was new to incense and didn&#x27;t know what I would like.</li>
            <li> Variety allowed me to try new scents.  </li>
            <li> I got a gift card for my birthday and a new burner</li>
            <li> And, if you are new to this, don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> Also, some of the sticks burn up very quickly and put up a lot of black smoke.</li>
            <li> These also let off a black trail of carbon when on fire, that smells strongly of chemicals and nastiness.</li>
            <li> I have been burning Nag Champa for years, and was excited to try the other scents offered by the company.</li>
            <li> If I find that I was the one in error I will come back and modify this rating to higher</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is that some of the scents are pretty gross.  </li>
            <li> All four smell exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I use it just for a few minutes and is more than enough to cover the whole house.</li>
            <li> These were old!  </li>
            <li> Buy these, last much longer than candles and don&#x27;t cost a fortune!</li>
            <li> I love the smell it leaves behind and much cleaner smelling  for much longer than a candle.  </li>
            <li> All in all well worth the purchase, if for no other reason than to discover your personal favorites.</li>
            <li> Really worth the money spent, we highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The rainforest scent is more like an overwhelming soap scent that I can taste, which I find unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t fit in my incense burner which is the black triple dragon one that&#x27;s sold here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Each stick lasts about half an hour, and they smell cheap.</li>
            <li> Nt only do these last longer than some of the cheaper ones, but they are true to smell</li>
            <li> I always have a stick burning when I have someone over, and have only received positive feedback.</li>
            <li> #34;the stick has a velvety deer antler feel whereas the remaining other are more dry and compressed&amp;#34;  So those first seven are closer to the quality of nag champa whereas the remaining others....almost smell as though they were made by a different manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will last you a long time, and some of them are really unique.</li>
            <li> I have a large, open house and all of the scents work well in my home.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not used to it, then you should only burn about 1/3 of each incense for a relatively large room and let yourself grow used to it.</li>
            <li> But the scent just doesn&#x27;t last near as long nor is it as developed and rich.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sandalwood - clear - sandalwood and spice - crumbly</li>
            <li> WOW WOW</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I will buy again, at least the ones that I like the most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up 3 packages so far.</li>
            <li> Still plenty left on the incense itself but it may be a sign they can&#x27;t keep up with the orders and rush out product that isn&#x27;t ready yet.</li>
            <li> a soft one...  </li>
            <li> My hubby is a practicing Buddhist and was pleasantly surprised with the purchase as he now has a plethora of incense to choose from for his evening prayers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite the connoisseur of all things incense and have been purchasing since I was a young teenager.</li>
            <li> Next time I think I am just going to order the 6 pack as the ones I really like are all in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My least favorite being blessings.</li>
            <li> This is by far my fav.</li>
            <li> 5 of the 12 boxes are non natural incenses.  </li>
            <li> They all smelled like soap and they were really crumbly, several stripped in shipping.</li>
            <li> Tons of quality incense for the price, much cheaper than you could get it at a smoke shop or similar place.  </li>
            <li> Completely changed the way I saw incense.</li>
            <li> The sticks burn for a reasonable amount of time; Ive never actually kept track</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at the quality of these.</li>
            <li> So old, in fact - they were crumbling.  </li>
            <li> what I do is, stick 3 or 4 different ones and leave it in the bathroom and it masks the smells very well.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m an old man</li>
            <li> This is a really inexpensive way to sample tons of different scents.  </li>
            <li> The Nag Champa scent is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> You get at least a dozen, and usually more in each box.  </li>
            <li> I wrote a note into the seller, they clarified that I had to open the outside of the box and sure enough there were 12 different scents.  </li>
            <li> I love them, I used one everyday in different parts of the house.  </li>
            <li> Im not a big incense person but something about the nag champa incense that puts the mind right and just smells divine, not like a stoner house, like a spiritual clenasing.</li>
            <li> The flavors are not overwhelmingly strong but leave a lasting exotic scent for quite some time after a burn.</li>
            <li> Not the typical sweet smell.</li>
            <li> It really is a great value buy and cannot go wrong with it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve experimented with several different brands and homemade ones to no avail, and like a boomerang i&#x27;ve come back full circle.</li>
            <li> Super Hit says it decreases the negative and increases the positive for all zodiac signs.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa and it&#x27;s usually the only thing I will ever burn.</li>
            <li> Only a couple smelled decent</li>
            <li> I ordered two different assortments and when I received them, everything smelled exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I will stick to their classic nag champa in the future!</li>
            <li> Not only does the smell kill off any other undesirable smells and scents, but it is mesmerizing to watch the smoke rise from the incense into the air - it has the calming meditative effect of wine!</li>
            <li> First time I buy these and definitely will get them again, the fragrance is not as intense as some other brands that I have try</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is one of the few authentic incense brands people use - many go for the cheap crap you get at wal-mart or</li>
            <li> My living room area is open and with high ceilings and the smell still lingers for hours...</li>
            <li> I normally burn the far more subtle Japanese style incense, so each of the following was a brand new experience for me.  </li>
            <li> Got exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> We wanted to try this set out because there are a few scents - especially the regular nag champa - that we&#x27;ve gotten separately and really enjoyed.  </li>
            <li> While some of the names of the scents leave you guessing as to what they are supposed to imitate, the low price on this large quantity of incense was enough to get me to purchase.</li>
            <li> They are small but very powerful.  </li>
            <li> I usually only buy the sandlewood and nag champa fragrances, but decided to try some new ones.  </li>
            <li> When I first received it, was not clear that there were actually 12 different scents in the exterior box.  </li>
            <li> There are a few scents that are bold.</li>
            <li> After a single burn of 5 of the scents they went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> I merely need to pick a fragrance to fit my daily mood, to open my window and to light a stick before setting off to go about my housechores, work or hobbies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rest aren&#x27;t nearly as bad though and you have a great variety to choose from.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t generally care for Satya&#x27;s flora incense.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried the patchouli and romance.</li>
            <li> , my&#x27; initial impression is it had a masculine men&#x27;s cologne smell to it?</li>
            <li> I have an old used up Glade candle with some wax left and</li>
            <li> I really like all of the difference scents, they burn evenly and i do not need to watch them as carefully as scented candles</li>
            <li> Because it seems to burn fast, and because its still is not really the smell I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> Nag Champa brand is mass-produced; sometimes you get poor batches, but most of the time, you get top-quality scents.</li>
            <li> Some are good, some not that much... :(</li>
            <li> I made this purchase because I am new to incense and wanted to smell the different types before settling in on a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lit \\&quot;Celestial\\&quot; last night</li>
            <li> You get about 15 grams per little box, you get 12 of those boxes which total up to around 180 grams,  If most of these scents are new and you can accept possibly not liking a few....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn these as much as I used to, but they last decently long, and smell up the entire house.</li>
            <li> Difficult to light and didn&#x27;t make much smoke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this bundle of incense as a gift for a frequent incense user twice; the second time it was actually a request!  </li>
            <li> Use caution when opening the bag containing the sticks within the box; a decent amount of loose incense residue will be in there and can be pretty messy if you pull a bundle of the sticks out at once from the bag (this is no fault of the manufacturer but just a result of the nature of the product, there will still ample incense material left on all of the sticks).</li>
            <li> I like all of them except for Blessings, which smells like an old lady perfume and will linger on for so long that I end up with a headache (already in the trash can).</li>
            <li> Mild earth tones, a little superficial compared to other brands I have burned, slow burning - light scent, lingers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain</li>
            <li> Every scent is quite unique, although many of them similar base ingredients (patchouli, sandalwood, etc).  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past and it&#x27;s money well spent, if you enjoy incense.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews have to be from the owners or folks who are either olfactorily challenged or never experienced a pure product</li>
            <li> The original Nag Champa is still my favorite but the other scents arnt bad.</li>
            <li> I live in New York City and usually buy incense from local Indian stores.</li>
            <li> as described, incense is very strong smelling , some good, some of the incense smells terrible ,i usually buy  </li>
            <li> I cant decide if thats a good thing or a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> I very much expect that I shall be purchasing bigger orders of at least their sandalwood and romance incenses individually in the future (as well as trying others!)</li>
            <li> These are decent there was a few I didn&#x27;t care for on the smell</li>
            <li> The aroma is pure and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize just how much incense comes in 12 small boxes</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give it long enough a burn to determine.  </li>
            <li> I order this as a gift for my father every Christmas and he loves it - it is a year long supply if you like to burn incense regularly.</li>
            <li> but, if you&#x27;re looking for long lasting Patchouli, these aren&#x27;t the ones you want.</li>
            <li> Long story short, this just doesn&#x27;t burn well.  </li>
            <li> and they last sooo long</li>
            <li> Some people hate the jasmine blossom and some love it, the same for fortune and so on, so it really just depends on you.</li>
            <li> It reminds of the the time we lost our 8 year old at the cosmetics counter and had to drive home with the car windows down.  </li>
            <li> For an incense burner I drill out any wine bottle three holes spaced near the bottom (for air intake)using a glass drill bit (easy) and then merely suspend the incense stick down the neck of the bottle (holding with a paperclip or just bending the stick stem).  </li>
            <li> I also like how these sticks last a long time!</li>
            <li> They last long!</li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks is if you don&#x27;t like a scent your stuck with a whole box...</li>
            <li> I have used several incense from cheap to expensive.</li>
            <li> Maybe 4 have the same characteristic notes of incense and another set of 3 or 4 might have another set that is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and although you can certainly smell them, the scent is not overwhelming and they burn for a very long time.</li>
            <li> forest - clear plastic - Citrus Ajax soap - tightly rolled (,not crumbly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came in one big box, packaged in 12 other smaller boxes inside.  </li>
            <li> Most of the ones i picked up randomly smelled soapy and too artificial or strong for my liking.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand produces an excessive amount of smoke.</li>
            <li> incense stick variety, while others were of the hand-rolled variety (think of classic blue box nag champa and you&#x27;ll understand what I mean.)  </li>
            <li> , you really can&#x27;t go wrong if you enjoy incense</li>
            <li> The smell lingers long after they are done buring.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps I am lighting them incorrectly and letting the flame stay on too long before I blow it out.</li>
            <li> The package of incense is well made and burns for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Scent is a VERY subjective preference, as subjective as preferred guitar picks (you guitar players know what I mean).</li>
            <li> I am currently forcing myself to use the other boxes</li>
            <li> I use a different scent every other day.</li>
            <li> I put 4 boxes in my bathroom and it works better than the reed diffuser(-&gt; completely useless!)</li>
            <li> Its fragrance will last 2-6 hours depending on the type, except for the jasmine which outlasts all the other types.</li>
            <li> These actually smell like they smell before they are lit, unlike all other incense I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I dont get it burning scented candles or other such smell burning products.  </li>
            <li> This amount lasts you a very long time too.</li>
            <li> Some of these seemed to be rushed to dry.</li>
            <li> The sticks seem dry.</li>
            <li> These are likely sticks rolled in cow dung and dipped in oils or perfumes.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a single incense I don&#x27;t like out of this pack.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike a single fragrance, I just have favorites.</li>
            <li> I find that a few of them kind of smell the same, but none of them smell bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the way these products smell in general or if the products are all packaged beside each other for too long of time, but they all smell about the same to me.</li>
            <li> Those extra fragrances are not worth it.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that I wish the description of the fragrant is more reflective to the ingredient as opposed to something so poetically vague...</li>
            <li> First poor review</li>
            <li> Wish there was less garbage from all of the individual boxes.</li>
            <li> You get a gross of incense sticks for less than $11, and Nag Champa is a well-known and well-liked brand.</li>
            <li> Even if you only end up liking half of these</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a big mess with the ashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super Hit- Smells like nag champa but less woody and more like artificial cherries and nutmeg.</li>
            <li> and I love them, but the 3 stars is for the poor quality in at least half of the scents provided.</li>
            <li> The majority of the scents produce little smoke when starting, but a couple do.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at first, they come in a large box labeled &amp;#34;Midnight&amp;#34; so I thought that&#x27;s all I got, the midnight smell.</li>
            <li> Most of these smell really bad.</li>
            <li> They all smell like burning wood, no real hint of perfume or anything.</li>
            <li> and romance are not appreciated.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s because they smelled like Dove Soap and that&#x27;s not really a scent</li>
            <li> Such a goodbye I get to try all the types of sense I used to spend six dollars for one box with a few last-minute</li>
            <li> Today I just lit \\&quot;Sunrise\\&quot; and again, all I smell is fire and smoke, not much fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps a bit stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> scent did not hold up as expected.</li>
            <li> It has a wide variety of smells.</li>
            <li> Have bought it a few times and you definitely get quite a bang for your buck here.</li>
            <li> The assortment gives me a wide range to play with and  if I want to gift a friend I&#x27;ll be recommending this vendor.</li>
            <li> No, just get your Nag Champa, burn one a few times a day or as needed, and your entire abode will sigh with tranquility.</li>
            <li> Getting tired of the same old Nag?</li>
            <li> I use these in the basement/bar area of my home (a typical Chicago house, average size) and one stick is plenty to take care of the entire space.</li>
            <li> After trying this out a few years back, I have never again spent money trying other incenses out.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was also too mute, not strong enough for burning.</li>
            <li> and you will not make such a mess!</li>
            <li> I seriously think these guys are putting 2 boxes good 10 boxes crude.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the other incense are wood based and that&#x27;s why I get minimal fragrance and a lot of wood.</li>
            <li> I had never really been exposed to the other fragrances.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blessing: Sweet perfume-counter style with low sandalwood base - moderate scent&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I expected does the job !</li>
            <li> other scents from this pack that are among my favorites are romance and jasmine blossom.</li>
            <li> These come packed inside another incense box, so don&#x27;t freak out when you receive what looks like something other than what you ordered.</li>
            <li> Other odors you need to kill out?</li>
            <li> so I decided to take a risk and try some of their other fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I have been using only a couple of the boxes in the past months</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in most of them</li>
            <li> this set usually lasts us about 5-6 months and we burn incense on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t made my way through the other ones yet, but I have a feeling</li>
            <li> Due to differences in thickness and moisture content</li>
            <li> When we buy this incense we usually buy three boxes at a time and they last about three months.</li>
            <li> I am a nag champa burner,  but these other scents,  </li>
            <li> The one drawback, they are shorter than other incense sticks</li>
            <li> and I have no reason to believe the other 11 wont.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> They are not as well made as other incense that I have bought, but</li>
            <li> The other scents were too sweetly perfumed with an artificial hotel soapy smell.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it or other scents again.</li>
            <li> If you want a wide variety of incense get this package deal!</li>
            <li> THEY BURN SLOWER THAN SOME OTHER BRANDS I HAVE PURCHASED .</li>
            <li> but I have yet to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> However, this is in some part due to the fact that I have a pollen and dust allergy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually does, but I guess I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Celestial is harder for me to pin down, like sunrise</li>
            <li> , I concluded that when burned there are subtle differences in odor, and some smell a lot worse than others, but overall, for someone of western European descent, the odor was basically strong and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing some away that I totally hated, but I found the ones that I love!</li>
            <li> This time a completely different item arrived and Amazon is givingme a hard time about returning it.</li>
            <li> When they are of bad quality they light up immediately and produce a lot of dark smoke.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nag Champa - opaque plastic - Nag Champa - crumbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight - opaque - dark and earthy - crumbly</li>
            <li> resins  and ambers that might give an off scent but when burned give it a totally different effect so if you buy this don&#x27;t shrug it off without at least lighting it.</li>
            <li> Burnin&#x60; Down The House.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried them all, but like about half of the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> All but two of them were so revolting/disgusting, I had to extinguish them after two minutes or less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it for years and know its slightly crumbly.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought the 6 box set but</li>
            <li> I prefered  of all that I smelled was the black boxed Sandalwood</li>
            <li> but I would estimate each one lasts about half an hour.</li>
            <li> Previous reviewers mentioned some moisture damage to the incense</li>
            <li> I thought each box would have 20 sticks, but it had less.</li>
            <li> I am used to the incense you typically buy in stores.</li>
            <li> A half hour an hour a stick.</li>
            <li> When I finished the previous set, I decided to buy this one, hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy them as often.</li>
            <li> I could tell you which ones I loved and hated and tell you this sucks</li>
            <li> All incense I have tried, including this one, carries a slight chemical smell that I wish I could get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Be forewarned, there are certain fragrances that are only subtly different from others, so if you&#x27;re looking for a sampler 12 completely different scents you may be disappointed, otherwise, speaking in terms of quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Shrinivas Sugandhalaya.  </li>
            <li> zero mess...</li>
            <li> They do make a mess when you&#x27;re getting them out of the bags so be warned.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more to say other than you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this particular variety.  </li>
            <li> I keep them air tight.</li>
            <li> Very little smell, maybe old stock or poor production.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar with patchouli scents</li>
            <li> : I just lit Sunrise for a little morning relaxation before work</li>
            <li> You see, once it is lit it just burns a little and then goes out.  </li>
            <li> I paid a little over $1 each for the boxes in this sampler.  </li>
            <li> A little dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Attempting to burn what was not crumbled - just made smoke, little essence.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of incense a few months backs</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m impatient.  </li>
            <li> After trying a few cheaper brands, some of which smelled like burnt hair, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t like tons of smoke or heavy</li>
            <li> It has my favorites, plus a few I have never tried before, i.e. Fortune, Blessings and Patchouli Forest.</li>
            <li> gave a few away</li>
            <li> With 12 boxes, I kept a few and gave a lot of boxes away to my friends.  </li>
            <li> I can burn a stick and if it is too heavy i can switch to another without getting over bearing.</li>
            <li> burn times, and not too messy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t old and stale.</li>
            <li> A few of them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t enjoy it but didn&#x27;t hate</li>
            <li> And I made a big mistake - the quality of these is worse than the Set of 6 boxes.</li>
            <li> Not knowing what all 12 would smell like, I&#x27;ve found that quite a few are somewhat pungent.</li>
            <li> Lots of it, but many of the fragrances are very sickly.</li>
            <li> The scent is tailored to an older age group or to people who like artificial perfume smelling incense (though everyone I&#x27;ve met hates the scent)</li>
            <li> Had some issues with my place smelling like cats from the previous owners and started a few of these in the room that stinks and the smell is completely gone now.</li>
            <li> Too bad - all the others I have purchased were much higher quality than this variety package.</li>
            <li> I threw mine away because it was stinking up my whole house when I wasn&#x27;t using them and the smells were blended together which made it unpleasant</li>
            <li> I was excited to try other offerings from a brand I&#x27;ve come to trust, but I was severely disappointed!</li>
            <li> This particular brand of incense is unpleasant, to me.  </li>
            <li> and I love aromas and incense but found these to all smell terrible.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure even then.</li>
            <li> I usually burn two at once in my apartment</li>
            <li> using them they are too small thought should burn longer</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t recommend to be in a medium or small room with it alone</li>
            <li> One drawback seems to be an abundance of incense powder in each pouch, I&#x27;m not sure if this is intentional or an accident/broken up incense</li>
            <li> I just mixed them all up to pick randomly from them.</li>
            <li> I can usually buy incense for $1 per box, and the boxes usually contain from 20 to 40 sticks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually paying $7 bucks for one box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below is a small breakdown of my experience with each scent:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The odor was awful and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The poor quality is overwhelming and even sickening.</li>
            <li> Usually when i read negative ratings even one or two im cautious about buying</li>
            <li> When the fire is extinguished though, the black trail is gone and they let off the artificial perfume-like fragrant smoke as expected.</li>
            <li> LOT&#x27;s of variety, hard to find a fragrance you wouldn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Patchouli Forest doesnt smell of Patchouli, at least not to me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s got this weird peppery smell</li>
            <li> You could burn one, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I like to cover the smell of wet dog when it&#x27;s raining.</li>
            <li> You can at least get to sample the majority of the Satya lineup.</li>
            <li> If you like inscents you&#x27;ve gotta try these, at least once.</li>
            <li> For people giving negative comments on smells etc, dont know the history of incense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked incense.</li>
            <li> They burn slowly too.</li>
            <li> Burns really slow  </li>
            <li> They burn slowly.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t found one that I hate yet</li>
            <li> Some of the new scents included in this 12 pack have disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I mean you&#x27;re not going to smell it and go &amp;</li>
            <li> I just mean it&#x27;s not as penetrating...</li>
            <li> I hate to give these 1 star, as I had high hopes for these incense sticks based on reviews.</li>
            <li> seriously...</li>
            <li> They smell fake, overly perfumed and were quite messy.  </li>
            <li> Buyer beware, not a good item.</li>
            <li> Not good at all..  </li>
            <li> Half smell like bad perfume but there a few I would reorder.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try these and definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have burned about 6 different kinds and not one has disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li> They burn slowly and the calming scent fills my house!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all bad, but there&#x27;s too much unpleasant filler in this large sample pack...</li>
            <li> These stick burn very slowly as well.</li>
            <li> but I have not experienced any with my order.</li>
            <li> :c but other than that, I L O V E</li>
            <li> all only 1 I hated so its still a 5 star product to</li>
            <li> I received the wrong scent</li>
            <li> Some smells are quite fake like &amp;#34;midnight&amp;#34;... weird smell.</li>
            <li> I have had mediocre smelling ones but they lasted for about 30 min.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong when you buy Satya Sai Baba incense.</li>
            <li> ill never want to leave the room</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...</li>
            <li> Smells like nag champa with faint floral background.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorites are &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Blessings&amp;#34;, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.</li>
            <li> They smell fake and artificial, plus are so overpowering (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what was so disagreeable about them, but they were sickening.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately to me half of these are unbearable, they smell terrible.</li>
            <li> The Fortune and Blessings were terrible, these are the two a previous reviewer described as cat-pee.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s half the cost and gives you a headache from horrible ingredients.</li>
            <li> They did not smell of artificial chemicals or anything mainstream.</li>
            <li> That stuff stinks to no end.</li>
            <li> sandalwood without something else or artificial, just sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> The fragrances in this set were all unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> some of the scents are a bit too flowery for me, so i use them outside on my balcony to cover up my disgusting neighbor&#x27;s disgusting cigarette</li>
            <li> Not too bad once you burn it.</li>
            <li> Bad, smelly soap.</li>
            <li> about two out of all of them are intolerable and are so bad.</li>
            <li> but I must say I like them all, there really isn&#x27;t a bad one.</li>
            <li> Others are musty and funky, some tolerable, and some just funky in a bad way.  </li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> like the scent things that are used in urinals to cover up bad smells.  </li>
            <li> , the junk is THAT bad</li>
            <li> premiere promotional item  which I was hoping to uncover with this box. :(</li>
            <li> Never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> , hate it or both....</li>
            <li> Hated these</li>
            <li> I HATED was Romance.</li>
            <li> Some of the twelve smelled just awful Blessings, jasmine blossom ans fortune smelled straight.out of a.portapotty.</li>
            <li> Some of the scent smell terrible.</li>
            <li> simply awful!!!  </li>
            <li> These had a horrible smell to them.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> aside from the nag champa in this set, they smell awful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are great if you&#x27;re looking for a variety of scents. Lots of different nice scents at a reasonable price. I also like how these sticks last a long time!</li>
            <li> Great smelling stuff and so many scents to choose from ! ! !</li>
            <li> These are decent there was a few I didn&#x27;t care for on the smell but they burn fine and I would buy again shipping was fast also</li>
            <li> Hated these and I love aromas and incense but found these to all smell terrible. Couldn&#x27;t use them.  They smell fake, overly perfumed and were quite messy.  Attempted to ship back but the label wouldn&#x27;t print and I threw them in the trash.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> first time i have seen a variety pack, love all the different choices.</li>
            <li> Complete order, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Some of these smell delicious, some are awful. I guess it&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference. Also, some of the sticks burn up very quickly and put up a lot of black smoke.</li>
            <li> Love it and will be back!</li>
            <li> These, are not the best. Some smell okay but all really do smell alike, and some just smell like a soap bar! And it&#x27;s really strong! But the burn every well!</li>
            <li> Great product long lasting burn time</li>
            <li> Nice variety of scents. Love how they make my house smell. A very good buy.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong scent</li>
            <li> What I expected does the job !</li>
            <li> I love incense and burn it frequently. This is an amazing set, very affordable, really adds to the environment and nice touches to the room, all the smells are lovely and aromatic!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these. A great variety of choices. The cost is good for all these. I&#x27;ve purchased this set 3 or 4 times. On my 4th set. Better than aerosol spray to freshen up a room and the sent last longer as well.</li>
            <li> I just love these incense! Great product and price!</li>
            <li> Each of the scents are as perfect and unique as the original Nag Champa.  Sandalwood, Fortune, and Patchouli Forest are my favorites.  If you wonder where the manufacturers name comes from, go to Wikipedia and search for Satya Sai Baba.  You might find yourself in awe.</li>
            <li> This is twelve full size boxes.  I am good on incense for several months.  A wonderful deal!</li>
            <li> Each of the ones I&#x27;ve used so far smell great!</li>
            <li> This brand of incense is the best one I&#x27;ve found. I love the Nag Champa and Sandalwood. I have a large, open house and all of the scents work well in my home. I&#x27;ll be buying this set again. I have used Nag Champa for years.</li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW I am so happy and grateful to find this. also the price is affordable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed. There isn&#x27;t a single incense I don&#x27;t like out of this pack. My dad goes to India frequently and brings back incense, and last time he gave me a sandalwood incense that was really nice. However, I think Satya&#x27;s sandalwood is even better! I tend to like stronger scents (I know many people are the opposite) and other scents from this pack that are among my favorites are romance and jasmine blossom. I very much expect that I shall be purchasing bigger orders of at least their sandalwood and romance incenses individually in the future (as well as trying others!)</li>
            <li> As a result of buying this sampler i now have 5 or 6 favorites to re-up every year. Superhit is incredible</li>
            <li> All that variety for a really good price. So wonderful and relaxing. Two thumbs up and six stars if I could rate it like that! :)</li>
            <li> 10/12 smell really good. I like those odds.</li>
            <li> LOVE HAPPINESS AND RAD SCENTS FOR RAD DAYS THIS IS A GREAT COMBO PACK THAT WILL AD SOME ZEST TO YOUR DAY ENJOY #simple</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these! Each smell I&#x27;ve used so far has been wonderful, and I can&#x27;t wait to try the rest! My favorite so far is Romance</li>
            <li> Great variety selection. The flavors are not overwhelmingly strong but leave a lasting exotic scent for quite some time after a burn. The set with each individual flavor comes plastic wrapped inside a box for each flavor and comes in a master box called Fortune.  I will purchase again.  Fine product for those who love exotic incense. The flavors all have distinctive notes and don&#x27;t all smell the same. Burn times are fair.. perhaps 20 minutes.  For an incense burner I drill out any wine bottle three holes spaced near the bottom (for air intake)using a glass drill bit (easy) and then merely suspend the incense stick down the neck of the bottle (holding with a paperclip or just bending the stick stem).  Works perfectly.. zero mess... no ash anywhere. Lots of smoke (chimney effect).</li>
            <li> pleased with the overall Promptness of delivery and packaging. Unfortunately to me half of these are unbearable, they smell terrible. Romance, fortune, blessings, rain forest and Jasmine blossom I couldn&#x27;t even give away. I suggest the variety bundle that contains Tibetan Tantra Ayurveda Ritual Devotion Aastha etc. Far better scents.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best incense I have EVER purchased.  The scent is strong (not overpowering).  It lingers for hours.  I have been looking for something like this for awhile.  Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> lots of variety- a bit smokey when burnt</li>
            <li> perfect mood setter &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. They smell like dollar store incense. They all smell like burning wood, no real hint of perfume or anything. Save your money! By something a little more higher-quality</li>
            <li> Smell great and what a selection!</li>
            <li> Love the variety!  Enjoy most scents!  Great deal</li>
            <li> It was great to sample the different scents, but i should have stayed with the basic Agarbatti. Half smell like bad perfume but there a few I would reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving the product 2 stars because of the blessings and romance scents. Most of the scents having the same urinal like odor. I purchased this brand once before and loved every stick.Something has definitely changed!!</li>
            <li> Great to test out all of the scents!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tried the patchouli and romance. They are long burning and smell wonderful. Some incense smells cheap and thin. These smell distinct and rich. Romance has a clean rose-like scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> These are some of the best smelling incense sticks I have every used! Sometimes incense sticks smell very well straight out of the box, but when burned they don&#x27;t smell quite as well, but these smell wonderful, burn for a long time, and the scent lingers in the air even after it is finished burning. All the scents smell very good, but nag champa is always my favorite. A wonderful buy and great selection from a great company.</li>
            <li> Amazingly low price, lasts for 2-3 months. Just order it.</li>
            <li> I love having a nice variety of incense from which to choose. The majority of the scents produce little smoke when starting, but a couple do. Might want to watch those closely to avoid soot on your furniture.</li>
            <li> I hate to give these 1 star, as I had high hopes for these incense sticks based on reviews. But being an avid and experienced user of incense, these are very very low quality compared to the hundreds of others I&#x27;ve used. The scent is tailored to an older age group or to people who like artificial perfume smelling incense (though everyone I&#x27;ve met hates the scent) so I&#x27;m not sure even then. These also let off a black trail of carbon when on fire, that smells strongly of chemicals and nastiness. When the fire is extinguished though, the black trail is gone and they let off the artificial perfume-like fragrant smoke as expected. You&#x27;ll notice what I&#x27;m talking about if you buy these.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of incense a few months backs and I was more than pleased with the quality of the products I received.  Some fragrances were of the &amp;#34;dipped&amp;#34; incense stick variety, while others were of the hand-rolled variety (think of classic blue box nag champa and you&#x27;ll understand what I mean.)  Either way, the perfumes and ingredients used smell great and the scent after burning a stick can linger for days.  Be forewarned, there are certain fragrances that are only subtly different from others, so if you&#x27;re looking for a sampler 12 completely different scents you may be disappointed, otherwise, speaking in terms of quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong with Shrinivas Sugandhalaya.  This is a good introduction to the other incense Shrinivas Sugandhalaya has to offer and anyone who enjoys blue box Nag Champa will be sure to love it.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. The scents are so beautiful. My favorite is Romance, it is not floral but has a strong spiced scent. I live in New York City and usually buy incense from local Indian stores. This product is cheaper and I get to try all sample scents. I been buying this product for 2 years.</li>
            <li> This set is a great way for someone who is new to burning incense to see if this is a way to enjoy fragrance, and to sample different scents. But for someone who burns incense every day, it wasn&#x27;t a good choice.  This is higher quality incense - good place to start.</li>
            <li> there is actually about twelve sticks per box. Blessing,.fortune, and romance are not appreciated. The rest are good. Rain forest is amazing. Good luck</li>
            <li> There are roughly 120 of these, I haven&#x27;t exactly counted, they range in scents, most of which are not really scents, but names that look cool, they still do burn for about an hour each, and give off a good amount of scent.</li>
            <li> I have used many of the different scents by now.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed them all and haven&#x27;t had any that are too strong.  This is a great variety pack!</li>
            <li> Awesome deal! I got more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very little smell, maybe old stock or poor production.</li>
            <li> Great selection for the price</li>
            <li> Wonderful selection. Quick delivery. Nag champa is always the best. If you use incense you have to use these. Enjoy</li>
            <li> Eh, I must have to get used to it. The outside of the box smelled of moth-balls. Not too bad once you burn it. Only have burnt patchouli forest and sandalwood. Patchouli Forest doesnt smell of Patchouli, at least not to me. But it was pleasant. Daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa and Super Hit incense, so this assortment was an affordable way to try other fragrances. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I gave it A  gift.  I do not know how well she liked it yet.  I just gave it to her for christmas.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a couple of the scents I really do not like, but that still leaves 9-10 scents that I absolutely DO love. They burn nice and even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying all these different kinds of incense and so far the Super Hit and Romance are two that I like. Being able to sample so many kinds is a plus, and all are great quality for burning slow and providing a good scent without too much smoke. I will buy again, at least the ones that I like the most.</li>
            <li> Very good quality inscense sticks</li>
            <li> I love love love this set so much! I&#x27;ve used up 3 packages so far. Love the scents and they last long. Kudos!</li>
            <li> Why of course I want to spend $15 for twelve boxes instead of $3-4 PER tiny box at a head shop! I am a loyal nag champa person so this is a must in the household, just wish I could subscribe and save to these!</li>
            <li> I love the variety of incense. This is the best brand an there are some kinds I hadn&#x27;t tried before. Great way to package too.</li>
            <li> Some of these seemed to be rushed to dry. A couple boxes the bags of incense sticks have a collection of powder in the bottom of them. Still plenty left on the incense itself but it may be a sign they can&#x27;t keep up with the orders and rush out product that isn&#x27;t ready yet.</li>
            <li> Great scents ! Fast on time delivery will order again.</li>
            <li> The majority of these smell like soap.  Bad, smelly soap.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, not a good item. I bought and the smoke discolored a white ledge and permanently damaged furniture. I have used incense sticks for decades and have never seen anything like this. At first I thought it was oily around the actual burner, but when I attempted to clean, noticed under incense holder, it was fine, but where smoke touched table and white ledge, it took off wood finish and discolored the white to beige. Makes you wonder what it put into my air. Returning and would give 0 stars if could. This should be removed.</li>
            <li> I just love these incenses, they smell fabulous! I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled upon&#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Loved the smells, excellent for offerings, relaxation. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome and well made product. Supplier company was outstandingly prompted.</li>
            <li> These come packed inside another incense box, so don&#x27;t freak out when you receive what looks like something other than what you ordered. Good assortment. Haven&#x27;t tried them all, but like about half of the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very good! Exactly what I was looking for. I love Nag Champa &amp; the price was very reasonable. Very good!</li>
            <li> seems like all of them smell the same, smells like soap more than anything else. if your looking for quality this is not the right product</li>
            <li> Most of the boxes smell very similar, its not the biggest deal because they do smell quite good. The super hit scent is the only one the is unique and also happens to be the best smelling in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the scents, super hit, and the original nag champa have been my favorites</li>
            <li> Not want I was looking for but there okay.</li>
            <li> love these scents mostly the Sandlewood and original Nag champa but they are all wonderful and fill up the entire room, great for having quiet times and just meditating :)</li>
            <li> Great buy, love this brand!</li>
            <li> Great variety pack. All the different smell for all the different parts of your day!</li>
            <li> How about a review you can actually use?  lol - sorry...I guess I&#x27;m impatient.  Okay, this is just my&#x27; opinion.. there&#x27;s a divide in quality,  the &amp;#34;better ones&amp;#34; being --- sandalwood, celestial, sunrise, super hit, nag champa, midnight, and patchouli forest -- these 7 have a similar powdery smell and feel &amp;#34;the stick has a velvety deer antler feel whereas the remaining other are more dry and compressed&amp;#34;  So those first seven are closer to the quality of nag champa whereas the remaining others....almost smell as though they were made by a different manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which ones suck?  To my&#x27; nose it would be jasmine blossom... it smells like... kinda like a burning flowery urinal cake... seriously... you know?  That desperately cheap sting-y perfumey smell?... smell a mothball for example.. kinda like that but of a flower...that isn&#x27;t any kind of jasmine I&#x27;ve ever smelled..  Not good at all..  And i&#x27;m not necessarily picky... I&#x27;ll burn it, sure and give it a place in my&#x27; collection but by no means is it something i&#x27;ll ever order on it&#x27;s own..  The rainforest one was surprisingly wonderful to me, it does NOT smell like a satya scent at all though &amp;#34;in case you care about that&amp;#34; it literally smells like a cool rain of some kind... Very much a scent that stands out on it&#x27;s own in this variety pack.  Blessings you&#x27;ll either like it, hate it or both.... it&#x27;s got this weird peppery smell but it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a very different smell and stands out in that way... I don&#x27;t LOVE it...but I like it?....does that make sense?  Like, I&#x27;ll have it in my&#x27; collection because it&#x27;s unique not neccessarily because it&#x27;s awesome.  More specifically it does indeed &amp;#34;like the color of the box&amp;#34; have a &amp;#34;YELLOW&amp;#34; color/smell to it...  So again, it has its place in my&#x27; collection as it&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;yellow smelling&amp;#34; fragrance I have...  Fortune smells minty, the only one in this variety pack that has that smell....unique enough to keep inthe collection, I remember liking it for sure.  Didn&#x27;t give it long enough a burn to determine.  Romance was pretty good, imagine what the color pink smells like to you, does it smell like cotton candy? Strawberries?...this one has that personality but not in a perfect, indesputable sort of way.  I mean you&#x27;re not going to smell it and go &amp;#34;oh hey! it smells like cottencandy and strawberries&amp;#34; lol....because it doesn&#x27;t... just....it has that vibe, that energy I guess... --- Sandalwood.....honestly it&#x27;s my&#x27; favorite in this variety pack...of all the satya...but i&#x27;m not going to sit here and tell you it&#x27;s THE best one....you decide that for yourselves... most prefer nag champa over everything I&#x27;ve come to notice... but I like the sandalwood because &amp;#34;if the batch is fresh, genuine or whatever&amp;#34; it has this warm toasty, simple, pure, somewhat uncomplicated &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; personality.... it&#x27;s not stinging your nostrils with a sharp flowery smell, it&#x27;s...kind of a warm reassuring hug...a soft one...  I&#x27;ve smelled sticks of this though that were more akin to a damp campfire ... so... just hope you get a good or authentic batch I guess...  Sandalwood to me, done right.... it smells warm woodsy and sweet...  I meditate with this one ...  To some people a sandalwood doesn&#x27;t smell like this, they&#x27;re probably not expecting any sort of flowery notes/sweetness.... dunno...  but I dig this one.  -  Midnight is great, alot of witches burn it to the morgan, my&#x27; initial impression is it had a masculine men&#x27;s cologne smell to it? but that could just be projection lol.  Still though it&#x27;s a sensual kind of &amp;#34;sexy?&amp;#34; smell?...Patchouli forest is good I&#x27;m not familiar with patchouli scents but I dig this!  Sunrise is flowery...most reviews of it are pretty accurate...it&#x27;s a good smell though, has very much a feminine flowery type quality to it... Celestial is harder for me to pin down, like sunrise it&#x27;s flowery but not as peircing?  LOL not a pleasant sounding word to use in describing a fragrance.  I just mean it&#x27;s not as penetrating... this one you&#x27;ll have to burn and A/B compare.  --- Everyone knows what nag and superhit smells like so I won&#x27;t go there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so, my&#x27; conclusion is this: You get about 15 grams per little box, you get 12 of those boxes which total up to around 180 grams,  If most of these scents are new and you can accept possibly not liking a few.... this is an affordable chance to try them and pick the ones you DO like! -- If you&#x27;re on a real budget and just want consistent good, a low tolerance for risk you might try the variety pack of 6.. those are the scents which are closer to nag champa...since everyone seems to love it the most.  You&#x27;ll find it here on amazon,  comes with the afore mentioned first 7 fragrances... but only comes with six.... you have to either choose to get the pack that includes midnight or super hit... OR you could just buy a big thing of super hit... I like it! lol...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun.</li>
            <li> Smells great---good variety of sents</li>
            <li> This is the best pack of incense I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I don&#x27;t dislike a single fragrance, I just have favorites. The smell lingers long after they are done buring. I usually burn two at once in my apartment and it&#x27;s enough to fill 1000 sq ft. You could burn one, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I like to cover the smell of wet dog when it&#x27;s raining.</li>
            <li> This is nice incense.  The ends of the sticks are think, so may lean in some incense holders. Variety of fragances:  Sunrise, Midnight, Patchouli, Sandalwood.  My favorite so far is the Sandalwood</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the way these products smell in general or if the products are all packaged beside each other for too long of time, but they all smell about the same to me. They smell like what a hippie&#x27;s nursing home would smell like lol. I love Nag Champa and even that scent was off. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my local smoke shops next time.</li>
            <li> The fragrances in this set were all unpleasant to me. I&#x27;m not sure what was so disagreeable about them, but they were sickening.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered these boxes of incense. They are an excellent set for the money. The scents are pleasant and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say about these. A great way to try new scents without having to pay for each individually. Ultimately it&#x27;s the price and convenience that earned these a five star rating.</li>
            <li> House stink? Cat odors? Other odors you need to kill out? These will do the trick. Each offers their own little twist on a great smell that last!</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Nag Champa customer for decades and this company (Satya) is probably the best there is so I decided to take a risk and try some of their other fragrances.  All but two of them were so revolting/disgusting, I had to extinguish them after two minutes or less.  The only one that was tolerable is the sandalwood.  If you love Nag Champa as much as I do, chances are, you too, may be sickened by these other fragrances.</li>
            <li> All pretty great. Wish there was less garbage from all of the individual boxes. Some smells are quite fake like &amp;#34;midnight&amp;#34;... weird smell.</li>
            <li> A GREAT value on a product I frequently buy at a brick-and-mortar store. Buying this box is about a third of the price of the retail store.</li>
            <li> Lots of it, but many of the fragrances are very sickly.</li>
            <li> I did not like 1 of these but the rest were a beautiful natural aroma. They did not smell of artificial chemicals or anything mainstream. They each had their own sweet and unique aroma to be enjoyed not going to buy any other brands no time soon either : ) Thanks  Update may 22, 2014 stilling I purchase these every month.</li>
            <li> About the best deal for Indian Incense I have found. Lots of variety included. My neighbors like it as well, and I have to keep ordering for them too.</li>
            <li> Some of them smell good like sandlewood but the nag champa smells like somebody was smoking in the house, GROSS!</li>
            <li> The incense are awesome and thank you for your auction of them. The &amp;#34;Satya&amp;#34; kind are harder to find. Thank you again for your auction.</li>
            <li> Extremely high quality, not like the sickeningly sweet American &#x27;incenses, one would find at &#x27;snoke shops&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful collection of scents and is high quality incense.  The scents are true - they do not smell like &amp;#34;scorch&amp;#34; like some cheap incenses do.  These smell like you are in a temple.  Perfect.  I will probably stick with these for my future incense purchases.</li>
            <li> I order this as a gift for my father every Christmas and he loves it - it is a year long supply if you like to burn incense regularly. All of the scents are lovely.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet but love the ones I have</li>
            <li> I am very pleased. My hubby is a practicing Buddhist and was pleasantly surprised with the purchase as he now has a plethora of incense to choose from for his evening prayers. Love it. It was delivered on time, no hassles or hitches.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful assortment of smells! Whether it is burned or not, the incense adds a suble yet distinct change to the common household odors but,does not bother my sinuses like cheaper brands. I prefer Nag Champa to all others!</li>
            <li> Awesome set of scents which has lasted me a long time. Some scents light more easily than others (seems like some are coated with an oil that makes them burn better), but all light and burn well.</li>
            <li> They all smell good..kinda burn fast though..</li>
            <li> Love the scents, perfect for a beginner to see what I like and don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance! They last long! 100% recomended</li>
            <li> This incense set is great! You get a gross of incense sticks for less than $11, and Nag Champa is a well-known and well-liked brand. They all smell great and burn long and strong. Best incense value I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Burns fast very strong... For $15 its worth trying 12 different scents. Burned two one at a time today and it filled the entire place (one bedroom apartment) with very strong aroma.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the smells leak out of the box when you&#x27;re not using them. I threw mine away because it was stinking up my whole house when I wasn&#x27;t using them and the smells were blended together which made it unpleasant</li>
            <li> It smells so good but lasts only like 10 min. I have had mediocre smelling ones but they lasted for about 30 min. But i still love them!</li>
            <li> This collection is by far the best I have ever purchased. I&#x27;m quite the connoisseur of all things incense and have been purchasing since I was a young teenager. Given that, I have been through quite the range of companies and smells. I do believe you will enjoy this collection as much as I have. Each scent is discernible from the last and each offer their own &amp;#34;character&amp;#34; when lit. I&#x27;m enjoying them so much, I haven&#x27;t even been able to open them fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;This price will beat any that you will find at some local store, so pick one up today and I guarantee you&#x27;ll be back for more! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love them all burn them every day!! Will be buying more!!</li>
            <li> The wife loves them. Lots of variety.</li>
            <li> a very good deal, and all the best scents</li>
            <li> I got these because of what someone else said in their review and boy they were right. I love just about all of them.</li>
            <li> I love this set! A lot of these I have never tried before so I am glad I got to sample them all. They smell great and shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> I was paying almost $3 per box at the mall...and found this set for so much cheaper here...so now I buy them in bulk....the smell is amazing...much better than the cheap $1 stuff....the coffin is a wonderful idea to keep from making a mess!</li>
            <li> These all smell excellent. After trying a few cheaper brands, some of which smelled like burnt hair, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> First off I am a huge fan of Nag Champa by Satya Sai Baba. I&#x27;ve bought it for years and know its slightly crumbly. I will go through each scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain forest - clear plastic - Citrus Ajax soap - tightly rolled (,not crumbly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celestial - opaque plastic - Baby Powder - crumbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine Blossom - clear plastic - Strong floral scent - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli forest - opaque plastic - Patchouli and Nag Champa - crumbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nag Champa - opaque plastic - Nag Champa - crumbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight - opaque - dark and earthy - crumbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood - clear - sandalwood and spice - crumbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance - clear - cheap hotel soap - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessing - clear - light lemon - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortune - clear - minty - tight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise - opaque - cedar and Nag - crumbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superhit - opaque - fruity bubble gum - crumbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only scent I HATED was Romance. That stuff stinks to no end. It smells exactly like those cheap white bars of hotel soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else ranged from OK to fantastic. The original Nag Champa is still my favorite but the other scents arnt bad. Next time I think I am just going to order the 6 pack as the ones I really like are all in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m throwing away the Romance after I am done with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all only 1 I hated so its still a 5 star product to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like tons of smoke or heavy smells Satya Sai Baba isn&#x27;t for you. Try a Japanese incense instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this many times.  Love it every time.</li>
            <li> Love this set. I was new to incense and didn&#x27;t know what I would like. I ended up throwing some away that I totally hated, but I found the ones that I love!</li>
            <li> Great way to sample lots of scents.  Nag Champa is a favorite but I had not seen/experienced some of these before.  Will definitely reorder when I need more!</li>
            <li> Good value! Must admit, Nag Champa and Super Hit are the only ones I would buy again, the others too perfumy.</li>
            <li> Some are good, some not that much... :(</li>
            <li> Great price . Very pleased !</li>
            <li> I love the variety!!!!!! :)  some smells are too strong for my taste, but the lighter ones like &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Sunrise&amp;#34; are my favorites! All of the smells are good. Great Buy :D</li>
            <li> You almost get too much product.  I have been using only a couple of the boxes in the past months, I can&#x27;t believe how many boxes you get.  Even the box makes my studio smell good without lighting it.</li>
            <li> For the price being cheap, this is not a bad buy. It gets the job done and the scents are awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this style of incense. All the non-Indian brands I have tried stink like herbal essence shampoo. These are more earthy and pleasant. The variety is also nice. I have bought this mix a number of times.</li>
            <li> All the smells are amazing.  The Jasmine blossom I found to be over powering but I love having a large variety to fit my moods or change the atmosphere before a party.  Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa so was.excited about.the varieties. Some of the twelve smelled just awful Blessings, jasmine blossom ans fortune smelled straight.out of a.portapotty. Clean portapotty but you still knew where you were.  Others where a wonderful surprise patchouli forest and sandalwood were two. Actually the rest of them were extremely pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the speed of delivery.  I was also very impressed with the selection of scents.  Some of the scents were heavenly but some of them were headache inducing.  All in all well worth the purchase, if for no other reason than to discover your personal favorites.</li>
            <li> these smell so awesome! they are potent and smell amazing. i will order again. i even burn them in the car with the air circulating and my car smells amazing (do not do while driving!)</li>
            <li> I LOVE Nag Champa so much I was very excited to get the entire collection.  Unfortunately the creative spicy mixture of Nag Champa is no where to be found in most of the rest of the set.  I ran through the Nag Champa, Super Hit and Sandalwood pretty quickly.  I am currently forcing myself to use the other boxes as most of it reminds me of a mix of dimestore incense and old lady perfume.  If you like smokey florals you will love it.  I am just personally not a fan.  I was disappointed in most of them but, again Nag Champa, Super Hit and Sandalwood ROCK!  Making it seem well worth the extremely reasonably priced purchase.</li>
            <li> great quality and smell the product came sooner then excepted</li>
            <li> This pack is great, I love burning incense and the selection is amazing. There wasn&#x27;t a smell I disliked but there were a few that I liked more than others, the rain scent was by far one of my favorites! They made my house smell sweet and clean and burned slowly, def would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like burning incense, it&#x27;s kind of a ritual for me to burn some while I meditate and get started working. So finding a huge box of affordable incense was an incredible deal. Crossed my fingers and hoped they&#x27;d smell good, I bought them and have worked my way through the entire box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the 12 different boxes of incense, I&#x27;ve enjoyed all but two. TWO! And those two that I didn&#x27;t really care for, it&#x27;s because they smelled like Dove Soap and that&#x27;s not really a scent I enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a nice variety of scents, each stick is about 10 inches long, and they burn slower than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I enjoyed these and I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Good set of a variety of incense scents.  When the box arrives you can smell it before you even open it, great value for the price cant beat it. this set usually lasts us about 5-6 months and we burn incense on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of regular Nag Champa, but most of these smell like an old women&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> I love all the scents in this package and they are all portionally sized. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is perfect. I was able to sample all the different smells. They all smell great. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great deal... Bought Tibetan incense burner also. 8^)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item before and loved it, so I ordered again. This time a completely different item arrived and Amazon is givingme a hard time about returning it. Order at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I love incense. This is a good product for a great price.  They seem to burn faster then others. But for the price they are worth it.</li>
            <li> I love all the choices. I use a different scent every other day. I just love incense.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this varity box.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, packaged nicely, good price.  Very happy. Ty. :)</li>
            <li> Great selection for the price!! They&#x27;re burning well and smlee fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected! Shipping was extremely fast!  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love ordering this big 12 pack of incense.  It&#x27;s a great deal, and I love how there is a big variety of scents included.</li>
            <li> Excellent incense product, as always with Nag Champa.  They remain a favorite whether purchased at the local Indo-Pak grocery store or on-line, you really can&#x27;t go wrong if you enjoy incense</li>
            <li> Got here early snd has the full variety. The sticks are well made and smell extraordinary. Some bags are slightly more difficult to stretch and tear open.</li>
            <li> Such a goodbye I get to try all the types of sense I used to spend six dollars for one box with a few last-minute this is such a deal I have I could change the sense in my house all the time great</li>
            <li> Awesome assortment. Great price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> To my taste this is a very good combination of scents. Well made, and presented.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The selection of fragrances is why I ordered this set of incense. It has my favorites, plus a few I have never tried before, i.e. Fortune, Blessings and Patchouli Forest. This a great set to give as a gift or to try out if new to the use of incense.</li>
            <li> So nice to get an assortment. They smell wonderful and burn evenly.</li>
            <li> Had some issues with my place smelling like cats from the previous owners and started a few of these in the room that stinks and the smell is completely gone now. It also smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a few away and they buy from Amazon now :-)</li>
            <li> I ordered the six pack last time. It included Nag Champa, Sandalwood, Celestial, Patchouli Forest, Super Hit, and Sunrise. I loved it...and likely burned through it all way too quickly because I thought all the scents were so great and soothing! To make it last longer this time around, I went with the twelve pack...from now on, I&#x27;ll stick with the six pack for sure. Some of the new scents included in this 12 pack have disappointed me. Rainforest smells like soap. Romance smells like some sort of cheap, store-bought fragrance. Midnight was alright. I haven&#x27;t made my way through the other ones yet, but I have a feeling they&#x27;ll be similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Nag Champa&#x27;s incense, so I encourage you all to keep buying it...just trust me and go with the six pack! Those extra fragrances are not worth it.</li>
            <li> So strong!!! You get what you pay for. Some of the scent smell terrible.</li>
            <li> I WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT THIS ITEM WASN&#x27;T SO CHEAP LOOKING AND CHEAP SMELLING. I WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN EVER.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is consistently a great product. Their Sandalwood is especially nice, even better than the patchouli, which is usually my favorite. Great price, prompt service.</li>
            <li> I received this item quickly from Tom&#x27;s Incense.  The 12 boxes were plastic wrapped together, with the individual boxes dated 2011 (one was 2012). I was hoping for fresher.&lt;br /&gt;About 12-13 sticks in each box.&lt;br /&gt;The Sandalwood was moldy and decaying and I immediately threw it away.  The Fortune and Blessings were terrible, these are the two a previous reviewer described as cat-pee.  I think it is a lemon-base that makes them smell like ammonia.&lt;br /&gt;Romance smelled like a bathroom after a woman had just taken a shower.  Baby powder and soap. Not for me.&lt;br /&gt;So I threw those 4 boxes away.&lt;br /&gt;The rest were good to great, with Nag Champa and Superhit being the best.&lt;br /&gt;The Jasmine Blossom is very strong and has an undertone of fermenting or vinegar, but I still like it.&lt;br /&gt;Your tastes may vary.  :-)</li>
            <li> I would say that about 8 of these are good enough to use regularly. 4 I love (superhit, Romance, nag champa, midnight) My least favorite being blessings. Would recommend this set to anyone who is interested in incense but don&#x27;t know quite what they like. You can at least get to sample the majority of the Satya lineup. Great buy fast shipping and they smell great. Enjoy &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> The sticks seem dry. After lighting them, they go out often. They don&#x27;t have much fragrance in them. I keep them air tight. I have had much better.</li>
            <li> This Insense package is great if you&#x27;re looking for quality and variety...To be honest though, none of these really smells great besides normal Nag Champa and Super Hits. If you haven&#x27;t tried Super Hits, you get two packages in this deal, so that was nice. Would I buy this again? Probably not. I know what my favorite scents are now.</li>
            <li> Great smells. Last awhile. I&#x27;ve purchased these twice now. They do make a mess when you&#x27;re getting them out of the bags so be warned. Nothing a chlorox wipe cleans up though 😃</li>
            <li> Really like fortune, midnight, blessings, superhit, sandalwood, and celestial.</li>
            <li> I really love this set of incense. Each box smells amazing to me and they last twice as long as than the ones I buy from Walmart. I will most likely buy these again.</li>
            <li> Never fond of incense - until a trip to Vietnam brought me closer to the experience.  This is the real thing, and wonderful - a great mix of scents.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great way to try all the Nag Champa varieties to find your favorite!</li>
            <li> While some of the names of the scents leave you guessing as to what they are supposed to imitate, the low price on this large quantity of incense was enough to get me to purchase. I was not disappointed once I had the opportunity to get them all lit.</li>
            <li> This incense is fantastic.  This is another product that I have used for years and I keep coming back.  The assortment pack is great for deciding on a favorite and just for changing up the fragrance.  This incense is a heavier incense than a Japanese incense, which I like as well.  It all depends upon ones mood.  This is a real deal incense...way better than anything that you will get at big box stores or convenience stores.  They are worlds apart.  If you are uncertain about getting the sampler pack I suggest starting with Nag Champa or Super Hit as these are two of their most popular fragrances.  if you like the overall quality of those then explore further with the sampler.  One note:  these are hand rolled incense and are sold by weight.  I read online that there are 15 sticks per box.  This is not correct.  Due to differences in thickness and moisture content the sticks themselves are different weights, therefore the number of sticks per box will vary.  I found in my last purchase that the boxes contained from 11-15 sticks of incense.  Still an excellent value and I highly suggest giving this incense a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Nag Champa anything.  They make really good incense.  This shipment was a bundle of joy &amp; happiness when it arrived, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> They all smell good, some better than others but it&#x27;s fun to have a variety.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa and it&#x27;s usually the only thing I will ever burn. I decided this time around to expand my horizons and try more &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; from the same company. While none of them can hold a candle to Nag Champa, I am not disappointed with this purchase or with any of scents I received. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in sampling more scents from Sai Baba&#x27;s line of incense.</li>
            <li> Great variety of scents!</li>
            <li> Great selection, good quality.</li>
            <li> I have my old burner boxed up and living in my new bedroom, something was missing incense and a perfect burner.  totally recommend this vendor and plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> A great collection for trying out different smells. I like all of them except for Blessings, which smells like an old lady perfume and will linger on for so long that I end up with a headache (already in the trash can).</li>
            <li> nice aroma especially when I cook fish or chiken</li>
            <li> This is my second time i buy this product. And definitely continue buying more. Every time i have guests coming to my house i receive good complements on the aroma.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fairly priced, properly packaged and shipped out on time. And incense is a fair option to my wife&#x27;s love of candles which are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent service!! That is what it is all about! Kudos to this organization for their attention to detail! Most Excellent.</li>
            <li> Love love love how it came in a package of all different scents!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, and great incense!</li>
            <li> Was very happy with the amount and types of fragrances, burn them together and get a very groovy blend that can not be beat.  Such an excellent product.  I will be back to purchase more as soon as this healthy batch is all used up in prayers that linger all day long in a fragrance you will keep enjoying.</li>
            <li> I DIDNT PURCHASE THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> love the variety, and it&#x27;s great quality incense too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and Good quality!</li>
            <li> Even if you only end up liking half of these it&#x27;s still a great deal. I used to use this nag champa regularly and when I ran out, decided to try some that were cheaper. But the scent just doesn&#x27;t last near as long nor is it as developed and rich. I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve decided to go with this brand again and I don&#x27;t see myself going back any time soon.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and pleasant scents.</li>
            <li> about two out of all of them are intolerable and are so bad. but half of them are great and the rest are just ehh. Im sticking with all nag champa</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a wonderful purchase. Perfect sampler pack for people uncertain of what this brand scents smell like. I loved most of the scents, only two (romance &amp; rain forest) smelled VERY soapy, like cheap soap at that...nag champa smells wonderful as it should, the jasmine blossom is my favorite - if you love earthy sweet scents most of these can meet your desires. I know mine have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality incense sticks, they do not leave that &amp;#34;burning wood&amp;#34; smell that low quality incense do, such as the kind purchasable at walmarts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this for anyone new to incense or this particular brand</li>
            <li> This last me about two months.</li>
            <li> Great selection of incense. Most are great, couple smell kinda like soap but overall excellent.</li>
            <li> I like it but the smell is not for everyone</li>
            <li> smell wonderful love them very much better than the ones you can get at the grocery store</li>
            <li> Great smell and price</li>
            <li> Great product, great condition, very punctual.</li>
            <li> Incredibly pure smelling incense</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally set for the next decade..including Birthday and Christmas presents for the family</li>
            <li> With 12 boxes, I kept a few and gave a lot of boxes away to my friends.  Really good quality incense.</li>
            <li> Great assortment for people who are still trying to find their favorite scents! They do burn quickly, though. Definitely worth the amount I paid, though!</li>
            <li> So stoked !!!!!!  😎👍🏽👯</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased this bundle pack because I wanted to experience all different types of scents and this truly does the trick and I love it.  I would highly recomment.</li>
            <li> using them they are too small thought should burn longer</li>
            <li> The perfect incense to order to counteract the cigarette smokers upstairs toxins ( screened porch).</li>
            <li> I love the variety pack. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for, and give me plenty of good smelling options.</li>
            <li> Some of these scents are winners (midnight, for example) and some are not such good winners in my opinion, but I love having the chance to try so many different scents out! Watch out, some of them are pretty crumbly and opening the package will cover your life in pleasantly-scented dust. Maybe be a bit more careful than me and you will not make such a mess!</li>
            <li> a great deal on scents recommend this i was worried about how many sticks would be in each box but once open i was no longer got like 15 or 20 sticks or some thing didn&#x27;t actually count them but was happy that they didn&#x27;t scimp</li>
            <li> Very happy with the deal what a great deal this will last me for a long time if I run out I will order this pack set again</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of incense to buy. Period. I have been burning Nag Champa for years, and was excited to try the other scents offered by the company. There is no need to look further for incense…THIS is the one to buy, people!</li>
            <li> I love the Nag Champ incense. The aroma is out of this world, full bodied and lasts a very long time. I will continue to purchase this product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Tried two different sets.... This is by far my fav. Ordered twice, may keep ordering in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this brand.  Always did Sai Baba Nag Champa, but these other scents are wonderful as well!  Very pleased!  You can&#x27;t go wrong when you buy Satya Sai Baba incense.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is my aromatherapist! Such smooth, natural, concentrated, and lingering scents.</li>
            <li> The best thing about these are they burn for over an hour.  I lit one as soon as I got them, and an hour and 10 m. later it finally went out.  And the aroma...fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great variety for a great price. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Most of the ones i picked up randomly smelled soapy and too artificial or strong for my liking.  It also didn&#x27;t fit in my incense burner which is the black triple dragon one that&#x27;s sold here on amazon.</li>
            <li> as described, incense is very strong smelling , some good, some of the incense smells terrible ,i usually buy  (Sai Baba Nag Champa Incense) which is included, that smells the best . expierment if you will , i would not buy again</li>
            <li> Jasmine smells like an out house</li>
            <li> 5 of the 12 boxes are non natural incenses.  So 7 are GREAT and 5 are s***.</li>
            <li> love the different scents. love this product</li>
            <li> Wonderful scents! I really enjoyed the variety. Also, the insense itself is high quality. There wasn&#x27;t the acrid smoky smell that you get with a lot of the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I love these sticks. The perfumes are relaxing, peacefully, and makes you quite. If you would like to buy some sticks, please buy these.</li>
            <li> smell good in the house</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD DEAL!!!! WILL BUY MORE... I LOVE THESE!!!</li>
            <li> Th ank you.  This pro duct is just what I ne eded.  Ex cellent servic e,  and pac ka ging.</li>
            <li> Really good price or ALOT of incense and some of the best brand name incense as well! It all kind of smell the same except for a few really distinctive one, but overall a very good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> ...and the smell isn&#x27;t that great.  Find a local incense dealer, you&#x27;re better off, as all of the scents are basically the same.</li>
            <li> These burn slowly and offer great scents. I love the idea of one purchase for a variety of scents depending on the mood. I prefer the shorter sticks. Great deal.</li>
            <li> I burn incense every day so being able to change the mood with just a change of a box is simple and neat. The scents are great from Blessings to Patchouli and the exotic Celestial very nice scents for mood setting or meditation time get these!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks is if you don&#x27;t like a scent your stuck with a whole box... But who cares! Toss it. You&#x27;re getting a good deal on getting to try each scent of THE BEST BRAND of incense. Then you can order the 100 pack of your favorites</li>
            <li> so far we really  like these. The scent on most of them are great. The reason I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star is because the Jasmine does not have a great aroma . really. it smells like  human liquid. If you understand what I&#x27;m saying you&#x27;ll understand you don&#x27;t want to burn this anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;but the rest  so far so good I will keep this review up to date. As we burn the rest.</li>
            <li> Great deal on the only incense I burn.  Variety allowed me to try new scents.  Can&#x27;t say I like them all, but that is open to individual preference.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Selection....will be back for more...</li>
            <li> Unbeatable for the price. This set will last me months. Many of the scents smell similar but I like them all and they burn well.</li>
            <li> some are great and some smell like old lady perfume...</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite brand of incense, I&#x27;ve tried many others and the scent is either too strong or they burn out too fast. These are great for mediation, yoga etc. and although you can certainly smell them, the scent is not overwhelming and they burn for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who loves Satya Sai Baba brand incense.  Each pack is sealed in original plastic bags inside of the original packaging and looks exactly as described and pictured.  The incense is fresh and the sticks are in perfect condition, do not flake, and are not crushed.  The variety pack has several traditional favorites and others that are unique and pleasant to smell.  Everything is potent and even after the incense is done burning, the scent lingers!  Fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the variety of incenses, except the Jasmine Blossom, (too strong and overwhelming). I bought it under $ 16.00 so it was a good deal for the price...</li>
            <li> Still some of the best incense I&#x27;ve ever used. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.  Ships fast, and I always get the right order.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of fragrances. You&#x27;ll find your favorite here, (if you are able to decide) you will enjoy all.&lt;br /&gt;Nag Champa has always been great. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> This order arrived quickly, great packaging.  I haven&#x27;t tried all of the fragrances yet, but the ones that have been sampled are very nice. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> LOVE NAG CHAMPA!!! Very pleased with the product and the aromas. Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I was worried because incense can either smell really awesome or just be terrible and so far the scents in this set and WONDERFUL! My favorite would have to be Fortune. I highly recommend this product and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> 12 different scents! They are wonderful. Burn a little quickly, but they are potent.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like any of them.  They all smelled like soap and they were really crumbly, several stripped in shipping.</li>
            <li> I love the variety! Great Selection</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for covering up the smell in the house after I cook fish or meat.  I wish an air freshener spray which has so many attractive scents could do the job but they simply can&#x27;t. Of course after burning one of these incenses my house gets filled with smoke but better than being filled with fish smelling smoke.  Also I found another great use for them.  Their scents are pretty strong so just putting a box in the cleaning supply closet or shoe cabinet makes the whole space smell nice.  I put 4 boxes in my bathroom and it works better than the reed diffuser(-&gt; completely useless!)</li>
            <li> I had previously bought the 6 box set but these smell so great I burn them all almost with a week or two but this is a perfect variety. The scent Romance and sometimes Jasmine blossom I would recommend burning when u definitely plan on being another room but its really strong because they&#x27;re floral but still great just don&#x27;t recommend to be in a medium or small room with it alone (not that you should be in a small or medium room by yourself burning incense no matter what scent, but I&#x27;m just giving an example lol). Awesome selection and I got it very quick.</li>
            <li> Great for those exploring incense! Celestial is my favorate!</li>
            <li> These have a very strong scent. Definitely best used in a larger room. Most scents smelled the same - soapy. I was looking for more variety on scent.</li>
            <li> When we buy this incense we usually buy three boxes at a time and they last about three months. We are about to place our third order for this product but this time we are looking to purchase a years supply. Nice, fragrant smells.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered, and I love the scents. Great price, great shipping!</li>
            <li> This was ok. Interesting smells .  I prefered  of all that I smelled was the black boxed Sandalwood it was rich smelling but appears unavailable for individual purchase.</li>
            <li> I love variety: books, foods, games, and yes, incense. I purchased this sampler simply because it offered a great, convenient, and affordable way to experience for the first time all the SATYA SAI BABA incenses that I have repeatedly seen glowing reviews for. Scent is a VERY subjective preference, as subjective as preferred guitar picks (you guitar players know what I mean). I decided, however, to include my impressions of each scent. I normally burn the far more subtle Japanese style incense, so each of the following was a brand new experience for me.  I give the pack itself four stars as I did discover I really don&#x27;t generally care for Satya&#x27;s flora incense.  But this was a good way to find out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessing: Sweet perfume-counter style with low sandalwood base - moderate scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine Blossom: Sweet, very sweet - strong scent, is rather overbearing... I ended throwing this one out along with Romance simply because of it&#x27;s overbearing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance: Floral - strong and overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli Forest: Mild sweet with earth tones, slow burning - moderate light scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood: Mild earth tones, a little superficial compared to other brands I have burned, slow burning - light scent, lingers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain Forest: Sweetness that made me think of a bar of soap - moderate scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celestial: Mild, warm sweetness- light scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortune: Musty earth with tinge of sweet - medium scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise: Spicy warmth - medium scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naga Champa: So this is the famous Naga Champa, Wow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight: Warm, mild spice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super Hit: The signature incense, and for good reason, light, spicy, long burning</li>
            <li> Includes large amount of incense of each type.  A good starting point for somebody looking to try new scents, or just aiming to have a variety of choices available.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of incense, but it can be heavy at times, so a variety pack is perfect. I can burn a stick and if it is too heavy i can switch to another without getting over bearing. One stick of most of these varieties is enough to give decent fragrance to a room about 20ft x 20ft. Its fragrance will last 2-6 hours depending on the type, except for the jasmine which outlasts all the other types. The jasmine sticks are quit flammable and will char when you are lighting them if you do not blow them out quickly.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the different scents available.  I had not known they existed.  I know where to shop now!  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great deal on these incense but the scents are a lot more of acquired smells they are not for everyone</li>
            <li> Good quality, and great assortment. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This appears to be a great buy.  Tons of quality incense for the price, much cheaper than you could get it at a smoke shop or similar place.  One drawback seems to be an abundance of incense powder in each pouch, I&#x27;m not sure if this is intentional or an accident/broken up incense but the handful of sticks I&#x27;ve used have been great.</li>
            <li> I like burning incense every morning when I get up and even sometimes in the evening before going to bed. It always puts me in a good state of mind. I really like the Nag Champa products and fragrences better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. They burn consistantly and I like all of the different fragrences and the way they are packaged for convient use. What can say? There is nothing I don&#x27;t like about this product and intend to use it as ling as I can get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> I love this box of insence. It&#x27;s a great mix. Definitely worth getting</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no substitute for good incense. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> A lot of sticks...These will last you a while. Got exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and works fine.</li>
            <li> Incense Good!! Great Service!!</li>
            <li> Only a couple smelled decent</li>
            <li> Great incense with plenty of choices to choose from, smell&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> What a selection.  Here you will have every scent.  They are easy to light and the scents are attractive.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> These guys are so so strong. I mean they will singe your nose hairs and give you the fabulous illusion that your room smells good</li>
            <li> Best friend took my Nag Champa one from my box :c but other than that, I L O V E this set. c:&lt;br /&gt;Got my box yesterday and I already want to order another because you can smell the scents coming from the box, plus I just really love incense. c:</li>
            <li> every scent is a good one, and everybody who comes over to my house wants to light a new scent. It&#x27;s been a big hit with us, and our guests!&lt;br /&gt;Good burn times, and not too messy.</li>
            <li> I had tried alot of these scents before, they are staples in my home, nag champa, sandlewood, patchuouli forests, midnight etc... but i now love the jasmine and more. I will buy this variety pack from now on. the price is unbeatable in my area. If you like inscents you&#x27;ve gotta try these, at least once. They beat the pants off the cheapo inscents you find at the flea markets and such. These are high quality. They&#x27;ll lift your spirits, and they wont break the bank!</li>
            <li> Seller was awesome in making sure I got my package when I emailed about not receiving it, they lasted a while because of it being variety back but I used them up pretty quickly because I love the nag champa scents. They also sent mine in a larger nag champa box that held all 12 scents, which I never received before so it was nice to have a box to keep them organized &amp; advertised what they were!</li>
            <li> I received all 12 variety incense sticks on time. They have a strong scent, but I like it very much. One stick lasts about 3-5 minutes. I have yet to figure out which one of the scents is my favorite. You definitely need a stick holder. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, all of these arrived fresh and packaged professionally. Great for meditation, home aroma therapies, or just for beautiful smells through the air. Trusted seller and product. Excellent.</li>
            <li> Great price! I love burning incense, so this was a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve liked all the different scents, but one smelled EXACTLY like a dirty ferret, so we threw that one out :)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this incense. It arrived quickly, was packaged nicely, and it was fresh. It wasn&#x27;t old and stale. It all smells great, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I like this incense but did not get all the scents that were listed. I wanted to try them all but got some duplicates instead of all the different scents. Also, I noticed different amounts of sticks in each box, I could have swore there was supposed to be 15 sticks in each box but some boxes had as low as only 12! Probably will still buy this incense because I like it and it&#x27;s a good price but they don&#x27;t deliver exactly what they say you are going to get!</li>
            <li> I am in love. 12 boxes Satya for that price is awesome. They all smell really good and are neatly packaged and good quality.</li>
            <li> Brought some paranormal images and trick or treaters while burning at the door.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Love it!  What can I say???:&lt;br /&gt;I love all the scents they are so relaxing to me.</li>
            <li> The scents are a little odd, but still very nice. Arrived very quickly with no damages. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Final Update. The fragrances are lovely if you leave Jasmine Blossom off the list. I would purchase again because, even with this one exception, the bulk is worth the price! 4.9/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Update: Blessings. It was all worth it to light blessings. That fragrance was amazing! Not one smell of fire either, just pure and amazing fragrance. Perhaps the other incense are wood based and that&#x27;s why I get minimal fragrance and a lot of wood. However, I am going to get a larger box of Blessings. I l.o.v.e it. That, just in itself, has upped this product to a 4/5 in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just lit Sunrise for a little morning relaxation before work and you know, all I smell is fire....it seems like it should smell good but the woody fragrance is overpowering any possibility of a decent fragrance. Just for added measure I ordered a couple samples from Shoyeido&#x27;s website to see if its just what I purchased or if, possibly, I&#x27;m more a candle type person. Shame with these though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I purchased this set because I wanted to know how they measure up against having candles, as this is my go to when it comes to fragrancing my house. I made this purchase because I am new to incense and wanted to smell the different types before settling in on a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lit \\&quot;Celestial\\&quot; last night and I thought, gee, this smells mostly like fire and not a very woman-like scent so I don&#x27;t know about this. Today I just lit \\&quot;Sunrise\\&quot; and again, all I smell is fire and smoke, not much fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I am lighting them incorrectly and letting the flame stay on too long before I blow it out. I will keep trying. If I find that I was the one in error I will come back and modify this rating to higher but if this is how they are supposed to smell then there is no difference in fragrance and I am back to my candles... Product 3/5 as it stands.</li>
            <li> The only ones I liked were the sandalwood and super hit otherwise I thought they did not smell good.</li>
            <li> Most smelled like burning soap. Some let off a whole lot of smoke. A couple were ok. The cats litter box seemed to smell pretty good compared to most of these scents.</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa, especially Fortune, Super Hits, and Celestial.&lt;br /&gt;My gf can&#x27;t stand the smells-bad memories (?)&lt;br /&gt;There are 12 scents, as the description states; some I&#x27;m familiar with, others not so much.  They&#x27;re all great.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, I&#x27;m not sure there are many better options than Nag Champa.</li>
            <li> This particular brand of incense is unpleasant, to me.  I ordered two different assortments and when I received them, everything smelled exactly the same.  I wondered if they shipped to the US in a sea-freight (metal) container on the deck of the ship and sat baking in the sunshine for 30 days or so during transit, so that all the volatile oils got mixed together.  That would explain everything smelling more or less the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I concluded that when burned there are subtle differences in odor, and some smell a lot worse than others, but overall, for someone of western European descent, the odor was basically strong and unpleasant.  I tried to work through them but eventually decided life was just too short and tossed them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have an ethnic background that appreciates whatever these are, there are very good incense sticks out there.  This brand in my mind is NOT one of them.</li>
            <li> Love these -- use every morning during my prayer time!</li>
            <li> Completely changed the way I saw incense. Best brand I&#x27;ve ever had and I&#x27;ve been burning incense since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Love this variety pack. I get to change the smell depending on my mood. Also love how strong and long-lasting the smell is. My living room area is open and with high ceilings and the smell still lingers for hours...love it</li>
            <li> Burnin&#x60; Down The House.</li>
            <li> I usually only buy the sandlewood and nag champa fragrances, but decided to try some new ones.  I didn&#x27;t like all the &#x27;flavors&#x27; but found a friend that did.  Worth trying if you aren&#x27;t sure which fragrance to buy.</li>
            <li> Came in one big box, packaged in 12 other smaller boxes inside.  I just finished burning the Fortune incense and I love the smell of it.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> such an awesome variety,  wow fast ship too!  I will reorder from the seller here,  this is worth it!  A lot of insence,  I mean,  a lot and the scents,  are beautiful smells,  they burn well,  a nice long burn,  and the smells are strong and do not fade away,  I am a nag champa burner,  but these other scents,  they are just a most enjoyable to smell and burn!</li>
            <li> A fantastic variety! :)</li>
            <li> Pleasant scents that the wife and love.</li>
            <li> Amazing value for the variety, definitely ordering again.</li>
            <li> I really love these incense, I bought them as a gift for my girlfriend and I can&#x27;t wait to see her face. I was disappointed at first, they come in a large box labeled &amp;#34;Midnight&amp;#34; so I thought that&#x27;s all I got, the midnight smell. To my amazement, when I opened that box, there they were! all 12 scents in their own separate boxes.</li>
            <li> Great way to sample all the scents!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for an incense aficionado and he loves this product. For the money, you can&#x27;t really beat the variety or amount of incense you&#x27;re getting. All incense packages were sealed and worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Excellent combination</li>
            <li> Certainly a lot of product for the money. Perhaps a bit stronger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Already began prayers with these and I love and adore them! Beautifully packaged and smell so wonderful! I can&#x27;t wait to pray with them all! Thank you from our family to yours!</li>
            <li> Nice range of scents didnt like some but thats just personal preference</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely great deal on one of the highest quality brands of incense. Each box has maybe 17-20 sticks, I&#x27;m guessing because I counted from boxes that I&#x27;ve already used from, but it&#x27;s certainly a decent quantity per box and a great variety. I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> There are some excellent scents here, and the incense itself is of great quality.  The reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is that some of the scents are pretty gross.  I&#x27;m not crazy opposed to flowery fragrances, but most of the flowery ones here completely overdo it.  Out of the 12 there were 4 or 5 that I set aside.  The rest were all so good I just mixed them all up to pick randomly from them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome! So many great incense, good quality &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> Sweet incensce off joy!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure about which scent you like, this is a good variety of which to sample.</li>
            <li> First time I buy these and definitely will get them again, the fragrance is not as intense as some other brands that I have try</li>
            <li> These incense sticks are very pleasant. They burn slowly too. I have bought these before and will surely but them again.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully fragranted incense</li>
            <li> A nice selection of scents that do not over power the atmosphere.</li>
            <li> I smell fortune and blessings! Great odor and would buy again... I love this set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 sets already and just ordered my 3rd! Truly a fantastic value, and the price is right on.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this variety pack!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery..... Love the selection..? Burns really slow  which is a pluss</li>
            <li> My personal favorite incense set, usually better than what you can find at head shops or any other place that would have incense. I&#x27;ve bought these sticks many times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> LOT&#x27;s of variety, hard to find a fragrance you wouldn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I love the variety. Each of them smell great!</li>
            <li> I love the selection and the superb range of scents in this collection. Until this purchase I had heard only of Nag Champa (my favorite since hippie-hood) and Super Hit(discovered much later in life). Now I have enough variety to last my lifetime, I think. I recommend Sandalwood, Blessings, and Sunrise, (as well as my 2 faves above) but I must say I like them all, there really isn&#x27;t a bad one.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;They are cheap, but they don&#x27;t really smell good, like cheap soap or something.</li>
            <li> The price is okay for how much you get but some of them don&#x27;t stay lit or are hard to light. Most of them are pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> Love these! Will reorder again!! Love te variety and quality! They are amazing and exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The package of incense is well made and burns for a long time.  The aroma is pure and not overwhelming.  I love keeping a few burning most of the day!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> scent did not hold up as expected. The company is good but this particular item I will not reorder.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!!!</li>
            <li> Lots of amazing scents. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> simply awful!!!  The positive reviews have to be from the owners or folks who are either olfactorily challenged or never experienced a pure product ie  sandalwood without something else or artificial, just sandalwood. These are likely sticks rolled in cow dung and dipped in oils or perfumes. Sample ( scents of earth ).....am a customer not an owner or employee.&lt;br /&gt;This got 1 star because it was the only way I could leave a review</li>
            <li> These are my favorite incenses that i couldn&#x27;t find in any store. I absolutely love all the unique smells. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It brings 12 Nag Champa incenses excellent for meditation to concentrate and aromatherapy for the house...each are all with a different flavor</li>
            <li> Now I like a lot more scents other then just the patchouli.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> Love the Set, Buying another set one, right now. All of the boxes had 17-20 inc. Great deal happy to be a repeat client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus. Thank You...</li>
            <li> Will be a lifetime buyer!</li>
            <li> Some are the fragrance smell too strong.</li>
            <li> I was never a big fan of incense. Bought these for a friend but decided to try them out first. Well, I fell in love with these incense sticks. They smell wonderfull, not overpowering! The one drawback, they are shorter than other incense sticks but well worth the money I spend! If you want a good smell in your home, buy these incense sticks, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> will be buying again soon, I love all the varieties of different smells. Romance nag champa super hit and blessings are my favs</li>
            <li> These are way too strong. A few of them i kind of like but they&#x27;re too much for my liking. They all have a similar scent to them so you&#x27;re not getting much variety. They don&#x27;t smell anywhere near as good as Wildberry incense, I&#x27;m gonna stick with those.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve experimented with several different brands and homemade ones to no avail, and like a boomerang i&#x27;ve come back full circle. if its not broken, don&#x27;t fix it. great quality, wide variety, lovely smell, unbeatable price. definitely recommend the sets.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but all the incense smell the same...</li>
            <li> These are the most delicious and aromatic insence in the world.  I have tried different brands and always come back to Nag Champa. It makes my living spaces amazingly peaceful.</li>
            <li> A very worthwhile collection of classic Indian scents. Each pack has 20-25 sticks... enough to burn for quite while.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> sometimes when I buy Patchouli they don&#x27;t have a particular smell, but these Patchouli&#x27;s all have a unique smell.  but, if you&#x27;re looking for long lasting Patchouli, these aren&#x27;t the ones you want.</li>
            <li> I was expecting 12 boxes of incense that smelled good and I got 12 boxes of incense, the first of which smells good and I have no reason to believe the other 11 wont.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in India, looks authentic!</li>
            <li> Great variety!  They are not as well made as other incense that I have bought, but hey, who really cares if there is a lot of &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; in the packet.  They burn fine and give off a nice scent!</li>
            <li> These are such heaven to my nose. The only brand incense I will buy!!</li>
            <li> I love incense samplers, as I tend to get used to/tired of a particular fragrance if burned for too long, so sets like this are wonderful.  A nice selection of quality Satya Sai Baba incense fragrances at a good price.</li>
            <li> I order this again and again for my yoga studio.  Just wish I could get more of the romance sticks.  We love them!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE VARIETY FOR THE VALUE</li>
            <li> I like this company. They are top quality at a good price. Any form of their Nag Champa is excellent smelling.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this brand. I have tried four of the scents. All four smell exactly the same. I have used several incense from cheap to expensive. This particular brand produces an excessive amount of smoke. I burned one incense and my living room, dining room and kitchen all were filled with smoke. I would not recommend this particular brand. I plan to use them outdoors on the patio to see if they help with mosquitos.</li>
            <li> Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There might be 12 different scents, but in actuality there maybe only 4!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes they have different names and all but youll find similarities in them from one to another. Maybe 4 have the same characteristic notes of incense and another set of 3 or 4 might have another set that is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all theres like only 4 scents! (imo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some are stronger and more pungent (some say &amp;#34;soap/detergent&amp;#34;) but these are all nice in there own right. Good deal im satisfied!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and could smell them thru the box. So far they smell great. Lots of flavors.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT!  All these are my favorite....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to get into what each type smells like, because I like them all.  Every scent is quite unique, although many of them similar base ingredients (patchouli, sandalwood, etc).  Of course I like others BETTER, but I truly love all the scents.  If you like incense or Nag Champa specifically you will love this set!</li>
            <li> Prefect...great for the price..so many kinds..very happy with this purchase.ty</li>
            <li> Really nice aroma, and I clearly have many more to enjoy!! Can&#x27;t wait!!  And lot&#x27;s of them too!!!  I would recommend to a friend!!!</li>
            <li> i will only do this set from now on. all of the stick smells delicious and there is a ton of them! its a super great deal. it comes in cute little packages for each smell. love it</li>
            <li> Decent selection, but some of the varieties are very soapy and smokey.  There are better quality collections available, but for the money this is adequate.</li>
            <li> I love burning incences and this set includes a nice variety of scents.  I would purchases these incense sticks again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep all the varieties straight, but you&#x27;re sure to find something you like in this pack. It&#x27;s fun to try them all. Great value! A lot of variety!</li>
            <li> This is a great value and a great way to discover new incense you may want to try. all the scents are great I love them all and these will last me quite a while. I will purchase this set again. You don&#x27;t realize just how much incense comes in 12 small boxes but it is a lot. I love all the smalls and these are great quality. A must have</li>
            <li> All of these smell awesome and stick around for a few days after being burned. Definitely will buy more of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of incense including some &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; products from smaller, cultural shops and Satya brand has consistently been the absolute best on the market. This is a great collection of the company&#x27;s various offerings, the scents are a very pleasant and relaxing combination of essential oils that is never overbearing or &amp;#34;smokey&amp;#34; smelling. The sticks burn for a reasonable amount of time; Ive never actually kept track but I would estimate each one lasts about half an hour. I use these in the basement/bar area of my home (a typical Chicago house, average size) and one stick is plenty to take care of the entire space. The price advertised here is an excellent deal compared to what you would pay in stores and the product arrived in great shape. Previous reviewers mentioned some moisture damage to the incense but I have not experienced any with my order. Use caution when opening the bag containing the sticks within the box; a decent amount of loose incense residue will be in there and can be pretty messy if you pull a bundle of the sticks out at once from the bag (this is no fault of the manufacturer but just a result of the nature of the product, there will still ample incense material left on all of the sticks). If you&#x27;re looking to find your favorite scent of incense from Satya this is the way to go. I highly recommend the &amp;#34;Midnight&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first given how it was packaged that I got a massive box of super hit only, but was happy to see it was just how it was packaged.  Wonderful incense at a great price!</li>
            <li> These are our favorite incense, try to keep them in stock even for our back deck near the hot tub :)!</li>
            <li> love all the different smells.</li>
            <li> Most of these smell delicious. The three major exceptions: Blessings, Rainforest, and Jasmine Blossom smell like cheap soap. I threw out these three boxes. The sticks light and burn well. The smoke and aroma quickly fill the room with a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Order Ten!</li>
            <li> I love the Sai Baba Nag Champa Incense and decided to try some of their other scents. Out of this collection I also loved the Sandalwood and Patchouli Forest. They both have a very good, rich, and refined quality (although neither smell like traditional sandalwood or patchouli). The other scents were too sweetly perfumed with an artificial hotel soapy smell. I threw them away, but I highly recommend the Nag Champa, Sandalwood, and Patchouli Forest. I know that the Super Hit is popular but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it or other scents again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. All of them smell amazing. Thank you</li>
            <li> I just keep buying these.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, lots of variety, need to order again.</li>
            <li> I got a chance to try all the different variety. Honestly, I love them all although SuperHits of one of my Favs!!!</li>
            <li> These incense seriously smell so good! Especially Jasmine Blossom and Super Hit. Super hit smells like candy, so I kind of burned through them the first two days lol. I&#x27;m using the Jasmine Blossom currently and it really does smell like jasmine blossoms, to a tee! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome! What a great deal!</li>
            <li> Product is amazing. Delivery was not. It was 6:30pm when I got it and the guy didn&#x27;t even pull into the drive way. He got out and threw the package to me without saying anything</li>
            <li> More incense then you could every possibly need at one point in time. Great variety for the price, highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> Great price and a good bunch of different incense to try and also, enjoy.  I liked the selection sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nag Champa incenses are always a great choice.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all bad, but there&#x27;s too much unpleasant filler in this large sample pack... I love the original Nag Champa. One of the things I like the most about it is that it does not have what to my nose is the sharp, cheap, headache inducing chemical-like smell of lots of the inexpensive incense you&#x27;ll find around. I was excited to try other offerings from a brand I&#x27;ve come to trust, but I was severely disappointed! After a single burn of 5 of the scents they went straight in the trash. Some of the others are nice, and some just not offensive enough to throw away. The nicest ones were those that are offered in the 6 scent pack here on Amazon. If you love this Nag Champa and you think you&#x27;d like to experiment with some other smells stick to the 6 scent pack.</li>
            <li> very nice packaging and scent.</li>
            <li> great deal and lovely incense</li>
            <li> Nice mixture of scents.</li>
            <li> Good deal but smell sort of off. I wanted to try out all the nag scents but I feel like these are the reject packs and maybe the actual scents smell a little better and more authentic.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to receive such a nice variety of incense!  Satya Brand is some of the highest quality incense in my opinion.  Comparing what I have smelled compared to some of the other reviews, I have to say that some of the \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ones are really good, like Fortune.  It smells like a citrusy cologne, and I enjoyed it very much.  Rainforest is also very nice, and it&#x27;s not overpowering like some of the cheaper \\&quot;rain\\&quot; scents that you find out there.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a chance to smell all of them yet, but I highly recommend this product to anyone who is wanting to venture out into the world of incense!</li>
            <li> Getting tired of the same old Nag? Want to find out what else is out there?  This is the answer.  But you will find you like that old Nag a lot more than some of this stuff.  Some of these are HARDCORE FUNKY.  Some have an over-powering soapy smell. Like maybe something that would be good to freshen up a 1000 year old public out-house in Mumbai or someplace, where the over-powering smell of soap is needed to beat back the funk of a 1000 year old mixture of turds.  Some of these actually smell pretty good and are nice for a change.  Others are musty and funky, some tolerable, and some just funky in a bad way.  This will satisfy your curiosity about Nag and you&#x27;ll probably find a handful of new flavors that you like, as well as come away with a new appreciation for just how good the standard stuff really is.</li>
            <li> This incense pack is fantastic, it brings 12 different and all incredible smells and feel! I look forward to coming home so i can light one up to get my house is a completely different mood! Already shared a few with my friends and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be buying some soon!</li>
            <li> i LOVE this set. Bought it because i loved Nag Champa and wanted to get some more of the same type. I tried all of them and i didn&#x27;t find a single one that was anything less than great. Might even reorder this just so i can keep a verity on hand.</li>
            <li> Great assortment! Definitely a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Scents are great they just dont stay lit, have to relight them like they are wet</li>
            <li> Great price, and some of the best incense money can buy.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> We love these incense. The aroma is righteous. Thank you</li>
            <li> Have bought these several times - great variety!</li>
            <li> These had a horrible smell to them. They all basically smelled the same.  The only way I can describe the smell was that it was a cross between men&#x27;s cologne and cleaning products or soap.  The only positive is if you do happen to like the smell, they are VERY strong, I didn&#x27;t even light one and they smelled up the room they were in!</li>
            <li> Came packaged in a 2012 edition box instead of a bunch of loose boxes (which I was expecting), so I was very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Midnight, Sunrise, Rain Forest, Super Hit - all very good. The rest - from ok to too floral to odd.&lt;br /&gt;Nag Champa is ok, but not what I remember from years ago. I like a lot of incense better than this stuff now.&lt;br /&gt;And I prefer the quality and scent of HEM incense better.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try all of the different scents. I love the blue box Nag Champa! I thought the set will give me a nice variety to the same ol Nag Champa sent that I love. However, all of these smell similar except a couple of them. They are girly, loud and sweet smelling incense. The smell is distinct and lingers for awhile compared to most sticks. I ordered the set looking for a change. I would not order again. It&#x27;s excellent deal a little over a $1 a box, but I will just stick to the same ol blue box Nag Champa. The Sandalwood was very different smelling. Not the typical sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Mom once a couple years ago.  She loved them so much she has me buy them for her again everytime she runs out.</li>
            <li> For people giving negative comments on smells etc, dont know the history of incense. Thats why this package gives you 12 different boxes!! For 13 bucks that a steal in any format LOL!! Buy the package, sit back, and enjoy the essence of aroma!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this package of incense sticks and was pleased it had a good varity of smells.  I would have liked to have smelled them like other incense I have bought.  The only way to smell this incense was to smell it at yor nose, unlight.  You see, once it is lit it just burns a little and then goes out.  Over the years I have burndt many different sticks and cones and none have stopped burning almost immediately.  It was not that I wasn&#x27;t lighting it incorrectly.  First poor review I&#x27;ve ever had to put into an Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> I am surprise this came with so many incense  :)  It&#x27;s definitely great value.  The only complaint is that I wish the description of the fragrant is more reflective to the ingredient as opposed to something so poetically vague... so I don&#x27;t have to sniff each one to see what I am in the mood for lighting.  Otherwise, I recommend this very much.</li>
            <li> Great value, great product, small packaging, and these things smell great! Really worth the money spent, we highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> would def buy again. some scents i liked. some i didnt. now i know. product and delivery excellent!</li>
            <li> Nag Champs is a superior product.  I paid a little over $1 each for the boxes in this sampler.  I can usually buy incense for $1 per box, and the boxes usually contain from 20 to 40 sticks.  These boxes list weight, not number of sticks, and seem to have about 14 sticks.  Given that, incense is not expensive, Nag Champa is very slow burning, and the fragrances are wonderful and long lasting.  Paying a few cents more for this brand is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal for this pack! Because of the price I thought it would just be a sample set of 12 different scents, not larger boxes of them. Great purchase! If I wasn&#x27;t set for the next year or so I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great deal on a very good variety pack, I love each of the scents. It came quickly and well packaged. I will definitely order again when this supply runs out.</li>
            <li> They burn out a lot quicker than the ones I got at the sunday market. A little dissapointed. The auromas are also very pungeant and kind of all similar.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller.</li>
            <li> Warning: very strong aroma. With that being said, the smells themselves are nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked incense. I began smudging with White Sage and found I liked the smell, so I tried another product (Wild African Violet) and found I liked that smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;I *thought* I started to like incense and bought these based on reviews. Bad idea. These are horrible. They smell fake and artificial, plus are so overpowering (even if not lit!).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> Offensive and powerful smell without even opening the boxes.  I actually could not even keep the box in the house because of the strong smell.  Definitely not incense to buy if you are looking for a calming, relaxing and pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> If you want a wide variety of incense get this package deal! It really is a great value buy and cannot go wrong with it!</li>
            <li> I thought each box would have 20 sticks, but it had less. The fragrance was also too mute, not strong enough for burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before and they seem to be very good quality and reasonably long buring. I love the variety, but it would also be nice to be able to select exactly which aromas I recieve in bulk. Excellant price &amp; quantity.</li>
            <li> I use it just for a few minutes and is more than enough to cover the whole house. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at the quality of these. I am used to the incense you typically buy in stores. After burning these, I definitely notice the difference in quality. These are strong, burn around 30-45 minutes, and actually smell like what they&#x27;re supposed to. I have some other incense that smell good prior to burning, but while burning, they smell nothing like it. That&#x27;s not the case with these. I also like the variety that is offered. I did not care much for the soapy, floral scents. I was not expecting to like all the scents, about 6 out of the 12 scents I liked. This helped me figure out what I like and should look for next time I purchase. I really liked the sandalwood, midnight, and nag champa.</li>
            <li> great variety, awesome product, fast shipping &amp; amazing value!</li>
            <li> These actually smell like they smell before they are lit, unlike all other incense I&#x27;ve ever tried. Very unique scent. The variety is nice, but so far they all smell like Nag Champa to me, which is what is sold in most head shops. This is the only incense I will use. You may as well light firecrackers with all that other garbage.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT VARIETY OF SENT&#x27;S ! NAG CHAMPA IS THE BEST SMELLING INSENTS  EVER. THEY BURN SLOWER THAN SOME OTHER BRANDS I HAVE PURCHASED .</li>
            <li> Im not a big incense person but something about the nag champa incense that puts the mind right and just smells divine, not like a stoner house, like a spiritual clenasing. I know that sounds hippyish, but I really love this stuff. I was so plased to try the &amp;#34;grabbag&amp;#34;. Its fun and they are all very nice. Vey reasonably priced as well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this incense....they are easy to burn and they have so many different fragrances to choose from. Thanks so very much!!!</li>
            <li> I love incense but often find them to smell soapy or weird when I get home and burn them. Nt only do these last longer than some of the cheaper ones, but they are true to smell and I haven&#x27;t found one scent I haven&#x27;t like. Amazing quality.</li>
            <li> I really like the selection this set provides. I love Nag Champa and this set allows you to change it up a little without losing the quality.</li>
            <li> Until now, I have tried some, they smell delicious. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I am sooooo happy I order this product... I am into incense burning have been for over 20yrs so I have burned and smelled many incenses but I must say this is on top of my fav list I have the smell is relaxing and not smoking or over whelming...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it smells great the only thing is I wish it burned longer and last a litlle longer other than that I am happy I will be getting these again</li>
            <li> A nice variety pack for incense lovers! The person that I gifted this to really enjoyed all of the different aromas.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like some of the scents but most are great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this bundle of incense as a gift for a frequent incense user twice; the second time it was actually a request!  These are wonderful smelling incense and the price is the best I&#x27;ve found for such quality and the impressive quantity offered.</li>
            <li> I ordered without really taking the time to read the description but I love everything about what I received! Perfect scents for every occasion and every day use.</li>
            <li> These were old!  So old, in fact - they were crumbling.  Attempting to burn what was not crumbled - just made smoke, little essence.  Too bad - all the others I have purchased were much higher quality than this variety package.</li>
            <li> They smell incredible and burn slow. Most incense gives me a headache but I decided to try these and definitely wasn&#x27;t disappointed. If you&#x27;re going to buy any, buy from this brand. I absolutely cent get enough :)</li>
            <li> The variety offered in this pack is outstanding. This is my first time coming across high quality incense so it was nice having a decent selection to introduce me. I highly recommend this set of 12 to anyone looking to find which kind of incense they like or simply someone looking for a lot of high quality incense that will last them quite a while. I always have a stick burning when I have someone over, and have only received positive feedback.</li>
            <li> Exactly as i named this review is how my house smells, \\&quot;Romance\\&quot; tells me on the box ill never want to leave the room and it&#x27;s true, i dont want to leave! This variety is amazing, it&#x27;s such a good deal that it&#x27;s going to be a while until i need to order again but, 100% recommended if you want a quality product..which you do.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal. If you are a fan of the original Nag Champa (blue box) incense, there&#x27;s all the varieties in this package.</li>
            <li> show up on time . a bunch of different scenes. some i like some i don&#x27;t but still a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> One or two of the scents didn&#x27;t smell good, but I liked them overall and they make my living room smell great, thanks!</li>
            <li> we run an animal shelter, and we keep it immaculate! we ordered Nag Champa incenses to add calming and delicious smell and now we are hooked!!! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Such an awesome deal! I&#x27;m usually paying $7 bucks for one box. I will have incense for a year. And definitely be buying this again. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Killer combo of the world&#x27;s most imported</li>
            <li> Came fast and they smell great. I like sandalwood the best!</li>
            <li> Giving two STARS because two of the actual quality iten is all I received. What I received was a mix of good quality and low quality incense. You can tell the difference, even if novice. The poor quality is overwhelming and even sickening. I seriously think these guys are putting 2 boxes good 10 boxes crude. Sorry. sunrise sandalwood might (as stated in description) might be the only set that is legit.</li>
            <li> Best incense I have purchased, great scents!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice pack of incense. I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try out a couple of them so far, but they&#x27;re been wonderful, and the ones I havn&#x27;t had a chance to use yet still smell great in their boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each scent comes individually packaged in its own box, and all of them are contained within another larger box - great for shipping and for storage. A+ product, I will definitely be making this a regular purchase when i run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this porduct for about 3 scents I like only to discover there are a lot more awesome scents I didn&#x27;t even know about. I love the variety and quality.</li>
            <li> We wanted to try this set out because there are a few scents - especially the regular nag champa - that we&#x27;ve gotten separately and really enjoyed.  The price is so low that it&#x27;s worth it to get a few boxes of scents that you don&#x27;t really enjoy as much, but most of them are very nice.</li>
            <li> I love everything about it. The variety of the smells and their quality is very satisfying! I am a big fan on this product and I keep on coming back!</li>
            <li> Horrible..Threw them out...Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Great variety of scents! I use them for the bathroom or for the house. I have an old used up Glade candle with some wax left and what I do is, stick 3 or 4 different ones and leave it in the bathroom and it masks the smells very well. Better than any air fresher or candle. I also use it when I am changing the litter box. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love all the variety it&#x27;s cheaper than burning my candles.</li>
            <li> Love having so many choices!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these incents. It has a wide variety of smells. They burn slowly. Doesn&#x27;t make a big mess with the ashes. We love this product.</li>
            <li> This 12 pack is my favorite. Great smell, Good quantity per box. Has plenty of variety for picking the right scent for each occasion.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love the original Nag Champa. I was pleasantly surprised that I liked all of the included scents.  Celestial is my favorite, but the others are also nice.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed exploring the different scents, but many were much too perfumey for my tastes. I will stick to their classic nag champa in the future!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...this is a exceptional deal for incense, but majority of the scents are too strong and perfumy for my tastes.  It reminds of the the time we lost our 8 year old at the cosmetics counter and had to drive home with the car windows down.  She had sampled a few too many perfumes.</li>
            <li> love the variety of scents</li>
            <li> I just bought this set and started to burn one in my apartment, and it&#x27;s lasted for over an hour! It smells great and I love the variety that it comes with. Has stuff that both my roommate and I will enjoy! There are 12 in each package, so that is 144. And if each one lasts for more than an hour, then we have a lot of time till we will need to be getting more! Great buy!</li>
            <li> some were better than others, patchouli forest and the original nag champ flavors were my favorite, but overall was a great buy.</li>
            <li> alot of the flavors suck not bad tho</li>
            <li> awesome stuff!!!  love the variety</li>
            <li> My sister loves Nag Champa so I figured a variety pack would be a great Christmas gift.  It smells so good!</li>
            <li> I mean everything else is great, but I&#x27;m just not cray about 8 out of 12 of the smell, but it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> To buy all of these at the candle shop near my house it would have cost me $40 or more. This is a great deal. My favorite right now is the nag champa sticks in the blue box but I have yet to try the other scents. Every time I light one of these up my apartment smells great and I seem to be in a much better and relaxed mood. These stick burn very slowly as well. A half hour an hour a stick. I can see this entire pack lasting me a year or more. Buy these, last much longer than candles and don&#x27;t cost a fortune!</li>
            <li> I really love the variety pack on these.  Everything arrived nicely packaged, smells fantastic.  Nag Champa is a winner, and we love opening the new packs for something new.  Great incense!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa makes the best incense I have ever smelt hands down. These incense are not over powering, they put off an excellent smelling fragrance that makes the house smell very wonderful. Also these incense do not give me a headache like a lot of these cheap incense sold today do. I recommend these to everyone.</li>
            <li> These incense sticks smell nice but are a bit too uneven &amp; flimsy</li>
            <li> Most of the smells I didn&#x27;t care for very much, but it let me experiment on which ones I liked. Nag champa was my favorite in the end.</li>
            <li> Some sticks smelled great, while others smelled like burning cardboard. Going to search elsewhere for incense next time.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Enough said.</li>
            <li> The fragrances are fantistic.  I wish I could purchase some of them separatel.  But still the fragrances are consistently good quality!!</li>
            <li> They are small but very powerful.  However, they are a bit smkey when first lit but other than, wonderful.  I plan to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> They are excellent BANG BANG</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, most beautiful scents...  ty</li>
            <li> This collection of incense are a delight to burn and I truly enjoyed them. One thing I didn&#x27;t enjoy is that some of the incense have flying particles and cause me to sneeze. However, this is in some part due to the fact that I have a pollen and dust allergy. Other than that, I am sure to recommend them to friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> I will always review based on price- and for what its worth, this is a good buy. Either you love the original Nag Champa and trust the brand or you&#x27;re looking to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a small breakdown of my experience with each scent:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortune- great &#x27;higher quality&#x27; smell. Easily my favorite out of the pack. On par with the original nag champa as far as enjoyment of scent and.. relightability?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight- Very soothing and rich scent. Earthy undertones with a hint of gentlemen&#x27;s musk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rainforest- smells like hotel soap. Clean smell, but not what id want from incense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood- Smells like traditional sandalwood incense. Soft, but didn&#x27;t linger as long as i would&#x27;ve liked after burning out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings- Potent and nauseating. Smells like senior ladies&#x27; knockoff perfume. Never lighting one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli Forest- I would describe it as a light weight original nag champa scent. Smells great and useful in a small room or to freshen up a large one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine blossom- Absolutely terrible. The odor was awful and overwhelming. Had to put it out after 2 minutes- couldn&#x27;t take another second&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunrise- Difficult to light and didn&#x27;t make much smoke. Good for those who wish to be more discreet with the presence of their incense. Smells like nag champa with faint floral background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romance- Floral scent. Has the same soap-like background smell that Rainforest has. Burns rather quickly compared to the rest. Didn&#x27;t enjoy it but didn&#x27;t hate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celestial- Good fragrance, general woody incense smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super Hit- Smells like nag champa but less woody and more like artificial cherries and nutmeg. Difficult scent to describe, but an enjoyable one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 5 stars because of the price and the enjoyment of discovering the scent of each pack. Your opinion may and/or will vary greatly from mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The set is great for variety and the safe gamble. It had been some time since I last used incense- but it really is an affordable alternative to candles. I enjoyed most except for the Romance, Jasmine, and Rain Forest scents that became quickly/intensely cloying and overwhelmingly sweet and floral; lingered for too long. The surprise of the pack for me was that I do not care for the Super Hit at all- also way too nausea inducing sweet. My children loved them all. Suffice to say eight out of twelve (for my fickle nose) is a pretty great turnout on a small investiture. It was fun for our family to anticipate the smell on the stick/burn fragrance of each scent. It is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> There is a variety of scents in the package and I love them all. This is my second time to order these. I will definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> the more i smell the more i feel empowered to breathe into the deep deep spaces between us and our love.</li>
            <li> Incense lovers, don&#x27;t ever look further than Nag Champa! Amazing scents last forever, and I&#x27;ve gotten raves when folks enter my home and take a sniff. Calming to me and my five dogs, awesome for covering food and smoke odors, beautifully packaged-- this is the best ever!!!</li>
            <li> I get this collection bi-monthly and it&#x27;s wonderful, the scent variety can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worth every penny. I got a gift card for my birthday and a new burner so naturally I needed some incense to burn and this is the best deal you can find. The sticks smell great and a variety of sweet and serene fragrances with about 18-20 per box. So well worth the money I saved so much I got express shipping.</li>
            <li> Some smell great, others meh</li>
            <li> aside from the nag champa in this set, they smell awful.  like the scent things that are used in urinals to cover up bad smells.  gross.</li>
            <li> This set of 12 Satya Sai incense packs is my ultimate favorite. So many incense brands smell great in the box, but smell like burning stick when you light them. Satya Sai, with their cult-classic Nag Champa in the blue box, is a brand I have trusted for decades to smell fantastic, each and every stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before having purchased this set from Amazon, I had tried Nag Champa, Super Hit and Celestial. I had never really been exposed to the other fragrances. There is a great variety to choose from and, though I have some favorites, they all suit my taste. I merely need to pick a fragrance to fit my daily mood, to open my window and to light a stick before setting off to go about my housechores, work or hobbies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could cite all the fragrances and what they smell like to me, but scent is such a subjective thing. This is a good deal, if you like incense, consider trying this set. See what you like/don&#x27;t like. You may get lucky and enjoy them all, as I do! :-)</li>
            <li> these are great, and while I liked some scent better than others, they are all very nice and reasonably long lasting</li>
            <li> Fantastic variety and well worth the price!! They burn slowly and the calming scent fills my house! Perfect for when I meditate!</li>
            <li> i love this incense. now i know my favourite kinds of satya incense and can order those individually. this arrived in good time, and was in good condition.</li>
            <li> some of the scents are a bit too flowery for me, so i use them outside on my balcony to cover up my disgusting neighbor&#x27;s disgusting cigarette smoke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these arrive quite quickly.</li>
            <li> beats paying $5 a box at the liquor store. Not all the scents are amazing but there are tons to choose from</li>
            <li> They all come in one box in a 3x4 set up. All flavors are incredible (except maybe one, in my opinion. Totally worth the buy. Have bought it a few times and you definitely get quite a bang for your buck here. This is an incense lover&#x27;s dream.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scents great value for the money, but VERY STRONG. Be warned.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time ! Will buy again ! Thank you !</li>
            <li> some of the pack are just junk.&lt;br /&gt;they smell as if they are bathroom spray for a public restroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is my first review and i&#x27;m an old man, the junk is THAT bad&lt;br /&gt;peace</li>
            <li> This was a really good price. It got here fast. The first one I opened was Super Hit and it was pretty good. Tried other ones and some are so so and some are good. Cheaper then the stores here.</li>
            <li> These smell amazing.  I have people compliment the smell of my home because of these.  This amount lasts you a very long time too.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of wonderful incense sticks.</li>
            <li> A nice mix to change up things and to suit your mood. Good for freshening the air, praying, meditation etc.</li>
            <li> This box was such a pleasant surprise.  Going to reorder them as&lt;br /&gt;price is great and they have such a pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but these all seem to smell the same.  They all smell like regular Nag Champa to me.  I recommend the Dragon&#x27;s Blood incense.  I got it around the same time and use it way more than these.  These will probably be retired in my house.</li>
            <li> Not only are these incense sticks a very good price, but they are high quality and richly scented. I have been a long-time Nag Champa scent lover, but wanted to see what some of the scents smelled like so I figured I would order a variety pack. Each scent is unique and beautiful. I will be buying the variety set every time my sticks start getting low. Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> underwhelming.  Long story short, this just doesn&#x27;t burn well.  Inconsistent.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Every scent is wonderful! Fabulous.</li>
            <li> My favorite incense, never tried the multi-pack before.</li>
            <li> So many different incense scents to smell and see if I like, I really love Midnight, it calms the room and can be used at any time of the year and it will feel right!</li>
            <li> I previously bought the Set of 6 x 15g Boxes Incense, and I loved them. I loved the smell and the fact that each incense stick lasts about two hours. When I finished the previous set, I decided to buy this one, hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy them as often. And I made a big mistake - the quality of these is worse than the Set of 6 boxes. Each stick lasts about half an hour, and they smell cheap. It seems to me that they lowered the quality for the Set of 12. If I could do it again, I would just order the Set of 6 twice.</li>
            <li> to many variety to choice from...and all are great...i awesome product...you will not regret getting one...</li>
            <li> Nice set, worth the extra $ sticks are a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; short but it matters not.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve purchased this item &amp; I luv it the price is good,  it doesn&#x27;t burn too fast &amp; I luv the variety of scents</li>
            <li> There are a few scents that are bold. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that but overall, I like them.</li>
            <li> Great deal, I love how these smell. The Jasmine is my favorite. Much cheaper here than in stores.</li>
            <li> Good deal ! GOOD STRONG fragrance !</li>
            <li> These scents were just awesome. The only one we didn&#x27;t like was rainforest. But all the rest were lovely and relaxing. Out favorite was Jasmine Blossom and we&#x27;ve opted to just buy a large box of that one going forward. Soooo relaxing.</li>
            <li> iT GIVES OUR HOUSE, A SCENT OF BEING IN A MAGIC LAND FAR AWAY, IT GIVES YOU A INNER PEACE AND TAKES YOU TO A WONDERFUL STATE OF NIRVANA</li>
            <li> I love Nag Champa. It is the only incense I&#x27;ve ever used that I liked the smell and wasn&#x27;t obnoxious with the smoke. So it was great to try this value pack and try a bunch of other scents. This will last you a long time, and some of them are really unique. Still none are better than the original blue box Nag Champa, but that one is included, too.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance however, they have small stems</li>
            <li> I love the Nag Champa incense is an easy way to make any room smell really nice, and the package gives you a really good selection.</li>
            <li> I really like all of the difference scents, they burn evenly and i do not need to watch them as carefully as scented candles</li>
            <li> Let me just say that this is my favorite incense maker so I was stoked to see the &amp;#34;bargain buy&amp;#34; (you will easily pay triple for all these individually at a local store) with new scents I haven&#x27;t tried. The sticks were all good quality long burners with wonderful lasting aromas. For price, quality, and satisfaction I give this five stars. Now, on to the different fragrances. I could tell you which ones I loved and hated and tell you this sucks so don&#x27;t try it, but keep in mind smell preference varies from individuals so you won&#x27;t know for yourself until you try it. Some people hate the jasmine blossom and some love it, the same for fortune and so on, so it really just depends on you. For the record I like them all except for sunrise. However my husband liked sunrise just fine. For the ones saying they smell &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; there are two that do give off that clean soap smell yes, but those are nicely suited for freshening up your bathroom. Jasmine blossom can be overwhelming in a small area but is very well suited for more open spaces. You just have to experiment for yourself. All in all great price for a great product, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> They all kind of smell the same. But I feel like I&#x27;ll never run out so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Most of these smell really bad.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying month after month at the store, buy this wonderful collection and save money.&lt;br /&gt;Quality at it&#x27;s best price!</li>
            <li> These light easy and burn long.  They come in such a great variety and ship fast, I have ordered them several times and don&#x27;t buy from anywhere else</li>
            <li> All the different scents were nice, only 1 that I did not like. Will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Incense pack. It&#x27;s quite big. You&#x27;ll get a year set of something to burn in your apartment for a nice smell. Great pack. And attempt to try many Sai Baba incense. I like them most of all.</li>
            <li> Great incense with a great variety.</li>
            <li> Nearly all of these scents are nice, although you may not be able to distinguish them all. The rainforest scent is more like an overwhelming soap scent that I can taste, which I find unpleasant.</li>
            <li> First of all, I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this product was delivered. It was lickety-split and I really appreciate that. No shipping charges either. This incense is fine quality and priced very reasonably. Buying the set of 12 gives even more value. I love all the scents and I use this throughout my house. I recommend this item from this seller. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Lovely I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon I love my incenses and they last sooo long I just ran out so I&#x27;ll be ordering more :}</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic assortment at a very good price.  Nag Champa makes wonderful products.  Anyone who has used them will know this</li>
            <li> These all smell wonderful</li>
            <li> A lot of these scents don&#x27;t seem to be made the same as others. When some (about half of the incense scents) are lit, it burns differently and does not smell as pleasant, having more of a &amp;#34;fire burn&amp;#34; scent. Others seem to work normally and I love them, but the 3 stars is for the poor quality in at least half of the scents provided.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, it&#x27;s really strong, and there is a lot to offer!</li>
            <li> This is a really inexpensive way to sample tons of different scents.  I really haven&#x27;t found one that I hate yet and I have discovered some great new ones!</li>
            <li> Good value. Some good scents in there.</li>
            <li> Just a amazing collection. Pick the scent according to your mood. I love the midnight scent :)</li>
            <li> I love the various smells. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great assortment of incense.  The Nag Champa scent is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> The assortment is perfect.  We have bought it twice and will buy again.  The quality and burn rate is great.</li>
            <li> Love it, excellent service!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn these as much as I used to, but they last decently long, and smell up the entire house. Definitely helps for when my gf &amp; I used to smoke in her room.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past and it&#x27;s money well spent, if you enjoy incense.  It comes packaged in a nice box with the twelve scents in individual boxes within the outer packaging.  You get at least a dozen, and usually more in each box.  I enjoy all the scents.  There&#x27;s not much more to say other than you can&#x27;t go wrong buying this particular variety.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great way to find your favorites, or light scent by your mood. Very top quality incense, burns well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re sure to find something you like with this set. There are a few that are trash worthy right away, but the ones that hit (Celestial, Fortune, etc.) are really nice. Definitely worth a purchase if you&#x27;re unsure about what scents you might enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still can&#x27;t find the incense from the movie &amp;#34;The Devil Inside&amp;#34; premiere promotional item  which I was hoping to uncover with this box. :(</li>
            <li> The assortment gives me a wide range to play with and  if I want to gift a friend I&#x27;ll be recommending this vendor.</li>
            <li> Great choice of different incenses! Just a word of advice though, stay away from jasmine blossom like the others suggest. I thought &#x27;Hey! I like jasmine, I&#x27;ll try it anyway&#x27; and in a minute I was drowning the thing in water and trying to air out the house. It&#x27;s terrible. The rest aren&#x27;t nearly as bad though and you have a great variety to choose from.</li>
            <li> I bought this package to explore incense, and I couldn&#x27;t even open the box before my entire house was permeated with the overwhelming smell of patchouli oil and dreadlocks. I put it in a sealed garbage bag, and that didn&#x27;t even help. The smell was so overwhelming I had to throw it out before I could even light any of them.</li>
            <li> love all the different scents! AWESOME. Fast ship. Thank you.</li>
            <li> assortment is pleasant and lasted over a year.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s Nag Champa........It IS beautiful and potent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a pure Nag Champa fan and have been nothing but thrilled with every scent created.  We adore this purchase and will definitely reordering once we&#x27;ve burned through this entirely.</li>
            <li> If you are not burning incense in your home, you may want to start. It is one of the most zen habits I started years ago, thanks to the impact of yoga and meditation in my life and it has been remarkable. Not only does the smell kill off any other undesirable smells and scents, but it is mesmerizing to watch the smoke rise from the incense into the air - it has the calming meditative effect of wine! Seriously LOVE this collection, every single one smells wonderful and it is a STRONG incense. If you&#x27;re not used to it, then you should only burn about 1/3 of each incense for a relatively large room and let yourself grow used to it. Love LOVE this brand and would buy it yet again.</li>
            <li> Most smell great, bought for my girlfriend. She loves them!</li>
            <li> THEY SMELL ABSOLUTLEY WONDERFUL</li>
            <li> Great variety!  Good deal.</li>
            <li> great variety of some awesome incense</li>
            <li> Great smells that last all day even when incense is burnt out.</li>
            <li> love these always get them when i run out</li>
            <li> My previous purchase of &#x27;Set of 6&#x27; was wonderful - This &#x27;Set of 12&#x27; just added 5 SOAPY smelling odors that we had to throw away - They truly smell like burning soap - These include the following: Romance, Fortune, Rain Forest, Jasmine Blossom, Blessings - The &#x27;6 Set&#x27;, Nag Champa, Sunrise, Sandalwood, Midnight (or Super Hit), Patchouli, Celestial is excellent.....</li>
            <li> Some boxes had incense in plastic bags &amp; they smelled like chemicals when burned. Yuck 😕&lt;br /&gt;But more than half smelled really nice. Its a good way to sample all the different scents. I love nag champa!</li>
            <li> I found This to be  a nice deal on Amazon, and I felt it was a good deal to take advantage of. So I say it was a good deal for the buck.  SW</li>
            <li> Fantastic! You get a ton of different incense and a lot of incense sticks in each box. We have had fun trying them all out and figuring out which ones we love!</li>
            <li> This pack has a great variety and an amazing price, comparable to brands you&#x27;d find in Wal-Mart. However, unlike Wal-Mart incense most of these scents are great! I thought Romance and Rain Forest were a bit generic, like a scented soap. Otherwise, these sticks last about 20 minutes. These sticks are a bit stronger than what I&#x27;m used to, though some scents are stronger than others, and need to be placed further away or even in a different room to get a more balanced strength.</li>
            <li> Strong scent on some but like how they last longer than most incense.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa has always been my favorite brand. After trying this out a few years back, I have never again spent money trying other incenses out. These are simply the best. Just compare the amount of smoke the cheap stuff produces when you light them up. When they are of bad quality they light up immediately and produce a lot of dark smoke. (You can see some sort of oil in the tip). Plus, the after smell from the cheap stuff is not that nice either. After continuous use it  leaves your home smelling of burnt paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just the best out there and at great price too.!!</li>
            <li> For incense lovers...a great way to check out a variety  of scents.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> Excellent selection. top qulity. Beats buying local with smqlller selections.Good goodm good goood good good good Good good Good Good.</li>
            <li> such variety and such a great price will buy again</li>
            <li> this is a great variety of scents that provide comfort. Nag Champa is my all time favorite, but I enjoy discovering the different  scents in different moods or rooms of my house. Super Hit says it decreases the negative and increases the positive for all zodiac signs. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually does, but I guess I can&#x27;t complain! I&#x27;m going to give this as a gift to someone that enjoys candles and home decor. I think she&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> This was an awesome set! Comes in a large box so I don&#x27;t have all the individual boxes floating around the house! Love the variety and I can&#x27;t wait to smell all of them!!! ^_^</li>
            <li> Not knowing what all 12 would smell like, I&#x27;ve found that quite a few are somewhat pungent. I doubt I&#x27;ll use them at all. Although they are intact and fresh and the sent is definitely strong.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.  When I first received it, was not clear that there were actually 12 different scents in the exterior box.  I wrote a note into the seller, they clarified that I had to open the outside of the box and sure enough there were 12 different scents.  I have mostly given up candles in favor of incense.  I love the smell it leaves behind and much cleaner smelling  for much longer than a candle.  Thanks I love it!</li>
            <li> GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Sunrise&lt;br /&gt;2. Romance&lt;br /&gt;3. Fortune&lt;br /&gt;4. Rain Forest&lt;br /&gt;5. Sandalwood&lt;br /&gt;6. Blessings&lt;br /&gt;7. Jasmine Blossom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MIXED FEELINGS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Nag Champa&lt;br /&gt;2. Midnight&lt;br /&gt;3. Celestial (Smells similar to urine I think)&lt;br /&gt;4. Super Hit&lt;br /&gt;5. Patchouli Forest</li>
            <li> I havent tried all yet but these are good quality so far</li>
            <li> This is a good way to try out many of the incense like  Nag Champa. They have many different kinds I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll enjoy it. I myself prefer Nag Chompa, but that&#x27;s just my taste.</li>
            <li> I have bought incense before but none have come strait out of the box with as much smell as this set did.  I did not even need to burn it before my room smelled of incense.  I cant decide if thats a good thing or a bad thing.  To be honest, this is probably the best incense I have used in a while.  Why did I not rate it 5 stars?  Because it seems to burn fast, and because its still is not really the smell I am looking for.  All incense I have tried, including this one, carries a slight chemical smell that I wish I could get rid of.  I dont get it burning scented candles or other such smell burning products.  Oh well...</li>
            <li> I love the variety of this pack!  I enjoy all the different smells and think this is a great value.</li>
            <li> My favorite. Best insense I&#x27;ve ever used. Never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Usually when i read negative ratings even one or two im cautious about buying but i used to burn Nag Champa brand incense religiously . I only have tried 2 types (Nag Champa and Midnight) and were always my favorite so i took a chance with the whole set. I have burned about 6 different kinds and not one has disappointed me yet. Im starting to realize from the other comments about some smelling like soaps or bathrooms but to be honest they are made of woods  resins  and ambers that might give an off scent but when burned give it a totally different effect so if you buy this don&#x27;t shrug it off without at least lighting it. They are very strong and linger a while and all have amazing different smells. My absolute new favorite is fortune, and even my room mate who has asthma says he enjoys them a lot. Being a fan of Nag Champa sometimes one box of 10-15 sticks goes for 3 bucks so you are paying the price of 5 boxes and getting 7 free!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrances will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> Nag Champa brand is mass-produced; sometimes you get poor batches, but most of the time, you get top-quality scents. I find that a few of them kind of smell the same, but none of them smell bad. Nag Champa is one of the few authentic incense brands people use - many go for the cheap crap you get at wal-mart or the like that&#x27;s half the cost and gives you a headache from horrible ingredients. Bubblegum incense? Are you kidding me? No, just get your Nag Champa, burn one a few times a day or as needed, and your entire abode will sigh with tranquility. That&#x27;s the point. And, if you are new to this, don&#x27;t worry. This is a set of all 12 popular scents at a great price!</li>
            <li> Variety is the spice with this romantic collection.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase, my home smells incredible. My favorites are &amp;#34;Romance&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Blessings&amp;#34;, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of them.</li>
            <li> great variety pack!  good value &amp; great price!</li>
            <li> mm so sophisticated smelling i love them all</li>
            <li> When i got them they smelled beautiful before i even unboxed them. Some smell better than others, of course, but overall i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. They were right on time too.</li>
            <li> I love them, I used one everyday in different parts of the house.  I feel more relaxed and serene when I use them.</li>
