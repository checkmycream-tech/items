            <li>Great price for my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>Tea Rose eau de toilette spray,  is my very favorite  and has been for about 20 years.   </li>
            <li>(It was to be either this, or $20-$30 roses that cost $10 more just to deliver!)</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find it here on Amazon and for such a good price!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume!</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>it is ideal for day wear since it is mild, flowery and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It must be popular because it has been on the market for years.</li>
            <li>It smells nice though.      </li>
            <li>(a tea rose fragrance though...</li>

            <li>and I love my Tea Rose.    </li>
            <li>This is a very clean, no nonsense rose scent.</li>
            <li>She is happy and I am happy to find on Amazon what she could no longer find locally.</li>
            <li>I was happy  to note that  it has a light fresh rose fragrance, which lasts.</li>
            <li>It awakens sweet memories of your childhood and youth - the years of happiness.</li>
            <li>excellent condition, nicely packed, didn&#x27;t take me long to get it.</li>
            <li>The perfume has a light floral rose scent.  </li>
            <li>In that I&#x27;m to embark on a plane,  the airlines allows nothing more than 3 oz bottles.   </li>
            <li>It would work better if the lotion had a spray cap.  </li>
            <li>Men love it.  </li>
            <li>if you love roses</li>
            <li>&#x3D;).  </li>
            <li>I love,  </li>
            <li>This is the 1st Amazon purchase I have not been completely satisfied with in over a decade.</li>
            <li>the spray was ok</li>
            <li>I love to use it on my linens.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>I just Love the smell of a fresh cut rose, this is definitely worth the money!!!  </li>
            <li>for such good service and thanks -  Perfumer&#x27;s Workshop Ltd. for a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this set, as I have never found the body lotion before &amp; have wanted it for over 20 yrs!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like there had been lotion in the bottom of the tube &amp; someone filled it up to the top w/water.</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T USE PURCHASE A WHOLE PERFUME SET, BUT THE PRICE WAS SO GOOD</li>
            <li>It was such a good deal!</li>
            <li>All you need is a bit, because it is strong.</li>
            <li>The Tea Rose perfume is like the old fashion rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smells so strongly and I have a headache...</li>
            <li>While the Tea rose perfume is fine, the body lotion is virtually unuseable, as it is very runny (like milk!)</li>
            <li>If it wasnt for the fact that the bottle of perfume is just fine</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a pure rose scent.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic fragrance.</li>
            <li>i spray all the light bulbs in my bedrm, dressingrm, entry hall, den &amp; bathrm.</li>
            <li>in the morning spray your light bulbs when they are off.</li>
            <li>I am sooo happy to have found this fabulously romantic scent here on Amazon.com!   </li>
            <li>The scent opens up beautifully and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>However, the seller made good and refunded me adequately, so I am pleased overall.</li>
            <li>Many thanks, Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li>has it&#x27;s original scent.</li>
            <li>love this perfume - lots of thanks to its creators!</li>
            <li>es original no es copia.</li>
            <li>--- it has very clear rose notes.  </li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE SCENT,... GET POSITIVE COMMENTS ALL THE TIME,...</li>
            <li>But if you are looking to the true scent of roses, this one is it</li>
            <li>I have used Tea Rose for years, I&#x27;ts the one fragrance people comment about when I&#x27;m near.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a sweet and over-powering fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My friends say to me that they know I am around when they smell the sweet roses.</li>
            <li>IT is the most beautiful long lasting sent that truly smells like tea roses..</li>
            <li>Perfect and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Absolutely adore this natural scent of a fresh tea rose.</li>
            <li>Fun to wear in the summer.  </li>
            <li>If you actually go into a perfume store and request a pure tea rose fragrance, they&#x27;ll scoff at you and say,</li>
            <li>&quot;  I have&#x27;nt been able to find it in local stores.</li>
            <li>since roses have so many different aromas).</li>
            <li>No problems with the seller, and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I remembered she used to wear Tea Rose when I was a child, but she hadn&#x27;t had it in years due to lack of availability in stores.</li>
            <li>Well....maybe this pure and natural rose fragrance is the fragrance of youth because young guys are only drawn to me because of this light and natural fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Thanks - Amazon.com  </li>
            <li>I ordered this shipped straight to my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>My wife has always found it difficult to find rose scented perfumes and body wash that actually had the right scent of rose and</li>
            <li>I love the perfume, but the lotion was just grainy and extremely runny.  </li>
            <li>It is such a unique scent.</li>
            <li>I have found my new signature sent!</li>
            <li>Very uncomplicated and appropriate for everyday as well as evening.</li>
            <li>would highly reccommend this</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine for years but not easy to find in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>The smell is delicate, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>Lotion has a more condensed, less fresh fragrance; almost a little fruity.</li>
            <li>It is far too liquid to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for about 10 years and started wearing it in my early 20s.  </li>
            <li>You are too young.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s for old ladies.\\</li>
            <li>Huge mess!</li>
            <li>The lotion is very thin, and watery......little difficult to use., but lotion is most pleasant</li>
            <li>The toilet water is good but the lotion was a thin as water and is not useful.  </li>
            <li>(I got it for under $15, shipped free with her other small gift.)</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s for old ladies.\\</li>
            <li> Huge mess!</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thin, and watery......little difficult to use., but lotion is most pleasant</li>
            <li> The toilet water is good but the lotion was a thin as water and is not useful.  </li>
            <li> (I got it for under $15, shipped free with her other small gift.)</li>
            <li> Its similar to the Jo Malone perfume (but far less costly)</li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I would have given far less stars.</li>
            <li> Must have been on shelf for a long time.  </li>
            <li> somewhere?\\&quot; not knowing it was actually my perfume and not a bouquet hidden somewhere.      </li>
            <li> I spent a penny on this crape.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t even worth dealing w/the weird consistency.</li>
            <li> This classic simple fragrance can be difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I like it alone or combined with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> (Doesnt last as long as the JM, or have the same lightness--but the comparison is unfair.)</li>
            <li> It is hard to find.. especially the lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the subtle fragrance you get when you are standing next to a bouquet of roses</li>
            <li> but I have worn it before, having purchased it previously when visiting the USA.   </li>
            <li> Not worth a nickel!</li>
            <li> When I turned the tubed upside down to squeeze onto my leg, the sludge splashed onto my leg and dripped everywhere!</li>
            <li> It is not heavy, cloying or overly complicated.</li>
            <li> The only thing I was annoyed with</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.. I have been using this for about  years and it is by far my signature sent.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to receive it.   </li>
            <li> I recommend sticking to the perfume alone &amp; skipping this pointless, useless set.</li>
            <li> The scent was so faint</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely useless because the runny consistency is NOT lotion, impossible to control &amp; can&#x27;t be spread around like lotion since it&#x27;s a liquid.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> I hate</li>
            <li> This is horrible!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not too fragrant.  Fun to wear in the summer.  The perfume has a light floral rose scent.  It must be popular because it has been on the market for years.</li>
            <li> While the Tea rose perfume is fine, the body lotion is virtually unuseable, as it is very runny (like milk!) and spills all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The scent is exquisitely rose-like. The only reason why this is not getting 5 stars is that the lotion for some reason is too fluid that one has to refrigerate it, otherwise it will flow too swiftly like bottled water.</li>
            <li> This is a very clean, no nonsense rose scent. It is not heavy, cloying or overly complicated. The scent opens up beautifully and lasts a long time. I like it alone or combined with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Fantastic fragrance. All you need is a bit, because it is strong. But if you are looking to the true scent of roses, this one is it</li>

            <li> She is happy and I am happy to find on Amazon what she could no longer find locally. I will be ordering when she runs out</li>
            <li> Tea Rose eau de toilette spray,  is my very favorite  and has been for about 20 years.   Its my personal \\&quot;scent\\&quot;.   In that I&#x27;m to embark on a plane,  the airlines allows nothing more than 3 oz bottles.   Hence - I had to scramble around to find something that would be allowed.    Found it on Amazon - the 2 oz bottle - ordered it and it arrived within about 4 days of the order.   I truly like doing business with Amazon.com - and I love my Tea Rose.    Thanks - Amazon.com  for such good service and thanks -  Perfumer&#x27;s Workshop Ltd. for a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shipped straight to my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day. (It was to be either this, or $20-$30 roses that cost $10 more just to deliver!) I remembered she used to wear Tea Rose when I was a child, but she hadn&#x27;t had it in years due to lack of availability in stores. I was very happy to find it here on Amazon and for such a good price! (I got it for under $15, shipped free with her other small gift.) It arrived in plenty of time and she loved it! She was impressed with the beautiful packaging and said it is a wonderful perfume! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a pure rose scent.  This one fits the bill. Perfect and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume, but the lotion was just grainy and extremely runny.  As soon as I removed the cap, it poured out.  It is far too liquid to use.  It would work better if the lotion had a spray cap.  It smells nice though.      I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for about 10 years and started wearing it in my early 20s.  Men love it.  Guys I didn&#x27;t even know would come closer and compliment me.  Some would say, \\&quot;do you smell roses somewhere?\\&quot; not knowing it was actually my perfume and not a bouquet hidden somewhere.      If you actually go into a perfume store and request a pure tea rose fragrance, they&#x27;ll scoff at you and say, \\&quot;oh, you don&#x27;t want that. You are too young. That&#x27;s for old ladies.\\&quot;  Well....maybe this pure and natural rose fragrance is the fragrance of youth because young guys are only drawn to me because of this light and natural fragrance.  It isn&#x27;t a sweet and over-powering fragrance.  It&#x27;s like the subtle fragrance you get when you are standing next to a bouquet of roses (a tea rose fragrance though...since roses have so many different aromas).</li>
            <li> if you love roses this is a wonderful scent. i spray all the light bulbs in my bedrm, dressingrm, entry hall, den &amp; bathrm. in the morning spray your light bulbs when they are off. just a couple of skurts then when you come home in the evening turn on your lights &amp; ooh the wonderful scent of roses fills the room. it&#x27;s very strong so alittle goes along way...</li>
            <li> This classic simple fragrance can be difficult to find. Very uncomplicated and appropriate for everyday as well as evening. I&#x27;ve purchased this perfume several times over the years since I wore it on my wedding day &#x3D;).  Its similar to the Jo Malone perfume (but far less costly) --- it has very clear rose notes.  (Doesnt last as long as the JM, or have the same lightness--but the comparison is unfair.) Lotion has a more condensed, less fresh fragrance; almost a little fruity.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for an excellent price!  Buy this if you are looking for Tea Rose!</li>
            <li> The toilet water is good but the lotion was a thin as water and is not useful.  However, the seller made good and refunded me adequately, so I am pleased overall.</li>
            <li> I am sooo happy to have found this fabulously romantic scent here on Amazon.com!   I am a Canadian and we can&#x27;t buy it here but I have worn it before, having purchased it previously when visiting the USA.   The price is awesome too for the two piece gift set. I can hardly wait to receive it.   Many thanks, Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of mine for years but not easy to find in stores anymore.  it is ideal for day wear since it is mild, flowery and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! It is such a unique scent. My friends say to me that they know I am around when they smell the sweet roses. The only thing I was annoyed with is that the lotion was a bit too watery. It could have just been a one time product problem. However, I still recommend this product to anyone that I do not know. I don&#x27;t want to run into people that have the same signature scent as I.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume.  She was thrilled to receive this gift for Christmas.  The Tea Rose perfume is like the old fashion rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> IT CAME QUICKLY AND EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT,... GOOD PRODUCT, GOOD PRICE, GOOD SERVICE,... MY FAVORITE SCENT,... GET POSITIVE COMMENTS ALL THE TIME,...</li>
            <li> I just Love the smell of a fresh cut rose, this is definitely worth the money!!!  would highly reccommend this</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T USE PURCHASE A WHOLE PERFUME SET, BUT THE PRICE WAS SO GOOD I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> excellent condition, nicely packed, didn&#x27;t take me long to get it. has it&#x27;s original scent. the scent lasts for hours, even the lotion too.</li>
            <li> It was such a good deal! I was happy  to note that  it has a light fresh rose fragrance, which lasts.</li>
            <li> This is horrible! The lotion is like creamy water and smells like roses and urine!  I hate I spent a penny on this crape. Not worth a nickel!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product! The smell is delicate, fresh, and clean. It smells just like the inside of a florists shop. Its not an overwelming sent, but very pleasant. I have found my new signature sent! Will definitly be ordering again. No problems with the seller, and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Makes you feel feminine and desired. Absolutely adore this natural scent of a fresh tea rose. It awakens sweet memories of your childhood and youth - the years of happiness. I love,  love this perfume - lots of thanks to its creators!</li>
            <li> My wife has always found it difficult to find rose scented perfumes and body wash that actually had the right scent of rose and now an overwhleming odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance and hit the jackpot. She love the products and is very happy with the selection.</li>
            <li> Fu&amp;eacute; despachado a tiempo y lleg&amp;oacute; en perfectas condiciones.El perfume es original no es copia.El precio excelente tambi&amp;eacute;n. Vale la pena comprarlo. Lo recomiendo.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this set, as I have never found the body lotion before &amp; have wanted it for over 20 yrs! Used it as soon as it came. The lotion was the consistency of melted ice cream! When I turned the tubed upside down to squeeze onto my leg, the sludge splashed onto my leg and dripped everywhere! Huge mess! I shook the tube and it sounded like water was in it. The scent was so faint it wasn&#x27;t even worth dealing w/the weird consistency. It&#x27;s like there had been lotion in the bottom of the tube &amp; someone filled it up to the top w/water. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. It&#x27;s absolutely useless because the runny consistency is NOT lotion, impossible to control &amp; can&#x27;t be spread around like lotion since it&#x27;s a liquid. Extremely disappointed in this purchase. If it wasnt for the fact that the bottle of perfume is just fine I would have given far less stars. I recommend sticking to the perfume alone &amp; skipping this pointless, useless set. This is the 1st Amazon purchase I have not been completely satisfied with in over a decade. Wish I could get a portion of my money back.</li>
            <li> the spray was ok the lotion was water and had no scent.  Must have been on shelf for a long time.  Will never buy again</li>
            <li> I purchase just what I wanted. The perfume smells just like roses. The scent is long lasting. Not only do I spray it on myself,  I love to use it on my linens.</li>
            <li> It says on here that there is one left when actually they are sold out! What a disappointment.. I have been using this for about  years and it is by far my signature sent. It is hard to find.. especially the lotion and I wanted to purchase it with my son&#x27;s Amazon gift card. IT is the most beautiful long lasting sent that truly smells like tea roses..</li>
            <li> Great price for my favorite perfume.  The lotion is very thin, and watery......little difficult to use., but lotion is most pleasant</li>
            <li> It smells so strongly and I have a headache...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommended it.&lt;br /&gt;My husband hates.</li>
            <li> This is so wonderful.  I have gotten so many compliments on it.  Mind you I haven&#x27;t tried the lotion but the perfume is awesome.</li>
