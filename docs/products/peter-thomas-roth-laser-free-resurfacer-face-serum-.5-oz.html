            <li>Great price on Amazon as well!!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>I promise you will Love it!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Peter Thomas Roth Face Serum for 3 months and I am extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>This is a great wrinkle-smoother.</li>
            <li>NO ALLERGY, NO untoward effect, this is really good .</li>
            <li>I seriously love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li>It takes about 1.5-2 weeks to see good results but it was worth it as nothing else I have tried reduces redness.</li>
            <li>it knocked off so many layers of skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, at my age I shouldn&#x27;t have acne, but I do.  </li>
            <li>not saying I look 30 any more</li>
            <li>but the pump mechanism on the top of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;quit</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>more youthful ..</li>
            <li>It seems to work just fine</li>
            <li>Love this product very much!</li>
            <li>At age 60 with moderate sun damage I&#x27;m happy to say PTR has evened out my skin tone, reduced pore size and faded a couple of sun spots.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and makeup, then, goes on well.</li>
            <li>but I can say I&#x27;m pleased with how my skin looks right now for being 60.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe if you are a normal 40ish woman who does not get breakouts like I do and use an additional moisturizer this would probably be an excellent product, because it does seem to work for smoothing out skin tone and even out sun damage and maybe lessen appearance of wrinkles as well, but if you get the occasional hormonal breakouts this will not help.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m nearing the bottom, but that&#x27;s from using a GENEROUS (2 full pumps) twice a day.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been in such good shape since my 30&#x27;s.....</li>
            <li>The wrinkles are Gone!&amp;#34;  I even wrote to Peter Thomas Roth and they were quick to respond and thank me for the feedback.</li>
            <li>PTR products are well worth the price</li>
            <li>I rarely give anything a 5,  there is aways some room for improvement,but this comes close.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the full-size bottle from Amazon right away.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my friend&#x27;s mother， she said it is pretty useful for her mother，</li>
            <li>it has little scent,is smooth, absorbs almost instantly, and feels good!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried Peter T Roth products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update, 2 Months Later: I love this product.</li>
            <li>So I tried for the first time and I will give my opinion...</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Love this combined with scrub and moisturizer from same line.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other PTR products and have been happy with everything.  </li>
            <li>I have a huge problem with redness from acne scars and this actually worked.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve since read it might not be the real thing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much fresher ..</li>
            <li>younger and significantly reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Love it, works well with other PTR products I use</li>
            <li>does make my skin feel smooth, but you will need an additional moisturizer with it if your skin is prone to getting dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does blend well, can be worn under make up and does not feel greasy or heavy, no stinky smell or odors, so overall a good product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When ROC stopped selling their Daily Correction cream last year I tried a variety of other ROC products in addition to other retinol creams and wasn&#x27;t impressed with any of them.  </li>
            <li>,don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to this product, but I enjoy using it, and that makes it easier to stay &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it&#x27;s started to clear up -</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my extraordinarily sensitive skin - if anything, it&#x27;s helped the sensitivity by a lot.</li>
            <li>No uneven texture, no reddening after washing/sweating/exfoliating/exercising, no nothing.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>really like this--in my must-use daily regimen</li>
            <li>This is pleasantly light and delicately scented.</li>
            <li>Now two weeks after starting it, my skin is literally nearly clear.</li>
            <li>although I have still broken out at times and it did not hurriedly clear it up either, I had to actually use something else that does clear up the break outs quickly to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

            <li> This is the first time I have tried Peter T Roth products. I was not impressed with the results. I thought for the price it should show visible changes, however, after using for over 2 months, I see no visible changes.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!! I seriously Can&#x27;t say enough.  I went over to my sisters and she immediately said, &amp;#34; what is with your Face?! What the heck? The wrinkles are Gone!&amp;#34;  I even wrote to Peter Thomas Roth and they were quick to respond and thank me for the feedback. I seriously love this stuff! Great price on Amazon as well!!  Just try it! I promise you will Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with redness from acne scars and this actually worked. It takes about 1.5-2 weeks to see good results but it was worth it as nothing else I have tried reduces redness.</li>
            <li> Baby..it knocked off so many layers of skin.It never worked so well thereafter...Hhhmmm..or did it ?</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend&#x27;s mother， she said it is pretty useful for her mother， so I bought one.</li>
            <li> PTR products are well worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had severe cystic acne for a long time. Thankfully, it&#x27;s started to clear up - however, I was left with a lot of bad scarring and inflammation. I received this product as a sample from a recent Sephora order and was hooked immediately. After applying it just once in the morning, my skin already looked clearer by that night. I ordered the full-size bottle from Amazon right away. Now two weeks after starting it, my skin is literally nearly clear. I hardly wear foundation anymore. It&#x27;s even helped my acne! This is pleasantly light and delicately scented. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my extraordinarily sensitive skin - if anything, it&#x27;s helped the sensitivity by a lot. This is a must-own. I will use it forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 2 Months Later: I love this product. I would say that my scarring is about 75% gone. And by gone, I mean COMPLETELY gone. No uneven texture, no reddening after washing/sweating/exfoliating/exercising, no nothing. It hasn&#x27;t completely faded some of my darker and larger marks, but I don&#x27;t hold that against the product, they just need a little extra \\&quot;encouragement.\\&quot; I&#x27;m still using the same tube I ordered 2 months ago. I think I&#x27;m nearing the bottom, but that&#x27;s from using a GENEROUS (2 full pumps) twice a day. I am ordering another bottle of this!</li>
            <li> I rarely give anything a 5,  there is aways some room for improvement,but this comes close.  it has little scent,is smooth, absorbs almost instantly, and feels good!  I can say people don&#x27;t think I look my age,don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to this product, but I enjoy using it, and that makes it easier to stay &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The product and the service met my expectations. I would use this source again in the future. Product Met Expectations.</li>
            <li> WRINKLES REDUCED AFTER USING IT. NO ALLERGY, NO untoward effect, this is really good . Love this product very much!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, at my age I shouldn&#x27;t have acne, but I do.  This product keeps my skin clear and soft. Thank you Peter Thomas Roth</li>
            <li> product date is 2012,it is getting expired,will not recommond to buy .&lt;br /&gt;there is no box,not like what i bought from Peter thomas roth before.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is expensive.  I am&lt;br /&gt;over 50 and always use PTR products.  They do keep your skin&lt;br /&gt;looking younger and significantly reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> really like this--in my must-use daily regimen</li>
            <li> When ROC stopped selling their Daily Correction cream last year I tried a variety of other ROC products in addition to other retinol creams and wasn&#x27;t impressed with any of them.  I&#x27;ve been using Peter Thomas Roth Face Serum for 3 months and I am extremely happy with the results.  At age 60 with moderate sun damage I&#x27;m happy to say PTR has evened out my skin tone, reduced pore size and faded a couple of sun spots.  My skin hasn&#x27;t been in such good shape since my 30&#x27;s.....not saying I look 30 any more but I can say I&#x27;m pleased with how my skin looks right now for being 60.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other PTR products and have been happy with everything.  Highly recommend!!&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I&#x27;d started using PTR 10 years ago so you younger gals give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, works well with other PTR products I use</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Not too heavy.  Makes you glow.</li>
            <li> It seems to work just fine but the pump mechanism on the top of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;quit working leaving about half of the product in the bottle and no way to&lt;br /&gt;get it out.</li>
            <li> I think it works well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and feel like I have had an improvement in my overall complexion so I decided to commit to buying this larger bottle. Fingers crossed it continues to make a difference.</li>
            <li> So I tried for the first time and I will give my opinion...I like it in a lot of ways, although I do not think it does everything it claims.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for approximately a month and it has evened out my skin tone and lessened the breakouts a bit...although I have still broken out at times and it did not hurriedly clear it up either, I had to actually use something else that does clear up the break outs quickly to get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;It does make my skin feel smooth, but you will need an additional moisturizer with it if your skin is prone to getting dry. I believe if you are a normal 40ish woman who does not get breakouts like I do and use an additional moisturizer this would probably be an excellent product, because it does seem to work for smoothing out skin tone and even out sun damage and maybe lessen appearance of wrinkles as well, but if you get the occasional hormonal breakouts this will not help.&lt;br /&gt;It does blend well, can be worn under make up and does not feel greasy or heavy, no stinky smell or odors, so overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skin smooth and clear. I have added several other items to my skin care routine but never will replace this product. Sometimes I want to try other products, but I am afraid that my skin will revert back to a less than nice place, so I keep it in the routine. With this product, I noticed results within a week of use....love it!</li>
            <li> This product did not have the same consistency as what I&#x27;ve bought in Sephora before and I&#x27;ve since read it might not be the real thing. Wouldn&#x27;t risk it on my face.</li>
            <li> I like it!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great wrinkle-smoother. I recommend it to aging skin like mine. It goes on smoothly and makeup, then, goes on well.</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay but it does leave your skin &amp;#34;rosy&amp;#34; as it is red so I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> Love this combined with scrub and moisturizer from same line.  My skin looks so much fresher .. more youthful .. after one week!  Gonna try eye product next.</li>
