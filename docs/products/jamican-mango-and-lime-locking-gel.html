            <li>My dreadlocks love this product.</li>

            <li>/&gt;The result is a soft natural</li>
            <li>When I was using it, I was sure it was going to make my daughter&#x27;s hair look ashy when it dried because when I was twisting her hair with it, the product turned white and it oozed out through the strands.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product. I heard a lot about it on Youtube and decided to give it a try. It works great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product ever since i moved on from the greasy Bees Wax products for my hair. Not only does this gel not flake but it has incredible hold and smells amazing. When the local shop stop stocking this i was lucky to find it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this gel but I would only suggest you buy it if you want something that smells cheap and has way too much perfume in it. The scent is overwhelming and I&#x27;m so confused about companies assume that people who buy African hair products want products with ridiculously cheap fruity scents in them.</li>
            <li> I love it... have been locing for a year now... and this is phenom... no flaking and it leaves your hair soft not crunchy... my daughter has very 4a texture and this is the only gel that really manages her hair... she has been locing for 3 months... it smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li> This is my gel of choice!  Works well for my soft, thin hair.</li>
            <li> My dreadlocks have been growing strong since I started them May 2013. I attribute this to the locking gel by Mango &amp; Lime. I&#x27;ve washed my hair and the dreads are still strong. I am a true fan of this product and will continue to use it as my dreads continue their journey of growth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something lightweight that would not cause build up in my locs. This is a winner. You can retwist and let air dry it sit under a dryer. Good but wish it came in a larger form.</li>
            <li> Best gel for naturals . I have 4b hair . This product is holy grail status . No build up or white residue . Love !</li>
            <li> The best inexpensive product that I used for my dreads... the price is unbelievable for the size! you won&#x27;t find this unbelievable price anywhere in the hair store Walmart nowhere</li>
            <li> I only use this product to re-twist my locs. If you are looking for a great product to maintain your locs snd does not build up in your locs. Then this is perfect</li>
            <li> Although it makes my hair smell great it causes a disturbing amount of build up which actually made my hair look white when I wash it i would not recommend for anyone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week and a half since I applied this gel on my 6 year-old daughter&#x27;s hair to start her locs, and her hair still looks freshly done! When I was using it, I was sure it was going to make my daughter&#x27;s hair look ashy when it dried because when I was twisting her hair with it, the product turned white and it oozed out through the strands. Surprisingly, when dried the whiteness went away and her haired actually shined! Outstanding results for a low price. Y&#x27;all go ahead and get it and stop thinking about it. It has a pleasant fruity smell as well!</li>
            <li> Good to maintain dreads.&lt;br /&gt;It is not very strong; this is what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;The result is a soft natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is 4a; when not combed and not cut, it is making dreads.</li>
            <li> love it works great thx thx thxhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhh hhh h h h h h h h h hh hhhhhhh h</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair texture.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold hair. I won&#x27;t be buying this again!</li>
            <li> My dreadlocks love this product. I wonder if they have it in South Africa, I would like to stay with it.</li>
