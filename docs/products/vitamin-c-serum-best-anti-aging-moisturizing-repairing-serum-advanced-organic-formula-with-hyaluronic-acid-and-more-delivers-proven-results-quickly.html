            <li>you, Xfacio Labs, Amazon and Mia, best Customer Service ever!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!! :)</li>
            <li>I love this another wonderful product from Xfacio!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it looks much better, but I&#x27;ve been blessed with very good skin and at 44</li>
            <li>Xfacio Labs customer service seems really good, too.</li>
            <li>It was surprising what toxic chemicals all of these mainstream companies use.</li>
            <li>If your results are anything like mine, you&#x27;ll be delighted like I am.</li>
            <li>I loved the product.</li>
            <li>and I get lots of compliments on how my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li>but once I use a moisturizer it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li>I had wrote a review that I loved the product after a couple of days</li>
            <li>Good.  </li>
            <li>, i use it before or after the Hyaluric acid serum, goes perfectly with out leaving your face with a thicknes feeling; very fast results!</li>
            <li>I had a lot of prominent hereditary skin tags or moles on my face but they&#x27;ve shrunk or disappeared so my skin looks great now.</li>
            <li>The one great thing about this company though is that they will return your money no questions asked if you aren&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>It comes in a darkened 1 fl. oz./ 30 mL bottle, which is good for the serum, so it does not oxidize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found you!! :)</li>
            <li>Love this serum!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>why would I want another bottle of something in my cabinet that doesn&#x27;t work even if it is free?!?!  </li>
            <li>I want my free bottle of all of them because I know they WORK for me!!  </li>

            <li>Best Vitamin C serum I have found thus far!</li>
            <li>We both are very happy with these products and highly recommend XFACIO LABS to anyone looking to have truly healthy skin and not just a temporary fix.</li>
            <li>They e-mailed me to make sure I got each product and wondered how I liked it, etc.</li>
            <li>Best Vitamin C serum- natural , in 3 days.</li>
            <li>and I have to say , WOW I AM IMPRESSED!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best vitamin C serum that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear very much makeup and wanted my skin to look great</li>
            <li>First of all, the seller of this product is really great.  </li>
            <li>so moisture is very important.  </li>
            <li>I  am using it every day and my skin is healthy and glowing</li>
            <li>I have tried many a face product over the years and I must say I am sticking with this one.</li>
            <li>and I have sincerely noticed some brightening in my skin.  </li>
            <li>She did not even require me to return the damaged bottle as proof of my complain, as many companies require.</li>
            <li>I bought all 4 products from XFACIO and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin tone is more even and brighter.</li>
            <li>have assisted in many face lifts and have seen the results of the scarring, suture tears, misalignment, pain, etc...</li>
            <li>Best of all, they included some extra, helpful information about vitamin C serum and its uses: its ingredients, how to use it, what to expect from it, etc.</li>
            <li>love it 😊</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin feels smoother and my skin looks brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li>Also, I have never had better customer service.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am looking forward to more products from this XFACIO.</li>
            <li>Best of all, they included some extra, helpful information about vitamin C serum and its uses: its ingredients, how to use it, what to expect from it, etc.</li>
            <li>I also used some on my hands and noticed they look better too.</li>
            <li>I use it under the anti aging serum, and then apply my moisturizer on top of that.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to see my skin look more youthful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the best Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my age spots are lighter, and the crepe-y texture of my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a better outcome</li>
            <li>I really love this Vtamin C serum</li>
            <li>I started using this product last week underneath my anti-aging serum and its wonderful!!!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many products (or potions as my husband calls them) I have tried thru the years.  </li>
            <li>They sent me an email to make sure I had received the product and to make sure I had no questions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin seems to be brighter or more radiant, firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews (maybe I should :) ).  </li>
            <li>The customer service from this company is better than any</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the greatest facial products on the market.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m guessing more than a month.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>They send you an email to tell you how to use the product and then they send you another email to make sure you receive the product.</li>
            <li>second, the product itself is awesome</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The products arrived in a timely manner, and there were follow-up emails to make sure I was satisfied with delivery.  </li>
            <li>Love this serum.....</li>
            <li>:) .</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the free sample!  </li>
            <li>I am not going to say I don&#x27;t have any more lines because that is just not so</li>
            <li>say that I REALLY REALLY love it.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to use this around my eyes, as that&#x27;s one area that needs attention on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I am defiantly going to be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li>but I NEEDED TO DO THIS ONE3 .. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on better and NO primer is needed.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m encouraged and will continue to use it and expect to see even greater results.</li>
            <li>Much better than products I&#x27;ve paid five times more for.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many never had the result I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I had read many of the reviews so decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>This serum is sold on Amazon.com, like many others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li>I truly believe a wonderful product for those not sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Mia is such a incredible asset to her company and I hope that Xfacio knows how very fortunate they are to have her on their team.</li>
            <li>honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines around my eyes are fading :)</li>
            <li>In my opinion a serum is the most important part of any skincare regime.</li>
            <li>I take great care of my skin and of course like all of us, I want to look young forever...</li>
            <li>She was extremely helpful and sent wonderful information regarding the product, and how to use it.  </li>
            <li>imagine more noticeable results will take time but overall happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>if you use it every day with time it will have great results and the serum lasts and stays fresh much longer, no need to refrigerate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve super-sensitive skin that flares easy.  </li>
            <li>i strongly recommend product...</li>
            <li>Quick absorption and very light.</li>
            <li>Bright, vibrant, smooth.  </li>
            <li>Of all the serums I have tried, Xfacio&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>I can see the fine lines disappearing on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Notice fine line and wrinkles dissapearing.</li>
            <li>I can tell a difference in fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and i notice a difference in the fine lines on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Super product!</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will be able to catch some super discounts or maybe some samples soon.</li>
            <li>But so far I love the serum, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure with time, my skin will look better and better and I will be sure to come back and report if the discoloration improves.</li>
            <li>The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lined up to try this Advanced Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>The packaging is attractive and the dropper-top isn&#x27;t falling apart, like some of the similar bottles in the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it performs fabulously as an anti-aging free radicle scavenger that&lt;br /&gt;is non-irritating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>, I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few Vitamin C serums and of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel so smooth....</li>
            <li>I just started using this Advanced Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>Wife uses it daily since Christmas and works great</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and the results are visible immediately.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so smooth and even tighter....</li>
            <li>The serum goes on really smooth and absorbs in seconds.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it for about 3 weeks, but it has made a great difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>More of a golden glow.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful customer service and thank you for the free sample</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s important to me that anything I put on my face absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Goes on really smooth and appears to help my skin look fresher(I&#x27;m 61) so</li>
            <li>Alhtough I have seen cover models that do look good with uneven skin tones, it does not look good for me.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft with a nice healthy glow after I use all 4 products together.</li>
            <li>This item is good so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with the  Xfacio Labs™ Anti Aging Serum-An Advanced High Potency Natural Wrinkle Treatment which is also wonderful, non-greasy and quick drying.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE their products and I will continue using them forever and the price is right.... &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Would love to try other products from this company if they are as great as this one ..</li>
            <li>Again, Mia, my thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Customer service at Xfacio ( whose service is excellent ) has informed me that they are coming out with a new Vitamin C serum shortly.</li>
            <li>love it great product excellent service ,would highly recommend this product,left my skin feeling smoother and looking brighter in only a few days</li>
            <li>It made my skin radiant &amp; fresh looking!.</li>
            <li>Though they have the best customer service, however, after tried all the products, I&#x27;m not sure I will buy anything twice now.</li>
            <li>but this kept my make up look fresh all day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see something help with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight sinks in beautifully .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth to try it, ladies!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t call it a miracle since the only real miracle would be produced by a facelift, but it is a wonderful product that is worth the money and does what it promises.</li>
            <li>Feels fabulous on my face + looks very smooth and feels very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply -- has a fresh feel &amp; it appears to soften my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for 5 days, so I can&#x27;t speak long-term, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>The serum is fragrance free, dries quickly, and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>but so far I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This Vitamin C serum was one of the better I have tried recently, I found it made my skin look pretty good.</li>
            <li>I loved the original Xfacio face cream, which went above and beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>I am ordering the rest of the Xfacio products right now!</li>
            <li>- This is my absolute favorite skin product after a year of use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a number of so called age spots forming over the years and this wonderful serum is slowly making them fade away as well.</li>
            <li>If you want simple, effective and just plain wonderful try a bottle and you&#x27;ll be convinced.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle for sensitive skin and the results so far have been very good in the 2 areas that I was concerned about.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that it will live up to my expectations!</li>
            <li>I have order more for my mom,sister and some close friends, hope it does this same magic for them.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks; my skin feels more soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This serum absorbs quickly and is not at all oily.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>This product is amazing after a week of using  this vitamin c serum I saw a difference, my face was much tone and much brighter.</li>
            <li>It smooths on easily and doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle, but in just a few days of use, I&#x27;m seeing a remarkable difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the overall quality of this Exfacio product.</li>
            <li>First, I have to say that Mia is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>So far I love this product it is clean with no smelly after smell.  </li>
            <li>And it’s nice to know I’m actively preventing the signs of aging and helping to keep my skin healthy.</li>
            <li>As for the products, they go on easily and my skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The serum is a light, clear liquid that glides easily onto the skin and soaks in almost immediately.</li>
            <li>After ordering my first bottle FROM AMAZON, I received my first REAL bottle of this new REAL Advanced Vitamin C Serum and have completely fallen in love!</li>
            <li>Xfacio Labs was very prompt and attentive in their communications with me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Xfacio Labs was very prompt and attentive in their communications with me.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, non-greasy and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>With this product, I literally saw a very noticeable difference over night and a huge difference in just days.  </li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks I could definitely see the amazing difference in the way my face felt and looked.</li>
            <li>A sales rep sent an email after purchase explaining how to use the product, which was nice; however, there were multiple spelling and grammatical errors, which is a bit of a turn-off.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product on my hands after I received a complimentary bottle for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 52 and tried  all kind of serums and creams, I definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that my face looks younger and fresher.  </li>
            <li>and so it is also economical.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed by the skin and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Whether 30 or 80 it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I would love to share some products with my friends and who like me are into natural products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you get the point, right?</li>
            <li>This goes to work right away.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for my skin</li>
            <li>I started using it right</li>
            <li>Xfacio you guys got it right...</li>
            <li>You want a product that works right away.  </li>
            <li>I have given this serum a few weeks, and I must say it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>I like the smooth and vibrant feeling</li>
            <li>I’m very sensitive to fragrances, so I was pleased to find a natural, high-quality skin care product that’s fragrance free and has no odor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much in the way of fine lines anyway, so there isn&#x27;t much to fix.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and mild, I can use it around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Been using daily -- so far so good.  </li>
            <li>and I can clearly see results: my skin is much tighter and more even.  </li>
            <li>I just love the way it makes my skin feel and am surprised to be saying that it really does make difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much...</li>
            <li>This has made my skin very smooth in a very short time.  </li>
            <li>This is very reasonably priced, but just does not make my skin feel silky at all.</li>
            <li>These products are very much eqivalent to these and the prices are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorraine</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much, this product is so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>,I look forward to using more of their products in the future.</li>
            <li>I definitely would order more products from Xfacio Labs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first time to try a Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>I definitely would order more products from Xfacio Labs.</li>
            <li>So you really get a lot for your money with this!</li>
            <li>will say that I like it enough to continue to use it even if I don&#x27;t see more youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is already looking better, and I’ve only been using this for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li>This is the first Vitamin C serum I have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li>Bravo Xfacio ,,,now I would love a daily moisturizer??</li>
            <li>I WILL be ordering more when the bottle runs low.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s more color in my skin, and not the red type of color from rosacea!</li>
            <li>I tried this product and the first week</li>
            <li>The difference is very noticable!  </li>
            <li>I felt result results from the first use.</li>
            <li>Received this item fast and so far it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>My wife says that the products are as good, if not better, than namebrand higher priced products.</li>
            <li>But rather than that - I feel it&#x27;s a great product which really works - at least for me.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and really makes a difference in my face.  </li>
            <li>Have used it about a month and see positive results.  </li>
            <li>this product is amazing, i was changes 2 days used my dark spots started fading out; my boyfriend was amazed at how is glow in just 2 days use .</li>
            <li>I would love for this serum to be a staple in my facial regimen but the price is a too high for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this serum a few days ago, first of all the customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have read that topical vitamin C can be unstable, so use of the dark glass bottle is a great idea.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be keeping up on this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait until I had used the product a few months before writing a review and am glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this product, I already bought my second bottle, also I will try the new toner.</li>
            <li>I could see some fine lines starting and 2 age spots, I wasn&#x27;t liking what I was seeing.  </li>
            <li>Very high end bottle/packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, I saw a big difference literally over night on both arms but a HUGE difference on the arm where I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid, and moisturizer  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing serum, only using a week my facial lines are diffently fading and my skin glows!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using Advanced Vitamin C Serum for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>do&amp;#34; lady, people, and her customer service skills, coupled with her warmth and graciousness, are absolutely superlative.</li>
            <li>I really see the difference in the texture and tone in my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>I really see a difference in my face.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product.</li>
            <li>These products really work for me</li>
            <li>They really care about what their customers think about their products....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s lots of lotions and potions out there that really don&#x27;t make ant difference, but this one does.  </li>
            <li>really diappear.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually stopped using another product because the serum makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>This really is what you are looking for in a skin care product that makes a real difference in you skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I will be a repeat customer,  This product took away the creases in my face and  actually a few weeks later I look years younger</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised at how silky it made my skin feel right away.</li>
            <li>With just a couple of drops applied to the under eye area, the serum smoothes out crows feet and leaves a very light and cool protective film, not too glossy nor the least bit rubbery.</li>
            <li>It is a thin serum that I put under a very nice moisturizer with peptides, and it seems to be doing the job.  </li>
            <li>clean my face very well and put this on (dry&#x27;s very fast) and</li>
            <li>I use it with the original Xfacio serum and the results are equal to a facelift.</li>
            <li>I continue to re-order this product as it works better for me than other Vitamin C serums that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>After a week of using this product, the 2 spots are fading a little, my pores are smaller and overall my skin tone is more even and just looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is simple, dark glass with a dropper making it easy to use and protects the potency from light, no unnecessary ingredients to irritate skin.  </li>
            <li>and I love how the dark spots are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li>It was humid &amp; warm&amp; usually my face looks greasy  </li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to  trying this new product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No they don&#x27;t disappear, I&#x27;m 58 and, let&#x27;s be realistic, they are not going to go away.  </li>
            <li>I got this Vitamin C Serum after the High Potency Anti-Aging Serum and use them both together.  </li>
            <li>So I have some high hopes for the creases around my eyes after I&#x27;ve been using it a while.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes this will help my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products to anyone looking to improve the look of their skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>highly  recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Have high hopes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you layer products, and this was easy for me to include with any other product I wanted to use.</li>
            <li>and I really like it so far</li>
            <li>Some people say save your money and use general witch hazel instead of purchasing a higher priced product which has witch hazel in it.  </li>
            <li>I started taking better care of my face about the time I got to be middle aged, but I never thought much about my hands except to put some lotion on before bed.</li>
            <li>it’s so gentle and natural</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t do reviews</li>
            <li>they are there to help, they always get right back to me.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin yet other than silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida,with all our humidity</li>
            <li>After the huge difference I saw this morning on the arm that I used 3 products instead of just 2, I&#x27;m definitely going back to using all 3 of those in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin, so I&#x27;m hesitant to try anything new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the products are very reasonably priced, I always try products in different combinations to see if I can get results by using fewer products because of cost and time!  </li>
            <li>I even put it under my eyes where the skin is very sensitive....</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive</li>
            <li>Girrrrrrl.....used this product for the first time last night, my skin came to LIFE.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>First they sent an email explaining proper use because they want the customer to experience results.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth; as long as these results continue, I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and silky and everybody has noticed a new brightness or glow radiating from from my skin.</li>
            <li>Company (seller) has made follow-up contact on several occasions to verify satisfaction, which has been positive.  </li>
            <li>There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li>At 70 years old there is little one can do to look even a few years younger, but this serum easily removed under eye puffiness as well as managed to pull up some of the sagging skin most of us have at this age.</li>
            <li>I was initially worried about how much my skin was absorbing but that quickly changed and just a few drops is all that&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li>: I use the Vitamin C Serum to soften and repair my skin and then use a little oil free collagen cream over it.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and no heavy perfume scent.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fast approaching 50</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>This went to my old address and</li>
            <li>I am HIGHLY sensitive to sesame/sesame products.  </li>
            <li>People are commenting about how young I look.</li>
            <li>I really think it is too soon to say if it&#x27;s making a big difference</li>
            <li>although everyone always says I look in my early thirties..</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no fragrance, so nothing to irritate sensitive skin or eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, acne and rosacea, and this product hasn&#x27;t bothered my skin in any way.</li>
            <li>No heavy cream, lotion, or gel that sits on your skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive</li>
            <li>Ha, like getting an early Christ-mas gift.</li>
            <li>Skin stay soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My facial skin becomes noticeably better after a few weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li>and I instantly noticed a difference in firmness, less obvious wrinkles around my mouth and eyes, and my skin now has a clearer, more even tone to it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried multiple products and this serum has improved the texture and appearance of my skin better than anything else that i have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it especially for ageing skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and was looking for a reasonably priced product.  </li>
            <li>This is a similar concentration as you&#x27;d get from a doctor (for a much higher price) or from a few skin care companies (also at a much higher price).</li>
            <li>Also wonderful for mature skin in dry &amp; cold Midwestern winters!</li>
            <li>She said that she would personally send me a new serum today and that she was sending it Prime Shipping, with no cost to me.</li>
            <li>the P.O. finally got it to me at new address.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a little reddening when I first started using the Vitamin C serum but that quickly passed and suppose it was due to the product doing its job.  </li>
            <li>And it dried quickly with no grease.  </li>
            <li>This is my first vitamin C serum other than samples I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Using this in conjunction with the Anti-aging serum is a major breakthrough I think.  </li>
            <li>But my skin feel smoother, and much more hydrated, and at this time of the year, we&#x27;ve started running the furnace, and usually my skin starts to dry</li>
            <li>Comparing to  L-Ascorbic Acid (absorbed at 100%), this form absorbs at about 55% (based on what I read), however it is much more stable and does not oxidize as L-Ascorbic acid, as well as it is much less irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>I can hardly wait for the Vitamin C to be available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries very quickly, is not at all greasy and there is no unpleasant</li>
            <li>Like many of you, I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on lotions and potions that promised everything but delivered very little.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only used it 3-4 times per week during the day for about 2 weeks so</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and have been told twice this week that i do not look my age but much younger.</li>
            <li>and so far it is really terrific.  </li>
            <li>This is now a necessary part of my skin care routine day and night, and I&#x27;ll be purchasing again when I am near running out.</li>
            <li>ok I had to wait a little bit on using this and its been about a week and a half</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive, mature skin</li>
            <li>I have been using this now for about 8 weeks, and have had none of the dry winter skin I normally experience at this time of year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve spoken with customer service from their company to inquire about some of their other products, and they were always very helpful.</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s smoothing down and really holding moisture.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> you, Xfacio Labs, Amazon and Mia, best Customer Service ever!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!! :)</li>
            <li> I love this another wonderful product from Xfacio!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it looks much better, but I&#x27;ve been blessed with very good skin and at 44</li>
            <li> Xfacio Labs customer service seems really good, too.</li>
            <li> It was surprising what toxic chemicals all of these mainstream companies use.</li>
            <li> If your results are anything like mine, you&#x27;ll be delighted like I am.</li>
            <li> I loved the product.</li>
            <li> and I get lots of compliments on how my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li> but once I use a moisturizer it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li> I had wrote a review that I loved the product after a couple of days</li>
            <li> Good.  </li>
            <li> , i use it before or after the Hyaluric acid serum, goes perfectly with out leaving your face with a thicknes feeling; very fast results!</li>
            <li> I had a lot of prominent hereditary skin tags or moles on my face but they&#x27;ve shrunk or disappeared so my skin looks great now.</li>
            <li> The one great thing about this company though is that they will return your money no questions asked if you aren&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> It comes in a darkened 1 fl. oz./ 30 mL bottle, which is good for the serum, so it does not oxidize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found you!! :)</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> why would I want another bottle of something in my cabinet that doesn&#x27;t work even if it is free?!?!  </li>
            <li> I want my free bottle of all of them because I know they WORK for me!!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> sure will continue to use - thank you XFACIO / Amazon!</li>

            <li> We both are very happy with these products and highly recommend XFACIO LABS to anyone looking to have truly healthy skin and not just a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> They e-mailed me to make sure I got each product and wondered how I liked it, etc.</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin C serum- natural , in 3 days.</li>
            <li> and I have to say , WOW I AM IMPRESSED!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best vitamin C serum that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear very much makeup and wanted my skin to look great</li>
            <li> First of all, the seller of this product is really great.  </li>
            <li> so moisture is very important.  </li>
            <li> I  am using it every day and my skin is healthy and glowing</li>
            <li> I have tried many a face product over the years and I must say I am sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> and I have sincerely noticed some brightening in my skin.  </li>
            <li> She did not even require me to return the damaged bottle as proof of my complain, as many companies require.</li>
            <li> I bought all 4 products from XFACIO and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin tone is more even and brighter.</li>
            <li> have assisted in many face lifts and have seen the results of the scarring, suture tears, misalignment, pain, etc...</li>
            <li> Best of all, they included some extra, helpful information about vitamin C serum and its uses: its ingredients, how to use it, what to expect from it, etc.</li>
            <li> love it 😊</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin feels smoother and my skin looks brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li> Also, I have never had better customer service.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to more products from this XFACIO.</li>
            <li> Best of all, they included some extra, helpful information about vitamin C serum and its uses: its ingredients, how to use it, what to expect from it, etc.</li>
            <li> I also used some on my hands and noticed they look better too.</li>
            <li> I use it under the anti aging serum, and then apply my moisturizer on top of that.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to see my skin look more youthful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the best Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my age spots are lighter, and the crepe-y texture of my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a better outcome</li>
            <li> I really love this Vtamin C serum</li>
            <li> I started using this product last week underneath my anti-aging serum and its wonderful!!!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many products (or potions as my husband calls them) I have tried thru the years.  </li>
            <li> They sent me an email to make sure I had received the product and to make sure I had no questions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin seems to be brighter or more radiant, firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews (maybe I should :) ).  </li>
            <li> The customer service from this company is better than any</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the greatest facial products on the market.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing more than a month.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> They send you an email to tell you how to use the product and then they send you another email to make sure you receive the product.</li>
            <li> second, the product itself is awesome</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The products arrived in a timely manner, and there were follow-up emails to make sure I was satisfied with delivery.  </li>
            <li> Love this serum.....</li>
            <li> :) .</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the free sample!  </li>
            <li> I am not going to say I don&#x27;t have any more lines because that is just not so</li>
            <li> say that I REALLY REALLY love it.  </li>
            <li> I love being able to use this around my eyes, as that&#x27;s one area that needs attention on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I am defiantly going to be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> but I NEEDED TO DO THIS ONE3 .. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on better and NO primer is needed.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m encouraged and will continue to use it and expect to see even greater results.</li>
            <li> Much better than products I&#x27;ve paid five times more for.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many never had the result I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I had read many of the reviews so decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This serum is sold on Amazon.com, like many others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> I truly believe a wonderful product for those not sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Mia is such a incredible asset to her company and I hope that Xfacio knows how very fortunate they are to have her on their team.</li>
            <li> honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines around my eyes are fading :)</li>
            <li> In my opinion a serum is the most important part of any skincare regime.</li>
            <li> I take great care of my skin and of course like all of us, I want to look young forever...</li>
            <li> She was extremely helpful and sent wonderful information regarding the product, and how to use it.  </li>
            <li> imagine more noticeable results will take time but overall happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> if you use it every day with time it will have great results and the serum lasts and stays fresh much longer, no need to refrigerate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve super-sensitive skin that flares easy.  </li>
            <li> i strongly recommend product...</li>
            <li> Quick absorption and very light.</li>
            <li> Bright, vibrant, smooth.  </li>
            <li> Of all the serums I have tried, Xfacio&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> I can see the fine lines disappearing on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Notice fine line and wrinkles dissapearing.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and i notice a difference in the fine lines on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Super product!</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will be able to catch some super discounts or maybe some samples soon.</li>
            <li> But so far I love the serum, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure with time, my skin will look better and better and I will be sure to come back and report if the discoloration improves.</li>
            <li> The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lined up to try this Advanced Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> The packaging is attractive and the dropper-top isn&#x27;t falling apart, like some of the similar bottles in the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it performs fabulously as an anti-aging free radicle scavenger that&lt;br /&gt;is non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> , I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Vitamin C serums and of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel so smooth....</li>
            <li> I just started using this Advanced Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> Wife uses it daily since Christmas and works great</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and the results are visible immediately.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so smooth and even tighter....</li>
            <li> The serum goes on really smooth and absorbs in seconds.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for about 3 weeks, but it has made a great difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> More of a golden glow.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful customer service and thank you for the free sample</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s important to me that anything I put on my face absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Goes on really smooth and appears to help my skin look fresher(I&#x27;m 61) so</li>
            <li> Alhtough I have seen cover models that do look good with uneven skin tones, it does not look good for me.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft with a nice healthy glow after I use all 4 products together.</li>
            <li> This item is good so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with the  Xfacio Labs™ Anti Aging Serum-An Advanced High Potency Natural Wrinkle Treatment which is also wonderful, non-greasy and quick drying.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE their products and I will continue using them forever and the price is right.... &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Would love to try other products from this company if they are as great as this one ..</li>
            <li> Again, Mia, my thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Customer service at Xfacio ( whose service is excellent ) has informed me that they are coming out with a new Vitamin C serum shortly.</li>

            <li> It made my skin radiant &amp; fresh looking!.</li>
            <li> Though they have the best customer service, however, after tried all the products, I&#x27;m not sure I will buy anything twice now.</li>
            <li> but this kept my make up look fresh all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see something help with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightweight sinks in beautifully .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth to try it, ladies!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t call it a miracle since the only real miracle would be produced by a facelift, but it is a wonderful product that is worth the money and does what it promises.</li>
            <li> Feels fabulous on my face + looks very smooth and feels very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to apply -- has a fresh feel &amp; it appears to soften my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 5 days, so I can&#x27;t speak long-term, but so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> The serum is fragrance free, dries quickly, and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> but so far I love this product!  </li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum was one of the better I have tried recently, I found it made my skin look pretty good.</li>
            <li> I loved the original Xfacio face cream, which went above and beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am ordering the rest of the Xfacio products right now!</li>
            <li> - This is my absolute favorite skin product after a year of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of so called age spots forming over the years and this wonderful serum is slowly making them fade away as well.</li>
            <li> If you want simple, effective and just plain wonderful try a bottle and you&#x27;ll be convinced.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle for sensitive skin and the results so far have been very good in the 2 areas that I was concerned about.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that it will live up to my expectations!</li>
            <li> I have order more for my mom,sister and some close friends, hope it does this same magic for them.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks; my skin feels more soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly and is not at all oily.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> This product is amazing after a week of using  this vitamin c serum I saw a difference, my face was much tone and much brighter.</li>
            <li> It smooths on easily and doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle, but in just a few days of use, I&#x27;m seeing a remarkable difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the overall quality of this Exfacio product.</li>
            <li> First, I have to say that Mia is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> So far I love this product it is clean with no smelly after smell.  </li>
            <li> And it’s nice to know I’m actively preventing the signs of aging and helping to keep my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> As for the products, they go on easily and my skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The serum is a light, clear liquid that glides easily onto the skin and soaks in almost immediately.</li>
            <li> After ordering my first bottle FROM AMAZON, I received my first REAL bottle of this new REAL Advanced Vitamin C Serum and have completely fallen in love!</li>
            <li> Xfacio Labs was very prompt and attentive in their communications with me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Xfacio Labs was very prompt and attentive in their communications with me.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, non-greasy and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> With this product, I literally saw a very noticeable difference over night and a huge difference in just days.  </li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks I could definitely see the amazing difference in the way my face felt and looked.</li>
            <li> A sales rep sent an email after purchase explaining how to use the product, which was nice; however, there were multiple spelling and grammatical errors, which is a bit of a turn-off.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product on my hands after I received a complimentary bottle for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 52 and tried  all kind of serums and creams, I definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that my face looks younger and fresher.  </li>
            <li> and so it is also economical.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed by the skin and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Whether 30 or 80 it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I would love to share some products with my friends and who like me are into natural products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you get the point, right?</li>
            <li> This goes to work right away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right for my skin</li>
            <li> I started using it right</li>
            <li> Xfacio you guys got it right...</li>
            <li> You want a product that works right away.  </li>
            <li> I have given this serum a few weeks, and I must say it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth and vibrant feeling</li>
            <li> I’m very sensitive to fragrances, so I was pleased to find a natural, high-quality skin care product that’s fragrance free and has no odor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much in the way of fine lines anyway, so there isn&#x27;t much to fix.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle and mild, I can use it around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Been using daily -- so far so good.  </li>
            <li> and I can clearly see results: my skin is much tighter and more even.  </li>
            <li> I just love the way it makes my skin feel and am surprised to be saying that it really does make difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> thank you very much...</li>
            <li> This has made my skin very smooth in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> This is very reasonably priced, but just does not make my skin feel silky at all.</li>
            <li> These products are very much eqivalent to these and the prices are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorraine</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much, this product is so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ,I look forward to using more of their products in the future.</li>
            <li> I definitely would order more products from Xfacio Labs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try a Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> I definitely would order more products from Xfacio Labs.</li>
            <li> So you really get a lot for your money with this!</li>
            <li> will say that I like it enough to continue to use it even if I don&#x27;t see more youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is already looking better, and I’ve only been using this for a couple of weeks now.</li>
            <li> This is the first Vitamin C serum I have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> Bravo Xfacio ,,,now I would love a daily moisturizer??</li>
            <li> I WILL be ordering more when the bottle runs low.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s more color in my skin, and not the red type of color from rosacea!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and the first week</li>
            <li> The difference is very noticable!  </li>
            <li> I felt result results from the first use.</li>
            <li> Received this item fast and so far it seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> My wife says that the products are as good, if not better, than namebrand higher priced products.</li>
            <li> But rather than that - I feel it&#x27;s a great product which really works - at least for me.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and really makes a difference in my face.  </li>
            <li> Have used it about a month and see positive results.  </li>
            <li> this product is amazing, i was changes 2 days used my dark spots started fading out; my boyfriend was amazed at how is glow in just 2 days use .</li>
            <li> I would love for this serum to be a staple in my facial regimen but the price is a too high for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum a few days ago, first of all the customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have read that topical vitamin C can be unstable, so use of the dark glass bottle is a great idea.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be keeping up on this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I had used the product a few months before writing a review and am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I already bought my second bottle, also I will try the new toner.</li>
            <li> I could see some fine lines starting and 2 age spots, I wasn&#x27;t liking what I was seeing.  </li>
            <li> Very high end bottle/packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, I saw a big difference literally over night on both arms but a HUGE difference on the arm where I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid, and moisturizer  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing serum, only using a week my facial lines are diffently fading and my skin glows!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Advanced Vitamin C Serum for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> do&amp;#34; lady, people, and her customer service skills, coupled with her warmth and graciousness, are absolutely superlative.</li>
            <li> I really see the difference in the texture and tone in my face.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> I really see a difference in my face.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product.</li>
            <li> These products really work for me</li>
            <li> They really care about what their customers think about their products....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s lots of lotions and potions out there that really don&#x27;t make ant difference, but this one does.  </li>
            <li> really diappear.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually stopped using another product because the serum makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> This really is what you are looking for in a skin care product that makes a real difference in you skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I will be a repeat customer,  This product took away the creases in my face and  actually a few weeks later I look years younger</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised at how silky it made my skin feel right away.</li>
            <li> With just a couple of drops applied to the under eye area, the serum smoothes out crows feet and leaves a very light and cool protective film, not too glossy nor the least bit rubbery.</li>
            <li> It is a thin serum that I put under a very nice moisturizer with peptides, and it seems to be doing the job.  </li>
            <li> clean my face very well and put this on (dry&#x27;s very fast) and</li>
            <li> I use it with the original Xfacio serum and the results are equal to a facelift.</li>
            <li> I continue to re-order this product as it works better for me than other Vitamin C serums that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> After a week of using this product, the 2 spots are fading a little, my pores are smaller and overall my skin tone is more even and just looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is simple, dark glass with a dropper making it easy to use and protects the potency from light, no unnecessary ingredients to irritate skin.  </li>
            <li> and I love how the dark spots are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> It was humid &amp; warm&amp; usually my face looks greasy  </li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to  trying this new product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No they don&#x27;t disappear, I&#x27;m 58 and, let&#x27;s be realistic, they are not going to go away.  </li>
            <li> I got this Vitamin C Serum after the High Potency Anti-Aging Serum and use them both together.  </li>
            <li> So I have some high hopes for the creases around my eyes after I&#x27;ve been using it a while.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes this will help my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these products to anyone looking to improve the look of their skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> highly  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have high hopes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you layer products, and this was easy for me to include with any other product I wanted to use.</li>
            <li> and I really like it so far</li>
            <li> Some people say save your money and use general witch hazel instead of purchasing a higher priced product which has witch hazel in it.  </li>
            <li> I started taking better care of my face about the time I got to be middle aged, but I never thought much about my hands except to put some lotion on before bed.</li>
            <li> it’s so gentle and natural</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t do reviews</li>
            <li> they are there to help, they always get right back to me.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin yet other than silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida,with all our humidity</li>
            <li> After the huge difference I saw this morning on the arm that I used 3 products instead of just 2, I&#x27;m definitely going back to using all 3 of those in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin, so I&#x27;m hesitant to try anything new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the products are very reasonably priced, I always try products in different combinations to see if I can get results by using fewer products because of cost and time!  </li>
            <li> I even put it under my eyes where the skin is very sensitive....</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive</li>
            <li> Girrrrrrl.....used this product for the first time last night, my skin came to LIFE.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> First they sent an email explaining proper use because they want the customer to experience results.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth; as long as these results continue, I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and silky and everybody has noticed a new brightness or glow radiating from from my skin.</li>
            <li> Company (seller) has made follow-up contact on several occasions to verify satisfaction, which has been positive.  </li>
            <li> There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li> At 70 years old there is little one can do to look even a few years younger, but this serum easily removed under eye puffiness as well as managed to pull up some of the sagging skin most of us have at this age.</li>
            <li> I was initially worried about how much my skin was absorbing but that quickly changed and just a few drops is all that&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li> : I use the Vitamin C Serum to soften and repair my skin and then use a little oil free collagen cream over it.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and no heavy perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fast approaching 50</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> This went to my old address and</li>
            <li> I am HIGHLY sensitive to sesame/sesame products.  </li>
            <li> People are commenting about how young I look.</li>
            <li> I really think it is too soon to say if it&#x27;s making a big difference</li>
            <li> although everyone always says I look in my early thirties..</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no fragrance, so nothing to irritate sensitive skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, acne and rosacea, and this product hasn&#x27;t bothered my skin in any way.</li>
            <li> No heavy cream, lotion, or gel that sits on your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive</li>
            <li> Ha, like getting an early Christ-mas gift.</li>
            <li> Skin stay soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My facial skin becomes noticeably better after a few weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> and I instantly noticed a difference in firmness, less obvious wrinkles around my mouth and eyes, and my skin now has a clearer, more even tone to it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried multiple products and this serum has improved the texture and appearance of my skin better than anything else that i have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it especially for ageing skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and was looking for a reasonably priced product.  </li>
            <li> This is a similar concentration as you&#x27;d get from a doctor (for a much higher price) or from a few skin care companies (also at a much higher price).</li>
            <li> Also wonderful for mature skin in dry &amp; cold Midwestern winters!</li>
            <li> She said that she would personally send me a new serum today and that she was sending it Prime Shipping, with no cost to me.</li>
            <li> the P.O. finally got it to me at new address.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a little reddening when I first started using the Vitamin C serum but that quickly passed and suppose it was due to the product doing its job.  </li>
            <li> And it dried quickly with no grease.  </li>
            <li> This is my first vitamin C serum other than samples I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Using this in conjunction with the Anti-aging serum is a major breakthrough I think.  </li>
            <li> But my skin feel smoother, and much more hydrated, and at this time of the year, we&#x27;ve started running the furnace, and usually my skin starts to dry</li>
            <li> Comparing to  L-Ascorbic Acid (absorbed at 100%), this form absorbs at about 55% (based on what I read), however it is much more stable and does not oxidize as L-Ascorbic acid, as well as it is much less irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait for the Vitamin C to be available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries very quickly, is not at all greasy and there is no unpleasant</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on lotions and potions that promised everything but delivered very little.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used it 3-4 times per week during the day for about 2 weeks so</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and have been told twice this week that i do not look my age but much younger.</li>
            <li> and so far it is really terrific.  </li>
            <li> This is now a necessary part of my skin care routine day and night, and I&#x27;ll be purchasing again when I am near running out.</li>
            <li> ok I had to wait a little bit on using this and its been about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive, mature skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for about 8 weeks, and have had none of the dry winter skin I normally experience at this time of year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spoken with customer service from their company to inquire about some of their other products, and they were always very helpful.</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s smoothing down and really holding moisture.</li>
            <li> I usually mix this with my moisturizer as it&#x27;s one less thing to smooth onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough but am using daily sometimes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> It is clear and thin, no real scent and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not talking about the little crows feet and fine wrinkles that women in their late 30&#x27;s are whining about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could be that I haven&#x27;t used it long enough</li>
            <li> long will this bottle last?  </li>
            <li> Anxious to try the High Potency Anti Aging Serum next.  </li>
            <li> skin was supper dry and with in 3 days I could tell a big difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they are not bad products, they just didn&#x27;t have dramatic effect as stated in the product listing.</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased this was for my dark spots and it&#x27;s only lightened them up a little.</li>
            <li> have used this for a little over two weeks and for this&lt;br /&gt;68 year (young face) it has done wonders.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain but it really brightens up your skin.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to see my improvement after long term use.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin and cannot use harsh creams and serums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already begun to see some minor changes in my skin as I have begun to use this product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long it lasts &amp; ,my friends have noticed a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> After I apply and let it dry</li>
            <li> My face was REALLY dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not encountered any sensitivity with this serum as I have had in the past with stronger rated potencies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had this product for a couple of weeks, but it does appear that some of the freckles on my hands are not so dark.</li>
            <li> The product itself left my skin feeling too dry and too tight.  </li>
            <li> reason I knocked off half a star is that I don&#x27;t know if it actually does what it claims:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 months and have noticed a little difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this regularly for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, and it&#x27;s living up to them after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> The C serum is none irritating and every gentle.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> To save money and time,  in the last few weeks, I have just been using the Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer on my face without the spray toner and vitamin C</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time in the sun with our sons&#x27; baseball teams and further abuse my hands with gardening, washing dishes, and doing heavy work on our farm.</li>
            <li> I applied it only a few times</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get this as I&#x27;d never really heard of the company, but with the lower price, and the reviews I figured I&#x27;d try</li>
            <li> Been using it only for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I always carefully check each ingredient in the product as I am a fanatic of all organic and natural and must know what I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> bottle is very small, containing only a single ounce, but it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have decreased substantially and the age spots on my hands have become much lighter and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I ordered the xt toner and vit c serum and two other products for my wife.</li>
            <li> I am planning to try other products from this line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out their other product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other arm I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> do think I&#x27;ll buy this again, and as I use up the skin care I&#x27;m using in addition to this, I&#x27;ll try other products that Xfacio puts out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C products, and this one blows them all away.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first</li>
            <li> So I love the company and how hard they are trying to break into this crazy skin care world.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got dark marks from past acne, and those are starting to lighten.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the black bottle keeps the product</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong if you want to try a high concentration of Vitamin C!</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my cheeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to describe, I didn&#x27;t have acne or bumps on my face, but over all it feels smoother as if I had a facial without all the scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, one bottle usually lasts me 3 months using it morning and evening.</li>
            <li> Also, the pause button or &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyebrows is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fading and much less embarrassing for me.</li>
            <li> Noticing less puffiness around the eyes with use.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, is not greasy and has no odors.</li>
            <li> The lines at the corners of my eyes are already less noticeable.</li>
            <li> that is not your typical OTC allergen-free type of product (Aveeno, Neutrogena, etc.).  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer and smoother, and those lines are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend signing up for their mailing list to save a little money.</li>
            <li> I apply a little in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> I got this with a coupon I found that lowered the price quite a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I had a sun spot that wasn&#x27;t very dark</li>
            <li> I decided on XFacio after doing quite a lot of research; I like that they stand behind their products and it&#x27;s a relatively simple line of products.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks</li>
            <li> so was very skeptical at first)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this vitamin C serum for just a few days, and I&#x27;m watching my wrinkles disappear --</li>
            <li> After using it for a few days however, I had to discontinue use.  </li>
            <li> Over the past few months I have noticed a lot of &amp;#34;freckles&amp;#34; or discoloration on my face.</li>
            <li> Ive used it for the past month.  </li>
            <li> No off putting fragrance like some serums I have tried in the past .</li>
            <li> My skin feels plump and radiant after I apply it which is usually in the morning before I apply moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell</li>
            <li> but I get a lot of compliments on my skin lately</li>
            <li> even though they say it would take at least 28 days before you see a result.</li>
            <li> I seriously think it looks like I&#x27;m wearing powder or foundation, when I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> I saw softer skin and wrinkles soften within a day, seriously.</li>
            <li> I was worried the thin watered serum wasn&#x27;t going to work since it&#x27;s so watery</li>
            <li> My pore size has decreased and my skin tone keeps brightening.  </li>
            <li> I always thought that word was a false claim, as how would you measure brightening?</li>
            <li> unfortunately nothing  but  plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say one bad thing about this product.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed yet.  </li>

            <li> I used it for 2 days now &amp; im liking the result. It made my skin radiant &amp; fresh looking!. Even my husband tried it!</li>
            <li> Best serum I have ever purchased and I have tried them all!!!</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  It&#x27;s so gentle and mild, I can use it around my eyes.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I  am using it every day and my skin is healthy and glowing,I look forward to using more of their products in the future.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few weeks. So far I love this product it is clean with no smelly after smell.  Leaves my skin so smooth.  I have tried many a face product over the years and I must say I am sticking with this one. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I ordered the xt toner and vit c serum and two other products for my wife. Two containers had a leak from not being tightened properly. The company immediately sent replacements at no cost to us . My wife says that the products are as good, if not better, than namebrand higher priced products. Best of all, it is made in the USA. GREAT SERVICE + GREAT PRODUCT + MADE IN THE USA &#x3D; #1 Winner for us&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Advanced Vitamin C Serum for two weeks.  It does feel great on the skin. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin yet other than silky smooth.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Been using daily -- so far so good.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, i was changes 2 days used my dark spots started fading out; my boyfriend was amazed at how is glow in just 2 days use . I have order more for my mom,sister and some close friends, hope it does this same magic for them. i strongly recommend product...</li>
            <li> Easy to apply -- has a fresh feel &amp; it appears to soften my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for about 8 weeks, and have had none of the dry winter skin I normally experience at this time of year.  It is a thin serum that I put under a very nice moisturizer with peptides, and it seems to be doing the job.  I have read that topical vitamin C can be unstable, so use of the dark glass bottle is a great idea.</li>
            <li> This is my first vitamin C serum other than samples I&#x27;ve tried.  I decided on XFacio after doing quite a lot of research; I like that they stand behind their products and it&#x27;s a relatively simple line of products.  The packaging is simple, dark glass with a dropper making it easy to use and protects the potency from light, no unnecessary ingredients to irritate skin.  It is clear and thin, no real scent and absorbs quickly.  Works well under makeup and I have sincerely noticed some brightening in my skin.  So far I&#x27;ve only used it 3-4 times per week during the day for about 2 weeks so imagine more noticeable results will take time but overall happy with this purchase.  Anxious to try the High Potency Anti Aging Serum next.  I do recommend signing up for their mailing list to save a little money.</li>
            <li> I just received my order of the 2 serums. The Vitamin C Serum was damaged, with a defective stopper and oil all over the inside of the package.  Because of this I couldn&#x27;t draw any product  out of the bottle, only bubbles. At the rate I was using to apply the remaining serum with my finger I would have blown through the product in a very short time. It was Mia to the rescue! She said that she would personally send me a new serum today and that she was sending it Prime Shipping, with no cost to me.She did not even require me to return the damaged bottle as proof of my complain, as many companies require. Mia is a &amp;#34;can do&amp;#34; lady, people, and her customer service skills, coupled with her warmth and graciousness, are absolutely superlative. Mia is such a incredible asset to her company and I hope that Xfacio knows how very fortunate they are to have her on their team. Again, Mia, my thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Over the past few months I have noticed a lot of &amp;#34;freckles&amp;#34; or discoloration on my face. Alhtough I have seen cover models that do look good with uneven skin tones, it does not look good for me. I read that Vitamin C serum can be a great solution for people who have this issue. I read the vitamin C can help collagen rejuvenate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after looking at a lot of products here on amazon, I thought I would give this one a try. I am happy to say that it arrived looking exactly like the photo in good condition. I have been applying it for about a week now and although, I can&#x27;t say that now my skin is flawless, what I do notice is that my skin feels smoother. It&#x27;s a little hard to describe, I didn&#x27;t have acne or bumps on my face, but over all it feels smoother as if I had a facial without all the scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure with time, my skin will look better and better and I will be sure to come back and report if the discoloration improves.</li>
            <li> I bought all 4 products from XFACIO and absolutely love them.  I really see the difference in the texture and tone in my face. People are asking me what are you doing you look wonderful !! It is not greasy and no heavy perfume scent. My face feels soft with a nice healthy glow after I use all 4 products together. I use once in the morning before my makeup and than again as my nightly routine.  I have been only using for 2 weeks now can&#x27;t wait to see my improvement after long term use. The con is the products safety seal didn&#x27;t seem secure when I received the merchandise. I will be buying again. Love It !!</li>
            <li> I have given this serum a few weeks, and I must say it&#x27;s pretty great. I have noticed my skin tone is more even and brighter. Also, the pause button or &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; between my eyebrows is less noticeable. I am ordering the rest of the Xfacio products right now! Definitely a good find and results at a great price!</li>
            <li> I loved the original Xfacio face cream, which went above and beyond my expectations. I&#x27;m lined up to try this Advanced Vitamin C Serum. I&#x27;m confident that it will live up to my expectations! I&#x27;m so glad I found you!! :)&lt;br /&gt;Just an update...After ordering my first bottle FROM AMAZON, I received my first REAL bottle of this new REAL Advanced Vitamin C Serum and have completely fallen in love! It does not make my face break out, it feels wonderful, it helps tone and tighten skin, works on under eye bags, gets rid of crows feet...you get the point, right? It works for me. I use it with the original Xfacio serum and the results are equal to a facelift. I&#x27;m not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;I have assisted in many face lifts and have seen the results of the scarring, suture tears, misalignment, pain, etc...OMG! This girl \\&quot;ain&#x27;t\\&quot; going under the knife! I&#x27;ll stick with Xfacio Labs...thank you very much...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Xfacio Labs, Amazon and Mia, best Customer Service ever!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!! :)</li>
            <li> Xfacio Labs was very prompt and attentive in their communications with me. I immediately got an acknowledgement for my order, as well as a followup when it shipped. Best of all, they included some extra, helpful information about vitamin C serum and its uses: its ingredients, how to use it, what to expect from it, etc. I definitely would order more products from Xfacio Labs.&lt;br /&gt;I love it 😊</li>
            <li> Though they have the best customer service, however, after tried all the products, I&#x27;m not sure I will buy anything twice now. they are not bad products, they just didn&#x27;t have dramatic effect as stated in the product listing.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have sensitive skin and I also have darkness underneath my eyes. That&#x27;s fading and much less embarrassing for me. I waited a month before I posted to see if this product works. I don&#x27;t wear very much makeup and wanted my skin to look great but I get a lot of compliments on my skin lately so it&#x27;s this product that&#x27;s doing the trick. This ones a keeper for me. It seems  the improvement started immediately. I had a lot of prominent hereditary skin tags or moles on my face but they&#x27;ve shrunk or disappeared so my skin looks great now.</li>
            <li> Girrrrrrl.....used this product for the first time last night, my skin came to LIFE.  Bright, vibrant, smooth.  I am 50 years old so I need all the help I can get!  Thank you Xfacio Labs and MIA you know what I want ....NO what I NEED!  Thanks again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 5 days, so I can&#x27;t speak long-term, but so far I&#x27;m impressed. I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin, so I&#x27;m hesitant to try anything new. I bought this based on the reviews, and it&#x27;s living up to them after only a few uses. The texture of my skin feels smoother and my skin looks brighter and more radiant. I do have one brown age spot (I&#x27;m 35) that doesn&#x27;t seemed to have been affected yet, but I will update again in 30 days. I feel like I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth; as long as these results continue, I will be a customer for life! A sales rep sent an email after purchase explaining how to use the product, which was nice; however, there were multiple spelling and grammatical errors, which is a bit of a turn-off.</li>
            <li> I got this Vitamin C Serum after the High Potency Anti-Aging Serum and use them both together.  I really see a difference in my face.  Even the bags under my eyes (which are genetic) are lessening.  I don&#x27;t expect anything to take them away except going under the knife but I&#x27;m finally not embarrassed to go out.  I really like this product.  Also, I have never had better customer service.  They e-mailed me to make sure I got each product and wondered how I liked it, etc.</li>
            <li> Loving it!! Works great! I have definitely seen a difference. I can see the fine lines disappearing on my forehead and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Ive used it for the past month.  Notice fine line and wrinkles dissapearing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month and seeing great results.  I have a sensitive skin and cannot use harsh creams and serums. The C serum is none irritating and every gentle.  However, it is very effective and has already brightened my skin without any discomfort.  I will recommend this serum specially that for the value, you get a great product. I am looking forward to more products from this XFACIO. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just recently started using this serum and I really like it so far, plan to re-order. I always carefully check each ingredient in the product as I am a fanatic of all organic and natural and must know what I put on my face.  I also researched this form of vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbyl Phoshate) to check for absorbency. Comparing to  L-Ascorbic Acid (absorbed at 100%), this form absorbs at about 55% (based on what I read), however it is much more stable and does not oxidize as L-Ascorbic acid, as well as it is much less irritating to the skin. So for me it works as I believe if you use it every day with time it will have great results and the serum lasts and stays fresh much longer, no need to refrigerate. My only wish was that the bottle had a pump cap rather than a syringe to prevent air/light going into the bottle every time I use it so it does not oxidize. But so far I love the serum, it is amazing. I am planning to try other products from this line.</li>
            <li> I use this in the mornings before moisturizer, skin feels refreshed. Noticing less puffiness around the eyes with use.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This goes to work right away.  I have dry, sensitive, mature skin and I instantly noticed a difference in firmness, less obvious wrinkles around my mouth and eyes, and my skin now has a clearer, more even tone to it.  I&#x27;ve been using it in conjunction with the  Xfacio Labs™ Anti Aging Serum-An Advanced High Potency Natural Wrinkle Treatment which is also wonderful, non-greasy and quick drying.  One of the biggest changes has been the back of my hands where liver spots had started to appear and are now fading away to next to nothing and I&#x27;ve only been using this for about three weeks.  I did notice a little reddening when I first started using the Vitamin C serum but that quickly passed and suppose it was due to the product doing its job.  It is going to stay on my list of &#x27;must have&#x27; facial care items.</li>
            <li> This is a great Vitamin c serum. I&#x27;ve already begun to see some minor changes in my skin as I have begun to use this product.  It absorbs quickly, is not greasy and has no odors. I have sensitive skin and have not encountered any sensitivity with this serum as I have had in the past with stronger rated potencies. It&#x27;s just right for my skin and I love how the dark spots are beginning to fade. Very high end bottle/packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed, Xfacio!</li>
            <li> This is my first time to try a Vitamin C Serum and I was pleasantly surprised at how silky it made my skin feel right away. And it dried quickly with no grease.  I work with my hands and they&#x27;re always drying out from lots of washing and sanitizing and I can&#x27;t work with my hands constantly coated with greasy moisturizers. I think I now have the perfect solution: I use the Vitamin C Serum to soften and repair my skin and then use a little oil free collagen cream over it. It works so nicely, I&#x27;m now doing the same for my face. My skin feels nice all day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had this product for a couple of weeks, but it does appear that some of the freckles on my hands are not so dark. That&#x27;s an extra bonus!  So I have some high hopes for the creases around my eyes after I&#x27;ve been using it a while. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying out their other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the overall quality of this Exfacio product. The packaging is attractive and the dropper-top isn&#x27;t falling apart, like some of the similar bottles in the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xfacio Labs was very prompt and attentive in their communications with me. I immediately got an acknowledgement for my order, as well as a followup when it shipped. Best of all, they included some extra, helpful information about vitamin C serum and its uses: its ingredients, how to use it, what to expect from it, etc. I definitely would order more products from Xfacio Labs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me and I used another product with it. I actually took a picture as they recommend before I started using it. I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but I didn&#x27;t see any change. The one great thing about this company though is that they will return your money no questions asked if you aren&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference already. Age spots on my face are disappearing. I also used some on my hands and noticed they look better too.</li>
            <li> This item is good so far.  I have only been using it for a few weeks but it feels great on the face!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks; my skin feels more soft and smooth.  The serum makes my skin looks more bright and hydrated.  I use it under the anti aging serum, and then apply my moisturizer on top of that.  I am very happy with the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Goes on smooth, non-greasy and very moisturizing. Leaves&lt;br /&gt;skin silky, and it performs fabulously as an anti-aging free radicle scavenger that&lt;br /&gt;is non-irritating. The vitamin c used is stable and does not need refrigeration&lt;br /&gt;which is a big plus. Even so, the biophotonic glass bottle doubly ensures the potency of the product. So you really get a lot for your money with this!</li>
            <li> This worked for me!!  I tried this product because of the great reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of different products with great reviews that didn&#x27;t work for me but this one did.  I truly believe what works for some doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. With this product, I literally saw a very noticeable difference over night and a huge difference in just days.  I&#x27;m fast approaching 50 so I&#x27;m not talking about the little crows feet and fine wrinkles that women in their late 30&#x27;s are whining about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the products are very reasonably priced, I always try products in different combinations to see if I can get results by using fewer products because of cost and time!  To save money and time,  in the last few weeks, I have just been using the Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer on my face without the spray toner and vitamin C and I have still seen results. However, keep reading!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products worked so well on my face, that last night I tried them on my forearms.  On one arm I put just the Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer.  The other arm I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid and moisturizer.  Again, I saw a big difference literally over night on both arms but a HUGE difference on the arm where I used the Vit C serum, Hyaluronic acid, and moisturizer  After the huge difference I saw this morning on the arm that I used 3 products instead of just 2, I&#x27;m definitely going back to using all 3 of those in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t know if their witch hazel product makes that much difference or not because I haven&#x27;t done my own comparison test.  Some people say save your money and use general witch hazel instead of purchasing a higher priced product which has witch hazel in it.  At some point I will do that comparison and update my post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am going to get a free bottle for writing a review.  With that, keep this in mind....why would I want another bottle of something in my cabinet that doesn&#x27;t work even if it is free?!?!  I&#x27;ve lost countof the number of products I&#x27;ve purchased and thrown away because the products didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;m gratefully taking my free bottle and purchasing one too so that I do not catch myself without it.  As a business woman, kudos to this company for a marketing plan that not only benefits them but truly benefits the customer too!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are going to see this similar but basically same post from me on the vitamin C serum and moisturizer cream.  I want my free bottle of all of them because I know they WORK for me!!  No need to recreate the wheel each time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Vitamin C serums and of the ones I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one the best.  It&#x27;s the only one where I actually feel a tingle when I put it on my skin.  It does leave my skin nice and silky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries very quickly, is not at all greasy and there is no unpleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I knocked off half a star is that I don&#x27;t know if it actually does what it claims: repairs skin, reduces spots, etc.  I have yet to see my skin look more youthful.  It could be that I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, it&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I like it enough to continue to use it even if I don&#x27;t see more youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the best Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used and I definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
            <li> I started taking better care of my face about the time I got to be middle aged, but I never thought much about my hands except to put some lotion on before bed. I spend a lot of time in the sun with our sons&#x27; baseball teams and further abuse my hands with gardening, washing dishes, and doing heavy work on our farm. I have half a dozen age spots on my hands now, and crepe-y skin that looks older than my face. I decided to try this product on my hands after I received a complimentary bottle for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by the claims on the box that Vitamin C&#x27;s antioxidant effects help prevent sun damage and photo-aging from pollution, and even boosts the effectiveness of sunscreen. I liked that the ingredients were all-natural and organic and that the product is USA made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three weeks of using this serum on the backs of my hands, I have to admit I&#x27;m a believer. I applied XFacios&#x27; serum twice a day to the backs of my hands and on my wrinkly knuckles. The serum is fragrance free, dries quickly, and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy. I&#x27;ve noticed that my age spots are lighter, and the crepe-y texture of my skin looks better. I can&#x27;t say this is a miracle product, but I can see results and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 months and have noticed a little difference. The main reason I purchased this was for my dark spots and it&#x27;s only lightened them up a little. I was expecting a better outcome but I will continue to finish the bottles and see what happens. The customer service, Mia is a sweetheart</li>
            <li> I really love this Vtamin C serum and I&#x27;m truly excited with the results that I&#x27;ve been seeing in such short time. It goes on and disappears into my skin without any oily or sticky feeling whatsoever. My skin immediately feels much softer and smoother. I&#x27;ve tried a number of the much more expensive brand name anti aging serums and I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I like this product. There is something about this particular brand that is different, and I highly recommend that you try it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I started using this product last week underneath my anti-aging serum and its wonderful!!!  it makes my skin feel so smooth....I even put it under my eyes where the skin is very sensitive.... I am really loving the xfacio products.... I can&#x27;t tell you how many products (or potions as my husband calls them) I have tried thru the years.  These products really work for me and I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I want to mention again....their customer services is excellent..any questions you have they are there to help, they always get right back to me.  They really care about what their customers think about their products....</li>
            <li> I received the Xfacio Labs serum C in record time.  I started using it right away.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was supper dry and with in 3 days I could tell a big difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it especially under my eys and laught lines and am starting to see and feel a difference overall in my skin.  The follow up from the company was 5 star all the way.  They sent me an email to make sure I had received the product and to make sure I had no questions.  I will definitely put this on my reorder list and recommend it to all my&lt;br /&gt;friends.</li>
            <li> I’m very sensitive to fragrances, so I was pleased to find a natural, high-quality skin care product that’s fragrance free and has no odor. My skin is already looking better, and I’ve only been using this for a couple of weeks now. I like that it’s so gentle and natural I can use it under my eyes, rather than needing a separate eye gel. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin seems to be brighter or more radiant, firmer and smoother. The lines at the corners of my eyes are already less noticeable. This serum absorbs quickly and is not at all oily. Xfacio Labs customer service seems really good, too. Their followup email answered my questions and let me know how to contact them in the future if I needed anything. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> For Mothers Day, I went through my wife&#x27;s anti aging/wrinkle eliminating miracle product stash with her. We found ingredients in all of the standard off the shelf items which cost plenty of money which were unacceptable for use on human skin. It was surprising what toxic chemicals all of these mainstream companies use. As part of the same research, we made a list of things that we would like to see not used and one of ingredients which are proven to work and non-toxic. XFACIO LABS products met all of the list requirements using ingredients like Matrixyl 3000, Jojoba oil and Retinol. These help skin maintain health from the inside instead of just puffing it up from toxicity. Now that she has been using the XFACIO line, her skin looks healthier and has a glow about it that wasn&#x27;t there before. We both are very happy with these products and highly recommend XFACIO LABS to anyone looking to have truly healthy skin and not just a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> I just started using this Advanced Vitamin C Serum and I like it so far. I apply a little in the morning and at night. This is the first Vitamin C serum I have ever used on my face. It is not greasy and has not been drying. Looking forward to seeing great results I have high hopes this will help my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I cannot rate this product yet because I just received it yesterday.  This went to my old address and the P.O. finally got it to me at new address.  I will be happy to review this gift from you in a week or two.  Thank you for sending to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews (maybe I should :) ).  I&#x27;ve been using this product since last Fall and I can clearly see results: my skin is much tighter and more even.  I have &amp;#34;pronounced&amp;#34; lines between my eyebrows and on the forehead, and after a month or so of regular use of the Serum lines have relaxed visibly.  Skin all over the face and neck looks younger and tighter.  Of course it will not make all your wrinkles to go away - unfortunately nothing  but  plastic surgeon. But rather than that - I feel it&#x27;s a great product which really works - at least for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this regularly for a little over a month.  I can tell a difference in fine lines and wrinkles.  I am middle-aged, so this is of a concern to me.  I had a sun spot that wasn&#x27;t very dark and I could tell that it has lightened it even further.  I will be buying more of this--that&#x27;s for sure!  When I had a question about receiving another bottle of this wonderful serum, I was helped IMMEDIATELY by Mia.  The customer service from this company is better than any I&#x27;ve ever had the opportunity to work with!!!</li>
            <li> Love XFACIO Vit C and Hylauronic Acid Serums - excellent products that work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve super-sensitive skin that flares easy.  This is the only product I can use (which I purchased sight unseen so was very skeptical at first) that is not your typical OTC allergen-free type of product (Aveeno, Neutrogena, etc.).  Feels fabulous on my face + looks very smooth and feels very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sure will continue to use - thank you XFACIO / Amazon!</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the greatest facial products on the market.  There&#x27;s lots of lotions and potions out there that really don&#x27;t make ant difference, but this one does.  My skin is softer and smoother, and those lines are less noticeable.  No they don&#x27;t disappear, I&#x27;m 58 and, let&#x27;s be realistic, they are not going to go away.  But they are lessened, and I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed and delighted.  I&#x27;ve used this vitamin C serum for just a few days, and I&#x27;m watching my wrinkles disappear -- really diappear. Like many of you, I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on lotions and potions that promised everything but delivered very little.  That&#x27;s all done now because this vitamin C serum does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very small, containing only a single ounce, but it goes a long way.  I use a couple of drops in all for face and another for my neck; that&#x27;s it.  It smooths on easily and doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle, but in just a few days of use, I&#x27;m seeing a remarkable difference.  Tiny lines are gone, and the deeper wrinkles are filling in.  Remarkable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long will this bottle last?  Hard to tell but I&#x27;m guessing more than a month.  Not everyone&#x27;s skin is the same, and yours may not react like mine, but I suggest you give it a try.  If your results are anything like mine, you&#x27;ll be delighted like I am. Do give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!  TEN if that were an option!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS</li>
            <li> First, I have to say that Mia is fantastic.  She was extremely helpful and sent wonderful information regarding the product, and how to use it.  After using it for a few days however, I had to discontinue use.  My face started to breakout.  After reviewing the ingredients (should have done so prior to ordering), I realized the product contains sesamum indicum (sesame).  I am HIGHLY sensitive to sesame/sesame products.  After discontinuing use, my face cleared up.  I am giving the product a 4 anyhow.  Great service, and I truly believe a wonderful product for those not sensitive.  Quick absorption and very light.</li>
            <li> In my opinion a serum is the most important part of any skincare regime. It nourishes and is the foundation that helps your moisturizer or sunscreen do it&#x27;s job better.&lt;br /&gt;With a hefty boost of Vitamin C, this one glides on your face like silk. A little goes a long way, and the black bottle keeps the product fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to review.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I had used the product a few months before writing a review and am glad I did! I was worried the thin watered serum wasn&#x27;t going to work since it&#x27;s so watery (literally I thought it was) but my pores aren&#x27;t as noticeable and my wrinkles have softened up quite a bit! Oh and the customer service---AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I saw a youthful difference using Xfacio Labs Best Vitamin C serum- natural , in 3 days.It reduced under eye puffiness, diminished my age spots ,  and evened out my facial skin color. I loved the product. R. Jean Hall</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Great Service! Great product! Highly recommend!!!!! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product has given me great satisfaction. I like the way it make my skin look and feel. I finally found a facial product that doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and grease. I like the smooth and vibrant feeling it gives my skin. I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in my skin in the matter of 2 weeks. Thanks Xfacio you guys got it right...</li>
            <li> I continue to re-order this product as it works better for me than other Vitamin C serums that I have tried.  A little goes a long way, one bottle usually lasts me 3 months using it morning and evening.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!  People are commenting about how young I look. I have only been using it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I already bought my second bottle, also I will try the new toner. The best part is the feedback of how to use it. And maybe you can get a coupon. I am 52 and tried  all kind of serums and creams, I definitely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I am sold on your Vitamin C Serum.  It is fabulous!!!!  Thank youl</li>
            <li> Another great product from Xfacio Labs. At 63 it has definitely done everything for me that they advertised it would. Will always want to use this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> This product is a winner.  My face feels softer and looks brighter. I have gotten compliments from people I haven&#x27;t seen in a while.  They say I look happier.</li>
            <li> This is just the very best serum! My skin is glowing, pores minimized, fine lines are disappearing!!!  I highly recommend this product! I can&#x27;t believe how long it lasts &amp; ,my friends have noticed a difference in my skin! I took it with me on vacation to Mexico! It was humid &amp; warm&amp; usually my face looks greasy  but this kept my make up look fresh all day! Also wonderful for mature skin in dry &amp; cold Midwestern winters! Another beautiful product! I will be buying more!  Bravo Xfacio ,,,now I would love a daily moisturizer??</li>
            <li> Wife uses it daily since Christmas and works great she loves it. The company appears to make wonderful products for skin</li>
            <li> I bought this serum a few days ago, first of all the customer service is amazing. They send you an email to tell you how to use the product and then they send you another email to make sure you receive the product. second, the product itself is awesome I applied it only a few times and I get lots of compliments on how my skin looks so good. even though they say it would take at least 28 days before you see a result. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Customer service at Xfacio ( whose service is excellent ) has informed me that they are coming out with a new Vitamin C serum shortly. I am really looking forward to  trying this new product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using their antiaging serum faithfully and the results have been amazing. I can hardly wait for the Vitamin C to be available.</li>
            <li> Actually 4.5 stars.  I got this with a coupon I found that lowered the price quite a little bit.  I was hesitant to get this as I&#x27;d never really heard of the company, but with the lower price, and the reviews I figured I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rather impressed.  My skin feels amazing using this.  I can&#x27;t say it looks much better, but I&#x27;ve been blessed with very good skin and at 44 I don&#x27;t have much in the way of fine lines anyway, so there isn&#x27;t much to fix.  But my skin feel smoother, and much more hydrated, and at this time of the year, we&#x27;ve started running the furnace, and usually my skin starts to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;I do think I&#x27;ll buy this again, and as I use up the skin care I&#x27;m using in addition to this, I&#x27;ll try other products that Xfacio puts out.</li>
            <li> This has made my skin very smooth in a very short time.  I am starting to see my skin tone even out and pore size reduce.  This will be my go-to from now on.  I cannot wait until there is a cleanser.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I believe I can notice help with my wrinkles. I plan to continue to use this fo a while!</li>
            <li> The products arrived in a timely manner, and there were follow-up emails to make sure I was satisfied with delivery.  As for the products, they go on easily and my skin feels soft and smooth.  I can&#x27;t say that my wrinkles have disappeared, so no miracles, but still happy with the products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the face serum!!! I saw immediate results. My fine lines around my eyes are fading :)</li>
            <li> Love this serum.....my skin looks great!!</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin C serum I have found thus far! I highly recommend it especially for ageing skin.</li>
            <li> Received this item fast and so far it seems to be working fine. The smell is heavenly.</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum! I have been using this product for approx. 3-4 weeks now and i notice a difference in the fine lines on my face and around my eyes. I am 46 years old and have been told twice this week that i do not look my age but much younger. Keep the compliments coming. :) . I will certainly be keeping up on this product.</li>
            <li> My facial skin becomes noticeably better after a few weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> The best Vitamin C product I have used.  Apply and you will instantly notice a difference in the way your facial skin feels.  I even use it on the tops of my aging, sun damaged  hands. Thank you, Xfacio Labs for these gifts of wonderful products for skin that is just not as perfect as it used to be!</li>
            <li> Of all the serums I have tried, Xfacio&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is hands down the best! It goes on smoothly and the results are visible immediately. With just a couple of drops applied to the under eye area, the serum smoothes out crows feet and leaves a very light and cool protective film, not too glossy nor the least bit rubbery. And it’s nice to know I’m actively preventing the signs of aging and helping to keep my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. After I apply and let it dry I add my moisture cream which glides on over the serum. I&#x27;ve actually stopped using another product because the serum makes my skin feel so smooth. The company itself seems to care about its customers and gives great advise on how to use its products. Recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Using this in conjunction with the Anti-aging serum is a major breakthrough I think.  I&#x27;ve only just started using it and my skin feels so smooth and even tighter....I would highly recommend these products to anyone looking to improve the look of their skin.</li>
            <li> Works great! I love it.</li>
            <li> Used religiously until the bottle was gone.  Took before and after pics.  Did not see one bit of difference.</li>
            <li> So I love the company and how hard they are trying to break into this crazy skin care world.  Thank you for the free sample!  I have been using the product for a little over a week and so far it is really terrific.  The serum goes on really smooth and absorbs in seconds.  It does give my skin a tighter feel but once I use a moisturizer it&#x27;s all good.  I really think it is too soon to say if it&#x27;s making a big difference but I do think my skin is brighter.  I will repost and update when I get further along but so far I love this product!  So here is my update. I just love the way it makes my skin feel and am surprised to be saying that it really does make difference in my skin tone.  I am not going to say I don&#x27;t have any more lines because that is just not so BUT it has evened my skin tone, given my skin a smoother, brighter appearance.  I was initially worried about how much my skin was absorbing but that quickly changed and just a few drops is all that&#x27;s needed.  I have no problem recommending this product and I think for the 40&#x27;s crowd it would be amazing!    Dec 2014 Update - This is my absolute favorite skin product after a year of use.  My pore size has decreased and my skin tone keeps brightening.  This is all while I have gone through months of medical treatments that could have wreaked havoc on my skin.  If you want simple, effective and just plain wonderful try a bottle and you&#x27;ll be convinced.  This really is what you are looking for in a skin care product that makes a real difference in you skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this Xfacio Labs vitamin c serum on impulse and it&#x27;s turned out to be an amazing find. My skin feels so soft and silky and everybody has noticed a new brightness or glow radiating from from my skin. It&#x27;s hard to explain but it really brightens up your skin. I&#x27;ve had a number of so called age spots forming over the years and this wonderful serum is slowly making them fade away as well. It&#x27;s an excellent product, beautifully bottled and something that I can truly say you need to add as part of your skin care arsenal. Company follow up has also been superb. I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> love it great product excellent service ,would highly recommend this product,left my skin feeling smoother and looking brighter in only a few days</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I will be a repeat customer,  This product took away the creases in my face and  actually a few weeks later I look years younger</li>
            <li> First of all, the seller of this product is really great.  The product itself left my skin feeling too dry and too tight.  I have dry, sensitive skin and was looking for a reasonably priced product.  This is very reasonably priced, but just does not make my skin feel silky at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have only used it for about 3 weeks, but it has made a great difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I noticed a difference in my neck area the next day. I also appreciate that the product is not tested on animals. I bought the xfacio cream too and I use both the serum and the cream both AM and PM. I started using the cream with my Clarisonic Opal this morning. The serum absorbs quickly too.\\&quot;  UPDATE:  I now see a difference in my squint lines after only a week.  Super product!</li>
            <li> I had wrote a review that I loved the product after a couple of days but I had to come back and say that I REALLY REALLY love it.  I have used it for just over a week now and I can honestly say that my face looks younger and fresher.  I am 46 and although everyone always says I look in my early thirties..I could see some fine lines starting and 2 age spots, I wasn&#x27;t liking what I was seeing.  I take great care of my skin and of course like all of us, I want to look young forever...lol!  After a week of using this product, the 2 spots are fading a little, my pores are smaller and overall my skin tone is more even and just looks amazing.  I wish I had done before and after pictures!!!!  A co-worker who knows I have severe insomnia commented that I looked well rested....after I had gotten only 3 hours of sleep.  I WILL be ordering more when the bottle runs low.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve used other Vitamin C products, and this one blows them all away. There&#x27;s no fragrance, so nothing to irritate sensitive skin or eyes. I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, acne and rosacea, and this product hasn&#x27;t bothered my skin in any way. I love being able to use this around my eyes, as that&#x27;s one area that needs attention on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is well packaged in a tinted bottle with a dropper that keeps the serum sanitary and protected. The serum is a light, clear liquid that glides easily onto the skin and soaks in almost immediately. No heavy cream, lotion, or gel that sits on your skin. If you&#x27;re like me, you layer products, and this was easy for me to include with any other product I wanted to use. I usually mix this with my moisturizer as it&#x27;s one less thing to smooth onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting to use Vitamin C and specifically this version of it, I&#x27;ve noticed a brightening in my skin. I always thought that word was a false claim, as how would you measure brightening? But it seems to me there&#x27;s more color in my skin, and not the red type of color from rosacea! More of a golden glow. I seriously think it looks like I&#x27;m wearing powder or foundation, when I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;ve got dark marks from past acne, and those are starting to lighten. I&#x27;m excited to see something help with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spoken with customer service from their company to inquire about some of their other products, and they were always very helpful. This is a great product at a great price! You can&#x27;t go wrong if you want to try a high concentration of Vitamin C! This is a similar concentration as you&#x27;d get from a doctor (for a much higher price) or from a few skin care companies (also at a much higher price). This is now a necessary part of my skin care routine day and night, and I&#x27;ll be purchasing again when I am near running out. Great product at a great price. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> ok I had to wait a little bit on using this and its been about a week and a half and I have to say , WOW I AM IMPRESSED!! it is softening lines on my face and between my eyes and I also have a scar on my face that is also softening . I am defiantly going to be buying more of this product. I normally don&#x27;t do reviews but I NEEDED TO DO THIS ONE3 .. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff .! No off putting fragrance like some serums I have tried in the past . Perfect under makeup or without makeup. Lightweight sinks in beautifully . Would love to try other products from this company if they are as great as this one .. Thank you .</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  My face was REALLY dry and damaged.  I tried this product and the first week my face definitely went into shock.  Now, it&#x27;s smoothing down and really holding moisture. My makeup goes on better and NO primer is needed.  I am 3 weeks into it and LOVE it!  I&#x27;m 46 so moisture is very important.  You want a product that works right away.  This is it!</li>
            <li> love it!!, i use it before or after the Hyaluric acid serum, goes perfectly with out leaving your face with a thicknes feeling; very fast results!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will order again</li>
            <li> Still using.  Good.  Thank you</li>
            <li> A wonderful Vitamin C Serum.  Very gentle and really makes a difference in my face.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Tried the product on a whim.  Received it in a timely manner and began using it immediately.  It is a non-greasy product that goes on without a trace.  Have used it about a month and see positive results.  Company (seller) has made follow-up contact on several occasions to verify satisfaction, which has been positive.  Would recommend the product to friends and plan to reorder when needed.</li>
            <li> First they sent an email explaining proper use because they want the customer to experience results. It&#x27;s all purpose:  For Your Face, Under Eye and Neck Guaranteed To Work. I saw softer skin and wrinkles soften within a day, seriously. I&#x27;m encouraged and will continue to use it and expect to see even greater results. Using with the anti-agimg. It doesn&#x27;t take but a bit to work and so it is also economical. Much better than products I&#x27;ve paid five times more for.</li>
            <li> I received this product today,  after only one use,,,i can see a difference in my skin&#x27;s overall appearance.  The difference is very noticable!  Xfacio Lab&#x27;s products, do what they say they will do.  I have not been disappointed yet.  I have been using Lancome and Estee Lauder and Marilyn Miglin for years.  These products are very much eqivalent to these and the prices are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorraine Terranova&lt;br /&gt;Hospice Chaplain</li>
            <li> I love this another wonderful product from Xfacio! I &#x27;ve been using it for fews days and already noticed changes. My skin is brighter, firmer and smoother. I have dark spots on my cheeks so i hope this Vitamin C serum will help lightening them! I use it under makeup and the Xfacio anti aging. My skin is extremely sensitive but I don&#x27;t have any breakouts since using Xfacio products. It&#x27;s definitely worth to try it, ladies!</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much, this product is so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a little over two weeks and for this&lt;br /&gt;68 year (young face) it has done wonders.&lt;br /&gt;I clean my face very well and put this on (dry&#x27;s very fast) and&lt;br /&gt;then I continue with the Anti Age and then my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me lady&#x27;s I have tried everything almost on the market&lt;br /&gt;and this is the very best. I will continue to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful customer service and thank you for the free sample&lt;br /&gt;what a surprise that was. Ha, like getting an early Christ-mas gift.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple products and this serum has improved the texture and appearance of my skin better than anything else that i have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Never written a review before . this xfacio advance vitamin c serum is the best I have ever used. I have tried so many never had the result I was looking for. This product is amazing after a week of using  this vitamin c serum I saw a difference, my face was much tone and much brighter. This serum will now be my number . A must have I  highly  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed by the skin and not greasy at all.  My skin feels plump and radiant after I apply it which is usually in the morning before I apply moisturizer.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough but am using daily sometimes twice a day.  Have high hopes.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first but this has turned out to be an excellent product. Very gentle for sensitive skin and the results so far have been very good in the 2 areas that I was concerned about.  The wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have decreased substantially and the age spots on my hands have become much lighter and less noticeable. Excellent customer service as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know where to start, this is the BEST Vitamin C Serum that I have ever used. Within a couple of weeks I could definitely see the amazing difference in the way my face felt and looked. Since I have been using it, I have been getting compliments galore.....I absolutely LOVE their products and I will continue using them forever and the price is right.... &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This serum lived up to my expectations and then some. I had read many of the reviews so decided to purchase it. At 70 years old there is little one can do to look even a few years younger, but this serum easily removed under eye puffiness as well as managed to pull up some of the sagging skin most of us have at this age. I won&#x27;t call it a miracle since the only real miracle would be produced by a facelift, but it is a wonderful product that is worth the money and does what it promises. Whether 30 or 80 it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida,with all our humidity,it&#x27;s important to me that anything I put on my face absorbs well.This product does.No one wants something heavy or sticky.Skin stay soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say one bad thing about this product. This is by far the best vitamin C serum that I have ever used. I felt result results from the first use. I am still monitoring the physical results. Great product! I would love for this serum to be a staple in my facial regimen but the price is a too high for me. Hopefully I will be able to catch some super discounts or maybe some samples soon. I would love to share some products with my friends and who like me are into natural products.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum was one of the better I have tried recently, I found it made my skin look pretty good. It lightened some of my hyperpigmentation, especially on my cheeks and forehead. This serum is sold on Amazon.com, like many others I have tried. It comes in a darkened 1 fl. oz./ 30 mL bottle, which is good for the serum, so it does not oxidize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Been using it only for a few weeks and it&#x27; seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.I am noticing a difference especially around the eye area.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product but I&#x27;m hooked for life!! This is an amazing serum, only using a week my facial lines are diffently fading and my skin glows! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Goes on really smooth and appears to help my skin look fresher(I&#x27;m 61) so will take all the help I can get.&lt;br /&gt;Also great customer service...Nice people.</li>
    </ol>
