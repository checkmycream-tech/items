            <li>I love the creamy cleanser and the rich lipstick the most!</li>
            <li>I love the nude eye-shadows.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this cream.</li>
            <li>After using this product I noticed a bit more firmness in my face.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this compact.</li>
            <li>It also made my lips look Dupler and more &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Fit all my makeup that I travel with, and still had space!</li>
            <li>all in one make up set :)</li>
            <li>This set is so awesome, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love knowing I can buy them here.</li>
            <li>eye shadows are very creamy and have great pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Love clinique products.</li>
            <li>and I love the mascara.</li>
            <li>this lipgloss feels SO smooth on the lips and is amazing.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of it all is the BAG.</li>
            <li>love the colors.</li>
            <li>There is an eye cream which brightens the peepers and a moisturizer which is rich and effective without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>the seller is great and ships super fast and everything was nicely and safely packaged.</li>
            <li>I love it for on the go touch ups and the lipstick is a beautiful shade that matches the tone of my natural lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is a complete set already, so if you needed a quick gift, this is perfect!</li>

            <li>The lipstick is a pretty shade and feels good on the lips.</li>
            <li>First of all this Clinique make up bag is super cute and all these goodies in this bag are great.</li>
            <li>I like being able to sample many different products this way and have been happy with all of them.</li>
            <li>It leaves a great feeling around your eyes and has a very soft and light feeling when applying.</li>
            <li>I recommend this set if you r looking for sampling products before you go ahead and purchase the full size !</li>
            <li>I just love how everything from Clinique smells just clean.</li>
            <li>I am 20 years old so probably not the best candidate (haha).  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with discription of items by seller as well as fast shipping</li>
            <li>the other is a warm brown that looks great in the crease.</li>
            <li>Even the makeup bag itself was super cute and it corresponded with the packaging of the blush/shadow quad as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!! :-)</li>
            <li>but one is so light you can put all over the lid and</li>
            <li>You could easily fit all of the products in there twice with room to spare.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions are my own after personal use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great way to experience all the products without paying retail for full sizes.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited to share it with a friend.</li>
            <li>I love all the products I was given and use most of them frequently!</li>
            <li>whole set is fabulous and the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li>, I use it before bed and my eyeliner comes right off!</li>
            <li>The make up remover just melts the make up right off!</li>
            <li>I adore these products, everything in this set I will be purchasing full bottles of.</li>
            <li>Will be looking into buying a full size for myself and</li>
            <li>Off is seriously one of the best makeup removers!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the rinse off cleanser, left my skin feeling rejuvenated and healthy.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li>( I may actually purchase a larger version of the mascara, because it does a great job!);</li>
            <li>The travel size products are so cute .. and they are of decent sizes.. lasts you months..</li>
            <li>The set was shipped quickly and was well packaged ..</li>
            <li>Very pretty bag.</li>
            <li>Felt very moisturizing and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing gift set.</li>
            <li>This had been my favorite grab bag so far as it afforded me the o</li>
            <li>so they actually look nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;The little palette that the shadows and blush come in is so cute!!</li>
            <li>The bag is super roomy , Actually It takes full size products and still have space !!</li>
            <li>It is about twice as long as I had expected, which is perfect for trips where I like to keep all my makeup and beauty supplies in one place.</li>
            <li>This is like a perfect bag to give as a gift to someone who is just starting down the make up route.</li>
            <li>I was actually looking to buy some of these products individually and luckily was able to find them all conveniently packaged together :) lucky me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s HUGE and I will be using it now as my new make-up bag.</li>
            <li>The items came in neatly packaged and arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>It has a nice big brush that&#x27;s like a Christmas Tree with real bristles, not plastic.</li>
            <li>have fair skin and black hair</li>
            <li>The set came with both a lipstick and a gloss which is the first one I have found like that.</li>
            <li>IÂ´ve purchased several bags (Ipsy, Glossybox, Birchbox) and the pictures always show more products than the ones youÂ´ll receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Firstly, putting a mascara and lipstick together just doesn&#x27;t make sense in my opinion.</li>
            <li>meaning that I will be able to use them for a long time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and is great for sensitive skin plus the tiny bottle is enough to get you</li>
            <li>next time I will try one with a different colored bag and new shades for a change, but I will be happy to have a new set when these bottles run out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product was totally worth the near $17 I paid for it!</li>
            <li>would absolutely buy this set again...</li>
            <li>It came packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all ready to go, just wrap it up</li>
            <li>It lasted through eating, drinking, and wore very well.</li>
            <li>The blush is a pink/peach color that doesn&#x27;t really give off a color but instead brings warmth to the face.</li>
            <li>lip gloss doesn&#x27;t give off any color but is very shiny.</li>
            <li>Delivery fast and everything about this order made</li>
            <li>It really reduced puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>creams that are included are a good size and enough to use long enough to determine if you want to purchase a full size or</li>
            <li>Off Makeup Remover  is very effective without being irritating at all.</li>
            <li>The colors in the mini-palette are divine...neutral enough to be worn every day but unique and make a statement if I go heavier for a night look.</li>
            <li>Works great on eye makeup, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup junkie and only have tried a very few of clinique&#x27;s items but they were equally great as my prestige line of cosmetics i normally use!</li>
            <li>the blush compact is kind of small, but has quality pigmentation to it.</li>
            <li>One of the high end brands ..</li>
            <li>They are all new and sealed.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with the size of the bag.</li>
            <li>Really neat set, like how it is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>The sculpting night cream felt VERY nice around my tired eyes, a definite must.</li>
            <li>Just WOW!</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite brands and I love that I could buy the set online without having to purchase a very expensive product at the makeup counter in order to add this on to an order.</li>
            <li>Gives you the chance to try several Clinique products prior to buying full size.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These two colors really make blue eyes pop.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>The bag is cute too... and bigger than the little rinky-dink cosmetic bags that don&#x27;t hold all my goodies!</li>
            <li>I use the foam cleanser especially for when I have to go on vacations its much easier to pack than my normal facial</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a significant reduction after continual use and ran out of my previous products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself are staples in my traditional everyday makeup routine and are richly pigmented.</li>
            <li>The long last gloss wear isn&#x27;t really my color...</li>
            <li>Also, it helped calm down the tiny visible (to me anyway) lines around the eye are.</li>
            <li>Nothing was broken and I was so excited about this!</li>
            <li>Although they do not eliminate dark circles or bags completed (what product really does nowadays?</li>
            <li>Though the lip gloss is pink in the tube, it actually goes on clear.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It also made my lips look Dupler and more &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with discription of items by seller as well as fast shipping</li>
            <li> the other is a warm brown that looks great in the crease.</li>
            <li> Even the makeup bag itself was super cute and it corresponded with the packaging of the blush/shadow quad as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!! :-)</li>

            <li> Well worth the $$!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited to share it with a friend.</li>
            <li> I love all the products I was given and use most of them frequently!</li>
            <li> whole set is fabulous and the price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> , I use it before bed and my eyeliner comes right off!</li>
            <li> The make up remover just melts the make up right off!</li>
            <li> I adore these products, everything in this set I will be purchasing full bottles of.</li>
            <li> Will be looking into buying a full size for myself and</li>
            <li> Off is seriously one of the best makeup removers!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the rinse off cleanser, left my skin feeling rejuvenated and healthy.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li> ( I may actually purchase a larger version of the mascara, because it does a great job!);</li>
            <li> The travel size products are so cute .. and they are of decent sizes.. lasts you months..</li>
            <li> The set was shipped quickly and was well packaged ..</li>
            <li> Very pretty bag.</li>
            <li> Felt very moisturizing and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing gift set.</li>
            <li> This had been my favorite grab bag so far as it afforded me the o</li>
            <li> so they actually look nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;The little palette that the shadows and blush come in is so cute!!</li>
            <li> The bag is super roomy , Actually It takes full size products and still have space !!</li>
            <li> It is about twice as long as I had expected, which is perfect for trips where I like to keep all my makeup and beauty supplies in one place.</li>
            <li> This is like a perfect bag to give as a gift to someone who is just starting down the make up route.</li>
            <li> I was actually looking to buy some of these products individually and luckily was able to find them all conveniently packaged together :) lucky me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HUGE and I will be using it now as my new make-up bag.</li>
            <li> The items came in neatly packaged and arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> It has a nice big brush that&#x27;s like a Christmas Tree with real bristles, not plastic.</li>
            <li> have fair skin and black hair</li>
            <li> The set came with both a lipstick and a gloss which is the first one I have found like that.</li>
            <li> IÂ´ve purchased several bags (Ipsy, Glossybox, Birchbox) and the pictures always show more products than the ones youÂ´ll receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Firstly, putting a mascara and lipstick together just doesn&#x27;t make sense in my opinion.</li>
            <li> meaning that I will be able to use them for a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and is great for sensitive skin plus the tiny bottle is enough to get you</li>
            <li> next time I will try one with a different colored bag and new shades for a change, but I will be happy to have a new set when these bottles run out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product was totally worth the near $17 I paid for it!</li>
            <li> would absolutely buy this set again...</li>
            <li> It came packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all ready to go, just wrap it up</li>
            <li> It lasted through eating, drinking, and wore very well.</li>
            <li> The blush is a pink/peach color that doesn&#x27;t really give off a color but instead brings warmth to the face.</li>
            <li> lip gloss doesn&#x27;t give off any color but is very shiny.</li>
            <li> Delivery fast and everything about this order made</li>
            <li> It really reduced puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> creams that are included are a good size and enough to use long enough to determine if you want to purchase a full size or</li>
            <li> Off Makeup Remover  is very effective without being irritating at all.</li>
            <li> The colors in the mini-palette are divine...neutral enough to be worn every day but unique and make a statement if I go heavier for a night look.</li>
            <li> Works great on eye makeup, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup junkie and only have tried a very few of clinique&#x27;s items but they were equally great as my prestige line of cosmetics i normally use!</li>
            <li> the blush compact is kind of small, but has quality pigmentation to it.</li>
            <li> One of the high end brands ..</li>
            <li> They are all new and sealed.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with the size of the bag.</li>
            <li> Really neat set, like how it is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> The sculpting night cream felt VERY nice around my tired eyes, a definite must.</li>
            <li> Just WOW!</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite brands and I love that I could buy the set online without having to purchase a very expensive product at the makeup counter in order to add this on to an order.</li>
            <li> Gives you the chance to try several Clinique products prior to buying full size.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These two colors really make blue eyes pop.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> The bag is cute too... and bigger than the little rinky-dink cosmetic bags that don&#x27;t hold all my goodies!</li>
            <li> I use the foam cleanser especially for when I have to go on vacations its much easier to pack than my normal facial</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a significant reduction after continual use and ran out of my previous products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product itself are staples in my traditional everyday makeup routine and are richly pigmented.</li>
            <li> The long last gloss wear isn&#x27;t really my color...</li>
            <li> Also, it helped calm down the tiny visible (to me anyway) lines around the eye are.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken and I was so excited about this!</li>
            <li> Although they do not eliminate dark circles or bags completed (what product really does nowadays?</li>
            <li> Though the lip gloss is pink in the tube, it actually goes on clear.</li>
            <li> Long Last Glosswear-</li>
            <li> It is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this minuter set I can use this on the go and not talk all my products, the only thing was that the eyeshadow was a little broken both other</li>
            <li> It is a bit sticky, but with a longwear gloss that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the Clinique makeup remover, but I had never tried any of the other products.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my dark circles are lighter.  </li>
            <li> I thought the lipstick would be too dark</li>
            <li> The lipstick that came was a bit dark, so I opted for the lip gloss.</li>
            <li> and then I could dark it up if I wanted it darker); a lipgloss -</li>
            <li> It seems dry and has very little color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to break down this set product-by-product, and give my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;*Take</li>
            <li> I think it mutes down the purple color in the lipstick</li>
            <li> The creams weren&#x27;t too heavy on my face like a lot of other products, and the eye cream worked well for my circles.</li>
            <li> i thought it was going to be a little dark on my sand-beige skin, but it went on evenly</li>
            <li> I like that it gets all of the little eyelashes</li>
            <li> Took care of my tired eyes and minimal dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that is intended, or if it&#x27;s just mine.</li>
            <li> When I put this on, I noticed that it was a bit thick.</li>
            <li> so the purple lipstick looks ridiculous on me</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong for this price.</li>

            <li> I was very surprised with the size of the bag. It is about twice as long as I had expected, which is perfect for trips where I like to keep all my makeup and beauty supplies in one place. I can even put my makeup brushes in here and not have to cramp the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup in this set is amazing. It is one of my favorite brands and I love that I could buy the set online without having to purchase a very expensive product at the makeup counter in order to add this on to an order. I like being able to sample many different products this way and have been happy with all of them. The remover is excellent and very gentle. The face wash works well and makes my skin feel great. There is an eye cream which brightens the peepers and a moisturizer which is rich and effective without clogging my pores. The colors in the mini-palette are divine...neutral enough to be worn every day but unique and make a statement if I go heavier for a night look. The set came with both a lipstick and a gloss which is the first one I have found like that. I have probably done the GWP offer 3 or 4 times in stores but this set had way more products than I have ever gotten that way. Love the shades and the quality is unquestionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely buy this set again... next time I will try one with a different colored bag and new shades for a change, but I will be happy to have a new set when these bottles run out.

            <li> Great products and perfect travel sizes, bag is roomy enough for more stuff too!</li>
            <li> I love all the products I was given and use most of them frequently! I was actually looking to buy some of these products individually and luckily was able to find them all conveniently packaged together :) lucky me. Here are some individual reviews of the products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All about the eyes cream: This product has always worked well for me i love both the orange and the night repair one for keeping my under eyes moisturized. Although they do not eliminate dark circles or bags completed (what product really does nowadays?) I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a significant reduction after continual use and ran out of my previous products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The joint mascara and lipstick is a must have in my purse!!! I love it for on the go touch ups and the lipstick is a beautiful shade that matches the tone of my natural lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also adore the make up remover, I use it before bed and my eyeliner comes right off! I use the foam cleanser especially for when I have to go on vacations its much easier to pack than my normal facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product was totally worth the near $17 I paid for it!</li>
            <li> Great price for these eye care products.</li>
            <li> Just WOW! I never thought this gift set contained all of the products shown in the picture. Let me clarify: IÂ´ve purchased several bags (Ipsy, Glossybox, Birchbox) and the pictures always show more products than the ones youÂ´ll receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This had everything and they came with really good size, some of them were not sample size meaning that I will be able to use them for a long time. WeÂ´re talking about CLINIQUE, so rest assure that all of the product are of great quality. IÂ´ve used all of them and loved them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they have another 2016 sample bag IÂ´ll definitely buy it as well.</li>
            <li> This had been my favorite grab bag so far as it afforded me the o</li>
            <li> This is a great set! Love the colors of the make-up and it&#x27;s great that it includes the skin creams and make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I buy this in nordstrom store.I love the take The Day Off Makeup Remover  is very effective without being irritating at all. It seems to remove all types of make-up, even deep pigmentation and waterproof kinds. I follow with Foaming Cleanser to further cleanse my skin and any residue. for the all about eye is one that worked - and I thought I would try this one. I cannot express how much I love this product. Simply extravagant. It leaves a great feeling around your eyes and has a very soft and light feeling when applying. The best part - it works. Took care of my tired eyes and minimal dark circles. Also, it helped calm down the tiny visible (to me anyway) lines around the eye are. Great job Clinique.</li>
            <li> Perfect colors for summer. If summer had a makeup playlist this would be it. I love the creamy cleanser and the rich lipstick the most!</li>
            <li> Deluxe samples of all the Clinique favorites. Literally no complaints, you have to order it! Quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for sale price in exchange  of review, I personally loved clinique product. I have there collection for removing acnes, toner, facial wash and moisturizer.I love that it is a complete set already, so if you needed a quick gift, this is perfect! It&#x27;s all ready to go, just wrap it up and you&#x27;re set. I am using the make-up product and my my mum is using all the creams. She said she likes it and me I love the nude eye-shadows. You cant go wrong for this price.</li>
            <li> great items! loved the colors!</li>
            <li> I am loving this Clinique set! I&#x27;m going to break down this set product-by-product, and give my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;*Take the Day Off Makeup Remover- This product is absolutely lovely! Works great on eye makeup, and a little goes a long way. Non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;* Rinse-off Foaming cleanser- I used this cleanser after I took my makeup off, just to make sure I got everything, and I love it! Makes my skin feel soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;* Repairwear Sculpting Night Cream- I enjoyed this cream. After using this product I noticed a bit more firmness in my face. I am 20 years old so probably not the best candidate (haha).  I especially like that it is 100% fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;* All About Eyes cream- I used this cream for my undereye circles. I noticed that my dark circles are lighter.  Feels nice around the eyes too, did not irritate at all.&lt;br /&gt;* Color Compact- I am pleased with this compact. I think the eyeshadows are beautiful. They are smooth, pigmented, and blend perfectly. The blush however, I do not care for. It seems dry and has very little color. I&#x27;m not sure if that is intended, or if it&#x27;s just mine. I ended up using it as a blending shade for the eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;* Dual-ended Mascara/Lipstick- Firstly, putting a mascara and lipstick together just doesn&#x27;t make sense in my opinion. I think the mascara end should be the lip gloss, with the mascara being separate. That being said, they are both great products. The lipstick is a pretty shade and feels good on the lips. The mascara is nice, lengthening, and does not clump.&lt;br /&gt;* Long Last Glosswear- When I put this on, I noticed that it was a bit thick. It is also sheer with a bit of shimmer. I wore it alone, and over the lipstick on the set. Both looked great. Felt very moisturizing and smooth. It is very long lasting. It lasted through eating, drinking, and wore very well. It also made my lips look Dupler and more &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34;. It is a bit sticky, but with a longwear gloss that is to be expected. I am very pleased with it.Will be looking into buying a full size for myself and my mom.&lt;br /&gt;*Makeup Bag- Very pretty bag. It has lots of space. Fit all my makeup that I travel with, and still had space! Love!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the Clinique makeup remover, but I had never tried any of the other products. The lipstick stayed on for a good amount of time, and it&#x27;s awesome to have it in a duo with the mascara to save some space in my purse. The creams weren&#x27;t too heavy on my face like a lot of other products, and the eye cream worked well for my circles. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Great assortment of popular Clinique products. Perfect size for sampling or travel &amp; the cosmetic bag is adorable</li>
            <li> all in one make up set :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love clinique!! This set is so awesome, especially for the price! If you like clinique but can&#x27;t afford their products and want to try some this set would be perfect for you. I love it. The bag is great too, but it&#x27;s not a purse size bag, it&#x27;s a good sized one. You could use the bag to hold all your makeup or put in your suitcase for traveling. It will hold alot. I thought the lipstick would be too dark but it&#x27;s not. I think it will look great in just about anyone. I&#x27;ve always wanted some of these kits but didn&#x27;t want to spend the 85 bucks to get it. I love knowing I can buy them here. They are all new and sealed. I&#x27;ve bought 2 different sets from this seller and they are both great!!&lt;br /&gt;I recieved thisproduct at a reduced rate in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> Great set to give as a gift! Shipping was perfectly on time and there were no problems with the products! Great products!</li>
            <li> I like the variety in this set.&lt;br /&gt;The eye shadows are very creamy and have great pigmentation. There are only two in here but one is so light you can put all over the lid and the other is a warm brown that looks great in the crease. These two colors really make blue eyes pop.&lt;br /&gt;In with the shadows is a blush. The blush is a pink/peach color that doesn&#x27;t really give off a color but instead brings warmth to the face. I have fair skin but I can imagine this looks great on all skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;The little palette that the shadows and blush come in is so cute!! It is geometric print just like the bag and has a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not a fan of the lipstick because when I received it, it was melted and broke on me. I liked that it was dual ended though with a mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is great. It has a nice big brush that&#x27;s like a Christmas Tree with real bristles, not plastic. I like that it gets all of the little eyelashes you didn&#x27;t know you had but also washes off at the end of the of the day easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make up remover is the bomb. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes and is great for sensitive skin plus the tiny bottle is enough to get you hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creams that are included are a good size and enough to use long enough to determine if you want to purchase a full size or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip gloss doesn&#x27;t give off any color but is very shiny. I think it mutes down the purple color in the lipstick so they actually look nice together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and black hair so the purple lipstick looks ridiculous on me but I think it would look great on people with darker skin.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice if the lipstick offered any moisture but it didn&#x27;t make my lips chapped. It also doesn&#x27;t feather or bleed.&lt;br /&gt;The bag is very big. You could easily fit all of the products in there twice with room to spare. It is a nice cloth material so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting stained if something happens to spill in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Really neat set, like how it is small and easy to travel with. The lipstick is a beautiful color and applies nicely on the lips. The under eye cream is also nice and hydrating.</li>
            <li> I loved this combo, the colors were great and I loved the skin care. My favorite is the make up remover and the eyeshadows they were nice nudes and applied were well, no fall out and the best part is that they didnt irritate my sensitive eyes or skin.</li>
            <li> Love this bundle!!! Love the bag!!! Good price definitely worth it !!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! I&#x27;m so proud to be the owner of this sale. The mascara is AHMAZING best mascara I&#x27;ve used. The make up remover just melts the make up right off! Lip stick and gloss are perfect in every way! The customer service is a joy to work with. Delivery fast and everything about this order made me one happy make up junkie! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Love clinique products. Everything there as described.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is amazing and I love the mascara. The lipstick that came was a bit dark, so I opted for the lip gloss. Though the lip gloss is pink in the tube, it actually goes on clear. The eye cream is great! It really reduced puffiness around my eyes. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these products to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing gift set. It comes with a lipstick (which is actually a GREAT color - i thought it was going to be a little dark on my sand-beige skin, but it went on evenly and then I could dark it up if I wanted it darker); a lipgloss - this lipgloss feels SO smooth on the lips and is amazing. The eye make-up primer/cream is great - it&#x27;s held my eye shadow in place without it creasing; the mascara (which duals with the lipstick into one piece) is of great quality and makes my eyelashes much fuller ( I may actually purchase a larger version of the mascara, because it does a great job!); The eyeshadow duo w/ the blush compact is kind of small, but has quality pigmentation to it. The eye make-up remover is great -- removes mascara, eyeliner, and lip products with ease. The foaming face wash is great and removes make-up easily as well. My favorite part of it all is the BAG. It&#x27;s HUGE and I will be using it now as my new make-up bag. It&#x27;s cute, colorful, and perfect for summer. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this set !! It is amazing and it has everything a lady needs for a college or work. The travel size products are so cute .. and they are of decent sizes.. lasts you months.. The bag is super roomy , Actually It takes full size products and still have space !! love the colors. Of course no need to review CLinique brand.. One of the high end brands .. They understand the concerns of women .. The set was shipped quickly and was well packaged ..I recommend this set if you r looking for sampling products before you go ahead and purchase the full size !</li>
