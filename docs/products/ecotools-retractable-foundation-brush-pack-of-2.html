            <li>I was very excited for this product because I&#x27;ve been looking for a foundation brush with a cover to prevent stuff from getting all over it in my make bag</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely color and nice looking to use for your daily prep.</li>
            <li>The tip is perfect for the under-eye area and around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;It might be a bit small for full face foundation but as a concealer brush it is honestly a lot better than several high-end brushes I have</li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>They shipped me another set right away!</li>
            <li>They are worth the money.</li>
            <li>It have a retractable system that allows the lid without damaging the threads, it&#x27;s soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This brush is strong, but soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has never shed a single hair and is nice and dense.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found all the Ecotools brushes that I&#x27;ve gotten to be well made and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced the least breakouts with Eco tools, Some Sonia Kashuk and coastal scents brushesðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I love all of EcoTools brushes and this one is just the same.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, but also very well made!</li>

            <li>blends really well.</li>
            <li>They are soft,hold up well,and are very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The price is extremely reasonable.</li>
            <li>As a foundation brush, it&#x27;s good - soft bristles, firmly attached.  </li>
            <li>Any foundation brush is a pain to clean and this one is no different.</li>
            <li>It does NOT work as expected as a soft foundation brush which is supposed to apply foundation evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t come loose easily, and I know it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>but I find it hard to pull out to put the top back in place.</li>
            <li>Not very fluffy, so it spreads powder on pretty thick.  </li>

            <li> Not very fluffy, so it spreads powder on pretty thick.  But it works really well for travel</li>
            <li> I was very excited for this product because I&#x27;ve been looking for a foundation brush with a cover to prevent stuff from getting all over it in my make bag however I&#x27;m very disappointed in this and would not recommend it. My liquid foundation sticks to it and it basically absorbs it. Requiring me to use much more. It also goes on streaky and I end up having to use my fingers to even it out which defeats the purpose of having a brush. I&#x27;ve had it for a week and have tried it more than once. If you use a liquid foundation I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professtional make-up artist.  I didn&#x27;t imagine that brushes this cheap would be any good.  I bought extra set for me and one for my travel make-up kit.  I also bought retractable Powder Brush.  Prime shipping and you can&#x27;t lose!</li>
            <li> Nice brush love that it retracts to keep bristles safe.  It&#x27;s a lovely color and nice looking to use for your daily prep.</li>
            <li> Brush is great but retractable is not an option.  It came with a lid and anyone knows you can&#x27;t bend bristles backwards.  They always fluff when you start to use them.  I do like the brush set though.  They are worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Afican American with sensitive skin; I&#x27;ve used becca and MAC brushes and have broken out in the worst ways ... I&#x27;ve experienced the least breakouts with Eco tools, Some Sonia Kashuk and coastal scents brushesðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I love it and its great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Works just like a merge between a finger and a foundation brush.  I would have preferred to be able to purchase one, but the two pack allows me to take one on the go.  I love the retract-ability of it.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Took away one star because at times the retractable portion gets stuck and I have to apply force to retract.</li>
            <li> I do like this brush but I find it hard to pull out to put the top back in place.</li>
            <li> This product is great!!! It fits perfectly in my makeup bag!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I am glad it comes in a 2-pack! Mine actually originally was shipped solo, and I contacted Amazon and let them know. They shipped me another set right away! The bristles don&#x27;t come off during makeup application like some other brushes, and the retractable feature is great, allowing for me to keep it neatly stored in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it for my cream and liquid concealer.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the lid and retractable system it&#x27;s super easy to throw in my makeup bag and take anywhere without worrying about making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;It blends really well. The tip is perfect for the under-eye area and around the nose.&lt;br /&gt;It might be a bit small for full face foundation but as a concealer brush it is honestly a lot better than several high-end brushes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;It has never shed a single hair and is nice and dense.&lt;br /&gt;Will be repurchasing and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> EcoTools  are wonderful.They are soft,hold up well,and are very inexpensive.I like these brushes as well as my Bare Minerals expensive foundation brush.Of utmost importance to me is the fact they are a non animal testing company.</li>
            <li> This brush is strong, but soft. The bristles don&#x27;t come loose easily, and I know it will last me a long time. The price is extremely reasonable. Most quality foundation brushes cost much, much more. The coverage I get from this brush it perfect, and make up is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great applicator for foundation. Would Buy Again!</li>
            <li> I wanted a retractable make-up brush for traveling and this one works great.  Very inexpensive, but also very well made! I&#x27;ve found all the Ecotools brushes that I&#x27;ve gotten to be well made and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> very good . was excatcly what i order. very good quality . i will order more soon and price are good</li>
            <li> I love all of EcoTools brushes and this one is just the same. I use it everyday and it helps apply makeup evenly when I&#x27;m in a rush.</li>
            <li> Again you get what you pay for. This is a very stiff and uncomfortable brush. It feels very harsh on my face. I can&#x27;t use it at all.  I will stay away from these brushes. Echo tools are not for my skin. My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I cant believe I actually bought this coming with pack of 2....It does NOT work as expected as a soft foundation brush which is supposed to apply foundation evenly and smoothly. So say NO to these brush.....NO</li>
            <li> Not so good on the retractibility (ability?).  I got this to be a brush for on the go, one that I could just drop into my purse without worrying about it, but no such luck.  It won&#x27;t swivel back down, so the lid won&#x27;t go back on.  As a foundation brush, it&#x27;s good - soft bristles, firmly attached.  But if you need to retract it, spend your money elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan 2013 - sometime in December, the thing that allows this to be retractible loosened, and now it retracts/expands easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister and me, and it&#x27;s great. It have a retractable system that allows the lid without damaging the threads, it&#x27;s soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This brush is (was?) great for application, until i decided to give it a bath and it began shedding. It has shed more than a cat, and and the bristles/hairs end up all over myself and the sink. Not sure if I can trust this brand, as much as I would like to.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love these brushes.  I keep a makeup bag in my car (for touch-ups) and this brush was perfect for it.  Keeps my hands and makeup bag clean and I feel better applying foundation with a clean brush that is protected.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect foundation brush. It has a cover on it so it doesn&#x27;t get all over your makeup bag. It&#x27;s great for traveling. Any foundation brush is a pain to clean and this one is no different. I bought 4 of these and don&#x27;t see myself switching to another brush anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to be a pack of 2 however I only received 1 in the package so I feel this was unjustified in price. The brush works ok, don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again.</li>
