            <li>It goes on really nicely and has a nice light smell.</li>
            <li>I love that its completely adjustable and it works perfectly hand in hand with the cream.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad to have it this way.</li>
            <li>I am very happy because I do not to use Insulin in the future.</li>
            <li>There is no way this will fit around a man!</li>
            <li>It is the best buy that I have made and one that actually gave me the results that I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have been using Skinny Cream for about 45 days and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream..</li>
            <li>The water weight is off and I am glad as that was the problem for me.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Going to order more.</li>
            <li>Great product with a decent price.</li>
            <li>It fits most stomachs, and it easy to put on and comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The results might be more if I used it twice a day for the full 7 weeks, but the concept of buying 6 or 8 bottles to find out is what I am questioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With waist training being all the craze these days, I was super excited to try to trimmer and the skinny cream!  </li>
            <li>but now that it is off I look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am just glad that I did not waste my money on this.</li>
            <li>The skin becomes tight and the inner muscles are tones after using the belt and this is why you can shape use it to gain a perfect toned body.</li>
            <li>I ended up washing it and its fine now, but don&#x27;t be surprised when it arrives.  </li>
            <li>Nothing feels better than knowing that something you bought is actually living up to its description.</li>
            <li>Within the first week or so I noticed that my skin had become smoother and the cellulite had been reduced which is better than walking around looking a hot mess.</li>
            <li>I sit up straight when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>it only for thighs because I wanted it to last for 8weeks at least.&lt;br /&gt;Lasted more than 8 weeks but absolutely nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apply it to clean, dry skin and combine with waist trimmer for optimal results.</li>
            <li>Since using the Skinny cream, my skin seems to be more firm.</li>
            <li>I have used many other in the past but this one is by far my favorite...</li>
            <li>I used skinny cream regularly, it smooth and toned my skin ESP the lower abdomen  and the back where my back handles on the bra line.</li>
            <li>But so far I am excited for the results I do have in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I felt light and tight after using this product.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is to small to fit around someone needing to lose weight.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I can actually tell the next morning that my legs don&#x27;t feel or look as heavy.</li>
            <li>And it barely fits!</li>
            <li>The only thing this did was make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>The reviews on this was my deciding factor and so far it has only been a week</li>
            <li>so I hope to see more dramatic results with continued use.</li>

            <li> Waste of time now back to searching for a correct trimmer!</li>
            <li> I try to use it on a daily basis and although I sometimes miss a few days I still get results.</li>
            <li> But the waist trimmer has worked with other creams that I have used.  </li>
            <li> scent, absorbs quickly, but it failed the purpose for which it was purchased...Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Nothing beats having tight skin and not having it sag.</li>
            <li> I just received the waist trimmer, not sure how the cream works because I did not get it.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I have after 5 days is that the trimmer its self has a bad smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Poor product.  </li>
            <li> The waist trainer is a thin piece of fabric poorly put together.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical to say the least.</li>
            <li> The waist trimmer belt is ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> The neoprene stinks bad!!</li>

            <li> The skinny cream is a great addition to my weight loss routine and beauty regimen. Apply it to clean, dry skin and combine with waist trimmer for optimal results. It goes on really nicely and has a nice light smell. I felt light and tight after using this product. Will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I just received the waist trimmer, not sure how the cream works because I did not get it.  But the waist trimmer has worked with other creams that I have used.  It fits most stomachs, and it easy to put on and comfortable to wear.  I sit up straight when I wear it.  It does not pinch my skin.  A great waist trimmer!!</li>
            <li> Skin is firming feel it smoother</li>
            <li> The skin becomes tight and the inner muscles are tones after using the belt and this is why you can shape use it to gain a perfect toned body.</li>
            <li> Poor product.  Does NOT work.  The waist trainer is a thin piece of fabric poorly put together. The cream didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> My skin has been smoother and has actually toned up since I have been using this and I am glad to have it this way. The appearance is wonderful and I do not worry about it looking like I have bumps in my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic patient.I am losing my belly fat with this cream.I am very happy because I do not to use Insulin in the future.I am using this cream along with my work out.</li>
            <li> With waist training being all the craze these days, I was super excited to try to trimmer and the skinny cream!  The only negative I have after 5 days is that the trimmer its self has a bad smell to it.  I ended up washing it and its fine now, but don&#x27;t be surprised when it arrives.  Otherwise, the trimmer works wonders.  I love that its completely adjustable and it works perfectly hand in hand with the cream.  Overall a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review..</li>
            <li> I used skinny cream regularly, it smooth and toned my skin ESP the lower abdomen  and the back where my back handles on the bra line. It work wonders, I loved it!</li>
            <li> Just after using for two weka I could deffinetly see a difference. My thighs looks smoother. Wish the bottle was bigger. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> Since using the Skinny cream, my skin seems to be more firm. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month so I hope to see more dramatic results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for the waist trimmer belt as well as the cream. The waist trimmer belt is ridiculous!!! The neoprene stinks bad!! And it barely fits! People that are looking at this are looking at ways to help lose weight and if you can wear this you don&#x27;t need to! This trimmer is to small to fit around someone needing to lose weight. I am not obese I can just stand to lose about 15 lbs. if this helps you get an idea of the actual size. There is no way this will fit around a man! Waste of time now back to searching for a correct trimmer!</li>
            <li> It worked for me ! Great product with a decent price. I am happy I took the chance and tried this one.</li>
            <li> I have toned skin and the weight is off as well. I am just glad that I did not waste my money on this. It is the best buy that I have made and one that actually gave me the results that I wanted.</li>
            <li> The best thing that has happened is the fat reduction that I have seen. I have been trying to get that off and now it is finally coming off. I love skinny cream!!</li>
            <li> Ordered the pack of two.&lt;br /&gt;Used it only for thighs because I wanted it to last for 8weeks at least.&lt;br /&gt;Lasted more than 8 weeks but absolutely nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good scent, absorbs quickly, but it failed the purpose for which it was purchased...Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have this product  as a gift from my friend  and is not work at all I don&#x27;t see any improvement  I definitely  not recommended  this product  is a complety  rip off</li>
            <li> It has only been 3 weeks and I have only put it on once per day, but I have almost finished one bottle already and see no results at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results might be more if I used it twice a day for the full 7 weeks, but the concept of buying 6 or 8 bottles to find out is what I am questioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use my second bottle for the next 3 weeks and I will see if that helps at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermarolling will be my next experiment.  I know that dermarolling will get rid of the cellulite, but I chose this hoping this would decrease the fat deposits and that has not happened at all using it once per day.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t hoping for a miracle, but for some differance. The only thing this did was make my skin soft. So I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinny Cream for about 45 days and love it. Results are almost immediate. Exercise and eating healthy is important for best results. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Within the first week or so I noticed that my skin had become smoother and the cellulite had been reduced which is better than walking around looking a hot mess.</li>
            <li> I love this cream..I have used many other in the past but this one is by far my favorite...I recommend it to anyone!!</li>
            <li> The reviews on this was my deciding factor and so far it has only been a week and I notice my skin smoothing out where there was a lot of rocky road going on in the thigh area.</li>
            <li> My skin is tighter than it was before and I like the look especially when I want to wear a swim suit. Nothing beats having tight skin and not having it sag.</li>
            <li> The water weight is off and I am glad as that was the problem for me. I am not fat it’s just the added water weight but now that it is off I look and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> Using my skinny cream has helped me decrease the fat deposits and get rid of some of the water retention that has affected my skin. Nothing feels better than knowing that something you bought is actually living up to its description.</li>
            <li> I have been using the skinny cream and the waist trimmer combo for about 1 week not and I can already tell a difference in my waist and in the dimples I have in my belly area. My cloths are feeling looser and my skin feels firmer. I have used products similar to this and had no results so I was skeptical to say the least. But so far I am excited for the results I do have in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel firmer. Loving it</li>
            <li> I am seeing the reduction in the cellulite and it is great to see. I try to use it on a daily basis and although I sometimes miss a few days I still get results.</li>
            <li> Great product. Order it the 2nd time and I love it. Going to order more.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I can actually tell the next morning that my legs don&#x27;t feel or look as heavy.</li>
            <li> Loveeee the stuff. Been using it for months and totally see a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s tighter and smoother.</li>
