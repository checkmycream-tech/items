            <li>scent is actually very nice (not at all over-powering like</li>
            <li>this smells like Minty rose!</li>
            <li>as good but great price</li>
            <li>This smells nice too!  </li>
            <li>I dye my hair and am always looking for something great to use and good smelling.</li>
            <li>Perfect for fine hair</li>
            <li>It smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>just smells really good.  </li>
            <li>It does not fade my hair color, cleans well and leaves my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Herbal Essences one since the reviews are good.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice and it smelled great.</li>
            <li>as good as Wen&#x27;s but alot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>good night</li>
            <li>Best of all is that my hair was clean all day.</li>
            <li>I love everything rose and this was a very good conditioner rinse but in no way did this smell like roses.</li>
            <li>I have never used WEN because of the price but read many people used this instead with great results.  </li>
            <li>Ok, these all smell great.</li>
            <li>love all herbal essenes products they always leave my hair smelling and feeling great</li>
            <li>I love the push packaging and it&#x27;s a great conditioner for colored hair--maintains the color</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>Today I have beautiful, frizz free elongated curls.  </li>
            <li>and it smells amazing, like everything else Herbal Essences makes.</li>
            <li>My hair feels AMAZING with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is amazing.</li>
            <li>The cleansing conditioner works amazingly even if you do not have color treated hair.</li>
            <li>So, I started looking around and used similiar products that worked well but not as well as this AMAZING product.</li>
            <li>I respectfully disagree with those who say this smells good.</li>
            <li>Really nice alternative to WEN.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how my hair  looked and felt.  </li>
            <li>The rose scent is not overpowering...</li>
            <li>Nice smell too.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it smells really nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just a beefed up conditioner that smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this just feels like I am rubbing conditioner all over my head.</li>
            <li>This detangles well and has really nice slip.  </li>
            <li>Cleansing conditioner is kind of a compromise--</li>
            <li>the smell is a bit sweet for me, but the price is GREAT</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is beyond great, arrives so quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong flowery scent.</li>
            <li>Also, it makes brushing it out post-shower very easy.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy.  </li>
            <li>I honestly felt like it just cleaned my highlighted hair and made the highlights shine more.</li>
            <li>I tried Wen years ago and refuse to pay those prices when something this good is available and does not have to be ordered.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is the best.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Herbal Essences rose scent, always have.</li>
            <li>My hair always looks great right after I color it, but gets a bit brassy after a couple of washes.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I love that they did this in the original rose scent!</li>
            <li>Ive used others that I liked much better and worked much better.</li>
            <li>The smell is great that is the only great thing I can say for it.</li>
            <li>I find that Herbal Essences Color Me Happy helps maintain my salon color very, very well.  </li>
            <li>My hair smells great and is super smooth.</li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal one is much better.</li>
            <li>I tried it and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>hair color doesn&#x27;t seem to have faded any substantial amount (unlike with even &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; shampoos where I can see a notable difference).</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>love love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I gave this a shot based off of the reviews and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I happen to love the floral scent.  </li>
            <li>and you have to use more.</li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>and I love that it is color safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li>I dipped into my Wen reserve and fell in love all over again.</li>
            <li>I had been a WEN user for better than a year.  </li>
            <li>My hair does seem more moisturized, as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is still the color I love as if I just colored it yesterday.</li>
            <li>So I love my sudsy shampoo</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>And my hair smells like lovely roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt or looked better &amp; my color doesn&#x27;t fade.  </li>
            <li>I love using cleansing conditioners on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The trick is you do have to use a lot of product, and you have to make sure to spend time massaging your scalp.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair has a lot more body and now easier to style.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It was better then hair</li>
            <li>More like flowers with medicine.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>but I was able to find it cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love.</li>
            <li>but, I use it all the time and my hair has never felt or looked better.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Love it and so does my husband.</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny with this product ,even more so than Wen</li>
            <li>Love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love the price because she goes thru a bottle in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It works better than wen in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I gave a bottle to my sister and mother and they fell in love with it too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an OK cleansing conditioner for the price; leaves hair shiny, but does nothing to help make hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Just OK.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; any more.  </li>
            <li>My hair has more moisture &amp; body than ever</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>it helps retain the color longer and my hair and scalp love the feeling.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I have a blog under the name abeautyandthebusiness and have written many wen reviews that you can read there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to note one more thing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s so soft and shiny, just gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that herbal essence is finally making products that will work with my hair as I have always loved the nice fresh smell the products leave on the hair.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on hair, easy on the purse and great on results.</li>
            <li>I used Wen exclusively for years, but this is JUST AS GOOD, and is much more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I apply just like shampoo, massage my scalp, then I comb thru and leave in for about 2-3 minutes and it rinses out clean, leaves no oily residue like some....LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love the smell better than the original.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is soft and the frizzy halo is tamed and the smell is amazing, fruity and perfect for a young girl.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s available in town) and loved it after the first use.  </li>
            <li>This one has a great scent and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and I am a devote user of handmade Lush cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>LOVE that it&#x27;s sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>Price is good thanks amazon you get 6 and 6 Herbal ztars</li>
            <li>Smells great, is cheap and leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I tried this being an avid user of more costly cleansing conditioners and will NEVER pay alot of money again!</li>
            <li>This stuff spreads really easily, is buttery without being waxy, and does seem to cleanse my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to comb.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this product because I love the Herbal Essence naked cleansing conditioner but not the way it smells.</li>
            <li>, it seems to clean my (oily) hair better without drying it.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice stuff</li>
            <li>Smells great and my hair is super soft!</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and is less damaging than shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I suspect it would be fine....</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS TERRIFIC, SMELLS WONDERFUL AND SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li>I use this daily on my super curly 3b/c hair, and it feels soo good!</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a huge plus, but as I mentioned before, it takes time to get used to washing hair without loads of bubbles.</li>
            <li>Since this product is sulfate free</li>
            <li>It joins the list of sulfate free hair cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>Me Happy gives me an extra day without shampooing but gets rid of sweat from exercising.</li>
            <li>Starting using WEN which also is great</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>but you must use another conditioner a couple days in between to make your hair smooth.</li>
            <li>fragrance is pleasantly light.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic alternative to the drying effects of shampoo.</li>
            <li>As well as I have been sulfate free shampoo use for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is light and not at all over powering like the Loreal cleansing conditioner is.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I got some of this from a big chain discount store for a lot more money than amazon and loved the product.  </li>
            <li>Worked OK - the smell was not as good as many other clairol herbal essences products.</li>
            <li>Not half as good as WEN but a goos cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST THING I FOUND OUT WAS NO SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER!!</li>
            <li>I really like this product!!!  </li>
            <li>I use it in between shampooing and it seems to get my hair clean and soft and smelling really really good.</li>
            <li>This cleansing conditioner leaves my scalp feeling clean and oil free.</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>We love the whole no shampoo thing!</li>
            <li>They are soft and very lovely.  </li>
            <li>I felt like the herbal essences did not leave my hair feeling silky and clean, but rather</li>
            <li>My hair was as clean as always.</li>
            <li>Hair was greasy and didn&#x27;t look clean.</li>
            <li>Wen rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Now if one had a perm, this would be good to use after a perm (it is very conditioning, but no so much cleansing).</li>
            <li>It does have a pleasant smell and I might use it when extra conditioning is needed over cleansing.</li>
            <li>My hair was hydrated, clean, and full of volume.</li>
            <li>Hard to get used to no lather, but it smells great!</li>
            <li>Great product and arrived ahead of expected date.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping love this product</li>
            <li>My hair was nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>I used it after using V05 kiwi lime clarifying shampoo to get a true trial of this product on fresh product free hair.  </li>
            <li>and I knew that I could never use Wen to clean my hair effectively after more than 24 hours and once when out of town with limited packing space.</li>
            <li>I used to have shiny, healthy hair, but as I got older (40&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>Smells more chemical than rosy to me, and I still like Herbal Essences Naked a lot better.</li>
            <li>gets me in and out of the shower quickly as was the reason i obtained it.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Since the Naked version was all I could find I tried that first and loved it.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and it leaves my hair very well conditioned.  </li>
            <li>in all, it seems to do what it claims (which is rather rare for a hair product in my experience).</li>
            <li>It leaves my scalp feeling fresh, but not stripped.</li>
            <li>Overall, my favorite alternative to Wen and it&#x27;s available at some stores.</li>
            <li>That was about the only thing I liked about it.  </li>
            <li>Had a lot of success with this.  </li>
            <li>have given it 5 stars if it had a more natural smell.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft, clean and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>Another reason I prefer Wen because it is cruelty free and the ingredients they use are of a high quality, mostly oils and natural extracts.</li>
            <li>Very silky, healthy, vibrant hair.</li>
            <li>I have a very full head of long, straight, fine, colored hair (i.e., each hair is fine in diameter, and I have zillions of hairs.)  </li>
            <li>I noticed right away</li>
            <li>price is right and it has a pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li>for this cleansing conditioner I find it worrisome that right on the bottle in its directions use between shampoos.</li>
            <li>This is ABSOLUTELY the BEST EVER hair product for dry, frizzy, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been paying and searching for a great hair cleanser for far too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product and can&#x27;t imagine why I would go back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but makes medium hair dry.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and works pretty well on my excema-ridden scalp and dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good, but made my hair look a little greasy.</li>
            <li>I literally cannot understand how other reviews are claiming a rose fragrance--I dont detect a single note of rose anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I am confident that if I keep using this product I will not have to use it daily.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this product and I will most definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li>When I saw it here, and that I could get it sent to me before I run out, no shipping cost, and a product discount every time, I was ready to sign on!  </li>
            <li>Really helps my color hold up well!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time</li>
            <li>but I can see the benefits, and it&#x27;s so much better than wen, which I used only once.</li>
            <li>I use this exactly for that purpose as my shower goes a lot quite when I do not have to shampoo then leave in a conditioner for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>(Note: I did put more product in the second time thinking it would keep my hair softer longer.)</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the best alternative to shampoo 100% of the time, but I like it every 3rd day (one day shampooing, one day to skip, one day with conditioner/cleanser).</li>
            <li>but why pay more when this product gives me the same results.</li>
            <li>and it definitely swings and moves with more bounce.</li>
            <li>one.uses 2 pumps and My hair felt fresh and and the smell was not over powering PEOPLE that know I am real picky about my colored hair and skin products.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>This is the second Cleaning condition that I have tried and I absolutely love this one.  </li>
            <li>And MUCH CHEAPER THAN WEN!</li>
            <li>what I do is use this for my FIRST shampoo</li>
            <li>This was the first one I found so</li>
            <li>That said, it is a good non-invasive hair treatment versus harsh shampoos.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan to never use it again but since these conditioners have such amazing fragrances, I&#x27;m liking this new cleansing experience.</li>
            <li>Works just like Wen, smells good but its not a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find a product without these 2 ingredients and my beautiful hair is showing the results of their omission.</li>
            <li>This is one area I expected it to fall short of expectations, but i&#x27;m happy to say it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>ends did feel nice and soft, but I can get the same softness with any Herbal Essences conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works as good as, if not better than, WEN.</li>
            <li>I wish they had more scents because I know I&#x27;m going to be using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li>My curls are nice ringlets with less frizz.  </li>
            <li>Certain occasions I think still call for soapy cleaners though.</li>
            <li>washing with this cleansing conditioner I use 4 pumps for both the first wash, which my hair didn&#x27;t feel too clean and the second wash which my hair felt knotty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Felt very drying to my hair</li>
            <li>It really took care of that problem fast.</li>
            <li>I can say that it really does protect my hair color.</li>
            <li>me happy one and am addicted to this one now.</li>
            <li>I find that it cleanses really well, even when I have smelly, greasy gym hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than wen.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have a very oily scalp</li>
            <li>I wake up every morning with very oily roots.  </li>
            <li>looking for a substitute for wen and this comes very close</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioning cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>However that&#x27;s about every hair product for me because there is so much of it.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair shiny, and conditioned, and it smells like roses.</li>
            <li>I have been a wen girl for over five years, I really thought there would be nothing to beat wen.</li>
            <li>Works great....just not a big rose scent person and it makes my scalp itchy after several days use.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of heavy styling with my hair and this cleansing conditioner really does the job nicely when it comes to moisturizing.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it a few times, so far so good...</li>
            <li>It definitely got my hair clean and it feels much softer.</li>
            <li>The other reviews managed to convince me to buy it, however, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I originally got it because there was a coupon I thought it was a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>To me, it has the same original Herbal Essences flower smell from a decade ago.</li>
            <li>If I come to not be able to afford Wen anymore, I will buy this as a replacement and organix shampoo every other washing.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, oily hair with dry ends.</li>
            <li>It does not lather so it does not feel like I am giving myself a deep clean.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, like regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the skills like many beauty bloggers and Pinteresters who can somehow pile their hair on their head and suddenly look ready for a red carpet</li>
            <li>I have used WEN in the past and liked it, but not the price.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have the same cleaning properties as Wen, but it is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>hair seems less frizzy (without the use of other &amp;#34;de-frizzing&amp;#34; products), which isn&#x27;t something I was expecting, but is greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, and only washed out some of my fresh hair color, but left me with a lot of flyaways and soft frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have oily hair and scalp and this has worked very well to get my hair clean without making my scalp too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it smells like most conditioners out there which won&#x27;t bother most people just me .</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Not only is it cheaper than similar products, but it smells amazing and really did prolong the amount of time the red in her hair lasted before fading.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and my hair looks soft and shiny after using it.</li>
            <li>For now though, i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and would definitely recommend this to anyone who is tired of how traditional shampoos and conditioners treat their hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every possible cleansing conditioner for color treated hair and this one wins in every category.  </li>
            <li>This was a very good alternative to wen cleasing conditioner; that gets too expensive!</li>
            <li>Now I am going to get my hair re-colored in about 3 days and will follow-up this review with how the cleansing conditioner works on newly colored hair.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, saves using separate shampoo/conditioner combos and takes less time.</li>
            <li>I was a red head whose hair is now white, and I color it a light auburn.  </li>
            <li>I have just recently changed over from regular shampoo to sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it, it had made my hair very soft and silky until the next day.</li>
            <li>I sometimes follow up with a regular conditioner when I&#x27;m feeling ambitious or it&#x27;s date</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely compare it to the higher end ones, like Wen.  </li>
            <li>I used the naked one first and decided to try this one as I do color my hair.  </li>
            <li>I actually like this product more than the other Herbal Essences one</li>
            <li>It is also free of tocophyerol acetate (vitamin E), which is a problem in weighing down my curls and causing scalp irritation.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and I barely use my flat iron anymore</li>
            <li>My natural hair is white (prematurely, thanks Dad!)</li>
            <li>hair turned out clean, and genuinely soft without feeling like it&#x27;s coated in something (other conditioners coat your hair in wax to get that &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; feel,</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and clean but would not use again due to the smell.</li>
            <li>This works as good, if not better, than the Naked version and smells like middle school!!</li>
            <li>I had tried a few different options in the past that left my hair feeling greasy and left my fine very straight hair very limp despite my best efforts.</li>
            <li>My tip is to work it in, let it sit about five minutes, then before you rinse it out, add a little warm water and create a low later, massage, then rinse it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but i&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, this product does not claim to be a shampoo as it clearly states that this is meant for use in-between shampoos.</li>
            <li>I understand that the natural oils in my scalp are no longer being stripped.</li>
            <li>It feels soft.</li>
            <li>Will not repurchase (although it did make my skin soft and smell of roses)</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried Pantene&#x27;s brand and it left my hair much oilier than this brand.  </li>
            <li>This cleans my hair well and leaves my curls soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair was never as soft as it was when I used the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soft and silky and I don&#x27;t have flyaways like I used to.</li>
            <li>and I had no trouble working it in.</li>
            <li>I want soft, glossy hair, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I smooth it through my strands, massage it into my scalp, let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It is fragile and needs a gentle touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My hair is always soft the days I use this product.</li>
            <li>and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li>Hair looks lush and shiny in one week noticeably.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft but not greasy</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly 4a/4b.  </li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft not frizz.</li>
            <li>I would recommend  this to anyone with thick unruly hair,  and everyone else would be able to use it as a conditioner.</li>
            <li>It does seem a little flat today but not terribly so.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind though, this is just from my first use, If It starts to work differently I&#x27;ll come back and update this.</li>
            <li>This is gentle, a less expensive cleansing conditioner than other brands, so that is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I have very short hair, also very fine, thick and color treated</li>
            <li>you (sort of) preserve your color a little bit, but it gets clean enough that you can live with yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hands down better than any other product like it on the market.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair, naturally very wavy, not course or dry.</li>
            <li>I have chronic itchy scalp and have tried at least 10 different products, most without sulfates.  </li>
            <li>I used only the very tiniest shampoo before, but only a penny sized amount, then fully saturated my hair in each of these.</li>
            <li>I do find that it is better when mixed with water, otherwise it just seems way to thick</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it makes my hair very soft and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t leave a coated feeling.</li>
            <li>Great inexpensive alternative to other expensive cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li>It is still very thick however I need more product to throughly cleanse my hair than others like Wen.</li>
            <li>Not only do my roots show after 2 weeks, but the fade around the roots makes me self conscious.  </li>
            <li>apparently) to shower.</li>
            <li>This product let color bleed out of my hair,  I have the Bare cleansing conditioner from Herbal Essence and prefer that over this product,  as it does not fade my color at all.  </li>
            <li>Better then any cleansing product I have tired I decide to try it  before I went into the hospital.</li>
            <li>I absolutely must shower every day, which includes shampooing my hair, but regular shampoos dry my hair out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit iffy on this at first, I don&#x27;t typically like rose-scented things, and I had never used a cleansing conditioner before.</li>
            <li>Wen, in my opinion is extremely overpriced and much heavier than this product.  </li>
            <li>No dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought this because lately my scalp has been extremely dry and itchy and my hair was becoming brittle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now gone down to the tiniest pump, and while my hair combs out easily, it still leaves my hair looking limp and feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>So far though, I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find this product.</li>
            <li>my hair was very dry after a few hours and full of tangles.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that tends to get a bit frizzy and dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t blow dry or use irons) and this has fixed that problem.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this just wasn&#x27;t enough to clean the roots as much as they needed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Every few days, use a normal shampoo to get rid of the conditioner buildup, so don&#x27;t throw away all your old shampoo quite yet.</li>
            <li>Three starts because I do love the smell and ir holds my colour, but I can&#x27;t get past that limp greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, based upon this single use, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>have fine, thin longish hair.</li>

            <li> just smells really good.  </li>
            <li> It does not fade my hair color, cleans well and leaves my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Herbal Essences one since the reviews are good.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice and it smelled great.</li>
            <li> as good as Wen&#x27;s but alot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> good night</li>
            <li> Best of all is that my hair was clean all day.</li>
            <li> I love everything rose and this was a very good conditioner rinse but in no way did this smell like roses.</li>
            <li> I have never used WEN because of the price but read many people used this instead with great results.  </li>
            <li> Ok, these all smell great.</li>
            <li> love all herbal essenes products they always leave my hair smelling and feeling great</li>
            <li> I love the push packaging and it&#x27;s a great conditioner for colored hair--maintains the color</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> Today I have beautiful, frizz free elongated curls.  </li>
            <li> and it smells amazing, like everything else Herbal Essences makes.</li>
            <li> My hair feels AMAZING with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is amazing.</li>
            <li> The cleansing conditioner works amazingly even if you do not have color treated hair.</li>
            <li> So, I started looking around and used similiar products that worked well but not as well as this AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> I respectfully disagree with those who say this smells good.</li>
            <li> Really nice alternative to WEN.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how my hair  looked and felt.  </li>
            <li> The rose scent is not overpowering...</li>
            <li> Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it smells really nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just a beefed up conditioner that smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this just feels like I am rubbing conditioner all over my head.</li>
            <li> This detangles well and has really nice slip.  </li>
            <li> Cleansing conditioner is kind of a compromise--</li>
            <li> the smell is a bit sweet for me, but the price is GREAT</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is beyond great, arrives so quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong flowery scent.</li>
            <li> Also, it makes brushing it out post-shower very easy.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy.  </li>
            <li> I honestly felt like it just cleaned my highlighted hair and made the highlights shine more.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen years ago and refuse to pay those prices when something this good is available and does not have to be ordered.  </li>
            <li> So far, this is the best.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Herbal Essences rose scent, always have.</li>
            <li> My hair always looks great right after I color it, but gets a bit brassy after a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I love that they did this in the original rose scent!</li>
            <li> Ive used others that I liked much better and worked much better.</li>
            <li> The smell is great that is the only great thing I can say for it.</li>
            <li> I find that Herbal Essences Color Me Happy helps maintain my salon color very, very well.  </li>
            <li> My hair smells great and is super smooth.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal one is much better.</li>
            <li> I tried it and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> hair color doesn&#x27;t seem to have faded any substantial amount (unlike with even &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; shampoos where I can see a notable difference).</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I gave this a shot based off of the reviews and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I happen to love the floral scent.  </li>
            <li> and you have to use more.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> and I love that it is color safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I dipped into my Wen reserve and fell in love all over again.</li>
            <li> I had been a WEN user for better than a year.  </li>
            <li> My hair does seem more moisturized, as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is still the color I love as if I just colored it yesterday.</li>
            <li> So I love my sudsy shampoo</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> And my hair smells like lovely roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt or looked better &amp; my color doesn&#x27;t fade.  </li>
            <li> I love using cleansing conditioners on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The trick is you do have to use a lot of product, and you have to make sure to spend time massaging your scalp.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair has a lot more body and now easier to style.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It was better then hair</li>
            <li> More like flowers with medicine.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> but I was able to find it cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love.</li>
            <li> but, I use it all the time and my hair has never felt or looked better.  </li>
            <li> I also love the smell.  </li>
            <li> Love it and so does my husband.</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny with this product ,even more so than Wen</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love the price because she goes thru a bottle in 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It works better than wen in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I gave a bottle to my sister and mother and they fell in love with it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK cleansing conditioner for the price; leaves hair shiny, but does nothing to help make hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li> Just OK.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; any more.  </li>
            <li> My hair has more moisture &amp; body than ever</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> it helps retain the color longer and my hair and scalp love the feeling.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I have a blog under the name abeautyandthebusiness and have written many wen reviews that you can read there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to note one more thing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s so soft and shiny, just gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that herbal essence is finally making products that will work with my hair as I have always loved the nice fresh smell the products leave on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on hair, easy on the purse and great on results.</li>
            <li> I used Wen exclusively for years, but this is JUST AS GOOD, and is much more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I apply just like shampoo, massage my scalp, then I comb thru and leave in for about 2-3 minutes and it rinses out clean, leaves no oily residue like some....LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell better than the original.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is soft and the frizzy halo is tamed and the smell is amazing, fruity and perfect for a young girl.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s available in town) and loved it after the first use.  </li>
            <li> This one has a great scent and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and I am a devote user of handmade Lush cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> LOVE that it&#x27;s sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> Price is good thanks amazon you get 6 and 6 Herbal ztars</li>
            <li> Smells great, is cheap and leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I tried this being an avid user of more costly cleansing conditioners and will NEVER pay alot of money again!</li>
            <li> This stuff spreads really easily, is buttery without being waxy, and does seem to cleanse my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to comb.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product because I love the Herbal Essence naked cleansing conditioner but not the way it smells.</li>
            <li> , it seems to clean my (oily) hair better without drying it.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice stuff</li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair is super soft!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and is less damaging than shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I suspect it would be fine....</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS TERRIFIC, SMELLS WONDERFUL AND SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my super curly 3b/c hair, and it feels soo good!</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a huge plus, but as I mentioned before, it takes time to get used to washing hair without loads of bubbles.</li>
            <li> Since this product is sulfate free</li>
            <li> It joins the list of sulfate free hair cleaning products.  </li>
            <li> Me Happy gives me an extra day without shampooing but gets rid of sweat from exercising.</li>
            <li> Starting using WEN which also is great</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> but you must use another conditioner a couple days in between to make your hair smooth.</li>
            <li> fragrance is pleasantly light.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic alternative to the drying effects of shampoo.</li>
            <li> As well as I have been sulfate free shampoo use for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is light and not at all over powering like the Loreal cleansing conditioner is.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I got some of this from a big chain discount store for a lot more money than amazon and loved the product.  </li>
            <li> Worked OK - the smell was not as good as many other clairol herbal essences products.</li>
            <li> Not half as good as WEN but a goos cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST THING I FOUND OUT WAS NO SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!!!  </li>
            <li> I use it in between shampooing and it seems to get my hair clean and soft and smelling really really good.</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner leaves my scalp feeling clean and oil free.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> We love the whole no shampoo thing!</li>
            <li> They are soft and very lovely.  </li>
            <li> I felt like the herbal essences did not leave my hair feeling silky and clean, but rather</li>
            <li> My hair was as clean as always.</li>
            <li> Hair was greasy and didn&#x27;t look clean.</li>
            <li> Wen rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Now if one had a perm, this would be good to use after a perm (it is very conditioning, but no so much cleansing).</li>
            <li> It does have a pleasant smell and I might use it when extra conditioning is needed over cleansing.</li>
            <li> My hair was hydrated, clean, and full of volume.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to no lather, but it smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived ahead of expected date.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping love this product</li>
            <li> My hair was nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> I used it after using V05 kiwi lime clarifying shampoo to get a true trial of this product on fresh product free hair.  </li>
            <li> and I knew that I could never use Wen to clean my hair effectively after more than 24 hours and once when out of town with limited packing space.</li>
            <li> I used to have shiny, healthy hair, but as I got older (40&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> Smells more chemical than rosy to me, and I still like Herbal Essences Naked a lot better.</li>
            <li> gets me in and out of the shower quickly as was the reason i obtained it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Since the Naked version was all I could find I tried that first and loved it.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and it leaves my hair very well conditioned.  </li>
            <li> in all, it seems to do what it claims (which is rather rare for a hair product in my experience).</li>
            <li> It leaves my scalp feeling fresh, but not stripped.</li>
            <li> Overall, my favorite alternative to Wen and it&#x27;s available at some stores.</li>
            <li> That was about the only thing I liked about it.  </li>
            <li> Had a lot of success with this.  </li>
            <li> have given it 5 stars if it had a more natural smell.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft, clean and smelling good.  </li>
            <li> Another reason I prefer Wen because it is cruelty free and the ingredients they use are of a high quality, mostly oils and natural extracts.</li>
            <li> Very silky, healthy, vibrant hair.</li>
            <li> I have a very full head of long, straight, fine, colored hair (i.e., each hair is fine in diameter, and I have zillions of hairs.)  </li>
            <li> I noticed right away</li>
            <li> price is right and it has a pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li> for this cleansing conditioner I find it worrisome that right on the bottle in its directions use between shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the BEST EVER hair product for dry, frizzy, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been paying and searching for a great hair cleanser for far too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product and can&#x27;t imagine why I would go back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but makes medium hair dry.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works pretty well on my excema-ridden scalp and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good, but made my hair look a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I literally cannot understand how other reviews are claiming a rose fragrance--I dont detect a single note of rose anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I am confident that if I keep using this product I will not have to use it daily.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product and I will most definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li> When I saw it here, and that I could get it sent to me before I run out, no shipping cost, and a product discount every time, I was ready to sign on!  </li>
            <li> Really helps my color hold up well!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time</li>
            <li> but I can see the benefits, and it&#x27;s so much better than wen, which I used only once.</li>
            <li> I use this exactly for that purpose as my shower goes a lot quite when I do not have to shampoo then leave in a conditioner for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> (Note: I did put more product in the second time thinking it would keep my hair softer longer.)</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the best alternative to shampoo 100% of the time, but I like it every 3rd day (one day shampooing, one day to skip, one day with conditioner/cleanser).</li>
            <li> but why pay more when this product gives me the same results.</li>
            <li> and it definitely swings and moves with more bounce.</li>
            <li> one.uses 2 pumps and My hair felt fresh and and the smell was not over powering PEOPLE that know I am real picky about my colored hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> This is the second Cleaning condition that I have tried and I absolutely love this one.  </li>
            <li> And MUCH CHEAPER THAN WEN!</li>
            <li> what I do is use this for my FIRST shampoo</li>
            <li> This was the first one I found so</li>
            <li> That said, it is a good non-invasive hair treatment versus harsh shampoos.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan to never use it again but since these conditioners have such amazing fragrances, I&#x27;m liking this new cleansing experience.</li>
            <li> Works just like Wen, smells good but its not a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a product without these 2 ingredients and my beautiful hair is showing the results of their omission.</li>
            <li> This is one area I expected it to fall short of expectations, but i&#x27;m happy to say it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> ends did feel nice and soft, but I can get the same softness with any Herbal Essences conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works as good as, if not better than, WEN.</li>
            <li> I wish they had more scents because I know I&#x27;m going to be using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My curls are nice ringlets with less frizz.  </li>
            <li> Certain occasions I think still call for soapy cleaners though.</li>
            <li> washing with this cleansing conditioner I use 4 pumps for both the first wash, which my hair didn&#x27;t feel too clean and the second wash which my hair felt knotty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Felt very drying to my hair</li>
            <li> It really took care of that problem fast.</li>
            <li> I can say that it really does protect my hair color.</li>
            <li> me happy one and am addicted to this one now.</li>
            <li> I find that it cleanses really well, even when I have smelly, greasy gym hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than wen.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have a very oily scalp</li>
            <li> I wake up every morning with very oily roots.  </li>
            <li> looking for a substitute for wen and this comes very close</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioning cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> However that&#x27;s about every hair product for me because there is so much of it.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair shiny, and conditioned, and it smells like roses.</li>
            <li> I have been a wen girl for over five years, I really thought there would be nothing to beat wen.</li>
            <li> Works great....just not a big rose scent person and it makes my scalp itchy after several days use.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of heavy styling with my hair and this cleansing conditioner really does the job nicely when it comes to moisturizing.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it a few times, so far so good...</li>
            <li> It definitely got my hair clean and it feels much softer.</li>
            <li> The other reviews managed to convince me to buy it, however, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I originally got it because there was a coupon I thought it was a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> To me, it has the same original Herbal Essences flower smell from a decade ago.</li>
            <li> If I come to not be able to afford Wen anymore, I will buy this as a replacement and organix shampoo every other washing.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, oily hair with dry ends.</li>
            <li> It does not lather so it does not feel like I am giving myself a deep clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, like regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the skills like many beauty bloggers and Pinteresters who can somehow pile their hair on their head and suddenly look ready for a red carpet</li>
            <li> I have used WEN in the past and liked it, but not the price.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have the same cleaning properties as Wen, but it is not a bad product.</li>
            <li> hair seems less frizzy (without the use of other &amp;#34;de-frizzing&amp;#34; products), which isn&#x27;t something I was expecting, but is greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, and only washed out some of my fresh hair color, but left me with a lot of flyaways and soft frizz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair and scalp and this has worked very well to get my hair clean without making my scalp too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it smells like most conditioners out there which won&#x27;t bother most people just me .</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Not only is it cheaper than similar products, but it smells amazing and really did prolong the amount of time the red in her hair lasted before fading.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and my hair looks soft and shiny after using it.</li>
            <li> For now though, i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and would definitely recommend this to anyone who is tired of how traditional shampoos and conditioners treat their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every possible cleansing conditioner for color treated hair and this one wins in every category.  </li>
            <li> This was a very good alternative to wen cleasing conditioner; that gets too expensive!</li>
            <li> Now I am going to get my hair re-colored in about 3 days and will follow-up this review with how the cleansing conditioner works on newly colored hair.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, saves using separate shampoo/conditioner combos and takes less time.</li>
            <li> I was a red head whose hair is now white, and I color it a light auburn.  </li>
            <li> I have just recently changed over from regular shampoo to sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it, it had made my hair very soft and silky until the next day.</li>
            <li> I sometimes follow up with a regular conditioner when I&#x27;m feeling ambitious or it&#x27;s date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely compare it to the higher end ones, like Wen.  </li>
            <li> I used the naked one first and decided to try this one as I do color my hair.  </li>
            <li> I actually like this product more than the other Herbal Essences one</li>
            <li> It is also free of tocophyerol acetate (vitamin E), which is a problem in weighing down my curls and causing scalp irritation.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and I barely use my flat iron anymore</li>
            <li> My natural hair is white (prematurely, thanks Dad!)</li>
            <li> hair turned out clean, and genuinely soft without feeling like it&#x27;s coated in something (other conditioners coat your hair in wax to get that &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; feel,</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and clean but would not use again due to the smell.</li>
            <li> This works as good, if not better, than the Naked version and smells like middle school!!</li>
            <li> I had tried a few different options in the past that left my hair feeling greasy and left my fine very straight hair very limp despite my best efforts.</li>
            <li> My tip is to work it in, let it sit about five minutes, then before you rinse it out, add a little warm water and create a low later, massage, then rinse it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but i&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, this product does not claim to be a shampoo as it clearly states that this is meant for use in-between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I understand that the natural oils in my scalp are no longer being stripped.</li>
            <li> It feels soft.</li>
            <li> Will not repurchase (although it did make my skin soft and smell of roses)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried Pantene&#x27;s brand and it left my hair much oilier than this brand.  </li>
            <li> This cleans my hair well and leaves my curls soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair was never as soft as it was when I used the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also soft and silky and I don&#x27;t have flyaways like I used to.</li>
            <li> and I had no trouble working it in.</li>
            <li> I want soft, glossy hair, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I smooth it through my strands, massage it into my scalp, let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It is fragile and needs a gentle touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My hair is always soft the days I use this product.</li>
            <li> and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li> Hair looks lush and shiny in one week noticeably.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft but not greasy</li>

            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft not frizz.</li>
            <li> I would recommend  this to anyone with thick unruly hair,  and everyone else would be able to use it as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> It does seem a little flat today but not terribly so.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind though, this is just from my first use, If It starts to work differently I&#x27;ll come back and update this.</li>
            <li> This is gentle, a less expensive cleansing conditioner than other brands, so that is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I have very short hair, also very fine, thick and color treated</li>
            <li> you (sort of) preserve your color a little bit, but it gets clean enough that you can live with yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hands down better than any other product like it on the market.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, naturally very wavy, not course or dry.</li>
            <li> I have chronic itchy scalp and have tried at least 10 different products, most without sulfates.  </li>
            <li> I used only the very tiniest shampoo before, but only a penny sized amount, then fully saturated my hair in each of these.</li>
            <li> I do find that it is better when mixed with water, otherwise it just seems way to thick</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it makes my hair very soft and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t leave a coated feeling.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive alternative to other expensive cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> It is still very thick however I need more product to throughly cleanse my hair than others like Wen.</li>
            <li> Not only do my roots show after 2 weeks, but the fade around the roots makes me self conscious.  </li>
            <li> apparently) to shower.</li>
            <li> This product let color bleed out of my hair,  I have the Bare cleansing conditioner from Herbal Essence and prefer that over this product,  as it does not fade my color at all.  </li>
            <li> Better then any cleansing product I have tired I decide to try it  before I went into the hospital.</li>
            <li> I absolutely must shower every day, which includes shampooing my hair, but regular shampoos dry my hair out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit iffy on this at first, I don&#x27;t typically like rose-scented things, and I had never used a cleansing conditioner before.</li>
            <li> Wen, in my opinion is extremely overpriced and much heavier than this product.  </li>
            <li> No dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this because lately my scalp has been extremely dry and itchy and my hair was becoming brittle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now gone down to the tiniest pump, and while my hair combs out easily, it still leaves my hair looking limp and feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> So far though, I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find this product.</li>
            <li> my hair was very dry after a few hours and full of tangles.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to get a bit frizzy and dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t blow dry or use irons) and this has fixed that problem.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this just wasn&#x27;t enough to clean the roots as much as they needed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Every few days, use a normal shampoo to get rid of the conditioner buildup, so don&#x27;t throw away all your old shampoo quite yet.</li>
            <li> Three starts because I do love the smell and ir holds my colour, but I can&#x27;t get past that limp greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, based upon this single use, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> have fine, thin longish hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cleansing conditioners and so far this is the only one I have found that has the same consistency and works almost as well.</li>
            <li> And it left my hair feeling greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> Having to go only one extra day without shampooing may seem like this cleansing conditioner is a bit useless as you still have to wet and dry your hair after, but anyone with color treated hair, especially bleached and dyed an unnatural color, will know that one extra day is better than no extra day at all.</li>
            <li> With that being said the amount didn&#x27;t last long either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, even WEN, which costs way more than I care to spend on &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and left my hair feeling dirty and not shiny.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After 1 use I got instant relief from the itchy dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Definitely for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Not unpleasant, not great.  </li>
            <li> I tried this 2 times and both times it left my roots greasier and more dirty feeling than before I got in the shower, but of course I did not realize this until it was dry, and did not have time to rewash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M ECSTATIC TO REPORT MY LONG HAIR</li>
            <li> With this product I still have to use this everyday but the ends of my hair are soft now.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and although the instructions suggest 3-4 pumps, I started out with 2 pumps.</li>
            <li> And I have really long hair</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a long process sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for a long time.</li>
            <li> After a disastrous attempt to go blonde after years of coloring my hair dark brown I needed and trying every kind of replenishing shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I will probably use this for as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for affordable alternative to Wen and other similar salon products, give this a try!</li>
            <li> Became a convert of using a cleansing conditioner in between regular shampoos with the other one from Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> I have damaged hair due to prior perming.</li>
            <li> I have dry, wavy hair and use it every day with no buildup.</li>
            <li> This will allow you to go another day or two (if you use dry shampoo on that day 2)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with curly, frizzy, and dry hair like mine.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair with a dry scalp then this will probably work wonders for you.  </li>
            <li> Does not strip hair or make it dry.</li>
            <li> When my hair air dries or even when I blow dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to cleansing conditioners...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again - not nearly as good as the real thing.</li>
            <li> I decided to gamble and use it after a few grimy days of housework and running around that left me without time (</li>
            <li> hair does not need additional product to run a wide tooth comb through it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No real advantages.</li>
            <li> : In no way does this product even remotely smell like roses.  </li>
            <li> No spending several minutes getting fluid too thick for a pump to come out.  </li>
            <li> She hated the Renpure and loved the HE.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not like roses.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of) and doesn&#x27;t have that cheap &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; scent other rose-scented soaps/shampoos have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re desperate for clean AND moisturized hair, this is for you.</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders, straight, not super thick, not too oily and not too dry.</li>
            <li> My roots looked completely greasy and my hair was clumping together which made my scalp show through (not a good look).  </li>
            <li> My other cleansing conditioner cleaned too well.</li>
            <li> I was looking at other conditioners that I&#x27;d read about when I saw this on the shelf and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I even told my hairdresser about it because we both agree Wen is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical about a cleansing conditioner, so I thought I&#x27;d try this one first because it was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not exactly shampooing, so</li>
            <li> If you read some of my other cleansing conditioner reviews you&#x27;ll find that I often find they leave my hair oily and stringy</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews that this is not for oily hair.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to use this to replace every other shampoo</li>
            <li> that being said something that saids use between shampoos, knotty in the shower and heavy when dry its a skip for</li>
            <li> My very first use was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> But I still use regular shampoo at least every 3 washes</li>
            <li> So not worth ANY of the hype.</li>
            <li> Going back to the Pantene cleansing conditioner even though not thrilled with the slight pine sent of it, it still is nicer to use than the herbal essence</li>
            <li> It is thick spiral curled and will frizz and puff quickly when using the wrong product or drying method.  </li>
            <li> my hair has gotten flat, not as shiny, and hard to style.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and a little on the coarse side</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair lacks of volume and it gets oily after half day no matter</li>
            <li> would not recommend this to anyone who has even slight concerns about greasy hair or limpness.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the Wen products and a lot less expensiive</li>
            <li> jamaican black castor oil leave in.</li>
            <li> I previously have used Salon Grafix brand and Iiked it a lot.</li>
            <li> It cost less and I can find it at WalMart.</li>
            <li> so my hair was pretty dirty.  </li>
            <li> I can not think of a single negative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little runny in comparison, but it gets the job done if you just refuse to pay for WEN.  </li>
            <li> A little too minty.</li>
            <li> I read a  little about cowashing and thought it might help.</li>
            <li> One thing to note is it might take a little longer to rinse.</li>
            <li> I have a little volume and lots of shine and softness.</li>
            <li> Once because it had been a few days</li>
            <li> I tried it again and it was worse the second time.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my dd that has very thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to shampoo everyday because of my oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried Wen and really like it except it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, hoping to be able to ditch the shampoo that does strip my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted badly to like this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine straying from shampoo.</li>
            <li> I does not make my hair look dull or lifeless</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> Works just like Wen although not as thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wen girl for years - no more!!  </li>
            <li> This is not a great one.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because I am tired of the expense of WEN...</li>
            <li> ; I have used Wen in the past, but stopped due to the outrageous price.  </li>
            <li> Then came the painful reminder that my friend no longer worked for Guthy Renker and the days of my $7 bottles were no more.</li>
            <li> I was using Wen, however, it was two expensive.  </li>
            <li> Even my hair obsessed daughter gave it a try and now has it on auto ship.also.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I just was hoping for a replacement for my expensive Wen shampoo.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you just can&#x27;t go wrong for a trial month period.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, sorry.</li>
            <li> But yet I was proven wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the itchiness was driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 bottles because I am afraid others won&#x27;t discover how well it works</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Smell was unpleasant.</li>
            <li> EVER SINCE I HAD A BAD HIGHLIGHTING SESSION</li>
            <li> This is not it, too bad!  </li>
            <li> I was strictly a &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; girl but hated the cost including shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li> I had tried wen years ago and hated it, so not even going to go there.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s awfully pricy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I respectfully disagree with those who say this smells good. It has a very strong flowery scent. It&#x27;s not for those with scent allergies. I used once and threw it away</li>
            <li> I was using Wen, however, it was two expensive.  I have tried other cleansing conditioners and so far this is the only one I have found that has the same consistency and works almost as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to cleansing conditioners... I know how to use them.  This is not a great one.  It leaves a film on my hair or something.  The L&#x27;Oreal one is much better.</li>
            <li> EVER SINCE I HAD A BAD HIGHLIGHTING SESSION AND MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT IN CLUMPS I DID RESEARCH ONLINE.....THE FIRST THING I FOUND OUT WAS NO SHAMPOO/CONDITIONER!! WEN WAS JUST TO PRICEY FOR ME SO I CHOSE HERBAL ESSENCES COLOR ME HAPPY CLEANSING TREATMENT AND IT HELPED SO MUCH OVER TIME ALONG WITH LEAVE IN CONDITIONER, BIOTIN SUPPLEMENTS AND ONLY AIR DRIED MY HAIR. I&#x27;M ECSTATIC TO REPORT MY LONG HAIR IS BACK TO IT&#x27;S HEALTHY STATE!! THANK YOU HERBAL ESSENCES!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. THIS IS ALL I USE NOW!! THE PRICE IS TERRIFIC, SMELLS WONDERFUL AND SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!!!  It is comparable to Wen at a fraction of the cost.  I find that Herbal Essences Color Me Happy helps maintain my salon color very, very well.  I have recommended it to friends who swear by Wen and have made several converts.  A five-star review from me!</li>
            <li> Bought this because I am tired of the expense of WEN...I tried it and LOVE IT. It smells sooo good.Now I am looking for the styling cream.</li>
            <li> I was a bit iffy on this at first, I don&#x27;t typically like rose-scented things, and I had never used a cleansing conditioner before. The other reviews managed to convince me to buy it, however, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but i&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is actually very nice (not at all over-powering like I was afraid of) and doesn&#x27;t have that cheap &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; scent other rose-scented soaps/shampoos have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair turned out clean, and genuinely soft without feeling like it&#x27;s coated in something (other conditioners coat your hair in wax to get that &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; feel, I didn&#x27;t feel that with this. If it does do this it&#x27;s to a much lesser degree).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems less frizzy (without the use of other &amp;#34;de-frizzing&amp;#34; products), which isn&#x27;t something I was expecting, but is greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair color doesn&#x27;t seem to have faded any substantial amount (unlike with even &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; shampoos where I can see a notable difference). This is one area I expected it to fall short of expectations, but i&#x27;m happy to say it did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it seems to do what it claims (which is rather rare for a hair product in my experience). Keep in mind though, this is just from my first use, If It starts to work differently I&#x27;ll come back and update this. For now though, i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and would definitely recommend this to anyone who is tired of how traditional shampoos and conditioners treat their hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, like regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, oily hair with dry ends. I have been using this product for a week now. I usually have to shampoo everyday because of my oily scalp. With this product I still have to use this everyday but the ends of my hair are soft now. Since this product is sulfate free I understand that the natural oils in my scalp are no longer being stripped. The oils are being redistributed to the ends of my hair. I realize that my scalp will go through a transition period. This cleansing conditioner leaves my scalp feeling clean and oil free. My hair does not look or feel oily at all. It feels soft. I am confident that if I keep using this product I will not have to use it daily. :) yay!!!</li>
            <li> OMG THE BOMB! this smells like Minty rose! It leaves my scalp feeling fresh, but not stripped. My other cleansing conditioner cleaned too well. I use this daily on my super curly 3b/c hair, and it feels soo good! I suggest this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I used Wen exclusively for years, but this is JUST AS GOOD, and is much more reasonably priced.  Smells terrific.  I have dry, wavy hair and use it every day with no buildup.</li>
            <li> My hair has been awesome since I started using this! It dries quickly and I barely use my flat iron anymore,it&#x27;s so soft and shiny, just gorgeous! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff.  I originally got it because there was a coupon I thought it was a regular conditioner.  Works great though.  But I still use regular shampoo at least every 3 washes</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  Removes buildup of product on your hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this. Smells so good, but made my hair look a little greasy. Can be used as a conditioner after regular shampooing (avoiding the roots).</li>
            <li> I was strictly a &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; girl but hated the cost including shipping and handling.  I gave this a shot based off of the reviews and am so glad I did.  For me, this is as good but great price and I happen to love the floral scent.  Even my hair obsessed daughter gave it a try and now has it on auto ship.also.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This was a very good alternative to wen cleasing conditioner; that gets too expensive!</li>
            <li> Love the smell better than the original.  I do find that it is better when mixed with water, otherwise it just seems way to thick and you have to use more.</li>
            <li> Works great....just not a big rose scent person and it makes my scalp itchy after several days use.</li>
            <li> Felt very drying to my hair so I ended up using it like body wash.  Will not repurchase (although it did make my skin soft and smell of roses)</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  Makes my hair soft, silky and shiny.  Works great! This is my second purchase of this product and I will most definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Really nice alternative to WEN.  It&#x27;s a little runny in comparison, but it gets the job done if you just refuse to pay for WEN.  I&#x27;ve also tried Pantene&#x27;s brand and it left my hair much oilier than this brand.  This smells nice too!  Recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this bigger bottle.  I love this shampoo and I love that it is color safe. Smells great!</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner has saved my hair.  I used to have shiny, healthy hair, but as I got older (40&#x27;s) my hair has gotten flat, not as shiny, and hard to style.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, even WEN, which costs way more than I care to spend on &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and left my hair feeling dirty and not shiny.  I found this at Walmart (only place it&#x27;s available in town) and loved it after the first use.  It has brought back my shiny, manageable hair.  I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon and I hope Herbal Essences keeps making this.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo/cleaning conditioner for a while now. I was a red head whose hair is now white, and I color it a light auburn.  Not only do my roots show after 2 weeks, but the fade around the roots makes me self conscious.  I read about this product and decided after reading the reviews to give it a try.  I tried it after working out at the gym so my hair was pretty dirty.  I followed directions and my hair felt softer and smoother than before.  I really liked how my hair  looked and felt.  Now I am going to get my hair re-colored in about 3 days and will follow-up this review with how the cleansing conditioner works on newly colored hair.  So far though, I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find this product.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive alternative to other expensive cleansing conditioners. And the smell is wonderful. It is still very thick however I need more product to throughly cleanse my hair than others like Wen. Overall, my favorite alternative to Wen and it&#x27;s available at some stores.</li>
            <li> Decent cleansing conditioner.  Smells more chemical than rosy to me, and I still like Herbal Essences Naked a lot better.</li>
            <li> I have just recently changed over from regular shampoo to sulfate free shampoo.  This stuff smells awesome!  The rose scent is not overpowering...just smells really good.  I have naturally curly hair that tends to get a bit frizzy and dry on the ends.  This cleans my hair well and leaves my curls soft.  I have never used WEN because of the price but read many people used this instead with great results.  I can vouch for the great results. It does not fade my hair color, cleans well and leaves my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this off of Amazon, but I have used it and did not like it at all. Ive used others that I liked much better and worked much better. I felt like the herbal essences did not leave my hair feeling silky and clean, but rather like it still had tons of product in it.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice stuff; I have used Wen in the past, but stopped due to the outrageous price.  This is pretty comparable.  Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen off and on for years. After a disastrous attempt to go blonde after years of coloring my hair dark brown I needed and trying every kind of replenishing shampoo and conditioner I dipped into my Wen reserve and fell in love all over again. Then came the painful reminder that my friend no longer worked for Guthy Renker and the days of my $7 bottles were no more. So started the search for an alternative cleansing conditioner. I had tried a few different options in the past that left my hair feeling greasy and left my fine very straight hair very limp despite my best efforts. I came across some reviews of this and the Naked version. Since the Naked version was all I could find I tried that first and loved it. I used the entire bottle and only &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; my hair a handful of times. Once because it had been a few days and I knew that I could never use Wen to clean my hair effectively after more than 24 hours and once when out of town with limited packing space. My hair was never as soft as it was when I used the cleansing conditioner. I decided to gamble and use it after a few grimy days of housework and running around that left me without time (apparently) to shower. My hair was as clean as always. When I ran out of the Naked version I hightailed it to my local Walmart to pick this up since I couldn&#x27;t stand the idea of going without it even for a day. This works as good, if not better, than the Naked version and smells like middle school!!</li>
            <li> I had been a WEN user for better than a year.  I had started noticing that some of the name-brand commercial brands were making &#x27;cleansing conditioners&#x27; too.  That&#x27;s when I got some of this from a big chain discount store for a lot more money than amazon and loved the product.  When I saw it here, and that I could get it sent to me before I run out, no shipping cost, and a product discount every time, I was ready to sign on!  I use this every-other time I cleanse my hair (I use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner set when not using this).  Really helps my color hold up well! Smells heavenly too!</li>
            <li> Worked OK - the smell was not as good as many other clairol herbal essences products. A little too minty. Hair was a bit cleaner but did not have any volume.</li>
            <li> I started my cowash ritual with As I am Coconut cowash conditioner. My hair was hydrated, clean, and full of volume. Best of all is that my hair was clean all day. I decided to try Herbal Essences one since the reviews are good. It&#x27;s actually quite disappointing. I noticed that my hair lacks of volume and it gets oily after half day no matter what products I put on or don&#x27;t put on..  I&#x27;m actually considering to dump the remaining bottle and switch back to As I am coconut now.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells SO good!</li>
            <li> I bought this because lately my scalp has been extremely dry and itchy and my hair was becoming brittle. Because of menopause, maybe? Anyway, the itchiness was driving me crazy. I read a  little about cowashing and thought it might help. I looked at Wen but it&#x27;s awfully pricy. I was looking at other conditioners that I&#x27;d read about when I saw this on the shelf and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I used it for the first time yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 use I got instant relief from the itchy dry scalp. It really took care of that problem fast. My hair does seem more moisturized, as well. It doesn&#x27;t have the brittle texture it had before I used it. It definitely got my hair clean and it feels much softer. It does seem a little flat today but not terribly so. I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if it delivers on it&#x27;s promise to protect color treated hair. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. I&#x27;ll come back in a couple of weeks and report on the color protection; it it works I&#x27;ll bump it up to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, based upon this single use, I would recommend it. Oh, and it smells really nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a month now. I can say that it really does protect my hair color. My natural hair is white (prematurely, thanks Dad!) and I color it an ash blond. My hair always looks great right after I color it, but gets a bit brassy after a couple of washes. Not with this. My hair is still the color I love as if I just colored it yesterday. It&#x27;s also soft and silky and I don&#x27;t have flyaways like I used to. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and can&#x27;t imagine why I would go back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have chronic itchy scalp and have tried at least 10 different products, most without sulfates.  It seems that menthol and tea tree oil don&#x27;t help.  I noticed right away neither is in this product so I ordered 1.  So far I am very happy.  I wash my hair every 3 days and this seems to work with the HE Color Me Happy. It is also easier to comb out.  I do not color my hair.  Time will tell whether this product keeps my scalp happy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine hair</li>
            <li> So I love my sudsy shampoo but I decided to try this, the \\&quot;naked\\&quot; one and pantene&#x27;s cleansing condish for color treated hair. Ok, these all smell great. Like heavenly. I used only the very tiniest shampoo before, but only a penny sized amount, then fully saturated my hair in each of these. I left them on, washed, then rinsed. This will take getting used to but I can see the benefits, and it&#x27;s so much better than wen, which I used only once. This stuff spreads really easily, is buttery without being waxy, and does seem to cleanse my hair and scalp. Since my fav shampoo is prell, I&#x27;m going to use it as a body wash only and let my hair rest. It&#x27;s hard to imagine straying from shampoo. I don&#x27;t plan to never use it again but since these conditioners have such amazing fragrances, I&#x27;m liking this new cleansing experience. One thing to note is it might take a little longer to rinse. However, if you&#x27;re desperate for clean AND moisturized hair, this is for you. Also, it makes brushing it out post-shower very easy. I have wavy hair prone to tangles so that&#x27;s a huge plus, but as I mentioned before, it takes time to get used to washing hair without loads of bubbles.</li>
            <li> Works just like Wen, smells good but its not a long lasting scent. I use it in between shampoos. Love it.</li>
            <li> I tried this being an avid user of more costly cleansing conditioners and will NEVER pay alot of money again! This product works great. My hair is thick and a little on the coarse side and I had no trouble working it in. Left my hair soft, clean and smelling good.  My tip is to work it in, let it sit about five minutes, then before you rinse it out, add a little warm water and create a low later, massage, then rinse it out. I will be buying this often. Sorry Wen~ I&#x27;m out! Replacing you with Herbal Essences!</li>
            <li> Not half as good as WEN but a goos cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every possible cleansing conditioner for color treated hair and this one wins in every category.  Plus, the pump on the 16.9 actually works.  No spending several minutes getting fluid too thick for a pump to come out.  I will probably use this for as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> Wondeful smell.  I just was hoping for a replacement for my expensive Wen shampoo.  This is not it, too bad!  The smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> I want soft, glossy hair, but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not a celebrity with a budget for an arsenal of stylists at the ready&lt;br /&gt;- Although I do have the time to spend doing my hair, I prefer sleep&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t have the skills like many beauty bloggers and Pinteresters who can somehow pile their hair on their head and suddenly look ready for a red carpet&lt;br /&gt;- I absolutely must shower every day, which includes shampooing my hair, but regular shampoos dry my hair out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along comes Herbal Essences Cleansing Conditioner. My hair is just below my shoulders, so three pumps is enough. I smooth it through my strands, massage it into my scalp, let it sit for a few minutes, then rinse thoroughly. I sometimes follow up with a regular conditioner when I&#x27;m feeling ambitious or it&#x27;s date night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gave my stringy, greasy locks life! I have a little volume and lots of shine and softness. And my hair smells like lovely roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every few days, use a normal shampoo to get rid of the conditioner buildup, so don&#x27;t throw away all your old shampoo quite yet.</li>
            <li> Not. Cleansing conditioner. This is just a beefed up conditioner that smells really nice. Hair was greasy and didn&#x27;t look clean. Will not use this product but to condition.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this just feels like I am rubbing conditioner all over my head. It does not lather so it does not feel like I am giving myself a deep clean. However, this product does not claim to be a shampoo as it clearly states that this is meant for use in-between shampoos. I use this exactly for that purpose as my shower goes a lot quite when I do not have to shampoo then leave in a conditioner for 3 minutes. This will allow you to go another day or two (if you use dry shampoo on that day 2) and it smells amazing, like everything else Herbal Essences makes. Having to go only one extra day without shampooing may seem like this cleansing conditioner is a bit useless as you still have to wet and dry your hair after, but anyone with color treated hair, especially bleached and dyed an unnatural color, will know that one extra day is better than no extra day at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very good non shampoo.  It joins the list of sulfate free hair cleaning products.  And it is good.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thin longish hair. It is fragile and needs a gentle touch.&lt;br /&gt;My hair does not need additional product to run a wide tooth comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right and it has a pump dispenser.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and scalp and this has worked very well to get my hair clean without making my scalp too oily or too dry. I also have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair is super soft!</li>
            <li> I stopped shampooing 2 months ago.  My hair has never felt or looked better &amp; my color doesn&#x27;t fade.  Awesomeness!!!</li>
            <li> Yuck!  I tried this 2 times and both times it left my roots greasier and more dirty feeling than before I got in the shower, but of course I did not realize this until it was dry, and did not have time to rewash.  Now Im sitting at work with my hair pulled back in a gross ponytail...&lt;br /&gt;My ends did feel nice and soft, but I can get the same softness with any Herbal Essences conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone who has even slight concerns about greasy hair or limpness.</li>
            <li> Works just like Wen although not as thick.  I still like Wen the best but cannot afford it anymore.</li>
            <li> Great product and arrived ahead of expected date.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that my hair gets cleaned at all.  However, it&#x27;s still a conditioner and works great for shaving.</li>
            <li> I love using cleansing conditioners on my curly hair.  This one has a great scent and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  I&#x27;d definitely compare it to the higher end ones, like Wen.  The trick is you do have to use a lot of product, and you have to make sure to spend time massaging your scalp.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I had high hopes for this product. The packaging was nice and it smelled great. When I first tried it, it had made my hair very soft and silky until the next day. I thought well might as well give it another try since I thought that it needed time to adjust to my hair. I tried it again and it was worse the second time. (Note: I did put more product in the second time thinking it would keep my hair softer longer.) my hair was very dry after a few hours and full of tangles. I honestly felt like it just cleaned my highlighted hair and made the highlights shine more. No real advantages. I will not be repurchasing this product again. It&#x27;s just like the color me happy conditioner except in a bottle that claims it&#x27;s a cleansing conditioner. It works about the same. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with curly, frizzy, and dry hair like mine.</li>
            <li> ...and yes I am fully rinsing. No matter how much I rinse it makes my hair limp and greasy.  Three starts because I do love the smell and ir holds my colour, but I can&#x27;t get past that limp greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for affordable alternative to Wen and other similar salon products, give this a try! I was pleasantly surprised. My hair is past my shoulders, straight, not super thick, not too oily and not too dry. Color Me Happy gives me an extra day without shampooing but gets rid of sweat from exercising. My hair is always soft the days I use this product. Not sure if it&#x27;s the best alternative to shampoo 100% of the time, but I like it every 3rd day (one day shampooing, one day to skip, one day with conditioner/cleanser). I even told my hairdresser about it because we both agree Wen is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I am a devote user of handmade Lush cosmetics.  My curls are nice ringlets with less frizz.  For the price, you just can&#x27;t go wrong for a trial month period.  LOVE that it&#x27;s sulfate free.  It is also free of tocophyerol acetate (vitamin E), which is a problem in weighing down my curls and causing scalp irritation.  It&#x27;s very hard to find a product without these 2 ingredients and my beautiful hair is showing the results of their omission.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Best cleansing conditioner I have used and I have tried several.  Gentle on hair, easy on the purse and great on results.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Starting using WEN which also is great but why pay more when this product gives me the same results. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Became a convert of using a cleansing conditioner in between regular shampoos with the other one from Herbal Essences. Realized there was a color me happy one and am addicted to this one now. My hair feels AMAZING with this.&lt;br /&gt;Price is beyond great, arrives so quickly. I can not think of a single negative.</li>
            <li> This product let color bleed out of my hair,  I have the Bare cleansing conditioner from Herbal Essence and prefer that over this product,  as it does not fade my color at all.  ... this product smells good and i will be letting my daughter use it!  We love the whole no shampoo thing!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and is less damaging than shampoo. I find that it cleanses really well, even when I have smelly, greasy gym hair. Difficult to find in stores, will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the BEST EVER hair product for dry, frizzy, coarse, curly hair. It&#x27;s been a Godsend!!!&amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> smells great! and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s much cheaper than wen. My hair has a lot more body and now easier to style. I feel the fullness and it definitely swings and moves with more bounce. Hair looks lush and shiny in one week noticeably. I wish they had more scents because I know I&#x27;m going to be using this product for a very long time. I do a lot of heavy styling with my hair and this cleansing conditioner really does the job nicely when it comes to moisturizing. My scalp feels great too. No dry itchy scalp. Love it. Will buy this for now on.</li>
            <li> Best!  Hands down better than any other product like it on the market.</li>
            <li> love all herbal essenes products they always leave my hair smelling and feeling great</li>
            <li> Better then any cleansing product I have tired I decide to try it  before I went into the hospital. It was better then hair one.uses 2 pumps and My hair felt fresh and and the smell was not over powering PEOPLE that know I am real picky about my colored hair and skin products. Price is good thanks amazon you get 6 and 6 Herbal ztars</li>
            <li> I love everything rose and this was a very good conditioner rinse but in no way did this smell like roses. More like flowers with medicine.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it a few times, so far so good...as good as Wen&#x27;s but alot cheaper.  smells great too.  gets me in and out of the shower quickly as was the reason i obtained it.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.  I&#x27;ve been a Wen girl for years - no more!!  Can&#x27;t beat the price and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I love this product but I was able to find it cheaper in the store.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love. Makes hair soft but not greasy</li>
            <li> Works as well as the Wen products and a lot less expensiive</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  It was designed to use between shampoos but, I use it all the time and my hair has never felt or looked better.  I have really long hair and it tends to tangle and get frizzy (I don&#x27;t blow dry or use irons) and this has fixed that problem.  I apply just like shampoo, massage my scalp, then I comb thru and leave in for about 2-3 minutes and it rinses out clean, leaves no oily residue like some....LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this based on the reviews comparing it to Wen. I&#x27;m happy I did! This is my new favorite, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I have also tried Hair One. This one beats them all!</li>
            <li> The smell of this is awesome.  That was about the only thing I liked about it.  I have a very oily scalp and I was skeptical about a cleansing conditioner, so I thought I&#x27;d try this one first because it was inexpensive.  My very first use was disappointing.  I wake up every morning with very oily roots.  After using this product, my roots were not as oily but they still looked stringy.  I was very disappointed, hoping to be able to ditch the shampoo that does strip my hair.  Unfortunately, this just wasn&#x27;t enough to clean the roots as much as they needed.  I might try a different brand sometime but this one just did not work for me.  If you have dry hair with a dry scalp then this will probably work wonders for you.  It just didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> looking for a substitute for wen and this comes very close plus I like the roses smell, will try some others but this is definitely a keeper</li>
            <li> Smells nice but makes medium hair dry.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again - not nearly as good as the real thing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping love this product</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioning cleanser.  I used the naked one first and decided to try this one as I do color my hair.  I used it after using V05 kiwi lime clarifying shampoo to get a true trial of this product on fresh product free hair.  My hair is naturally curly 4a/4b.  It is thick spiral curled and will frizz and puff quickly when using the wrong product or drying method.  This detangles well and has really nice slip.  I also love the smell.  I&#x27;m happy that herbal essence is finally making products that will work with my hair as I have always loved the nice fresh smell the products leave on the hair.  I tried Wen years ago and refuse to pay those prices when something this good is available and does not have to be ordered.  Wen, in my opinion is extremely overpriced and much heavier than this product.  I would say give it a try if you like cleansing conditioners.  My sons are now using the naked version of this product.  Today I have beautiful, frizz free elongated curls.  They are soft and very lovely.  I am very very happy with this product and any product that is very accessible, affordable and works! I might also add that I did use a leave in conditioner before using the diffuser to try my hair...I used shea moisture jamaican black castor oil leave in.</li>
            <li> I really wanted badly to like this. I previously have used Salon Grafix brand and Iiked it a lot. So I thought this would be similar. I have long hair, and although the instructions suggest 3-4 pumps, I started out with 2 pumps. And it left my hair feeling greasy and flat. So I then tried only 1 pump, but with the same results. I&#x27;ve now gone down to the tiniest pump, and while my hair combs out easily, it still leaves my hair looking limp and feeling greasy. I don&#x27;t like it, sorry. Maybe for someone with thicker or wavy hair it would be great, but it&#x27;s not for my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. Gentle on hair. Does not strip hair or make it dry. I have tried several cleansing conditioners and cowashes. So far, this is the best. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Love it and so does my husband. Where was this all my life. I&#x27;m 43 and I&#x27;ve been paying and searching for a great hair cleanser for far too long. I have blonde, longer hair and this is amazing. So soft. I purchase mine from Walmart for $4.99.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. The smell is great that is the only great thing I can say for it. I have medium length hair, naturally very wavy, not course or dry. Very silky, healthy, vibrant hair. I followed the directions exactly. Made my hair frizzy and lifeless. I will never use this product again. So not worth ANY of the hype.</li>
            <li> Had a lot of success with this.  My hair was nice and soft.  The only problem is that I had to wash my hair every day because of it getting oily after 24 hours.  And I have really long hair so it&#x27;s a long process sometimes.  With that being said the amount didn&#x27;t last long either.  About 10-11 days.  However that&#x27;s about every hair product for me because there is so much of it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny with this product ,even more so than Wen .The price is only $5 so it can&#x27;t be beat .I would;d have given it 5 stars if it had a more natural smell. Unfortunately it smells like most conditioners out there which won&#x27;t bother most people just me .</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li> I love this. I dye my hair and am always looking for something great to use and good smelling. This is gentle, a less expensive cleansing conditioner than other brands, so that is wonderful.  It really makes my hair shiny, and conditioned, and it smells like roses. The price is great too. I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my dd that has very thick long hair.  She seems to always have a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of frizz popping out around her head and this drives her nuts.  So, after watching a wen commercial, guess what she wanted.  I had tried wen years ago and hated it, so not even going to go there.  Instead I ordered this product and Renpure.  She hated the Renpure and loved the HE.  Her hair is soft and the frizzy halo is tamed and the smell is amazing, fruity and perfect for a young girl.  I love the price because she goes thru a bottle in 2 weeks.  I would recommend  this to anyone with thick unruly hair,  and everyone else would be able to use it as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been a wen girl for over five years, I really thought there would be nothing to beat wen. But yet I was proven wrong with this product. It works better than wen in my opinion. It cost less and I can find it at WalMart. I gave a bottle to my sister and mother and they fell in love with it too. I will not be going back to wen. This smells like roses and flowers and the scent last all day. Its not over bearing either.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Not only is it cheaper than similar products, but it smells amazing and really did prolong the amount of time the red in her hair lasted before fading. Great value and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I read a review on this product and had to try it. The cleansing conditioner works amazingly even if you do not have color treated hair. For the quality and quantity this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an OK cleansing conditioner for the price; leaves hair shiny, but does nothing to help make hair more manageable.  I have a very full head of long, straight, fine, colored hair (i.e., each hair is fine in diameter, and I have zillions of hairs.)  This product is easy to use, and only washed out some of my fresh hair color, but left me with a lot of flyaways and soft frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some of us greaseballs, there&#x27;s no way in hell we can just &amp;#34;skip a day&amp;#34; of hairwashing, no matter what the beauty magazines say.  Cleansing conditioner is kind of a compromise--you&#x27;re not exactly shampooing, so you (sort of) preserve your color a little bit, but it gets clean enough that you can live with yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: In no way does this product even remotely smell like roses.  I literally cannot understand how other reviews are claiming a rose fragrance--I dont detect a single note of rose anywhere.  To me, it has the same original Herbal Essences flower smell from a decade ago. Not unpleasant, not great.  Just OK.  Will I use it on two shower days or when I dont have time for anything else? Yes. Would I buy it again.....probably not.</li>
            <li> This is the second Cleaning condition that I have tried and I absolutely love this one.  The smell is fantastic and it leaves my hair very well conditioned.  I skip the shampoo with this product as it cleans my hair without drying it out like shampoo does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; any more.  My hair has more moisture &amp; body than ever</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft not frizz. I does not make my hair look dull or lifeless and it is easy to comb.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Herbal Essences rose scent, always have. For some reason it makes me happy just to smell it. I was so happy to find this product because I love the Herbal Essence naked cleansing conditioner but not the way it smells. I actually like this product more than the other Herbal Essences one, it seems to clean my (oily) hair better without drying it. If you read some of my other cleansing conditioner reviews you&#x27;ll find that I often find they leave my hair oily and stringy but this one doesn&#x27;t at all. It is very hydrating and my hair looks soft and shiny after using it. My new favorite!</li>
            <li> Smells great, is cheap and leaves my hair feeling very soft. Love it and I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Same as wen. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> I love the push packaging and it&#x27;s a great conditioner for colored hair--maintains the color but you must use another conditioner a couple days in between to make your hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Smell was unpleasant. Certainly not like roses. My hair felt soft and clean but would not use again due to the smell.</li>
            <li> it helps retain the color longer and my hair and scalp love the feeling.  fragrance is pleasantly light.  good night</li>
            <li> I got this because I have one of those heads of hair where I skip a day of washing and it looks like bacon grease was dumped on my head.  However I don&#x27;t like the drying effect of shampooing every day.  I read about this product in a magazine and decided to try it.  I use it in between shampooing and it seems to get my hair clean and soft and smelling really really good.</li>
            <li> I love that they did this in the original rose scent! My hair gets so fried on regular sulfate shampoos. Certain occasions I think still call for soapy cleaners though. My hair smells great and is super smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner cleanser!! Works as good as, if not better than, WEN. And MUCH CHEAPER THAN WEN!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair greasy</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to no lather, but it smells great!</li>
            <li> This in no way compares to Wen. I&#x27;ve been using Wen for a long time. Wen rinses clean. This seems to leave a film. That said, it is a good non-invasive hair treatment versus harsh shampoos. I have damaged hair due to prior perming. Now if one had a perm, this would be good to use after a perm (it is very conditioning, but no so much cleansing). It does have a pleasant smell and I might use it when extra conditioning is needed over cleansing. Definitely for dry hair. It just doesn&#x27;t have the same cleaning properties as Wen, but it is not a bad product. If I come to not be able to afford Wen anymore, I will buy this as a replacement and organix shampoo every other washing.</li>
            <li> I have tried Wen and really like it except it is very expensive.So, I started looking around and used similiar products that worked well but not as well as this AMAZING product. I ordered 4 bottles because I am afraid others won&#x27;t discover how well it works and it will get discontinued! Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> I use this regularly to cowash my twa. Love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wen girl, no doubt about it....but that stuff isn&#x27;t cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and what I do is use this for my FIRST shampoo THEN I use WEN for the second shampoo and let it stay on...so I&#x27;ve cut my WEN costs considerably&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried this alone but I suspect it would be fine....the smell is a bit sweet for me, but the price is GREAT</li>
            <li> Fantastic alternative to the drying effects of shampoo. Awesome value and smells fruitylicious. Doesn&#x27;t smell like roses at all but does smell great!</li>
            <li> Seems like hair is greasy. Going back to the Pantene cleansing conditioner even though not thrilled with the slight pine sent of it, it still is nicer to use than the herbal essence</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works pretty well on my excema-ridden scalp and dry hair.  I wash every two or three days and remain non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews that this is not for oily hair.  My roots looked completely greasy and my hair was clumping together which made my scalp show through (not a good look).  I was trying to use this to replace every other shampoo but I am back to my regular shampoo.  I did like the smell and will probably use the rest as conditioner on my ends.</li>
            <li> I have a blog under the name abeautyandthebusiness and have written many wen reviews that you can read there. As well as I have been sulfate free shampoo use for 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this cleansing conditioner I find it worrisome that right on the bottle in its directions use between shampoos. I prefer to use my cleansing conditioners daily. I use wen daily and have no issue. I can&#x27;t say the same for this color me happy cleansing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When washing with this cleansing conditioner I use 4 pumps for both the first wash, which my hair didn&#x27;t feel too clean and the second wash which my hair felt knotty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my biggest beef with this cleansing conditioner my hair felt a bit knotty in the shower. When my hair air dries or even when I blow dry it my hair feels heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have a greasy roots with this but my ends feel gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said something that saids use between shampoos, knotty in the shower and heavy when dry its a skip for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to note one more thing. Another reason I prefer Wen because it is cruelty free and the ingredients they use are of a high quality, mostly oils and natural extracts.</li>
            <li> I have used WEN in the past and liked it, but not the price. So I decided to look around and see if others were making/selling cleansing conditioners. This was the first one I found so I tried it, having colored treated hair I prefer having something that is made for it. I love this stuff. It is so easy to use, saves using separate shampoo/conditioner combos and takes less time. I use this daily and it makes my hair very soft and shiny, and doesn&#x27;t leave a coated feeling. I have very short hair, also very fine, thick and color treated and this doesn&#x27;t make my hair at all greasy, and I have had oily hair my entire life, being the reason I must shampoo daily. The scent is light and not at all over powering like the Loreal cleansing conditioner is. I highly recommend giving this a try. I truly prefer it to WEN, both for price and it is just a great product.</li>
