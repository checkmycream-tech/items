            <li> Does not have a hard bottom in the bag.  We had to take one from another grocery bag.  Would be good to include that or at least specifically say that there is no plastic bottom.</li>

            <li> Well made and holds a bunch of clothes.  I used it as an overnight bag for our son as his backpack can&#x27;t hold all of his stuff for sleepovers.  Also works great for lugging towels and suits for pool parties.</li>
            <li> strong, sturdy and cute tote. Great as a gift back, so they can keep the bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this in lieu of a gift bag for my one year old nephew&#x27;s birthday gift. Added a few sheets of red tissue paper, and I think he liked it more than the gift! I like the fact that it&#x27;s something he can use to store things in later and it won&#x27;t get thrown away like a gift bag would. It&#x27;s a nice material that I feel like will be durable enough to last as long as he&#x27;s still interested in Spider-Man!</li>

            <li> Not a huge Spider-Man fan, but the graphic is super cool and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy material and the size is perfect. Just wish the handles were a bit longer so I could carry it over my shoulder.</li>
            <li> Cute bag, but not very heavy duty for the price. I used as a gift bag for my nephew.</li>
            <li> Cute bag but poor quality.  The seam on one of the corners came undone almost immediately and a strap broke less than a month after it was purchased.</li>
            <li> My sons love this bag!  We use it for their swmming lessons.  I am able to put two towels and an extra set of clothes for both boys to change into after their class.  Very spacious and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves Spidey...&lt;br /&gt;I use this item to carry my lunch to work.&lt;br /&gt;People loved it so much, I&#x27;ve ordered several and given them as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I like this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size bag. I bought it to wrap my cousins childrens presents in. It holds a lot of items. I also have a Tinkerbell one just like it for the sister of the one that gets this bag. They seem heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I bough the bag as a way to save on plastic bags at the store. But instead I use it as a work bag. It holds all my stuff and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Used this as a &amp;#34;gift bag&amp;#34; to put my nephew&#x27;s birthday present in. It was roomy and sturdy and worked well.</li>
