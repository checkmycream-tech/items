            <li>Perfect sunblock for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts after useage, so that&#x27;s great too,</li>
            <li>It provides great protection.  </li>
            <li>My makeup looks great</li>
            <li>But for every day the Clarins is what I love the best.  </li>
            <li>I can not say anything because it has not had time to use this cream as forward summer, but I read a lot of good</li>
            <li>but this product is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>the quality is good.</li>
            <li>this is light and wonderful</li>
            <li>The formula has good protection but is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a good idea to use them together.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair.  </li>
            <li>Clarins sunscreen has a wonderful texture -- amazing slip and goes on so smoothly, but with no feeling of oiliness at all.  </li>
            <li>I have never found it to be a problem,makes my skin feel great and feels very light.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Its an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>clarins sunscreen is definitely superior than neutrogena suncreen in preventing my face from developing more age-related sunspots.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and this is really the best option.</li>
            <li>This is super lightweight and provides great protection for your face.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent sun screen, not once did I ever burn when applying this frequently.</li>
            <li>The best sunscreen for Celiacs and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So I think this would be suitable for people with a variety of skin</li>
            <li>While I have had good results with other products, these Clarins products that I just bought, Serum, Day Cream, and protective sun screen are the best that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for facial production from harmful sun&#x27;s rays.  </li>
            <li>I say, try it yourself and figure out what your skin like better :-).  </li>
            <li>i love the feel of this stuff on my face.  </li>
            <li>Many of the sunscreens will leave your face looking shiny while others will just roll into balls if you touch your face.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a product working any better.</li>
            <li>Another downside is it doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly when used over a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Overall, product is okay, but pricey, and doesn&#x27;t work as a great sunblock, so I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Honestly I know that I have good genes, but because I have always cared for my skin, I look years younger!  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is best sunscreen out there hands down.</li>
            <li>We like it because it goes on so smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It is light and airy on the skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and silkily.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so smooth</li>
            <li>appears to be a genuine clarins sunscreen like the one I bought from sephora.com but lower in price than at sephora.com.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, even with that level of protection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin seems more calm and even.  </li>
            <li>It is so light that you don&#x27;t feel greasy and it won&#x27;t clog your pores.  </li>
            <li>It does not feel greasy and has full spectrum protection too.</li>
            <li>If it looks shiny, make sure you finish with powder like I would.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, for all year around if you live in a sunny area like me, and if you enjoy sun exposure, like me~</li>
            <li>This is super in the summer but does not moisturize at all so not working for me as winter creeps up.  </li>
            <li>This product is full of healthy ingredients for my skin not to mention there are no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Rarely drips into eyes.</li>
            <li>This sun block is pricey, but I think it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>But it is truly better than any other sunscreen I have tried, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>Boy were they right.</li>
            <li>High quality product; light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>It has high SPF and uses natural sunscreens which better then chemical sunscreens.</li>
            <li>and I always look forward to putting on my makeup knowing this is going on first.  </li>
            <li>I first saw this in InStyle Magazine that bragged about how you won&#x27;t need a primer under your makeup and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I tried Clarins sunscreen and was happy that it smells so much nicer than ordinary sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the bottle had a weight in it to make sure every last drop got out.</li>
            <li>great high SPF without greasy thick feeling.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, because of the texture, it&#x27;s very easy to spread/blend.  </li>
            <li>My seven year old son is sensitive to many sunscreens (he breaks out in a rash) and so far this is the only one that he has been able to tolerate.  </li>
            <li>I have never broken out from it and it feels almost like applying water to my skin.</li>
            <li>so I am not too worried about a lack of it from using too much screen.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for some time and it really protects against the sun.</li>
            <li>The product smells great, but is not a great sunblock.</li>
            <li>It feels very silky on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I always laugh when Consumer Reports reports that there is no real point to all this kind of product; their people are not doing it properly!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance (actually can&#x27;t detect much of one at all) and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, nor has it caused any breakouts thus far.  </li>
            <li>weightless, high spf, mineral and chemical blockers and doesn&#x27;t leave skin looking shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarins by Clarins: UV PLUS HP DAY SCREEN HIGH PROTECTION SPF 40 UVA-UVB/PA+++/OIL-FREE --/1.7OZ</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I like to wear high SPF sunscreen every day and, for my face, I prefer mineral sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin and my forehead has been sunburned several times after applying only this product in the morning.</li>
            <li>I live in San Diego, where it&#x27;s constantly sunny, which could be why...it may work better in less sunny areas.</li>
            <li>It is slightly white on your face for a moment, but quickly becomes completely sheer.  </li>
            <li>try to always have my face somewhat damp before applying anything, to enable creams to glide on smoothly, evenly, without a heavy layer anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading about the two types I decided that I wanted to use only a physical sunscreen even though they tend to be thicker and less lovely from a cosmetic point of view.  </li>
            <li>a bit right after I apply it, which is odd.</li>
            <li>These plant extracts contain antioxidants and enzymes that may help neutralize the effects of free radicals, so you&#x27;re potentially getting a little extra</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to Josie Moran spf 40 for the winter which works well on my 50 year old face.</li>
            <li>not greasy, works well, could have higher SPF, less chemicals.</li>
            <li>Once you try this, you&#x27;re hooked as all the other sunscreens feel so much heavier and greasy by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it daily and only apply to sensitive to sun areas (like my forehead, under my eyes, and my nose).</li>

            <li> Only need a small amount for whole face.</li>
            <li> I use this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a sunblock- maybe as a face lotion that has sunscreen in it for some minor protection.</li>
            <li> Works on my combination skin and my sisters dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, then you will need to add moisturizer before sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Finally found a facial sunscreen that does not exaggerate my pores and uneven skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one cream that requires less of such care.</li>
            <li> continue to use a really heavy duty screen on my face when I swim laps -- my face is white when I head out to the pool.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious if this happens to anyone else and what the reason is.</li>
            <li> This goes on silky and provides a nice base for makeup.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other sunscreen again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This includes a tea leaf extract and a melon extract (and some other plant extracts) in addition to the titanium dioxide.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price however regardless of that I still buy it.  </li>
            <li> WIth that said the claim that it lets in \\&quot;good rays\\&quot; but keeps out bad ones is a little weird.</li>
            <li> texture is a little runny so watch out for that.  </li>
            <li> I use this product almost everyday.</li>
            <li> If you are going to be out in heavy sun, then I would recommend a stronger sun block product.</li>
            <li> The only thing to be wary of is that this contains a lot of silicones (not a problem for me, but possibly an issue for some people).ing to be wary of is that this contains a lot of silicones (not a problem for me, but possibly an issue for some people).</li>
            <li> I like the texture of it and not a strong smell</li>
            <li> This has been my sunscreen for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks small but it goes anlongnway.  </li>
            <li> He has also &amp;#34;grown out&amp;#34; of lotions in the past but has been using this one for over two years now and not showing any sign of intolerance.  </li>
            <li> I am not wild about how expensive it is</li>
            <li> This is a little tough to use in the eye area, my eyes always water when using this sun screen.</li>
            <li> but until I find something else his skin can tolerate, I&#x27;m at least thankful to have found it.</li>
            <li> This is so expensive (which is why I gave it four stores rather than five).  </li>
            <li> Is there something wrong with it??</li>
            <li> I had been using  Clarins products but they are so expensive that I had not bought them for a while.  </li>
            <li> Hate paying the price for this, but will have to just scrimp somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I hate greasy.  </li>
            <li> Feel very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Normally I hate the feel of sunscreens!</li>

            <li> This has been my sunscreen for the past 5 years. What can say this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. It is light and airy on the skin. It has high SPF and uses natural sunscreens which better then chemical sunscreens. This sunscreen is best sunscreen out there hands down.</li>
            <li> This is super lightweight and provides great protection for your face. I have never broken out from it and it feels almost like applying water to my skin.</li>
            <li> High quality product; light and non-greasy. A little goes a long way and it lasts all day. Works well under foundation.</li>
            <li> Wonderful non greasy product.</li>
            <li> Great product. I just hope Clarins does not use animals for testing.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a sunscreen and also like a primer. It goes on so smoothly and silkily.  My only complaint is the price however regardless of that I still buy it.  Its an amazing product.  My skin has never looked so smooth and I always look forward to putting on my makeup knowing this is going on first.  I will continue to buy this product regardless of the price. I first saw this in InStyle Magazine that bragged about how you won&#x27;t need a primer under your makeup and sunscreen. Boy were they right.</li>
            <li> This is so expensive (which is why I gave it four stores rather than five).  But it is truly better than any other sunscreen I have tried, and I have tried many.  This is a &amp;#34;physical&amp;#34; sunscreen rather than a chemical sunscreen.  After reading about the two types I decided that I wanted to use only a physical sunscreen even though they tend to be thicker and less lovely from a cosmetic point of view.  They protect just as well and they are felt to be safer, as some of the chemicals used in chemical sunscreens are questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarins sunscreen has a wonderful texture -- amazing slip and goes on so smoothly, but with no feeling of oiliness at all.  It is slightly white on your face for a moment, but quickly becomes completely sheer.  Once you try this, you&#x27;re hooked as all the other sunscreens feel so much heavier and greasy by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use a really heavy duty screen on my face when I swim laps -- my face is white when I head out to the pool.  But for every day the Clarins is what I love the best.  Hate paying the price for this, but will have to just scrimp somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I use this for a long time.  I like the texture of it and not a strong smell and you can still put make up over it.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. This is my third bottle and it lasts forever. Works on my combination skin and my sisters dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can not say anything because it has not had time to use this cream as forward summer, but I read a lot of good</li>
            <li> appears to be a genuine clarins sunscreen like the one I bought from sephora.com but lower in price than at sephora.com. it doesn&#x27;t make your face look chalky nor greasy like Neutrogena sunscreen does to my face. clarins sunscreen is definitely superior than neutrogena suncreen in preventing my face from developing more age-related sunspots.</li>
            <li> I have used Clarins sunscreen for a number of years now and it is the only sunscreen I have used that I am not allergic to using. I have never found it to be a problem,makes my skin feel great and feels very light. I use this product almost everyday.</li>
            <li> This is super in the summer but does not moisturize at all so not working for me as winter creeps up.  I&#x27;m back to Josie Moran spf 40 for the winter which works well on my 50 year old face.</li>
            <li> i love it. it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;it is a very good product. but this product is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;But the quality is good.</li>
            <li> I tried Clarins sunscreen and was happy that it smells so much nicer than ordinary sunscreen. It does not feel greasy and has full spectrum protection too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for facial production from harmful sun&#x27;s rays.  Have used it for 20 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, even with that level of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to always have my face somewhat damp before applying anything, to enable creams to glide on smoothly, evenly, without a heavy layer anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one cream that requires less of such care.</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever found that dries to a non-cloying, non-greasy finish.  Rarely drips into eyes.</li>
            <li> The description is misleading I only received a .3oz sample.  This is the description I cut and pasted on here from Amazon&#x27;s website describing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clarins by Clarins: UV PLUS HP DAY SCREEN HIGH PROTECTION SPF 40 UVA-UVB/PA+++/OIL-FREE --/1.7OZ</li>
            <li> this is light and wonderful</li>
            <li> This is an excellent sun screen, not once did I ever burn when applying this frequently. Additionally, the bottle had a weight in it to make sure every last drop got out. WIth that said the claim that it lets in \\&quot;good rays\\&quot; but keeps out bad ones is a little weird. I take vitamin D supplements so I am not too worried about a lack of it from using too much screen. This sunscreen does have antioxidants, such as melon extract which can boost UV protection according to some studies.    This is a little tough to use in the eye area, my eyes always water when using this sun screen. Another downside is it doesn&#x27;t absorb very quickly when used over a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> One dash, that&#x27;s all!&lt;br /&gt;Light, effective.&lt;br /&gt;Tips: 1. Tap/ pad it on your face until even; do not use circle motion like a cream.  Sun screen and facial lotion are different.  2. Some say use it before facial lotion, some say use it after...I say, try it yourself and figure out what your skin like better :-).  3. If it looks shiny, make sure you finish with powder like I would.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, for all year around if you live in a sunny area like me, and if you enjoy sun exposure, like me~</li>
            <li> Hi, I ordered 2 of this sunblock but I just got 1. Is there something wrong with it?? Feel very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This sun block is pricey, but I think it is worth it.  The bottle looks small but it goes anlongnway.  The formula has good protection but is not greasy.  I hate greasy.  My skin can still breathe.  If I wear make up over it, it doesn&#x27;t distort the hand of the finish.  Best sunblock.</li>
            <li> I had been using  Clarins products but they are so expensive that I had not bought them for a while.  I just ordered them through Amazon.  While I have had good results with other products, these Clarins products that I just bought, Serum, Day Cream, and protective sun screen are the best that I have used.  I think it is a good idea to use them together.  My skin seems more calm and even.  I always laugh when Consumer Reports reports that there is no real point to all this kind of product; their people are not doing it properly!  Honestly I know that I have good genes, but because I have always cared for my skin, I look years younger!  I especially like this sunscreen.  I read a review of it at Amazon, and that is why I bought the products again.  i love the feel of this stuff on my face.  Normally I hate the feel of sunscreens!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product from Clarins. I have been using it for some time and it really protects against the sun. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product smells great, but is not a great sunblock. If you are going to be out in heavy sun, then I would recommend a stronger sun block product. I have light skin and my forehead has been sunburned several times after applying only this product in the morning. I live in San Diego, where it&#x27;s constantly sunny, which could be why...it may work better in less sunny areas. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a sunblock- maybe as a face lotion that has sunscreen in it for some minor protection. I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts after useage, so that&#x27;s great too, but I don&#x27;t use it daily and only apply to sensitive to sun areas (like my forehead, under my eyes, and my nose). It also makes my skin tingle a bit right after I apply it, which is odd. I&#x27;m curious if this happens to anyone else and what the reason is. Overall, product is okay, but pricey, and doesn&#x27;t work as a great sunblock, so I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My seven year old son is sensitive to many sunscreens (he breaks out in a rash) and so far this is the only one that he has been able to tolerate.  He has also &amp;#34;grown out&amp;#34; of lotions in the past but has been using this one for over two years now and not showing any sign of intolerance.  We like it because it goes on so smooth and easy.  It provides great protection.  He has had it on all day for summer camp and not been burned.  I am not wild about how expensive it is but until I find something else his skin can tolerate, I&#x27;m at least thankful to have found it.</li>
            <li> It is so light that you don&#x27;t feel greasy and it won&#x27;t clog your pores.  I have tried everything and this is really the best option.</li>
            <li> Finally found a facial sunscreen that does not exaggerate my pores and uneven skin.  This goes on silky and provides a nice base for makeup.  If you have dry skin, then you will need to add moisturizer before sunscreen. This has held up for me in the sun.  No sunburns and I&#x27;m fair.  It feels very silky on the skin.  Gave only four stars and not five because of the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect sunblock for my oily skin. It dries almost to a powder finish and keeps the sun&#x27;s rays at bay all day.</li>
            <li> great high SPF without greasy thick feeling. Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried several sunscreens including some that are more expensive than Clarins.  This beats them all.  Many of the sunscreens will leave your face looking shiny while others will just roll into balls if you touch your face.  Clarins goes on so well and stays on.  My makeup looks great and I don&#x27;t even feel like I am wearing sunscreen.  I can&#x27;t imagine a product working any better.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other sunscreen again. Clarins not only gives me the coverage I need, it also provides me with softer smoother skin. This product is full of healthy ingredients for my skin not to mention there are no harsh chemicals. Only zinc/titanium oxide. The best sunscreen for Celiacs and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like to wear high SPF sunscreen every day and, for my face, I prefer mineral sunscreens.  I had a sample of this and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week.  I&#x27;m definitely impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a little runny so watch out for that.  On the other hand, because of the texture, it&#x27;s very easy to spread/blend.  Another thing I like is that, even though this is a mineral sunscreen, it doesn&#x27;t leave a white coating on your skin.  Regardless of whether I use it under makeup or not, it doesn&#x27;t alter my skin tone.  So I think this would be suitable for people with a variety of skin colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This includes a tea leaf extract and a melon extract (and some other plant extracts) in addition to the titanium dioxide.  These plant extracts contain antioxidants and enzymes that may help neutralize the effects of free radicals, so you&#x27;re potentially getting a little extra protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients since they&#x27;re not listed on the product page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredient: Titanium Dioxide, 8.1%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane, Water, Polyglyceryl-3, Polydimethylsiloxyethyl Dimethicone, Corn Starch Modified, Alcohol, Aluminum Hydroxide Stearic Acid, Sodium Chloride, PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, PEG/PPG 20/15 Dimethicone, Tocopheryl Acetate, Fragrance, Hydroxy-Propyltrimonium Maltodextrin Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, Butylene Glycol, Glyercin, Pentylene Glycol, Cantaloupe Melon Fruit Extract, Biosaccharide Gum 4, Thermus, Thermophillus Ferment, Lapsana Communis Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Camellia Sinesis Leaf Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Rhodiola Rosea Root Extract, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Benzyl Salicylate, Geraniol, Citronellol, Benzyl Benzoate, Butyl-phenyl Methylpropional, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Linalool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance (actually can&#x27;t detect much of one at all) and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, nor has it caused any breakouts thus far.  The only thing to be wary of is that this contains a lot of silicones (not a problem for me, but possibly an issue for some people).ing to be wary of is that this contains a lot of silicones (not a problem for me, but possibly an issue for some people).</li>
            <li> not greasy, works well, could have higher SPF, less chemicals.</li>
