            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>and there you go so deep great service</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to charge phone and tablet at same time in car</li>
            <li>We love this because we have so many different devices that use USB...</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and works as I would expect.</li>

            <li>Exactly as I expected and it works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>both the 1A and 2A while driving and listening to Pandora, actually charged the phone at a decent rate despite not matching the 5.3V/2.0A of the OEM charger.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected from the description.  </li>

            <li> It works. Does what I want it to do. What more is there to be said?</li>
            <li> This USB port is exactly what I needed and I make use of it often.  I would purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever! We love this because we have so many different devices that use USB...kind of wish all the cars now had this instead of the pointless lighter spot.</li>
            <li> Good product concept and works ok but has flaws in charging which can and will damage your device!  It doesn&#x27;t have smart technology while changing to reduce power when it&#x27;s close to being charged.  Or shut off if you forget,  or don&#x27;t unplug it as soon as it&#x27;s charged.....  THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE! ! Insulting your customers and their knowledge of how things work. .??!! By, talking to them like there stupid or assuming their not technology savy or know how thing&#x27;s work or should work!!?? NOT GOOD FOR BUISNESS!!!!  Especially when they are an IT Account Manager and neck deep in providing IT Solutions for Businesses everyday!!! So yes I&#x27;m ney techbsavy!  ADDING insult to injury of a defective product that didn&#x27;t always charge correctly! ! I had to pay for shipping to get the product. I had to PAY to ship it back,  Instated of sending me a prpaid return shipping label for their defective....  I get a slap to the face and had to pay to ship it BACK COSTING MORE THAN THE PRODUCT Itself!!!!!!  RIDICOULUS doesn&#x27;t describe doing a customer like that.!!!  Especially since I had other products of theirs and initially wasn&#x27;t going to return them because they actually worked..  But after that,  yes I returned it all!!.  I will not buy from this company ever again. To each his own,  but I won&#x27;t do business with them again!!</li>
            <li> I have a different brand of the dame thing and it comes apart if I have two things plugged in and I unplug one and it cost more money than this one. This is great, sturdy and great price.</li>
            <li> Handy and convenient for the car. Easily tucks away unlike chargers with wires and I can charge both my phones</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  I can charge my s5 and the rest of the family can still charge what they need to.</li>
            <li> Very good and has a great size, feasible for any car lighter/charging area, love the durability and the dual components</li>
            <li> This item looks good I have not tried it yet because of waiting on additional cable.I am sure it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Not knowing exactly what I was purchasing, I am very happy with this charger.  The speed of recharging is amazing.  I can charge more than one device at a time, as well.  I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected from the description.  It arrived quickly and works as I would expect.</li>
            <li> Like the dual charger. Works excellant. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with how well made this car charger is!  It fits snuggly into the lighter socket in the car, and does not pop out or wiggle around or feel unstable.  It charges my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Note 8 devices quite well simultaneously.  For one who is literally not a techie, it took a lot of ressearching and learning about these accessories before I could make a decision on what car charger to buy and what cords to buy for it.  I am glad I made the choice to buy this charger!</li>
            <li> Fits so well in the socket unlike a few other ones that were so loose. Not one error message that &amp;#34;this device is not supported.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good if you have two phones.</li>
            <li> Got it at July 13th 2014 for my girlfriend, after one month...  stopped working, can&#x27;t return or exchange, I&#x27;m so screwed!</li>
            <li> wanted a charging system for my truck for my phone in different lights and not have to pay $29 for this one was on Amazon it was a good price it works fantastic and there you go so deep great service great product has give me everything I needed to do and it charges my note three very quickly on the 2.1 there you go</li>
            <li> This dual usb charger works perfectly.  It allows us to connect both iphone cable and samsung 5s cable ito one plugj,</li>
            <li> Came just like it described and on time. Very please and would order again</li>
            <li> While it charges one phone super fast it doesn&#x27;t charge two phones which is what I needed it for. Especially when we go on trips and use our phones for navigation.</li>
            <li> It works fine. Nice to be able to charge phone and tablet at same time in car</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Charges phone quicker than the standard USB hum for the car.</li>
            <li> I gave away this item as a gift to a friend.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have used both ports. Charged fast. Light bright for nighttime. Just unplug when not using or it gets warm.</li>
            <li> I like it,  it charge my phone first</li>
            <li> Order arrived on time. Charger works flawlessly. Great price. Love the blue back light. Definitely a good choice.</li>
            <li> I had no idea there&lt;br /&gt;Were different&lt;br /&gt;Amp chargers..&lt;br /&gt;So great to have options&lt;br /&gt;And be able to charge in car</li>
            <li> This is long and durable. I use it as my stay at work under the desk charger, no one else tried to use it either since it&#x27;s USB 3.0. Great success.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected and it works perfectly fine for me. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a car charger.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this over and over to any one that is looking for an adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for Samsung Galaxy products!</li>
            <li> Works great, haven&#x27;t used it to overnight charge my phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used both the 1A and 2A while driving and listening to Pandora, actually charged the phone at a decent rate despite not matching the 5.3V/2.0A of the OEM charger.</li>
            <li> This car charger is well made and has 2 charge settings. Nice blue LED light is not too bright and distracting.</li>
            <li> Works great and very secure in lighter outlet. Definitely glad to have a 1v/2v option as I have a Note 3 and it takes longer to charge through a 1v.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect to charge both my and my fianc&amp;eacute;e phone while on trips!! I am glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Worked once.  I&#x27;ve tried different Samsung phone cords, they work with the wall plug, but not this auto adapter.</li>
            <li> It works fine n it doesnt take too long to charge your phone</li>
