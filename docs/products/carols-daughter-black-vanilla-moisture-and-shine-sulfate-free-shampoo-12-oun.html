            <li>I love the fact that there is no sulfate in it.</li>

            <li>It works really well and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter</li>
            <li>I am mostly Caucasian but have some Native, AA, and Hispanic in me.</li>

            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>and I have to use a lot more of the product than others.</li>
            <li>Great smell and makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>I like that its sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I have been paying huge money for Paul Mitchell Ginger shampoo that is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>hair!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that cheap vanilla smell</li>
            <li>but I have used sulfate free shampoo for years</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Carol&#x27;s daughter products are made for hair that is coarser and curly - mine is straight fine blond hair, and I love this Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel like my hair is as clean as I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>parabens - Carol&#x27;s Daughter is great for my fine, blonde, straight hair.</li>
            <li>It smells good and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>As someone with a sensitive scalp and recurring eczema, this shampoo leaves my hair clean and my scalp feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t give you that instant silky soft hair, but I prefer healthy strong hair that doesn&#x27;t break easily.</li>
            <li>I try to only use sulfrate free shampoo and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have very long hair which is a problem as long hair takes special care to keep it looking good.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, lathers well, leaves my hair feeling soft and sily.mwould definitely buy again</li>
            <li>It is not moisturizing enough for normal and healthy hairs.</li>
            <li>Will certainly be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY shampoos that are sulfate free and they all made my hair feel very heavy and look greasy within a day.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how we get caught up using all these harsh chemicals and do not realize what we are doing to ourselves.  </li>
            <li>But it was suggested to me for colored hair because it&#x27;s sulfate free and from their personal experience.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a deep, rich but gentle scented vanilla (like the real thing.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo as it was highly recommended for color treated hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was a tangled mess that took forever to comb out resulting in more than normal hair loss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using 100% natural shampoo (morocco method) and was just tired of not having good smelling</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleans my hair and makes it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Cleans thoroughly, rinsed well and leaves my hair ultra soft</li>
            <li>I also use the conditioner on the lower half of my hair (that is the part that always needs conditioning when your hair is long) and I love that as well.</li>
            <li>It has done really well, and the purple washes out so much less than a normal color treatment shampoo that contains sulfate.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the last 6 weeks and my purple has barely faded at all!!</li>
            <li>Also, does not dry out scalp.</li>
            <li>it coats the hair and keeps the cuticle down, BUT the waxes are hard and make the hair brittle and there is more breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and not hard and rough like a lot of other sulfrate shampoos.</li>

            <li> It dried my daughters curls out.</li>
            <li> I started using it on my hair just not to let it go to waste.</li>
            <li> By the third week it made my curls course and difficult to comb out.  </li>
            <li> Well no more!  </li>
            <li> This product shampoo/conditioner makes my hair extremely heavy to the point of it feeling nasty as well.</li>
            <li> I am guilty as well!  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product doesn&#x27;t have better reviews! I love it. I try to only use sulfrate free shampoo and this is by far my favorite! Leaves my hair soft and not hard and rough like a lot of other sulfrate shampoos. Oh and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brand and everything they produce. This shampoo cleans my hair and makes it shiny and soft. I love the fact that there is no sulfate in it. Smells amazing and it lathers good.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this shampoo goes a long way.  I like that its sulfate free.  You get a lot in this bottle.  It smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy</li>
            <li> I discovered this shampoo when it was on sale at Target! I have very long hair which is a problem as long hair takes special care to keep it looking good. I have been paying huge money for Paul Mitchell Ginger shampoo that is sulfate free. I love Paul Mitchell, but let&#x27;s face it, it is very expensive. I have tried MANY shampoos that are sulfate free and they all made my hair feel very heavy and look greasy within a day. This shampoo works just as well on my hair and scalp as my beloved Paul Mitchell shampoo and I love it. My hair is very soft and manageable. I also use the conditioner on the lower half of my hair (that is the part that always needs conditioning when your hair is long) and I love that as well.</li>

I have been using it for the last 6 weeks and my purple has barely faded at all!! It smells good and lasts a long time. My ONLY complaint is that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much. Definitely worth the price! Will certainly be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Detangles my thick, coarse hair instantly while washing. I just comb through and leave it in for about a minute and rinse.  I follow with a straightening conditioner.  Great smell, too.</li>
            <li> Well this is my second bottle.  It is amazing how we get caught up using all these harsh chemicals and do not realize what we are doing to ourselves.  I am guilty as well!  Well no more!  This brand is not too expensive and I love it.  Oh and by the way....the smell is so amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo on my 3b curls once a week for a month.  By the third week it made my curls course and difficult to comb out.  I should have stopped using it but decided to try one more time. My hair was a tangled mess that took forever to comb out resulting in more than normal hair loss. I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> It is not moisturizing enough for normal and healthy hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo for my toddler who is bi racial with curly hair. It dried my daughters curls out. I heard about Carol&#x27;s daughter products off YouTube wanted to see what all the hype was about don&#x27;t buy it. I started using it on my hair just not to let it go to waste.</li>
            <li> It works really well and smells great. But it was suggested to me for colored hair because it&#x27;s sulfate free and from their personal experience. And it completely stripped the color from my hair in a few washes</li>
            <li> I love Carol&#x27;s Daughter</li>
            <li> I am mostly Caucasian but have some Native, AA, and Hispanic in me.My hair is coarse and thick even while straightened.This product shampoo/conditioner makes my hair extremely heavy to the point of it feeling nasty as well.Would not recommend for some multiracial people.</li>
            <li> Carol&#x27;s daughter products are made for hair that is coarser and curly - mine is straight fine blond hair, and I love this Shampoo and Conditioner. It makes my hair feel clean, smell great and look quite shiny. I have purchased this several times, as well as other items from the same line. No sulphates is really nice, as sulphates are so drying. You do not get as many suds, but it does suds up a bit and your hair will look fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this line does not have parabens (wax) or silicone in any of their products. I used to use products that had this stuff in it and it did make my hair look good - it coats the hair and keeps the cuticle down, BUT the waxes are hard and make the hair brittle and there is more breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only buy and use products that do not have silicone or parabens - Carol&#x27;s Daughter is great for my fine, blonde, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the conditioner to go with to help maintain my purple hair color. It has done really well, and the purple washes out so much less than a normal color treatment shampoo that contains sulfate. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is after washing a few times with this, it makes my hair look really dried out for some reason.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Cleans thoroughly, rinsed well and leaves my hair ultra soft</li>
            <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter shampoos are probably the best-quality SLS-free hair products you can find for the price. As someone with a sensitive scalp and recurring eczema, this shampoo leaves my hair clean and my scalp feeling healthy. That being said, I haven&#x27;t noticed any extra moisture or shine, or reduced hair fallout. It&#x27;s not a miracle-worker, but it&#x27;s a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I&#x27;ve been using 100% natural shampoo (morocco method) and was just tired of not having good smelling hair!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that cheap vanilla smell, it&#x27;s a deep, rich but gentle scented vanilla (like the real thing.)&lt;br /&gt;It does foam up if you&#x27;re used to the no foam shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the scent lasted longer than it does because if you use a different conditioner (even unscented) it will take out the scent.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement or harm done to my hairs health.</li>
            <li> Great smell and makes my hair soft but I have used sulfate free shampoo for years and I have to use a lot more of the product than others.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of shampoo that doesn&#x27;t get a good lather and sudsy. I just don&#x27;t feel like my hair is as clean as I&#x27;m used to. The company nailed the smell and it lasts in your hair for over a day.</li>
            <li> My hair felt stronger after continued use (about 6 weeks). Won&#x27;t give you that instant silky soft hair, but I prefer healthy strong hair that doesn&#x27;t break easily. Also, does not dry out scalp. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, lathers well, leaves my hair feeling soft and sily.mwould definitely buy again</li>
