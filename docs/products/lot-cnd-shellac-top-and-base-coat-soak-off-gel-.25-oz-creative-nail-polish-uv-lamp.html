            <li>They&#x27;re my favorite to use.</li>
            <li>I love the gel manicures.  </li>
            <li>I love this polish and am using it exclusively.</li>
            <li>Enjoy doing my own nails at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>While the colors are nice, the price is good, and delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use light coats.  </li>
            <li>I always make sure I get my sides cleaned up before I cure them under the light.  </li>
            <li>This is really easy to use, and my polish - even after 2 weeks - is not chipped at all.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>With the light it takes me 10 minutes to do my nails.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>You have to order the Shellac color and the UV light as well.</li>
            <li>I have gone to have my shellac nails done at salon for quite some time and decided to buy the UV light machine and supplies to do it myself.</li>
            <li>love love this product and would highly recommend to everyone!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The topcoat was gritty first time use - however I shook the bottle well (and now really shake the bottle every time I use) and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have to put anything special on it at all, it just peels right off on</li>
            <li>But it is all well worth it.</li>
            <li>I must say, they do come out beautiful and look fantastic but they do not last as long as it should.</li>
            <li>and th price is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This cracked right away.</li>
            <li>It peels right off if you do.</li>
            <li>; I used the gellish polish with it another time and it peeled right off.</li>
            <li>so I purchased the tab &amp; base coat, both works great and my manicure turns great every time.</li>
            <li>I really, really like the polish!  </li>
            <li>This is so much better than regular fingernail polish.</li>
            <li>I think the&lt;br /&gt;explanation of the product could have been more specific.</li>
            <li>If you are like I am and read all the reviews then you may be interested in what I have to say.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Best base and top coat out there in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I think the CND top and Base coat are the best.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much to the cuticle area as well for the same reason.</li>
            <li>The base coat is thinner, quick application, pop under the light, then use a creative color, top coat flows nicely from the brush even with the necessary thicker consistency.  </li>
            <li>so i bought my pink and this top coat</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much. .</li>
            <li>I really like the shellac nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered these before, fast services.</li>
            <li>Lasted a long ol&#x27; time, but came off easily with acetone.  </li>
            <li>Applies on nice and last a really long time with no chip!</li>
            <li>These were as they said new in box of the product and works just like the ones in my salon and a much cheaper price than a supply store without a license.</li>
            <li>My nails are also so much harder and do not break easily.</li>
            <li>you can put plain polish on top of it and it stays on.</li>
            <li>and I still get that hard gel finish that I love so much.  </li>
            <li>The Nail Harmony Gellish brand is cheaper, but the foundation and top coats peel up too quickly no matter what extra steps you take.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend doing it yourself over going and getting it done professionally.</li>
            <li>I like CND polish and these two products provide a nice base and top coat.  </li>
            <li>This LOT of Top and Base Coat and Soak off Gel .25 and creative Nail UV Lamp is not all included.</li>
            <li>I also just use the top and base coat most of the time.  </li>
            <li>well that sounds good on the surface BUT notice the actual 2 only items that ARE included are bottles that are only 1/2 the regular size of CND top and base coat.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much easier to remove than gels at the nail salon and last just as long.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this product would last as long as the manicure I got in the salon.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and the gel would peal off within 2 days or the gel would look dull after 2 days..</li>

            <li> I know that the gel colors are really hard to get right</li>
            <li> All of the layers - base coat, top coat and nail color - come off easily with very little effort.  </li>
            <li> Im in the Military and natural pink is allowed</li>
            <li> I really like the CND Shellac Top and Base Coats.  </li>
            <li> Shellac, wouldn, dry I ordered the UV dryer</li>
            <li> I have used these bottles for probably 10-15 manicures and it&#x27;s working as expected - lasts for 10 days or so with no chipping.</li>
            <li> This last time, I used CND for my base and top coat with another LED brand color</li>
            <li> I asked what IS included in the LOT of 4 items and was told only the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> If you put it on too thick it will peel up quicker and will not last as long.</li>
            <li> I was diaapoiinted that what I saw in the  selection was not exactly what I recieved.</li>
            <li> I have just written two other reviews for CND shellac polish.  </li>
            <li> Of course this is just the base and top coats.</li>
            <li> And I just got my replacement top and base coat bottles.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll use those colors in between my top and base</li>
            <li> In fairness, I have to say it lasts MUCH longer than my regular nail polish and also, I did not use the colored polish between the base and the topcoat.</li>
            <li> To take off, soak a small piece of cotton ball in acetone, squeeze out and place on finger nail.  </li>
            <li> Then wrap nail in a small piece of aluminum foil and wait about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> That said, when I have worn polish in the past, it would begin pealing within 24 hrs.  </li>
            <li> I find this system not really healthy for nails.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they say it is so hard to get off.  </li>
            <li> Your nails will shine for at least 2 weeks or more.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t put it on to thick....</li>
            <li> It does make your nails really weak so nourish them in between shellacs.</li>
            <li> I simply used the base and topcoat.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to remove, to change colors and cannot fill in when grows out</li>
            <li> I probably ordered the wrong product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved CND Shellac products. This last time, I used CND for my base and top coat with another LED brand color and it still worked!</li>
            <li> I love to do my Shellac manicures at home so I purchased the tab &amp; base coat, both works great and my manicure turns great every time. I love these items and their price!</li>
            <li> This is really easy to use, and my polish - even after 2 weeks - is not chipped at all.  The only reason I have to change is because of the nail growth.  My nails are also so much harder and do not break easily. When I need to remove the polish, I soak my nails for about 5 min in regular nail polish remover, and I have no problem getting the shellac off.  I really, really like the polish!  I do use a UV nail dryer, and after drying, wipe my nails with alcohol, ad they are perfect and stay shiny.</li>
            <li> I really like the CND Shellac Top and Base Coats.  They&#x27;re much easier to remove than gels at the nail salon and last just as long.  I just got back from a 5-day cruise and waited a week later to remove my gel polish.  To take off, soak a small piece of cotton ball in acetone, squeeze out and place on finger nail.  Then wrap nail in a small piece of aluminum foil and wait about 10 minutes.  All of the layers - base coat, top coat and nail color - come off easily with very little effort.  The price is cheaper than the ones that nail salons or beauty supply stores offer.</li>
            <li> I love these!!! Applies on nice and last a really long time with no chip! I will recommend this product to my friends and family!!!</li>
            <li> These were as they said new in box of the product and works just like the ones in my salon and a much cheaper price than a supply store without a license.</li>
            <li> Love it.  With the light it takes me 10 minutes to do my nails.  I took another reviewers advice and put the color coat on top of the top coat.  That way i can change colors without removing everything, just the color coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brittle nails are definitely longer, but It may be just because the polish reminds me to not rip them off!  That said, when I have worn polish in the past, it would begin pealing within 24 hrs.  This lasts. And only comes off when there is an edge I start picking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its great.</li>
            <li> These products were a great deal and worked really well. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying these again!</li>
            <li> The topcoat was gritty first time use - however I shook the bottle well (and now really shake the bottle every time I use) and it&#x27;s perfect. I have used these bottles for probably 10-15 manicures and it&#x27;s working as expected - lasts for 10 days or so with no chipping.</li>
            <li> I find this system not really healthy for nails.  It is difficult to remove, to change colors and cannot fill in when grows out</li>
            <li> CND is the best Shellac I have found. Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this brand of shellac.  Gellish is the best kind and the only one that stay.  That is what they use in the salons.  This cracked right away.</li>
            <li> I love shellac. Best products for my nails.</li>
            <li> , Came wrapped perfect. Love these and the price,great for at home shellac dries just as it says it will</li>
            <li> Best base and top coat out there in my opinion. Easy to use, smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> I tested this product while on vacation in Playa del Carmen and started loving it.&lt;br /&gt;It is very simple to use, and very simple to remove as well. Your nails will shine for at least 2 weeks or more.&lt;br /&gt;This nail polish is the best I ever tried!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect pair to create CND shellaced nails!</li>
            <li> I like CND polish and these two products provide a nice base and top coat.  My CND polish last for 2 to 3 weeks.  Easier to remove than Gelish products.</li>
            <li> ive orded it before the top coat is diff then the last on i got but works great!!! i love shellac</li>
            <li> This LOT of Top and Base Coat and Soak off Gel .25 and creative Nail UV Lamp is not all included. I asked what IS included in the LOT of 4 items and was told only the base and top coat. HUH? Then why are 4 items included in the description of a LOT for regular price of $79.99 for only $29.90....well that sounds good on the surface BUT notice the actual 2 only items that ARE included are bottles that are only 1/2 the regular size of CND top and base coat. You can buy 2 double sized bottles on Amazon for only $29.00...Think twice and then 3 times before you actually believe this listing. DNB!</li>
            <li> Im in the Military and natural pink is allowed so i bought my pink and this top coat it in hopes of feeling like a girl. But If your a woman who sticks her hands in water for anything longer than 5 mins than stay away from this one. It peels right off if you do.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than regular fingernail polish. They DO last for 2 weeks. Of course this is just the base and top coats. You have to order the Shellac color and the UV light as well. But it is all well worth it. I would recommend doing it yourself over going and getting it done professionally. It is so easy. And I find it comes off very easy for me, I don&#x27;t have to put anything special on it at all, it just peels right off on it&#x27;s own! ( so does my sister&#x27;s and my mother&#x27;s ) I don&#x27;t know why they say it is so hard to get off.  It does make your nails really weak so nourish them in between shellacs.</li>
            <li> This stays on better than any thing I have ever tried.  You can even us it without color. you can put plain polish on top of it and it stays on.</li>
            <li> as shown  done done done this is why I don&#x27;t give feed back you make people write stuff done with amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this in conjunction with the rest of the required items to do an at home shellac manicure. This is a great value, you will def save money doing these at home yourself. I did my first one tonight &amp; it turned out awesome. So easy to use. I def recommend. :)</li>
            <li> This product is great ...so much better them polish! Just don&#x27;t put it on to thick....it will last til it grows out!</li>
            <li> Shellac, wouldn, dry I ordered the UV dryer but It hasen&#x27;t arrived yet. I probably ordered the wrong product. I think the&lt;br /&gt;explanation of the product could have been more specific.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and the gel would peal off within 2 days or the gel would look dull after 2 days..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product CND Shellac is wonderful, the manicure/nails last 14 or more days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love this product and would highly recommend to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much. .</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this product would last as long as the manicure I got in the salon.  No such luck.  It lasts maybe 3-4 days.  In fairness, I have to say it lasts MUCH longer than my regular nail polish and also, I did not use the colored polish between the base and the topcoat. I simply used the base and topcoat.  So that might be the reason.  I will definately use this product instead of regular nail polish from now on.</li>
            <li> I really like the shellac nail polish.  It keeps the nail stong and it is a durable product.  I was diaapoiinted that what I saw in the  selection was not exactly what I recieved.</li>
            <li> I love the creative gel polishes. They&#x27;re my favorite to use. I&#x27;m a stylist and this has been the most popular thing ever.</li>
            <li> I love the gel manicures.  I started doing them myself about 9 months ago. And I just got my replacement top and base coat bottles.  If you are like I am and read all the reviews then you may be interested in what I have to say.  I think the CND top and Base coat are the best.  I&#x27;ve got a couple of different products in my nail drawer.  These are the best.  However, I use Harmony color often.  I also just use the top and base coat most of the time.  I know that the gel colors are really hard to get right and there are some really awesome OPI colors I can&#x27;t live with out.  So, I&#x27;ll use those colors in between my top and base and I still get that hard gel finish that I love so much.  Just make sure you use light coats.  If you put it on too thick it will peel up quicker and will not last as long. Make sure you don&#x27;t apply too much to the cuticle area as well for the same reason. I always make sure I get my sides cleaned up before I cure them under the light.  If you take your time, don&#x27;t hurry and use lightly you&#x27;ll have prefect nails all the time!!!  The Nail Harmony Gellish brand is cheaper, but the foundation and top coats peel up too quickly no matter what extra steps you take.  These two are the best!</li>
            <li> I have just written two other reviews for CND shellac polish.  I love this polish and am using it exclusively.</li>
            <li> Same as the nail salon I was going to. Does exactly as described. Enjoy doing my own nails at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> I have gone to have my shellac nails done at salon for quite some time and decided to buy the UV light machine and supplies to do it myself. While the colors are nice, the price is good, and delivery was fast. I will have to try the OPI brand because this brand does not lasts the two weeks as the OPI did and was the one used on me at salon. That should last the two weeks. I do know the steps and fallow them. I must say, they do come out beautiful and look fantastic but they do not last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.  The base coat is thinner, quick application, pop under the light, then use a creative color, top coat flows nicely from the brush even with the necessary thicker consistency.  Lasted a long ol&#x27; time, but came off easily with acetone.  Don&#x27;t mix brands though; I used the gellish polish with it another time and it peeled right off.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these before, fast services. Great product- and th price is worth every penny. My friedns have asked me to order for them.</li>
