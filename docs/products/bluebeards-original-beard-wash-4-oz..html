            <li>Frankly after some more exploration it&#x27;s not the best thing out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is great, I loved it for a time, it&#x27;s just not for me anymore.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant scent of lime and magic.</li>
            <li>my husband grows out his beard for \\&quot;good luck\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Good beard soap smells just like lime.</li>
            <li>With that being said this product smells good like lemon lime, leaves face feeling</li>
            <li>This was a good size for trying it out.</li>
            <li>My fiance uses this on his trimmed beard to keep it looking and feeling good.</li>
            <li>Cleans your beard and smells good.  </li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>It smelled good.  </li>
            <li>but he actually really loved it.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good beard soap for a while.</li>
            <li>Smells great like a nice lime smell.</li>
            <li>Really good beard wash.</li>
            <li>Bluebeard&#x27;s Beard Wash is a good product that does as stated in reducing itchiness and softening your beard.</li>
            <li>Really good for cleaning your beard, which you should do like six million times a day.</li>
            <li>Good scent&lt;</li>
            <li>Good price, good value</li>
            <li>Bluebeards Original makes the best products on the market.</li>
            <li>Lathers and cleans nicely, and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a good friend of mine and he was very excited about it!</li>
            <li>This is the 4th pregnancy - 5th child, and all have been very healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Leaves my boyfriend&#x27;s beard smelling and feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was making a difference, but when I ran out of Bluebeard&#x27;s wash and was using face soap on my beard, the beard wasn&#x27;t looking so good.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just kind of odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>while it smells nice while working with it, there&#x27;s no lingering scent after it&#x27;s been rinsed.  </li>
            <li>The lime scent is a nice touch when used and it has a neutral odor once washed out.</li>
            <li>I started stealing it from my girlfriend, and nothing else has been as nice.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey for the size</li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this stuff and it softens his beard and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Honestly I am EXTEREMLY Satified with the CUSTOMER SERVICE, 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE...</li>
            <li>I am Very Satisfied in how they quickly respond back to any incidents, and do thier Very Best in making the best of the situation...</li>
            <li>This is a great product for people who have a problem cleaning the skin on their face and necks while maintaining a nice clean beard.</li>
            <li>If you just need to clean your beard this product is great.</li>
            <li>lime scent is very strong, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your face once is it rinsed</li>
            <li>I tried many beard washes and have found the one I like the most with Bluebeards!  </li>
            <li>It smells nice too :-)</li>
            <li>Sure, it smells nice.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and smells nice, but for me it wasn&#x27;t the miracle cure that it seemed to be for others.</li>
            <li>If you want a great looking and great feeling soft healthy beard, buy this stuff.</li>
            <li>There are so many cooler and amazing products to help keep your beard fresh and happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blond, so the hair is very fine.</li>
            <li>A nice herbal or spice scent would have been more appropriate in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Not the kind of stickers that peel off easily.  </li>
            <li>Everything worked out fantastically until about three weeks into it, when my wife informed me (lovingly) that my beard had a strong and noticeable &#x27;funk&#x27; to it.</li>
            <li>:)).</li>
            <li>Maybe works better on non gray texture beards.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, the smell mostly washes out during rinse, but you have to put up with the smell while washing.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes your beard feel softer and more together</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not horrible or anything.</li>
            <li>I must say I love the product, does everything I wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I bought this mostly as a joke for him</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love the way it makes the beard feel</li>
            <li>It mostly bothers me, itches, when I sleep on my side.</li>
            <li>Bluebeards was recommended to me by a  friend and I have passed it along to many others.  </li>
            <li>bit of advice - when using this, make sure you massage it in.</li>
            <li>It does a better job than shampoo and face soap.</li>
            <li>Bluebeards cleans, just as the description says, but nothing more.</li>
            <li>3/5 stars seems appropriate.</li>
            <li>bought for gift for son and son in law, they both love the stuff.</li>
            <li>Unlike the company&#x27;s beard balm, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This beard wash works OK, just OK.</li>
            <li>With this product it is better but still has a scent that I still wish would go away.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my beard so nice and soft and smell great..</li>
            <li>It cleans his beard and his face better than hair shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that his beard looked a bit more tamed.</li>
            <li>I love this beard wash.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for writing an honest review.</li>
            <li>I love beards, more specifically my boyfriends, but I love all beards.</li>
            <li>The Wash with conditioners works better and is easer to use.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>They make some interesting manufactured products.</li>
            <li>One of the better products out there.</li>
            <li>I appluad there Customer Service, That pays much more than a Product...</li>
            <li>I advice them to put a tape and seal the top</li>
            <li>Gets my beard nice and clean, with a pleasing lime scent.  </li>
            <li>It has turned my beard from a greasy smelly Brillo pad into a super sexy chick magnet!  </li>
            <li>Now my brother-in-law is growing his first \\&quot;good luck\\&quot; beard.</li>
            <li>The shampoo Smells great too and most of the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>Kept my 2&amp;#34; beard from becoming itchy and dandruffy.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not an offensive smell, lime tootsie roll is not what I&#x27;d consider an ideal scent for facial hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your beard really soft and it has a great citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need much to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>[I suspect] that combines with the essential oils, to clean the crud build-up and leave a nice feeling along with the great fragrance.</li>
            <li>Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Wash takes care of the rest with outstanding results.</li>
            <li>beard comes out very soft, very clean, and I feel it does a good job moisturizing the skin underneath.</li>
            <li>Very mild shampoo for the beard.  </li>
            <li>It feels really clean and seems to soften up the whiskers, making them more manageable.  </li>
            <li>This is great for getting all the facial oils out of the beard hair, and making it smell better.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel particularly clean; it didn&#x27;t help get the beard wax out any better.  </li>
            <li>My beard is softer and more clean than I could ever get it before.</li>
            <li>It lathers on well and washes away easily</li>
            <li>Its more controlled, smells good, and it even makes it soft (for a beard).</li>
            <li>There is a supposedly unscented version; I haven&#x27;t tried it, but if it&#x27;s unscented, I&#x27;d strongly recommen that over this.</li>
            <li>but I thought that the packaging was less than perfect.</li>
            <li>full beard and I still believe nothing has made it softer and more comfortable than using Dove Hair Therapy Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>&quot; (a cheap one was fine for me).</li>
            <li>This product has a light lime scent.</li>
            <li>This is a welcome alternative to using regular shampoo on my beard.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent that is reminiscent of Lemonheads candy.</li>
            <li>If you have a beard, this will be a product you&#x27;ll enjoy using.</li>
            <li>and I do not think the price is justified.  </li>
            <li>o freshly plundered booty on a smooth beard!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything a cheap shampoo won&#x27;t also do.</li>
            <li>The BEST beard wash ive used, and ive used a few.</li>
            <li>My hubby is on his way to MANY wins, and hopefully will be national soon, and he uses this product.</li>
            <li>He likes the smell and how it leaves his beard feel smooth.</li>
            <li>so I can really tell what kind of effect it has on my beard.</li>
            <li>Completely eliminated the flakes, smells good, and allows you to style the beard any way</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>My beard doesn&#x27;t itch and my face feels fresh and so very clean</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves my beard super soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product along with [[ASIN:B00158U5YC Bluebeards Original Beard Saver]] for a month now.  </li>
            <li>My bottle was leaking when I received it because the seal on the top of the bottle (under the cap) was coming off, and also the package that it was shipped in was pretty flimsy, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
            <li>This stuff works good, gives beard a deep clean and smells great, but my beard gets coarse after drying.</li>
            <li>oh so clean, any my face has cleared up using this product.</li>
            <li>Shampoo will clean the beard, but leaves residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>If you want to clean all the of the oil out if your beard, it will do that though.</li>
            <li>The sheen of my beard is more aided by conditioners, but this stuff did seem to have a positive effect.</li>
            <li>Keeps everything in check, soft, and (MY FAVORITE PART) reduces itch!</li>
            <li>And ifins ye fell inclined to be pleasing sum special wench in yer life</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t done anything special for the part of my neck that I shave once a week or so, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noticeable because well, it&#x27;s right beneath your nose!</li>
            <li>The product definitely smells great and for me it has been very gentle to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is pretty viscous, and foams up nicely, which really gives me the impression that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>that 3 -4 drops can take care of my full beard.  </li>
            <li>I had never used a beard wash after many years of having a beard and this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Cool logo and packaging.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>While the scent was nice, light, and refreshing it didn&#x27;t seem to clean or moisturize as well as other products.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and makes my beard very soft.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool~!</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean lime scent that washes out, the lather is super rich and you literally only have to use a quarter size amount (4 inch amish beard).  </li>
            <li>If you have a seriously itchy beard it might be a dermatology problem and this might not be the best solution.</li>
            <li>(As a side note - I am currently pregnant, and every pregnancy -</li>
            <li>smells like limes :) although i did not find it that better than using a regular hair conditioner</li>
            <li>But it dissipates just as quickly once you rinse it out leaving you feeling fresh and clean with no residual smell.</li>
            <li>Honestly, though, for $20 I expected more.</li>
            <li>So read a bunch of reviews before buying this and was super stoked when it got here.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>but I have to say that for me I did not find it any better at softening my beard then normal Suave Naturals.</li>
            <li>Use it daily during beard season (November thru April here in Texas) and keeps my beard clean and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>She sort of laughed at first, but being a terrific wife, she bought it for me for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much better it is than shampoo or gentle soap, but it smells great.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it was the first time I used a product specially designed for beards, so I have nothing to compare it too besides shampoo or face soap.</li>
            <li>Give your face a good hard scratch/massage while applying this, and make sure you rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a light citrusy smell that is very addicting.  </li>
            <li>It has a light lemon smell too, though I can see why some people thought that it smells too much like cleaning chemicals.</li>
            <li>This wash is worth the money, and it does everything it claims.</li>
            <li>Leaves a great smell and combined with occasional conditioning keeps the beard soft.  </li>
            <li>I just did not find it to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Smells good but not very soapy or sudsy.</li>
            <li>Now a few days in, I can honestly say my beard has more shine an luster.  </li>
            <li>It does just as it states, and is WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li>I actually find the scent to be quite nice.</li>
            <li>Worth it?</li>
            <li>Bluebeards original beard wash with extra conditioning is the better way to go.  </li>
            <li>And results are pretty quick.</li>
            <li>and this is the only one that does what I want it to do:  get rid of ingrown hairs, really clean out mustache wax at the end of the day and all with a smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is gentle and leaves his beard smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The price is a big steep and though it does a good job I am not completely convinced that it is any better than the Neutrogena Men Razor Defense Face Scrub which I had been using before.</li>
            <li>Wish they hadn&#x27;t put the stickers right over the label so you couldn&#x27;t even read the description/name of the product.</li>
            <li>it works but it only feels really amazing for like the first 30 mins to and hour after using it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fully remove the Koru Beard Gloss in the rest of my beard very well either, and that product is pretty light.</li>
            <li>My beard feels clean and I have much reduced itching.</li>
            <li>than that it&#x27;s a great product, it&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li>Took a lot of product to work my full beard, and even then it didn&#x27;t build into much of a lather.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require much (even with my full beard)</li>
            <li>Funny thing is, there are no other beard washes available!</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great and necessary product for men with beards.</li>
            <li>It has totally transformed his beard and he is having more fun growing it out.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice, but might be better for someone with less sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Beard feels so clean after using this stuff, highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I never could get a good lather with the soap unless I used a bunch, which I was hesitant to do because this product is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li>My beard has been growing since January, and it&#x27;s never been itchy or funny smelling (I smoke :| ).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they offer a different size now.</li>
            <li>Buy the Beard Saver cream as this product really works and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I could see and feel a difference in my man beard after the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has been the prefect answer to keeping my beard free of flakes and itching.</li>
            <li>It was pretty</li>
            <li>;-).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for men that will actually use it :)</li>
            <li>After the first use my beard is already softer and feels cleaner.</li>
            <li>We have looked for similar items and just can&#x27;t find anything that does the job that Bluebeards does. :)</li>
            <li>Although pretty pricey, I got the beard saver.</li>
            <li>After getting out of the shower, my beard feels very soft, clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my husband&#x27;s beard lie down and behave, even though he has naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It has totally taken care of the dry skin, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing while you&#x27;re washing your beard, and after a single wash it made it super soft.</li>
            <li>Great beard wash, I use it mainly for a small neck beard, sideburns, and mustache.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks, and other than the nice lime aroma, I have not noticed a softer, cleaner beard.</li>
            <li>It keeps my beard clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I tried nearly everything I could think of to clean it - shampoo, soaps, skin cleansers, I tried it all, and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Bluebeard&#x27;s Wash is good with sensitive skin and has done wonders helping me with my lifelong fight with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I got it for him as a Christmas present and seeing him light up was worth it.</li>
            <li>Initially I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the scent, but it really grew on me and now I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as he has a beard.  </li>
            <li>This wash did the trick, you only need a really small amount of it as it lathers well and keeps my beard nice and smooth and also smells fresh!</li>
            <li>Good thing too, as the bottle is small and the price a bit steep.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent, leaves my husband&#x27;s bead very soft</li>
            <li>I want something that cleans, shines, makes my beard soft and smell good, and help lay the strays down so that my beard isn&#x27;t so frizzled and untamed.</li>
            <li>I guess it would be fine for someone who doesn&#x27;t use any products in his facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any man who had a beard that&#x27;s an inch or more long.</li>
            <li>, I want some of that!!&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m in the shower getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li>And it has been very manageable too.  </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much of a beard, but it didn&#x27;t soften my beard like I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li>Using this once a day takes care of any itch or flakes and keeps the beard fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey for the amount but one bottle lasts a while if you don&#x27;t use too much at a time.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by this product and had to order it and find out for myself if it really worked.  </li>
            <li>I also never noticed much of a change in my beard softness after using this wash.</li>
            <li>so it really lasts.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t really do anything that soap doesn&#x27;t already do.</li>
            <li>I have a very scraggly beard.</li>
            <li>I was about ready to give up and shave until I found this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>either haha.</li>
            <li>Softens the beard hair but not quite as much as the conditioning version of this product.</li>
            <li>Not so much anymore.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband for Christmas, and was very dissapointed in the size of the container.  </li>
            <li>Really, it smells like lime Lifesavers</li>
            <li>The product works really well, but my girlfriend says it smells like Pine Sol.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to use much product each time.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, unless a container larger than 4 oz. is available.</li>
            <li>Honestly get the same results from a basic baby shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is much more soft and the shampoo actually moisturizes my skin underneath.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is quite nice, not some heavy lingering smell, but a citrusy type that rinses out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the smell of the wash, when I first got it, it had a strong lime scent that was a little out of the ordinary, but also kind of fun.</li>
            <li>I found this product originally through a YouTube review because I was growing some facial hair and found that my beard had dandruff.  </li>
            <li>This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased of, Bluebeards Original Beard Wash, for my husband.</li>
            <li>In only a couple of days of using Bluebeards Original Beard Wash.  It has conditioned and softened my beard.</li>
            <li>I would say the beard saver is what has made the difference as I have noticed a significant improvement in my medium length beard I have had for over ten years.  </li>
            <li>I wish there was a little more quantity for the price because it seams like its just repacked condition at a higher price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any other wash of it</li>
            <li>, my beard actually becomes squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li>It has a great fresh fragrance, you only need a little bit to wash your beard, and it leaves your beard feeling softer than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad per say, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy it again.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>here wee bottle be enough potent tonic to cure ye of any tangles and dryness for an entire voyage.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but it also doesn&#x27;t clean my beard and moustache very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell, but it&#x27;s a little strong at first.</li>
            <li>It may seem high priced</li>
            <li>It is not required to use it every day so the cost is not too high</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It works wonders when he actually uses it consistently!  </li>
            <li>The boyfriend is enjoying both of the products, although the beard saver does smell a little like pine sol.</li>
            <li>its not really an all day silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found is that my beard is much softer within the first couple of hours of washing, but by the end of the day it&#x27;s back on the prickly side.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does take repeated use for more than a few days, but you will be well-rewarded for your efforts.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, but I will try a few others to compare.</li>
            <li>It noticeably softened my beard (which is ~1inch long) and is a full beard, not a goatee.  </li>
            <li>last a fairly long time if used sparingly and appropriately.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that I live overseas, and have to wait for it to clear customs, so I would love it if it was offered in a larger size to save time/shipping costs.</li>
            <li>Furthermore $14 seems like a pretty high price for what is essentially a 4 oz. facewash.</li>
            <li>I think I found a new stable product that will sit in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Found the Bluebeard product, and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I often take a break from using them when I&#x27;m going to try a new product</li>
            <li>Using that before the beard is full dry produces a soft result that lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure it sounds like a joke but using a small grain sandpaper when you have</li>
            <li>This stuff is the first thing I&#x27;ve washed my beard with that actually minimizes beard dandruff and itchiness.</li>
            <li>so it wont come off or break  the seal or be tampered with, they took that advice and is willing to send the Third Product...</li>
            <li>It works very well, and along with vigorous brushing and drying my beard after washing/swimming my head is looking luxurious with no dry skin or itchiness.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used normal shampoo on my face, tea tree oil, and several brands of dandruff shampoo, none of which really did the trick.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it does not foam up as much as regular shampoo, but it seems to penetrate down to the skin, then rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I got the title a little mixed up with my pirates.</li>
            <li>Great product, but just too expensive to use regularly.</li>
            <li>Since the ingredients are natural it smells like limes instead of flowers like my wife&#x27;s shampoo (which is what is was using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the bottle had fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>This item is part of a gift for my husband, and I&#x27;m completely bummed because it looks so crappy.  </li>
            <li>Not a fan of the smell directly under my nose.  </li>
            <li>There are microdermibraision pads that do the same thing but cost 10 times as much, so be a man and go with the sandpaper route.</li>
            <li>He likes that it keeps his beard soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and Bluebeards</li>
            <li>a side note, another poster had complained of the overwhelming smell</li>
            <li>Works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t make my beard poof out like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping however that it would be softer, however I don&#x27;t know how soft a beard can be.  </li>
            <li>So far his beard does feel softer after just a week or so of use.</li>
            <li>Leaves your beard soft and if you use a blow dryer on low and comb your beard will be straight and soft like the hair on your head.</li>
            <li>Smells weird, but good.</li>
            <li>Also, when I bought my first bottle, I was washing my beard too often, so my skin began to dry out.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I spent the first 36 years of my life facial hair free, but recently have decided that my inner manliness needed to express itself, and thus I grew a beard.</li>
            <li>My wife is always saying she does not mind my long beard, as long as I keep it clean, so I gave Bluebeards a try.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it seems expensive, but it&#x27;s super concentrated, so only a small amount is needed to make a nice full lather on the beard.</li>
            <li>Great that the wash isn&#x27;t animal tested, but it doesn&#x27;t hardly lather, and the aroma only last until my beard is dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently grown a full beard, but I have had a goatee for over ten years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any long-term effects, although to be fair, I only use it a few times a week when I have a little extra time in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will definitely be ordering another bottle or two when this one is finished!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all made by normal people, not bigger companies like this.</li>
            <li>it dosent dry my skin and leaves my beard smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with a medium to large beard.</li>
            <li>scruff can sand down the ends of course hair that your significant other hates so much.</li>
            <li>Not only did this beard shampoo totally dry out the skin under my beard, but it also agitated my skin and made it super red and sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have a classic style full beard and this product was a lifesaver when it came to taming the ITCH so common with beard growth.</li>
            <li>, the second one had the same problem again they sent me the second one right away and treated me with Respect and Kindness...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Bluebeards Original Beard Wash for about a week and a half and the results are obvious:</li>
            <li>My husband enjoys this wash, and now using only this brand, he has occasional skin sensitivity so it is very gemtle on his face.</li>
            <li>I usually have a very itchy, irritated face when I let my beard grow but this has certainly curbed that feeling almost completely.</li>
            <li>And now i will write some more words because the review system is dumb.</li>
            <li>but it requires very little to keep the beard clean per use.  </li>
            <li>If anything, it made it feel more dried out and less soft.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but worth it if you want to maintain your beard and keep it from feeling too scruffy.</li>
            <li>The dry skin goes away completely, and his beard feels so soft!</li>
            <li>Washes great, but smells bad.  </li>
            <li>It cleaned my beard and left it soft.</li>
            <li>It has a very faint and very pleasant citrus odor to it, and it has a slight tingle on the skin while applying.</li>
            <li>It feels better and less harsh on the face than shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li>This was my 2nd bottle of Bluebeards; the 1st one actually lasted me nearly 2 years!</li>
            <li>the flip side, it hasn&#x27;t really made my beard as soft as other users, but I&#x27;m willing to sit tight and use the entire bottle to figure out if it will make my beard softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Granted, this might be a particular association for me, and my beard never smells like wet dog or anything after I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li>After using this product for a couple of weeks I find my beard much less irritated straight.</li>
            <li>Within a day, my dry skin stopped, which completely justifies the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still worth a try, but not sure if a second bottle will find it&#x27;s way to my beard.</li>
            <li>Bad maybe be overstating it, but it definitely does NOT smell good.  </li>

            <li> Leaves my boyfriend&#x27;s beard smelling and feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was making a difference, but when I ran out of Bluebeard&#x27;s wash and was using face soap on my beard, the beard wasn&#x27;t looking so good.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just kind of odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> while it smells nice while working with it, there&#x27;s no lingering scent after it&#x27;s been rinsed.  </li>
            <li> The lime scent is a nice touch when used and it has a neutral odor once washed out.</li>
            <li> I started stealing it from my girlfriend, and nothing else has been as nice.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey for the size</li>
            <li> &#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff and it softens his beard and has a nice scent.</li>

            <li> I am Very Satisfied in how they quickly respond back to any incidents, and do thier Very Best in making the best of the situation...</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who have a problem cleaning the skin on their face and necks while maintaining a nice clean beard.</li>
            <li> If you just need to clean your beard this product is great.</li>
            <li> lime scent is very strong, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your face once is it rinsed</li>
            <li> I tried many beard washes and have found the one I like the most with Bluebeards!  </li>
            <li> It smells nice too :-)</li>
            <li> Sure, it smells nice.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and smells nice, but for me it wasn&#x27;t the miracle cure that it seemed to be for others.</li>
            <li> If you want a great looking and great feeling soft healthy beard, buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> There are so many cooler and amazing products to help keep your beard fresh and happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blond, so the hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> A nice herbal or spice scent would have been more appropriate in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not the kind of stickers that peel off easily.  </li>
            <li> Everything worked out fantastically until about three weeks into it, when my wife informed me (lovingly) that my beard had a strong and noticeable &#x27;funk&#x27; to it.</li>
            <li> :)).</li>
            <li> Maybe works better on non gray texture beards.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, the smell mostly washes out during rinse, but you have to put up with the smell while washing.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes your beard feel softer and more together</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not horrible or anything.</li>
            <li> I must say I love the product, does everything I wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly as a joke for him</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love the way it makes the beard feel</li>
            <li> It mostly bothers me, itches, when I sleep on my side.</li>
            <li> Bluebeards was recommended to me by a  friend and I have passed it along to many others.  </li>
            <li> bit of advice - when using this, make sure you massage it in.</li>
            <li> It does a better job than shampoo and face soap.</li>
            <li> Bluebeards cleans, just as the description says, but nothing more.</li>
            <li> 3/5 stars seems appropriate.</li>
            <li> bought for gift for son and son in law, they both love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Unlike the company&#x27;s beard balm, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This beard wash works OK, just OK.</li>
            <li> With this product it is better but still has a scent that I still wish would go away.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my beard so nice and soft and smell great..</li>
            <li> It cleans his beard and his face better than hair shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that his beard looked a bit more tamed.</li>
            <li> I love this beard wash.  </li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for writing an honest review.</li>
            <li> I love beards, more specifically my boyfriends, but I love all beards.</li>
            <li> The Wash with conditioners works better and is easer to use.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> They make some interesting manufactured products.</li>
            <li> One of the better products out there.</li>
            <li> I appluad there Customer Service, That pays much more than a Product...</li>
            <li> I advice them to put a tape and seal the top</li>
            <li> Gets my beard nice and clean, with a pleasing lime scent.  </li>
            <li> It has turned my beard from a greasy smelly Brillo pad into a super sexy chick magnet!  </li>
            <li> Now my brother-in-law is growing his first \\&quot;good luck\\&quot; beard.</li>
            <li> The shampoo Smells great too and most of the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> Kept my 2&amp;#34; beard from becoming itchy and dandruffy.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not an offensive smell, lime tootsie roll is not what I&#x27;d consider an ideal scent for facial hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your beard really soft and it has a great citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need much to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> [I suspect] that combines with the essential oils, to clean the crud build-up and leave a nice feeling along with the great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Wash takes care of the rest with outstanding results.</li>
            <li> beard comes out very soft, very clean, and I feel it does a good job moisturizing the skin underneath.</li>
            <li> Very mild shampoo for the beard.  </li>
            <li> It feels really clean and seems to soften up the whiskers, making them more manageable.  </li>
            <li> This is great for getting all the facial oils out of the beard hair, and making it smell better.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel particularly clean; it didn&#x27;t help get the beard wax out any better.  </li>
            <li> My beard is softer and more clean than I could ever get it before.</li>
            <li> It lathers on well and washes away easily</li>
            <li> Its more controlled, smells good, and it even makes it soft (for a beard).</li>
            <li> There is a supposedly unscented version; I haven&#x27;t tried it, but if it&#x27;s unscented, I&#x27;d strongly recommen that over this.</li>
            <li> but I thought that the packaging was less than perfect.</li>
            <li> full beard and I still believe nothing has made it softer and more comfortable than using Dove Hair Therapy Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> &quot; (a cheap one was fine for me).</li>
            <li> This product has a light lime scent.</li>
            <li> This is a welcome alternative to using regular shampoo on my beard.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent that is reminiscent of Lemonheads candy.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard, this will be a product you&#x27;ll enjoy using.</li>
            <li> and I do not think the price is justified.  </li>
            <li> o freshly plundered booty on a smooth beard!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything a cheap shampoo won&#x27;t also do.</li>
            <li> The BEST beard wash ive used, and ive used a few.</li>
            <li> My hubby is on his way to MANY wins, and hopefully will be national soon, and he uses this product.</li>
            <li> He likes the smell and how it leaves his beard feel smooth.</li>
            <li> so I can really tell what kind of effect it has on my beard.</li>
            <li> Completely eliminated the flakes, smells good, and allows you to style the beard any way</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> My beard doesn&#x27;t itch and my face feels fresh and so very clean</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my beard super soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with [[ASIN:B00158U5YC Bluebeards Original Beard Saver]] for a month now.  </li>
            <li> My bottle was leaking when I received it because the seal on the top of the bottle (under the cap) was coming off, and also the package that it was shipped in was pretty flimsy, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
            <li> This stuff works good, gives beard a deep clean and smells great, but my beard gets coarse after drying.</li>
            <li> oh so clean, any my face has cleared up using this product.</li>
            <li> Shampoo will clean the beard, but leaves residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> If you want to clean all the of the oil out if your beard, it will do that though.</li>
            <li> The sheen of my beard is more aided by conditioners, but this stuff did seem to have a positive effect.</li>
            <li> Keeps everything in check, soft, and (MY FAVORITE PART) reduces itch!</li>
            <li> And ifins ye fell inclined to be pleasing sum special wench in yer life</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything special for the part of my neck that I shave once a week or so, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noticeable because well, it&#x27;s right beneath your nose!</li>
            <li> The product definitely smells great and for me it has been very gentle to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is pretty viscous, and foams up nicely, which really gives me the impression that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> that 3 -4 drops can take care of my full beard.  </li>
            <li> I had never used a beard wash after many years of having a beard and this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Cool logo and packaging.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> While the scent was nice, light, and refreshing it didn&#x27;t seem to clean or moisturize as well as other products.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and makes my beard very soft.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool~!</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean lime scent that washes out, the lather is super rich and you literally only have to use a quarter size amount (4 inch amish beard).  </li>
            <li> If you have a seriously itchy beard it might be a dermatology problem and this might not be the best solution.</li>
            <li> (As a side note - I am currently pregnant, and every pregnancy -</li>
            <li> smells like limes :) although i did not find it that better than using a regular hair conditioner</li>
            <li> But it dissipates just as quickly once you rinse it out leaving you feeling fresh and clean with no residual smell.</li>
            <li> Honestly, though, for $20 I expected more.</li>
            <li> So read a bunch of reviews before buying this and was super stoked when it got here.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> but I have to say that for me I did not find it any better at softening my beard then normal Suave Naturals.</li>
            <li> Use it daily during beard season (November thru April here in Texas) and keeps my beard clean and smelling nice.  </li>
            <li> She sort of laughed at first, but being a terrific wife, she bought it for me for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much better it is than shampoo or gentle soap, but it smells great.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it was the first time I used a product specially designed for beards, so I have nothing to compare it too besides shampoo or face soap.</li>
            <li> Give your face a good hard scratch/massage while applying this, and make sure you rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a light citrusy smell that is very addicting.  </li>
            <li> It has a light lemon smell too, though I can see why some people thought that it smells too much like cleaning chemicals.</li>
            <li> This wash is worth the money, and it does everything it claims.</li>
            <li> Leaves a great smell and combined with occasional conditioning keeps the beard soft.  </li>
            <li> I just did not find it to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not very soapy or sudsy.</li>
            <li> Now a few days in, I can honestly say my beard has more shine an luster.  </li>
            <li> It does just as it states, and is WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> I actually find the scent to be quite nice.</li>
            <li> Worth it?</li>
            <li> Bluebeards original beard wash with extra conditioning is the better way to go.  </li>
            <li> And results are pretty quick.</li>
            <li> and this is the only one that does what I want it to do:  get rid of ingrown hairs, really clean out mustache wax at the end of the day and all with a smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is gentle and leaves his beard smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The price is a big steep and though it does a good job I am not completely convinced that it is any better than the Neutrogena Men Razor Defense Face Scrub which I had been using before.</li>
            <li> Wish they hadn&#x27;t put the stickers right over the label so you couldn&#x27;t even read the description/name of the product.</li>
            <li> it works but it only feels really amazing for like the first 30 mins to and hour after using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fully remove the Koru Beard Gloss in the rest of my beard very well either, and that product is pretty light.</li>
            <li> My beard feels clean and I have much reduced itching.</li>
            <li> than that it&#x27;s a great product, it&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li> Took a lot of product to work my full beard, and even then it didn&#x27;t build into much of a lather.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require much (even with my full beard)</li>
            <li> Funny thing is, there are no other beard washes available!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great and necessary product for men with beards.</li>
            <li> It has totally transformed his beard and he is having more fun growing it out.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice, but might be better for someone with less sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Beard feels so clean after using this stuff, highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I never could get a good lather with the soap unless I used a bunch, which I was hesitant to do because this product is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> My beard has been growing since January, and it&#x27;s never been itchy or funny smelling (I smoke :| ).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they offer a different size now.</li>
            <li> Buy the Beard Saver cream as this product really works and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I could see and feel a difference in my man beard after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has been the prefect answer to keeping my beard free of flakes and itching.</li>
            <li> It was pretty</li>
            <li> ;-).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for men that will actually use it :)</li>
            <li> After the first use my beard is already softer and feels cleaner.</li>
            <li> We have looked for similar items and just can&#x27;t find anything that does the job that Bluebeards does. :)</li>
            <li> Although pretty pricey, I got the beard saver.</li>
            <li> After getting out of the shower, my beard feels very soft, clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my husband&#x27;s beard lie down and behave, even though he has naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It has totally taken care of the dry skin, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing while you&#x27;re washing your beard, and after a single wash it made it super soft.</li>
            <li> Great beard wash, I use it mainly for a small neck beard, sideburns, and mustache.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks, and other than the nice lime aroma, I have not noticed a softer, cleaner beard.</li>
            <li> It keeps my beard clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I tried nearly everything I could think of to clean it - shampoo, soaps, skin cleansers, I tried it all, and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Bluebeard&#x27;s Wash is good with sensitive skin and has done wonders helping me with my lifelong fight with ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I got it for him as a Christmas present and seeing him light up was worth it.</li>
            <li> Initially I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the scent, but it really grew on me and now I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as he has a beard.  </li>
            <li> This wash did the trick, you only need a really small amount of it as it lathers well and keeps my beard nice and smooth and also smells fresh!</li>
            <li> Good thing too, as the bottle is small and the price a bit steep.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, leaves my husband&#x27;s bead very soft</li>
            <li> I want something that cleans, shines, makes my beard soft and smell good, and help lay the strays down so that my beard isn&#x27;t so frizzled and untamed.</li>
            <li> I guess it would be fine for someone who doesn&#x27;t use any products in his facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any man who had a beard that&#x27;s an inch or more long.</li>
            <li> , I want some of that!!&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m in the shower getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li> And it has been very manageable too.  </li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much of a beard, but it didn&#x27;t soften my beard like I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> Using this once a day takes care of any itch or flakes and keeps the beard fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey for the amount but one bottle lasts a while if you don&#x27;t use too much at a time.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this product and had to order it and find out for myself if it really worked.  </li>
            <li> I also never noticed much of a change in my beard softness after using this wash.</li>
            <li> so it really lasts.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t really do anything that soap doesn&#x27;t already do.</li>
            <li> I have a very scraggly beard.</li>
            <li> I was about ready to give up and shave until I found this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> either haha.</li>
            <li> Softens the beard hair but not quite as much as the conditioning version of this product.</li>
            <li> Not so much anymore.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband for Christmas, and was very dissapointed in the size of the container.  </li>
            <li> Really, it smells like lime Lifesavers</li>
            <li> The product works really well, but my girlfriend says it smells like Pine Sol.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to use much product each time.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, unless a container larger than 4 oz. is available.</li>
            <li> Honestly get the same results from a basic baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is much more soft and the shampoo actually moisturizes my skin underneath.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is quite nice, not some heavy lingering smell, but a citrusy type that rinses out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the smell of the wash, when I first got it, it had a strong lime scent that was a little out of the ordinary, but also kind of fun.</li>
            <li> I found this product originally through a YouTube review because I was growing some facial hair and found that my beard had dandruff.  </li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased of, Bluebeards Original Beard Wash, for my husband.</li>
            <li> In only a couple of days of using Bluebeards Original Beard Wash.  It has conditioned and softened my beard.</li>
            <li> I would say the beard saver is what has made the difference as I have noticed a significant improvement in my medium length beard I have had for over ten years.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was a little more quantity for the price because it seams like its just repacked condition at a higher price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any other wash of it</li>
            <li> , my beard actually becomes squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li> It has a great fresh fragrance, you only need a little bit to wash your beard, and it leaves your beard feeling softer than regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad per say, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> here wee bottle be enough potent tonic to cure ye of any tangles and dryness for an entire voyage.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but it also doesn&#x27;t clean my beard and moustache very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell, but it&#x27;s a little strong at first.</li>
            <li> It may seem high priced</li>
            <li> It is not required to use it every day so the cost is not too high</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works wonders when he actually uses it consistently!  </li>
            <li> The boyfriend is enjoying both of the products, although the beard saver does smell a little like pine sol.</li>
            <li> its not really an all day silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found is that my beard is much softer within the first couple of hours of washing, but by the end of the day it&#x27;s back on the prickly side.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does take repeated use for more than a few days, but you will be well-rewarded for your efforts.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, but I will try a few others to compare.</li>
            <li> It noticeably softened my beard (which is ~1inch long) and is a full beard, not a goatee.  </li>
            <li> last a fairly long time if used sparingly and appropriately.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that I live overseas, and have to wait for it to clear customs, so I would love it if it was offered in a larger size to save time/shipping costs.</li>
            <li> Furthermore $14 seems like a pretty high price for what is essentially a 4 oz. facewash.</li>
            <li> I think I found a new stable product that will sit in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Found the Bluebeard product, and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I often take a break from using them when I&#x27;m going to try a new product</li>
            <li> Using that before the beard is full dry produces a soft result that lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure it sounds like a joke but using a small grain sandpaper when you have</li>
            <li> This stuff is the first thing I&#x27;ve washed my beard with that actually minimizes beard dandruff and itchiness.</li>
            <li> so it wont come off or break  the seal or be tampered with, they took that advice and is willing to send the Third Product...</li>
            <li> It works very well, and along with vigorous brushing and drying my beard after washing/swimming my head is looking luxurious with no dry skin or itchiness.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used normal shampoo on my face, tea tree oil, and several brands of dandruff shampoo, none of which really did the trick.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it does not foam up as much as regular shampoo, but it seems to penetrate down to the skin, then rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I got the title a little mixed up with my pirates.</li>
            <li> Great product, but just too expensive to use regularly.</li>
            <li> Since the ingredients are natural it smells like limes instead of flowers like my wife&#x27;s shampoo (which is what is was using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the bottle had fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> This item is part of a gift for my husband, and I&#x27;m completely bummed because it looks so crappy.  </li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell directly under my nose.  </li>
            <li> There are microdermibraision pads that do the same thing but cost 10 times as much, so be a man and go with the sandpaper route.</li>
            <li> He likes that it keeps his beard soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and Bluebeards</li>
            <li> a side note, another poster had complained of the overwhelming smell</li>
            <li> Works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t make my beard poof out like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping however that it would be softer, however I don&#x27;t know how soft a beard can be.  </li>
            <li> So far his beard does feel softer after just a week or so of use.</li>
            <li> Leaves your beard soft and if you use a blow dryer on low and comb your beard will be straight and soft like the hair on your head.</li>
            <li> Smells weird, but good.</li>
            <li> Also, when I bought my first bottle, I was washing my beard too often, so my skin began to dry out.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I spent the first 36 years of my life facial hair free, but recently have decided that my inner manliness needed to express itself, and thus I grew a beard.</li>
            <li> My wife is always saying she does not mind my long beard, as long as I keep it clean, so I gave Bluebeards a try.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it seems expensive, but it&#x27;s super concentrated, so only a small amount is needed to make a nice full lather on the beard.</li>
            <li> Great that the wash isn&#x27;t animal tested, but it doesn&#x27;t hardly lather, and the aroma only last until my beard is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently grown a full beard, but I have had a goatee for over ten years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any long-term effects, although to be fair, I only use it a few times a week when I have a little extra time in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will definitely be ordering another bottle or two when this one is finished!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all made by normal people, not bigger companies like this.</li>
            <li> it dosent dry my skin and leaves my beard smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with a medium to large beard.</li>
            <li> scruff can sand down the ends of course hair that your significant other hates so much.</li>
            <li> Not only did this beard shampoo totally dry out the skin under my beard, but it also agitated my skin and made it super red and sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have a classic style full beard and this product was a lifesaver when it came to taming the ITCH so common with beard growth.</li>
            <li> , the second one had the same problem again they sent me the second one right away and treated me with Respect and Kindness...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Bluebeards Original Beard Wash for about a week and a half and the results are obvious:</li>
            <li> My husband enjoys this wash, and now using only this brand, he has occasional skin sensitivity so it is very gemtle on his face.</li>
            <li> I usually have a very itchy, irritated face when I let my beard grow but this has certainly curbed that feeling almost completely.</li>
            <li> And now i will write some more words because the review system is dumb.</li>
            <li> but it requires very little to keep the beard clean per use.  </li>
            <li> If anything, it made it feel more dried out and less soft.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but worth it if you want to maintain your beard and keep it from feeling too scruffy.</li>
            <li> The dry skin goes away completely, and his beard feels so soft!</li>
            <li> Washes great, but smells bad.  </li>
            <li> It cleaned my beard and left it soft.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint and very pleasant citrus odor to it, and it has a slight tingle on the skin while applying.</li>
            <li> It feels better and less harsh on the face than shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd bottle of Bluebeards; the 1st one actually lasted me nearly 2 years!</li>
            <li> the flip side, it hasn&#x27;t really made my beard as soft as other users, but I&#x27;m willing to sit tight and use the entire bottle to figure out if it will make my beard softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, this might be a particular association for me, and my beard never smells like wet dog or anything after I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of weeks I find my beard much less irritated straight.</li>
            <li> Within a day, my dry skin stopped, which completely justifies the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still worth a try, but not sure if a second bottle will find it&#x27;s way to my beard.</li>
            <li> Bad maybe be overstating it, but it definitely does NOT smell good.  </li>
            <li> My beard before would get kind of a stale wet smell to it, and this product eliminated that, but it didn&#x27;t make it smell &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; after my shower.</li>
            <li> Much softer and much less dry skin now that I am using it regularly.</li>
            <li> As other users have mentioned after drying their isn&#x27;t much of a scent, but that&#x27;s not really an issue in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the price for such a small bottle, but then again you don&#x27;t need that much compared to what you use for your hair...</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the bottle is small, it should last a long time because it only takes a few drops to generate a rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard or goatee for the last 19 years, and have always had to deal with dry skin, coarse beard hair and beard dander.  </li>
            <li> The only thin i would change about this prodcut is the size of the bottle, make a super size.</li>
            <li> I keep my beard short, so I only use this once or twice a week, but it keeps the dead skin from accumulating, keeps the beard soft, even though I trim often, and I dig the scent.</li>
            <li> He loves the scent, but also likes that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> They all left my face still itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> The wash is almost too thick to properly make it out of the bottle, you have to really squeeze to get it through the lid or take the lid off entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps all skin is not made the same and that is why mine was affected so differently from the other reviewers&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this shampoo I would have cut my beard long ago.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned the smell is a bit chemically but it does not linger to long after you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I use a conditioner afterward anyway, so it doesn&#x27;t smell that way for long.</li>
            <li> I use moustache wax and even after I break the wax down with oil, the beard wash barely touches it.</li>
            <li> Basically, I&#x27;ve been using the product daily, typically the last part of my shower.</li>
            <li> I did have a situation in that my bottle had a broken seal, and they sent me another one right away</li>
            <li> While I believe this small bottle will last a while, I&#x27;ll probably buy the bigger bottle next time.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t come in the same bottle as the picture, which I was hoping for (or I would have chosen the other item).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for only giving it 3 stars is, that after 2 months of use (one month of use everyday, and the last month only every other day) i haven&#x27;t found that my beard got any softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for a number of years but always taken for granted the dry skin it produces.</li>
            <li> It has basically eliminated any itch involved with having a beard, even now during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Bar soap made my skin dry and shampoo made my skin oily.</li>
            <li> While face wash cleans the skin on your face, but leaves the beard itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> My beard is softer and smoother and I no longer have the dry skin beneath the beard.  </li>
            <li> He used to get ingrown hairs and dry, flaky skin under his beard-</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star rating because it made my beard feel kinda dry.</li>
            <li> For the longest time, I have dealt with dry skin and an itchy beard.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re having issues with dry skin and your beard, try this product out.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with dry skin under my beard.</li>
            <li> Thank you my husbands beard looks shiny, feels soft &amp; no more frizz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few other shampoos and so far nothing has even come close to this stuff.</li>
            <li> The lime scent makes you feel like a pirate in the shower, which is cool and weird.</li>
            <li> From my boyfriend: \\&quot;Doesn&#x27;t dry out my face but cleans out my beard!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend previously and this is our second purchase.</li>
            <li> There are a small number of products on the market, most hard to find and with claims difficult to substantiate, to solve a common beard problem - the simple sequence of washing hair first and</li>
            <li> Once I started growing a full beard, the itching was very irritating, so I told my wife I would like to try Bluebeards.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard very dry and tangled.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size, 4 oz does not last long for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these little bottles will last you a while.</li>
            <li> It does seem to sink into the skin a little, so I&#x27;d recommend a boar bristle brush deep in the beard to pull the oils through the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it can simply be due to dry skin, so try some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the size of the bottle - I wish there was an option to buy a larger amount.</li>
            <li> The effect is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Even after conditioning it still feels rough.</li>
            <li> Up until a few weeks ago, my regimen consisted of using Selsin Blue &amp; my wife&#x27;s conditioner, which sort of worked, but then required post shower moisturizer, which usually lead to multiple moisturizer applications before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluebeards has solved that for me.</li>
            <li> Having unkempt, scraggly facial hair typically looks awful, so having some kind of beard wash is crucial.</li>
            <li> They left a sticky residue and even with scraping, half the sticker is still on it, impossible to get off cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Unless they change the size and lower the price i&#x27;m afraid it was my first and last bottle of beard wash.</li>
            <li> one day, my beard started to itch, and my black shirt was covered with dry flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does what it says it does, however I found that a lot of the reviews saying that it helped with dry skin under the beard were simply not true.</li>
            <li> Since then I found and began using this product daily in small quantity.</li>
            <li> Bluebeard was a French serial killer in a fairy tale (murdered a parade of wives) and a book by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying the other Bluebeards products.</li>
            <li> Lasted 2-3 months with a beard washing every other day.</li>
            <li> I would like to try their other products.</li>
            <li> other con is the bottle is problematic.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that this would be easier on my skin than other products, but when washing with this I could practically feel it sucking the moisture out of my face.</li>
            <li> I had a kind of eureka moment a few weeks ago that it was annoying and that there may be solutions.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for how much you get.</li>
            <li> Faint lemon smell, doesn&#x27;t make much suds</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I can say the slight dandruff problem I&#x27;ve had has gone away.</li>
            <li> I figured a beard wash might soften that hair and make that less of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering the Suave costs me less than a 1.50$</li>
            <li> black beard ye&#x27;ll be wonting a dab</li>
            <li> This stuff is ten times as expensive as every other product I use, and it is such a small amount.</li>
            <li> Over time, the scent has faded and, to me, smells a little bit like dog shampoo.</li>
            <li> it seems to serve a little bit of its purpose for me-</li>
            <li> He likes the beard saver a lot for softening and conditioning, but this wash was a little drying.</li>
            <li> A very, very small amount goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> Likewise, the bottles are made of a somewhat odd and inflexible plastic, making it somewhat difficult to squeeze out the right amount every time.</li>
            <li> This is not a perfect product because you may still need some beard conditioner to make your beard soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, maybe once or twice a week...</li>
            <li> It also dried out the skin under my beard causing my skin to flake which is why I&#x27;m giving it 1 star.</li>
            <li> and I admit it does have a heavy cleaner smell</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my boyfriend who has been working on a beard for a few months now.</li>
            <li> While this did immediately make my beard softer, it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I fear I&#x27;ll use it all up in just a few weeks, while my soap/shampoo lasts months.</li>
            <li> I picked up a few bottles of this over time</li>
            <li> Price was a little stiff for a 4 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I was very shocked and pleased.</li>
            <li> That being said, it still is painful to spend that much on something that is so small and will be empty in a month.</li>
            <li> I would recommend washing your beard no more than every few days (just like your hair).</li>
            <li> My beard usually yells &amp;#34;Hell ya</li>
            <li> He even asked me to order a bottle for my brother-in-law, for a small Father&#x27;s Day Gift.</li>
            <li> But those are small complaints.</li>
            <li> and it was destroying his beard and drying out his face!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure of the quality yet, but I will update this as soon as I know.</li>
            <li> Having tried quite a few, this is my product of choice!</li>
            <li> No more itching or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really stick around after you wash away the lather and that&#x27;s a little disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for how long it lasts though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Sub-par bottle, hard to get the product out</li>
            <li> The scent is a little different but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything except Captain Bluebeard&#x27;s because quite honestly I&#x27;ve never needed anything</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t touch other guys beards because that would just be weird.</li>
            <li> The beard wash is a very small bottle</li>
            <li> unless you use it everyday, and in that case it may be too expensive to be practical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told by others that it can be irritating when up against their skin.</li>
            <li> My husband started using this product a couple of years ago, and he&#x27;s completely addicted.  </li>
            <li> It would get so bad that once every few months he would have to shave his beard off to let his skin recover.  </li>
            <li> The beard saver arrived and I was a little disappointed that the wrong product came.</li>
            <li> Smells like a melted lemon-lime slushee in a weird way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my review is that this shampoo didn&#x27;t make my beard softer at all.</li>
            <li> Using this helps me comb my beard and prevents the hair from sticking out randomly.</li>
            <li> All this product is is expensive soap.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who gets awful dry, crusty skin under his beard and moustasche.  </li>
            <li> I have a small/medium sized beard and regrettably I have had the worst dry skin under my beard for the longest time.  </li>
            <li> he had trouble with painful ingrown hairs in his beard and this has seemed to help avoid those!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m unhappy with this product-</li>
            <li> It is like getting smashed in the face by an artificial lime sledgehammer.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t the only one experiencing this disgusting crap!  </li>
            <li> Too bad about 1/4 of it leaked out on the way to me in Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> Like it went bad or something.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t feel too bad</li>
            <li> has been in bad condition because of it.  </li>
            <li> but it is by no means so atrocious that it makes the product unusable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff way overpriced for a crap product.</li>
            <li> It was that bad!</li>
            <li> However, after a couple months (the bottle lasts a while) it smelled horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I found this product originally through a YouTube review because I was growing some facial hair and found that my beard had dandruff.  I used this in the shower (Along with the Bluebeards beard saver post shower) and the products solved my problem of beard dandruff.  This also left the hair on my face feeling smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> My beard usually yells &amp;#34;Hell ya, I want some of that!!&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m in the shower getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, leaves my husband&#x27;s bead very soft</li>
            <li> Bluebeard&#x27;s Wash is good with sensitive skin and has done wonders helping me with my lifelong fight with ingrown hairs.  That alone will keep me buying it.  I have tried all of the products at [...] and this is the only one that does what I want it to do:  get rid of ingrown hairs, really clean out mustache wax at the end of the day and all with a smell that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  It has a light citrusy smell that is very addicting.  A very, very small amount goes a very long way.  It never ceases to amaze me that 3 -4 drops can take care of my full beard.  Good thing too, as the bottle is small and the price a bit steep.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased of, Bluebeards Original Beard Wash, for my husband. It smells great, keeps his beard looking great, and he loves it! He even asked me to order a bottle for my brother-in-law, for a small Father&#x27;s Day Gift. (As a side note - I am currently pregnant, and every pregnancy - my husband grows out his beard for \\&quot;good luck\\&quot;.This is the 4th pregnancy - 5th child, and all have been very healthy. Guess it works! Now my brother-in-law is growing his first \\&quot;good luck\\&quot; beard. :)).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m even a fan on Facebook. My beard has been growing since January, and it&#x27;s never been itchy or funny smelling (I smoke :| ). The only problem I have is that I live overseas, and have to wait for it to clear customs, so I would love it if it was offered in a larger size to save time/shipping costs.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after reading the reviews. I have been using it for about 2 weeks, and other than the nice lime aroma, I have not noticed a softer, cleaner beard. Great that the wash isn&#x27;t animal tested, but it doesn&#x27;t hardly lather, and the aroma only last until my beard is dry. Honestly get the same results from a basic baby shampoo. Price was a little stiff for a 4 ounce bottle. Maybe works better on non gray texture beards. Funny thing is, there are no other beard washes available! Still worth a try, but not sure if a second bottle will find it&#x27;s way to my beard.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my beard!!  In only a couple of days of using Bluebeards Original Beard Wash.  It has conditioned and softened my beard. And it has been very manageable too.  I would only ask that there would be a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Use it daily during beard season (November thru April here in Texas) and keeps my beard clean and smelling nice.  The only downside is I have to use a conditioner or moisturizer to keep my face from drying out.</li>
            <li> Smells great and does its job and then some! This was a great buy and I look forward to needing another bottle</li>
            <li> This product has a light lime scent. I put a bit on my fingers, and massage it in to lather it up. Then I rinse out at the end of my shower. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I can say the slight dandruff problem I&#x27;ve had has gone away. I do color my beard and have not noticed the soap causing the color to fade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for a number of years but always taken for granted the dry skin it produces. I had a kind of eureka moment a few weeks ago that it was annoying and that there may be solutions. Since then I found and began using this product daily in small quantity. It works very well, and along with vigorous brushing and drying my beard after washing/swimming my head is looking luxurious with no dry skin or itchiness.    On another note, however, Bluebeard was not a pirate (that would be Edward Teach, aka Blackbeard). Bluebeard was a French serial killer in a fairy tale (murdered a parade of wives) and a book by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a good friend of mine and he was very excited about it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 4 years now and I love this product.  If it weren&#x27;t for this shampoo I would have cut my beard long ago. My hair is much more soft and the shampoo actually moisturizes my skin underneath. Since the ingredients are natural it smells like limes instead of flowers like my wife&#x27;s shampoo (which is what is was using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence about growing, or keeping, your beard. Give this product a shot. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Washes great, but smells bad.  It is NOT a peppermint smell.  Bad maybe be overstating it, but it definitely does NOT smell good.  Thankfully, the smell mostly washes out during rinse, but you have to put up with the smell while washing.  There is a supposedly unscented version; I haven&#x27;t tried it, but if it&#x27;s unscented, I&#x27;d strongly recommen that over this.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does what they say it does.</li>
            <li> This is a welcome alternative to using regular shampoo on my beard. I&#x27;ve only recently grown a full beard, but I have had a goatee for over ten years. I always used shampoo on my goatee, and I would always see Bluebeards advertised, but never wanted to spend the money for a goatee alone. Once I started growing a full beard, the itching was very irritating, so I told my wife I would like to try Bluebeards. She sort of laughed at first, but being a terrific wife, she bought it for me for Christmas. This wash is worth the money, and it does everything it claims. It has a great scent that is reminiscent of Lemonheads candy. Be aware that it does not foam up as much as regular shampoo, but it seems to penetrate down to the skin, then rinses clean. After getting out of the shower, my beard feels very soft, clean and hydrated. It has basically eliminated any itch involved with having a beard, even now during the dry winter months. While I believe this small bottle will last a while, I&#x27;ll probably buy the bigger bottle next time. I&#x27;m glad they offer a different size now. If you have a beard, this will be a product you&#x27;ll enjoy using. I look forward to trying the other Bluebeards products.</li>
            <li> Good beard soap smells just like lime. Really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with [[ASIN:B00158U5YC Bluebeards Original Beard Saver]] for a month now.  I would say the beard saver is what has made the difference as I have noticed a significant improvement in my medium length beard I have had for over ten years.  The beard wash is a very small bottle and I do not think the price is justified.  Buy the Beard Saver cream as this product really works and is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Product works just as it is depicted in the description. I&#x27;ve used bar soap and shampoo prior to using this product. Bar soap made my skin dry and shampoo made my skin oily. With that being said this product smells good like lemon lime, leaves face feeling oh so clean, any my face has cleared up using this product. The only thin i would change about this prodcut is the size of the bottle, make a super size.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who have a problem cleaning the skin on their face and necks while maintaining a nice clean beard. Shampoo will clean the beard, but leaves residue on the skin. While face wash cleans the skin on your face, but leaves the beard itchy and dry. Bluebeard Beard Wash is a happy medium. Why only 4 stars? This is not a perfect product because you may still need some beard conditioner to make your beard soft and shiny. Likewise, the bottles are made of a somewhat odd and inflexible plastic, making it somewhat difficult to squeeze out the right amount every time. But those are small complaints. Overall this is a great and necessary product for men with beards.</li>
            <li> Very mild shampoo for the beard.  Leaves a great smell and combined with occasional conditioning keeps the beard soft.  It may seem high priced but it requires very little to keep the beard clean per use.  It is not required to use it every day so the cost is not too high</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend previously and this is our second purchase. he had trouble with painful ingrown hairs in his beard and this has seemed to help avoid those! It smells nice too :-)</li>
            <li> From my boyfriend: \\&quot;Doesn&#x27;t dry out my face but cleans out my beard! I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was making a difference, but when I ran out of Bluebeard&#x27;s wash and was using face soap on my beard, the beard wasn&#x27;t looking so good. Then when I used shampoo, my face was red &amp; blotchy under the beard. This indicates that it works. Lasted 2-3 months with a beard washing every other day. Now buying it again. Would also recommend a boar&#x27;s hair \\&quot;beard brush\\&quot; (a cheap one was fine for me). Together, these items elevated my beard to awesomer proportions.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much of a beard, but it didn&#x27;t soften my beard like I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I grow a beard every winter and before using this I was using shampoo and conditioner but would still sometimes itch or flake. Using this once a day takes care of any itch or flakes and keeps the beard fresh and soft. I would highly recommend. It is a bit pricey for the amount but one bottle lasts a while if you don&#x27;t use too much at a time.</li>
            <li> This was a good size for trying it out. I now get the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I got the title a little mixed up with my pirates. Regardless, this stuff worked wonders. I could see and feel a difference in my man beard after the first use. I think I found a new stable product that will sit in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a nice fragrance!</li>
            <li> My dude&#x27;s face smells awesome and feels great.  I could make out with that beard all day.</li>
            <li> It has been great. My beard doesn&#x27;t itch and my face feels fresh and so very clean</li>
            <li> It has a great fresh fragrance, you only need a little bit to wash your beard, and it leaves your beard feeling softer than regular shampoo.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this product and had to order it and find out for myself if it really worked.  I&#x27;ve had a beard or goatee for the last 19 years, and have always had to deal with dry skin, coarse beard hair and beard dander.  I&#x27;ve used soaps, conditioners, etc and except for maybe Nizoral nothing worked.  I got Bluebeards and tried it immediately.  It took about a week of daily use, but it definitely does everything they say.  My beard is softer and smoother and I no longer have the dry skin beneath the beard.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have found Bluebeards beard wash to work just as advertised.  What got me was the size of the bottle.  For the money I paid i feel this bottle is about a quarter the size it should be.  Unless they change the size and lower the price i&#x27;m afraid it was my first and last bottle of beard wash.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the Bluebeards Beard Saver. The combination has prevented the itchy skin and flakes I have with my beard. I have sensitive skin and this has been the prefect answer to keeping my beard free of flakes and itching.</li>
            <li> This stuff does what it says it does, however I found that a lot of the reviews saying that it helped with dry skin under the beard were simply not true. Not only did this beard shampoo totally dry out the skin under my beard, but it also agitated my skin and made it super red and sensitive to the touch. Perhaps all skin is not made the same and that is why mine was affected so differently from the other reviewers&#x27; skin. My beard hair felt like a million bucks afterwards though when I could stand to touch my face a day or two later.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It smells amazing while you&#x27;re washing your beard, and after a single wash it made it super soft. As other users have mentioned after drying their isn&#x27;t much of a scent, but that&#x27;s not really an issue in my opinion. Would have given it 5 stars but I thought that the packaging was less than perfect. My bottle was leaking when I received it because the seal on the top of the bottle (under the cap) was coming off, and also the package that it was shipped in was pretty flimsy, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the bottle had fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s a great product, it&#x27;s a small bottle but you don&#x27;t need much to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to admit... one day, my beard started to itch, and my black shirt was covered with dry flaky skin.  It was pretty gross~!  So, I decided to google \\&quot;beard d___\\&quot; and it automatically showed up. Beard dandruff. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I wasn&#x27;t the only one experiencing this disgusting crap!  Found the Bluebeard product, and now I can&#x27;t live without it. Completely eliminated the flakes, smells good, and allows you to style the beard any way you want~!  Pretty cool~!</li>
            <li> I have a classic style full beard and this product was a lifesaver when it came to taming the ITCH so common with beard growth. I&#x27;ve been using it since December and I can tell an incredible difference. It makes your beard feel softer and more together and I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s grown in fuller and quicker since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Works great. My fiance uses this on his trimmed beard to keep it looking and feeling good. Started with the 4oz size to try it out and now he purchases the 8oz. It is a little pricey, but worth it if you want to maintain your beard and keep it from feeling too scruffy.</li>
            <li> I am not one to buy fancy products, but this caught my eye.  My wife is always saying she does not mind my long beard, as long as I keep it clean, so I gave Bluebeards a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The effect is not what I expected.  It feels really clean and seems to soften up the whiskers, making them more manageable.  The fragrance is quite nice, not some heavy lingering smell, but a citrusy type that rinses out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the bottle is small, it should last a long time because it only takes a few drops to generate a rich lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it, and so does my wife.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it might serve as a conditioner for my beard. I&#x27;m blond, so the hair is very fine. I&#x27;m told by others that it can be irritating when up against their skin. I figured a beard wash might soften that hair and make that less of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve found is that my beard is much softer within the first couple of hours of washing, but by the end of the day it&#x27;s back on the prickly side. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any long-term effects, although to be fair, I only use it a few times a week when I have a little extra time in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell of the wash, when I first got it, it had a strong lime scent that was a little out of the ordinary, but also kind of fun. Over time, the scent has faded and, to me, smells a little bit like dog shampoo. Granted, this might be a particular association for me, and my beard never smells like wet dog or anything after I&#x27;ve used it, it&#x27;s just kind of odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m unhappy with this product- it seems to serve a little bit of its purpose for me- but I don&#x27;t know that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It has a really great smell but I have to say that for me I did not find it any better at softening my beard then normal Suave Naturals. Considering the Suave costs me less than a 1.50$ and this product was 14$ for a much smaller bottle I don&#x27;t know that I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not horrible or anything. I just did not find it to be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My husband started using this product a couple of years ago, and he&#x27;s completely addicted.  He used to get ingrown hairs and dry, flaky skin under his beard- it drove him nuts, and hearing him complain about it drove me nuts ;-).  It would get so bad that once every few months he would have to shave his beard off to let his skin recover.  Since he started using Bluebeards his skin has stopped giving him problems altogether!  It has totally taken care of the dry skin, and it smells great.  I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as he has a beard.  We recommend Bluebeards to everyone!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend swear by this stuff! He hasnt had it in a while. I got it for him as a Christmas present and seeing him light up was worth it.</li>
            <li> I must say I love the product, does everything I wanted it to do.  Too bad about 1/4 of it leaked out on the way to me in Afghanistan. No plactic shrink wrap over the cap or anything.  That is the only reason this review is not 5*.</li>
            <li> Fantastoc stuff. Kept my 2&amp;#34; beard from becoming itchy and dandruffy.</li>
            <li> This wash does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Cleans your beard and smells good.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, maybe once or twice a week...Only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the price for such a small bottle, but then again you don&#x27;t need that much compared to what you use for your hair...</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to go out of my way to buy a shampoo strictly for my facial hair. But it&#x27;s definitely worth it. After using this product for a couple of weeks I find my beard much less irritated straight. The shampoo Smells great too and most of the ingredients are natural. So far so good</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet, so this review is based solely on packaging.  It came in a bottle that had two big white Amazon UPC code stickers plastered to the bottle.  Not the kind of stickers that peel off easily.  They left a sticky residue and even with scraping, half the sticker is still on it, impossible to get off cleanly.  This item is part of a gift for my husband, and I&#x27;m completely bummed because it looks so crappy.  Wish they hadn&#x27;t put the stickers right over the label so you couldn&#x27;t even read the description/name of the product.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not very soapy or sudsy. I definitely would not buy again. It smells like H20 brand. Too expensive for how much you get.</li>
            <li> While the scent was nice, light, and refreshing it didn&#x27;t seem to clean or moisturize as well as other products.</li>
            <li> Took a lot of product to work my full beard, and even then it didn&#x27;t build into much of a lather.  No noticeable softness and, while it smells nice while working with it, there&#x27;s no lingering scent after it&#x27;s been rinsed.  Wish I had only purchased 1 bottle instead of 2...</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone with facial hair. It makes your hair softer and more manageable. It smells good too. Having unkempt, scraggly facial hair typically looks awful, so having some kind of beard wash is crucial. I&#x27;ve never used anything except Captain Bluebeard&#x27;s because quite honestly I&#x27;ve never needed anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, these little bottles will last you a while. Unless you have a MASSIVE beard, it&#x27;ll probably last several months.</li>
            <li> Smells like liquid lysol.  Not a fan of the smell directly under my nose.  Will not remove wax products in your mustache.</li>
            <li> I had never used a beard wash after many years of having a beard and this stuff really works.  The lime scent is a nice touch when used and it has a neutral odor once washed out.</li>
            <li> I got my husband to use this one.  It smelled good.  I would recommend this for men that will actually use it :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who gets awful dry, crusty skin under his beard and moustasche.  It works wonders when he actually uses it consistently!  The dry skin goes away completely, and his beard feels so soft!</li>
            <li> Leaves my boyfriend&#x27;s beard smelling and feeling amazing. I bought this mostly as a joke for him but he actually really loved it. He has since used all of it and we will be repurchasing in the winter when he grows his beard back out.</li>
            <li> it works but it only feels really amazing for like the first 30 mins to and hour after using it. its not really an all day silky smooth. unless you use it everyday, and in that case it may be too expensive to be practical. This is the best beard shampoo that i have found, and have given it as gifts to people who need beard help. If your skin is itchy when growing out your beard it can simply be due to dry skin, so try some moisturizer. If you have a seriously itchy beard it might be a dermatology problem and this might not be the best solution. Fix your skin with over the counter products and/or go to a dermatologist and ask their advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another beard tip: try using sandpaper. i&#x27;m sure it sounds like a joke but using a small grain sandpaper when you have scruff can sand down the ends of course hair that your significant other hates so much. There are microdermibraision pads that do the same thing but cost 10 times as much, so be a man and go with the sandpaper route.</li>
            <li> Great beard wash!  Smells great and helps rid beards of food and smells!  Great man-gift!  I bought the beard conditioner and a comb with this as well and it made a great set!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I never could get a good lather with the soap unless I used a bunch, which I was hesitant to do because this product is pretty expensive. I also never noticed much of a change in my beard softness after using this wash.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good beard soap for a while. This one is it. It does have a lemon scent as others have mentioned, however, it is not overpowering. The best thing I could compare it to is lemon Gatorade. My beard feels clean and I have much reduced itching. 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! My husband LOVES this beard wash - 5 stars ++++. Thank you my husbands beard looks shiny, feels soft &amp; no more frizz. Yay!!!!</li>
            <li> Smelled great with that lime in there and worked as a beard wash. However, after a couple months (the bottle lasts a while) it smelled horrible. Like it went bad or something. Strange.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son in law as a Christmas gift and he is still thanking me for it !!  He loves the Beard Wash!</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd bottle of Bluebeards; the 1st one actually lasted me nearly 2 years! Doesn&#x27;t require much (even with my full beard) so it really lasts. Initially I wasn&#x27;t too keen on the scent, but it really grew on me and now I love it. Also, when I bought my first bottle, I was washing my beard too often, so my skin began to dry out. I would recommend washing your beard no more than every few days (just like your hair). Overall. great product, including quality, scent, and packaging.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting all the facial oils out of the beard hair, and making it smell better.  I highly recommend it to any man who had a beard that&#x27;s an inch or more long.</li>
            <li> I had never used a beard wash before so I thought I would give this a try. I love it</li>
            <li> Sure, it smells nice. But it doesn&#x27;t really do anything that soap doesn&#x27;t already do.</li>
            <li> Faint lemon smell, doesn&#x27;t make much suds</li>
            <li> Got this along with the &amp;#34;Beard Saver&amp;#34; as a gift for my bearded boyfriend. He likes the beard saver a lot for softening and conditioning, but this wash was a little drying. It does smell nice, but might be better for someone with less sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> The product definitely smells great and for me it has been very gentle to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for only giving it 3 stars is, that after 2 months of use (one month of use everyday, and the last month only every other day) i haven&#x27;t found that my beard got any softer. Furthermore $14 seems like a pretty high price for what is essentially a 4 oz. facewash.</li>
            <li> Smells weird, but good. Smells like a melted lemon-lime slushee in a weird way. Unfortunately, my review is that this shampoo didn&#x27;t make my beard softer at all. If anything, it made it feel more dried out and less soft. If you want to clean all the of the oil out if your beard, it will do that though. I have about a 3&amp;#34; full beard and I still believe nothing has made it softer and more comfortable than using Dove Hair Therapy Shampoo and Conditioner. I started stealing it from my girlfriend, and nothing else has been as nice.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend is a big fan of this buy! He was washing his hair with regular shampoo before I bought him this and it was destroying his beard and drying out his face! This stuff is gentle and leaves his beard smelling fresh and clean. It has totally transformed his beard and he is having more fun growing it out. He loves the stuff.</li>
            <li> Great beard wash, I use it mainly for a small neck beard, sideburns, and mustache. Keeps everything in check, soft, and (MY FAVORITE PART) reduces itch! Woot no beard itch!</li>
            <li> smells like limes :) although i did not find it that better than using a regular hair conditioner</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and makes my beard very soft. I tried combing my beard after a shower without using this, then after a shower using this and it made a big difference. Using this helps me comb my beard and prevents the hair from sticking out randomly. Great product!</li>
            <li> love the way it makes the beard feel</li>
            <li> I have a very scraggly beard. It mostly bothers me, itches, when I sleep on my side. This stuff softened it up maybe 15%. Not a big difference. It is refreshing and smells nice, but for me it wasn&#x27;t the miracle cure that it seemed to be for others.</li>
            <li> My husband enjoys this wash, and now using only this brand, he has occasional skin sensitivity so it is very gemtle on his face. He likes that it keeps his beard soft.</li>
            <li> Ye may be askin yer selv, \\&quot;Wat kinder swashbuckler be scrubbing he burly beard wif dis floozy warsh\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All o me best men be! Me finest crew!

Yar!</li>
            <li> From a simple hygene perspective or a pro bearding one, this stuff works wonders.  It has a nice clean lime scent that washes out, the lather is super rich and you literally only have to use a quarter size amount (4 inch amish beard).  This stuff literally cleans so well, my beard actually becomes squeeky clean.  Now a few days in, I can honestly say my beard has more shine an luster.  Can wait to see what it will look like in a year!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I would recommend this to anyone with a beard. And now i will write some more words because the review system is dumb.</li>
            <li> A great product to use in conjunction with their beard saver. It feels better and less harsh on the face than shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard very dry and tangled.  One of the driest shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used and doesn&#x27;t lather up every well.  It makes a conditioner have to work overtime.  Bluebeards original beard wash with extra conditioning is the better way to go.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star rating because it made my beard feel kinda dry. The plus side is that it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I tried many beard washes and have found the one I like the most with Bluebeards!  Bluebeards was recommended to me by a  friend and I have passed it along to many others.  Great product.  Cool logo and packaging.  I have sensitive skin and Bluebeards does not irrititate my skin one bit.  It keeps my beard clean and soft.</li>
            <li> All this product is is expensive soap. It doesn&#x27;t do anything a cheap shampoo won&#x27;t also do. It also dried out the skin under my beard causing my skin to flake which is why I&#x27;m giving it 1 star.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I spent the first 36 years of my life facial hair free, but recently have decided that my inner manliness needed to express itself, and thus I grew a beard. Everything worked out fantastically until about three weeks into it, when my wife informed me (lovingly) that my beard had a strong and noticeable &#x27;funk&#x27; to it. I tried nearly everything I could think of to clean it - shampoo, soaps, skin cleansers, I tried it all, and nothing worked. I was about ready to give up and shave until I found this product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived and I immediately tried it out. It has a very faint and very pleasant citrus odor to it, and it has a slight tingle on the skin while applying. Lo and behold - my beard now smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of advice - when using this, make sure you massage it in. You aren&#x27;t just washing your beard, you must get the skin underneath as well. Give your face a good hard scratch/massage while applying this, and make sure you rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the size of the bottle - I wish there was an option to buy a larger amount.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t come in the same bottle as the picture, which I was hoping for (or I would have chosen the other item). This is a gift for someone so I&#x27;m not sure of the quality yet, but I will update this as soon as I know.</li>
            <li> For the longest time, I have dealt with dry skin and an itchy beard. Up until a few weeks ago, my regimen consisted of using Selsin Blue &amp; my wife&#x27;s conditioner, which sort of worked, but then required post shower moisturizer, which usually lead to multiple moisturizer applications before going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluebeards has solved that for me. Basically, I&#x27;ve been using the product daily, typically the last part of my shower. The product is pretty viscous, and foams up nicely, which really gives me the impression that it&#x27;s working. It has a light lemon smell too, though I can see why some people thought that it smells too much like cleaning chemicals. And results are pretty quick. Within a day, my dry skin stopped, which completely justifies the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, it hasn&#x27;t really made my beard as soft as other users, but I&#x27;m willing to sit tight and use the entire bottle to figure out if it will make my beard softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re having issues with dry skin and your beard, try this product out. It&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I did mass amounts of research on numerous products meant specifically for the beard to no avail until I saw this product along with the 4+ star review and thought, why not? Man, this stuff is awesome! After the first use my beard is already softer and feels cleaner. Not only is this an A+ with my lady but it doesn&#x27;t feel too bad either haha. I usually have a very itchy, irritated face when I let my beard grow but this has certainly curbed that feeling almost completely. I highly recommend this product and will definitely be ordering another bottle or two when this one is finished!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, another poster had complained of the overwhelming smell and I admit it does have a heavy cleaner smell but it is by no means so atrocious that it makes the product unusable. It&#x27;s noticeable because well, it&#x27;s right beneath your nose! But it dissipates just as quickly once you rinse it out leaving you feeling fresh and clean with no residual smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must for any man who takes pride in his beard! It has a very pleasant scent of lime and magic. It has turned my beard from a greasy smelly Brillo pad into a super sexy chick magnet!  Your beard needs this product!</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few weeks and I like it.  I&#x27;m not sure how much better it is than shampoo or gentle soap, but it smells great.  I would like to try their other products.</li>
            <li> Great product. Made my beard manageable. Smells great. Too expensive for how long it lasts though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad and he loves it. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This works well. I wish there was a little more quantity for the price because it seams like its just repacked condition at a higher price but i did notice a difference all thought not enough to purchase it again</li>
            <li> There are a small number of products on the market, most hard to find and with claims difficult to substantiate, to solve a common beard problem - the simple sequence of washing hair first and then beard last solves some, but not all of these issues. Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Wash takes care of the rest with outstanding results. Yes, it does take repeated use for more than a few days, but you will be well-rewarded for your efforts. There is something about the lime juice [I suspect] that combines with the essential oils, to clean the crud build-up and leave a nice feeling along with the great fragrance. Having tried quite a few, this is my product of choice!</li>
            <li> Works very well for me and doesn&#x27;t make my beard poof out like a regular shampoo. Smells great like a nice lime smell.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my beard and left it soft. My beard before would get kind of a stale wet smell to it, and this product eliminated that, but it didn&#x27;t make it smell &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; after my shower. Honestly, though, for $20 I expected more. That being said, it was the first time I used a product specially designed for beards, so I have nothing to compare it too besides shampoo or face soap. It does a better job than shampoo and face soap. At the end of the day I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, but I will try a few others to compare. I want something that cleans, shines, makes my beard soft and smell good, and help lay the strays down so that my beard isn&#x27;t so frizzled and untamed. Bluebeards cleans, just as the description says, but nothing more. 3/5 stars seems appropriate.</li>
            <li> Really good beard wash. Can&#x27;t live without it! Bluebeards Original makes the best products on the market. If you want a great looking and great feeling soft healthy beard, buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Beard feels so clean after using this stuff, highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few other shampoos and so far nothing has even come close to this stuff.</li>
            <li> bought for gift for son and son in law, they both love the stuff.</li>
            <li> The BEST beard wash ive used, and ive used a few. Does an excellent job of cleaning your beard without drying your skin out. My only complaint is the size, 4 oz does not last long for me.</li>
            <li> great product. Kind of pricey for the size</li>
            <li> Bluebeard&#x27;s Beard Wash is a good product that does as stated in reducing itchiness and softening your beard. As others have mentioned the smell is a bit chemically but it does not linger to long after you rinse it off. The price is a big steep and though it does a good job I am not completely convinced that it is any better than the Neutrogena Men Razor Defense Face Scrub which I had been using before.</li>
            <li> The 2013 world champion facial hair grower says he uses this product. My hubby is on his way to MANY wins, and hopefully will be national soon, and he uses this product. It does just as it states, and is WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great beard moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This is great! I purchased this for my bearded boyfriend and he loves it. It&#x27;s better than any other wash of it&#x27;s kind. We have looked for similar items and just can&#x27;t find anything that does the job that Bluebeards does. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for my beard for several months now in combination with some jojoba oil and my beard has never been healthier. The scent is a little different but not in a bad way. Overall, i would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Gets my beard nice and clean, with a pleasing lime scent.  Helps prevent beard dander or skin flaking.  Softens the beard hair but not quite as much as the conditioning version of this product.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband who has started growing out his winter beard already.  He likes the smell and how it leaves his beard feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Great beard shampoo! it dosent dry my skin and leaves my beard smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with a medium to large beard.</li>
            <li> I kinda like it...I like the scent. I keep my beard short, so I only use this once or twice a week, but it keeps the dead skin from accumulating, keeps the beard soft, even though I trim often, and I dig the scent.</li>
            <li> So read a bunch of reviews before buying this and was super stoked when it got here. Not so much anymore. My beard has turned into straw. Even after conditioning it still feels rough. Spend your money elsewhere. This stuff way overpriced for a crap product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d personally like a larger bottle for the price, but this will still last me a couple of months. Lathers and cleans nicely, and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad per say, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy it again.  I didn&#x27;t feel particularly clean; it didn&#x27;t help get the beard wax out any better.  It&#x27;s just another soap, that smells like Lime Tootsie Rolls.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with dry skin under my beard. After using bluebeards wash, I don&#x27;t have flakes anymore! No more itching or irritated skin. My beard is softer and more clean than I could ever get it before.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my beard super soft!</li>
            <li> WORKS AS ADVERTISED,COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER</li>
            <li> This stuff works good, gives beard a deep clean and smells great, but my beard gets coarse after drying. Although pretty pricey, I got the beard saver. Using that before the beard is full dry produces a soft result that lasts throughout the day.  Use the beard saver along with this shampoo and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband for Christmas, and was very dissapointed in the size of the container.  I wish that I had seen that, and I would have passed on this one.</li>
            <li> Unlike the company&#x27;s beard balm, I love this stuff. Really good for cleaning your beard, which you should do like six million times a day.</li>
            <li> This beard wash works OK, just OK. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but it also doesn&#x27;t clean my beard and moustache very well. I use moustache wax and even after I break the wax down with oil, the beard wash barely touches it. It doesn&#x27;t fully remove the Koru Beard Gloss in the rest of my beard very well either, and that product is pretty light. I guess it would be fine for someone who doesn&#x27;t use any products in his facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now to the smell... It is like getting smashed in the face by an artificial lime sledgehammer. Really, it smells like lime Lifesavers x 10. While they are a tasty candy for children under the age of 10, I do not want that smell lingering under my nose all day. A nice herbal or spice scent would have been more appropriate in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It noticeably softened my beard (which is ~1inch long) and is a full beard, not a goatee.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a 3 1/2 weeks now and I&#x27;m about halfway through it.  My wife used to dislike it but now likes my softer beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping however that it would be softer, however I don&#x27;t know how soft a beard can be.  I don&#x27;t touch other guys beards because that would just be weird.</li>
            <li> Dope! Def need to buy myself some more of this, great product it works well! Once it runs out I&#x27;m getting another one</li>
            <li> Great product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Prior to ordering this I would not even kiss my husband for about a month.... It was that bad! With this product it is better but still has a scent that I still wish would go away.</li>
            <li> Great product and will by again</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my beard so nice and soft and smell great.. I would definitely get again. My wife loves it because it smells awesome</li>
            <li> My husband loves this enough that when he started running low he asked me to go ahead and order another.  It cleans his beard and his face better than hair shampoo.  I noticed that his beard looked a bit more tamed.</li>
            <li> I use all kinds of different beard shampoos, conditioners, creams and oils. I often take a break from using them when I&#x27;m going to try a new product so I can really tell what kind of effect it has on my beard. I&#x27;ve used the Bluebeards Original Beard Wash for about a week and a half and the results are obvious: it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard comes out very soft, very clean, and I feel it does a good job moisturizing the skin underneath. The sheen of my beard is more aided by conditioners, but this stuff did seem to have a positive effect. It lathers on well and washes away easily and I&#x27;d say it does everything it sets out to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is almost like a lemon lime soda ... I actually find the scent to be quite nice. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really stick around after you wash away the lather and that&#x27;s a little disappointing for me. It does seem to sink into the skin a little, so I&#x27;d recommend a boar bristle brush deep in the beard to pull the oils through the beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other con is the bottle is problematic. The wash is almost too thick to properly make it out of the bottle, you have to really squeeze to get it through the lid or take the lid off entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturizes and washes well&lt;br /&gt;- Good scent&lt;br /&gt;- Good price, good value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Scent doesn&#x27;t linger&lt;br /&gt;- Sub-par bottle, hard to get the product out</li>
            <li> The product works really well, but my girlfriend says it smells like Pine Sol. I don&#x27;t mind the smell, but it&#x27;s a little strong at first. I use a conditioner afterward anyway, so it doesn&#x27;t smell that way for long.</li>
            <li> I love this beard wash.  I have a small/medium sized beard and regrettably I have had the worst dry skin under my beard for the longest time.  I am constantly scratching my beard and the skin underneath has been in bad condition because of it.  I tried to lotion 2-3 times a day, I shower once a day and shampooed it, still nothing was helping.  This wash did the trick, you only need a really small amount of it as it lathers well and keeps my beard nice and smooth and also smells fresh!</li>
            <li> Great product, but just too expensive to use regularly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my boyfriend who has been working on a beard for a few months now. The beard saver arrived and I was a little disappointed that the wrong product came. The company I purchased it from (The Grooming Lounge) immediately sent me the beard wash and let me keep the beard saver as well. The boyfriend is enjoying both of the products, although the beard saver does smell a little like pine sol. So far his beard does feel softer after just a week or so of use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to use much product each time. I received this product for free in exchange for writing an honest review.</li>
            <li> I love beards, more specifically my boyfriends, but I love all beards. So this was a great Christmas gift for him. He loves it and  I can even see a difference. Its more controlled, smells good, and it even makes it soft (for a beard).</li>
            <li> The Wash with conditioners works better and is easer to use. With a beard a conditioner is a must not only for your skin, but that of your grilfriend. If you just need to clean your beard this product is great.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this.  It was a gift for my son.</li>
            <li> Works great. Leaves your beard soft and if you use a blow dryer on low and comb your beard will be straight and soft like the hair on your head. I was very shocked and pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, as he had been using shampoo to wash his beard and it was making his face itch and flake.  He has been using this for about a week, and his beard looks great and the itch and flakes are gone.  He loves the scent, but also likes that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.  We will definitely be buying this again and again!</li>
            <li> While this did immediately make my beard softer, it dried out my skin. I was under the impression that this would be easier on my skin than other products, but when washing with this I could practically feel it sucking the moisture out of my face. The scent also leaves something to be desired. While it&#x27;s not an offensive smell, lime tootsie roll is not what I&#x27;d consider an ideal scent for facial hair.</li>
            <li> smells great and feels very nice. last a fairly long time if used sparingly and appropriately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used normal shampoo on my face, tea tree oil, and several brands of dandruff shampoo, none of which really did the trick. They all left my face still itchy and dry. This stuff is the first thing I&#x27;ve washed my beard with that actually minimizes beard dandruff and itchiness. Hasn&#x27;t done anything special for the part of my neck that I shave once a week or so, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lime scent is very strong, but it doesn&#x27;t linger on your face once is it rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the price. This stuff is ten times as expensive as every other product I use, and it is such a small amount. I fear I&#x27;ll use it all up in just a few weeks, while my soap/shampoo lasts months. Worth it? Probably, since nothing else quite works the same. That being said, it still is painful to spend that much on something that is so small and will be empty in a month. -2 stars for price.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your beard really soft and it has a great citrus scent.  Yes, it seems expensive, but it&#x27;s super concentrated, so only a small amount is needed to make a nice full lather on the beard.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff and it softens his beard and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> cleanses the beard very good, makes it feel softer, and smells very nice as well. will definitely get this again!</li>
            <li> Bluebeards is a solid company, a big one. They make some interesting manufactured products. I picked up a few bottles of this over time and it&#x27;s not bad. The lime scent makes you feel like a pirate in the shower, which is cool and weird. Frankly after some more exploration it&#x27;s not the best thing out there. There are so many cooler and amazing products to help keep your beard fresh and happy. They&#x27;re all made by normal people, not bigger companies like this. Do some research, check out @beardacle on instagram he does some killer reviews, test out some stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, I loved it for a time, it&#x27;s just not for me anymore.</li>
            <li> Lathers very nicely and smells great. One of the better products out there.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my husband&#x27;s beard lie down and behave, even though he has naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I am Very Satisfied in how they quickly respond back to any incidents, and do thier Very Best in making the best of the situation... I appluad there Customer Service, That pays much more than a Product... I did have a situation in that my bottle had a broken seal, and they sent me another one right away, the second one had the same problem again they sent me the second one right away and treated me with Respect and Kindness... I advice them to put a tape and seal the top so it wont come off or break  the seal or be tampered with, they took that advice and is willing to send the Third Product... Honestly I am EXTEREMLY Satified with the CUSTOMER SERVICE, 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE...</li>
            <li> As one review stated, &amp;#34; got rid of the chin itch, and all the flaking&amp;#34;. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, unless a container larger than 4 oz. is available.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for my beard. Much softer and much less dry skin now that I am using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Item arrived open. Got refunded. Ordered some from another site, this stuff smells great and my boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> I tried it because I was suffering from itchy scalp, but this stuff does not work for hair so don&#x27;t buy it unless you have a beard or mustache. It does not work on the scalp.</li>
