            <li>Good size and easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;MM</li>
            <li>This kind of product should work smoothly, not be painful as it rips hairs out of your skin!!</li>

            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Like most of these type of shavers, it works well for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t even take care of the light peach fuzz on my face!</li>
            <li>BUT, overall, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>I recommend :)</li>
            <li>so i ordered this one, does work much better than the geranic one i had</li>
            <li>It keeps falling apart, had to tape it together to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>but i had to tape on the top part</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and portable.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>easy to carry and use.</li>
            <li>Found it does not get the fine hairs, let a lone nose hairs&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>Second one - works great</li>
            <li>Light part i didn&#x27;t need but razor works well</li>
            <li>easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I like the light on it &amp; for the price</li>
            <li>not feel comfortable to trim my nose hair.</li>
            <li>It works great for trimming those pesky upper lip, chin, and nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Appeared very nice, but when actually using it it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Much better &amp; longer lasting than popularly advertised one.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>I just love this trimmer - this is the second one I own -</li>
            <li>Well it was cheap, really cheap and it lasted the first use.</li>
            <li>its really quite fragile but if ya take good care of it, should do the job just fine.</li>
            <li>The trimmer seems to do a good job, but the blade keeps coming loose.</li>
            <li>Great little precision trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a great little product.</li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>The light switch is not what I really was interested in but the razor itself works well</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first day, then a small plastic piece inside the head broke and the motor won&#x27;t grab the blade now.</li>
            <li>It effectively shaves facial hair around lips ,chin, &amp; in the nose really well but doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>Especially since being of Scandinavian descent, our faces seem to be a bit &amp;#34;furrier&amp;#34; than most.</li>
            <li>My favorite personal trimmer!  </li>
            <li>is pretty light/flimsy and it does come apart but wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The first time I dropped it on the floor (about 3 feet off the floor onto vinyl)</li>
            <li>I was able to piece it back together</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old, have a fair complexion, and have moderately light facial hair (especially on my upper lip and lower chin).  </li>
            <li>Over the last 5 years I have tried a number of \\&quot;pencil razors\\&quot; very similar to this on my face, and none of them did a good job or worked well.</li>
            <li>This was the first time using a personal shaver like this that I actually felt some kind of razor burn on my face after using it.</li>
            <li>and it worked great for all over facial hair and tight spots like under the eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic around the blades</li>
            <li>it don&#x27;t really  trim anything, ripped off.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>Quality at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really help illuminate anything.</li>
            <li>It is made of a really flimsey plastic.</li>
            <li>Works better than other trimmers.</li>
            <li>I bought the first one from a local store but found a better price on Amazon the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New in box!</li>
            <li>For the price though, a decent buy.</li>
            <li>The construction is pretty cheap, but that seems to be typical of this type of product.</li>
            <li>This little tool is great - we replaced our last one which finally broke after about 2 years.</li>
            <li>Worked great, order came in when expected, but got dull fast because I had a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>the tip can pivot making it real prone to extending too far.</li>
            <li>Have given these to a few of my close girlfriends, and they are equally pleased.</li>
            <li>This little guy is handy for removing unwanted facial hair and trimming eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Only reason this isn&#x27;t a 1 star is because of how well it worked at first, I&#x27;m hoping it was just a defective piece.</li>
            <li>And truth be told, I have even used it just inside my nose (getting old is not for whimps!). &#x27;</li>
            <li>Worked only the first time I used it, then it fell apart.</li>
            <li>It is a basic trimmer designed mainly for your face (no shaving) and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Great for that pesky female upper lip hair, but my husband also uses it for nose hair and other delicate areas ;)</li>
            <li>The built-in light isn&#x27;t too swell - it has an eerie orangey-yellow street light feel to it.</li>
            <li>Changed the battery a few times to make sure, but got the same result.</li>
            <li>The light and pivoting head seem pointless.</li>
            <li>Good product, sometimes the turn on switch is a little confusing but maybe that is just me.  </li>
            <li>either.&lt;br /&gt;For such an inexpensive item, I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one every 18 months...</li>
            <li>As expected with fast shipping</li>
            <li>Maybe you&#x27;ll get lucky and it will last a few months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and convenient and priced right.</li>
            <li>i just use it for those little lip hairs that hurt too much to pluck</li>
            <li>Quiet little motor, efficient and gentle.</li>

            <li> but if leave on long quits running and have to shut off and wait awhile and then turn back on later.</li>
            <li> I have owned several of this style razor of other brands.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money - go with a different brand.</li>
            <li> Now I need a new one and it looks like this one is the least junky of the affordably priced options.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, previous one lasted maybe</li>
            <li> I have been using personal trimmers for the past 8 years and have used various brands</li>
            <li> Not very good for eyebrow grooming, only upper lip management.</li>
            <li> This product does not Really remove all hair from the face.  </li>
            <li> Went to use it a second time, it was dead.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it on other parts of my body and would not recommend doing that either.</li>
            <li> Go a little crazy and it will easily clean your armpits as well.</li>
            <li> There goes $12 down the drain.</li>
            <li> so I just put a dot of superglue on the little switch that holds that plastic in place.</li>
            <li> Takes care of the little trouble spots.</li>
            <li> The blades are small and might get stuck or pull hair when used on areas where it is not supposed to be.</li>
            <li> No more tears from tweezing.</li>
            <li> Small and portable.</li>
            <li> Work just as well if not better than that one seen on TV who gives you a hard time when you want to replace the blades.</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t care too much (still saved $), but this thing is WORTHLESS.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!!!</li>
            <li> but this one has been by far the worst.</li>
            <li> but it would bust apart at random.</li>
            <li> This product must have dull blades because it was very painful to use!!!</li>
            <li> It cuts off the ends, but does a bad job to do as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this trimmer.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times and it&#x27;s already died. Not very good for eyebrow grooming, only upper lip management.</li>
            <li> Appeared very nice, but when actually using it it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped. For the price though, a decent buy.</li>
            <li> Work just as well if not better than that one seen on TV who gives you a hard time when you want to replace the blades.</li>
            <li> If I could give this ZERO stars, I would. It&#x27;s so wimpy it won&#x27;t even take care of the light peach fuzz on my face! Changed the battery a few times to make sure, but got the same result. Fortunately, I only bought this so I could save shipping costs, so I don&#x27;t care too much (still saved $), but this thing is WORTHLESS. It hit the trash immediately. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Second one - works great</li>
            <li> This little tool is great - we replaced our last one which finally broke after about 2 years. Great for that pesky female upper lip hair, but my husband also uses it for nose hair and other delicate areas ;)</li>
            <li> This little guy is handy for removing unwanted facial hair and trimming eyebrows. The construction is pretty cheap, but that seems to be typical of this type of product. The piece of plastic that holds the blades in place tends to fall off so I just put a dot of superglue on the little switch that holds that plastic in place. The light doesn&#x27;t really do much for me. Mine did well for over a year and then a battery leaked acid inside the unit. Now I need a new one and it looks like this one is the least junky of the affordably priced options.</li>
            <li> Light part i didn&#x27;t need but razor works well</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price, it does what I need it to do. Especially since being of Scandinavian descent, our faces seem to be a bit &amp;#34;furrier&amp;#34; than most.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first day, then a small plastic piece inside the head broke and the motor won&#x27;t grab the blade now. Only reason this isn&#x27;t a 1 star is because of how well it worked at first, I&#x27;m hoping it was just a defective piece.</li>
            <li> Great little precision trimmer. The built-in light isn&#x27;t too swell - it has an eerie orangey-yellow street light feel to it. Doesn&#x27;t really help illuminate anything. BUT, overall, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Came on time, as advertised. I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Over the last 5 years I have tried a number of \\&quot;pencil razors\\&quot; very similar to this on my face, and none of them did a good job or worked well. THIS pencil razor, however, is terrific. I am 60 years old, have a fair complexion, and have moderately light facial hair (especially on my upper lip and lower chin).  This is fast and works perfectly - AND no pain at all. And truth be told, I have even used it just inside my nose (getting old is not for whimps!). &#x27;Have given these to a few of my close girlfriends, and they are equally pleased.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  No concerns.</li>
            <li> My favorite personal trimmer!  Much better &amp; longer lasting than popularly advertised one.&lt;br /&gt;Use around lip &amp; chin to trim hairs when don&#x27;t pluck ( between brows too)&amp; for my husband - ear hair, trim nose hair, around my husband&#x27;s neck  between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;Use alcohol wipe to disinfect after every use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and portable. Takes care of the little trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I just love this trimmer - this is the second one I own - I bought the first one from a local store but found a better price on Amazon the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very effective for ears, nose, sideburns and even neck hair. Go a little crazy and it will easily clean your armpits as well. I have not tried it on other parts of my body and would not recommend doing that either. The blades are small and might get stuck or pull hair when used on areas where it is not supposed to be. It is a basic trimmer designed mainly for your face (no shaving) and is reasonably priced. I recommend :)</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  No more tears from tweezing.</li>
            <li> Worked great, order came in when expected, but got dull fast because I had a lot of hair. Wish I had refills of blades. But in the end it quit working and not even switching the battery would work. Ended up buying one from Wal-Mart. But I miss the tiny razer for the eyebrows......</li>
            <li> This is a great little product. It effectively shaves facial hair around lips ,chin, &amp; in the nose really well but doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;shaved&amp;#34;. I like the light on it &amp; for the price, it&#x27;s a nice product. Would buy again...</li>
            <li> Worked with only 2 battery batteries and now it just pulls hairs, not trim them.</li>
            <li> Luv this product, ordering for friends!</li>
            <li> works great to remove nose hairs, i gave 3 out 5 because its a tad flimsy, very plasticky and can break real easy and the tip can pivot making it real prone to extending too far. its really quite fragile but if ya take good care of it, should do the job just fine. This is my second one, previous one lasted maybe 2 years before it just gave out so don&#x27;t expect it to last forever.</li>
            <li> I had this trimmer for over a year before it broke and it worked great for all over facial hair and tight spots like under the eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic around the blades is pretty light/flimsy and it does come apart but wasn&#x27;t a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I never had to change the batteries either.&lt;br /&gt;For such an inexpensive item, I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one every 18 months...</li>
            <li> does a good job, i have used these before so i ordered this one, does work much better than the geranic one i had</li>
            <li> Good product, sometimes the turn on switch is a little confusing but maybe that is just me.  It works well.</li>
            <li> Works great for what I use it for!</li>
            <li> As expected with fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great service.  Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It keeps falling apart, had to tape it together to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> This product does not Really remove all hair from the face.  It cuts off the ends, but does a bad job to do as advertised.  I will not use it!!!!</li>
            <li> looks good. easy to carry and use. but a bit too noisy. not feel comfortable to trim my nose hair.</li>
            <li> Works great! Simple to use. Small and portable. Quiet. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Well it was cheap, really cheap and it lasted the first use. Went to use it a second time, it was dead. Maybe you&#x27;ll get lucky and it will last a few months.</li>
            <li> Worked only the first time I used it, then it fell apart. After I found the piece, I put it back together, &amp; it hurts to use it. It is made of a really flimsey plastic. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected.</li>
            <li> Very good but if leave on long quits running and have to shut off and wait awhile and then turn back on later.</li>
            <li> bought four of these - all of them stopped working.  Not worth the money - go with a different brand.</li>
            <li> The light switch is not what I really was interested in but the razor itself works well</li>
            <li> it works..but i had to tape on the top part so it would not fall off.  i just use it for those little lip hairs that hurt too much to pluck</li>
            <li> Perfect, plus it&#x27;s pretty. Quiet little motor, efficient and gentle. Tops any similar product I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I have been using personal trimmers for the past 8 years and have used various brands but this one has been by far the worst. The first time I dropped it on the floor (about 3 feet off the floor onto vinyl) it fell apart. I was able to piece it back together but it would bust apart at random. This was the first time using a personal shaver like this that I actually felt some kind of razor burn on my face after using it. The light and pivoting head seem pointless. It is finally in the garbage after I dropped it again and somehow a piece of flimsy metal inside bent and even when I put it back together it doesn&#x27;t shave anymore.</li>
            <li> It works great for trimming those pesky upper lip, chin, and nose hairs. It&#x27;s small and convenient and priced right.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased one of these trimmers that actually pull your hair while trimming, its painful!&lt;br /&gt;Had to throw in trash!</li>
