            <li>Sticks well , yet can be repositioned before adding your top coat .</li>
            <li>I love the variety in this group.</li>
            <li>I have done better since</li>
            <li>but I am still able to do nail designs.</li>
            <li>These were ok.</li>
            <li>She added another top coat after three days and they design held up for the week.</li>
            <li>and I love using these.  </li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use and even looked youtube videos using the tape for more ideas.</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply with a curved tweezers and stays put when applying a top coat after application or my preference (sealing them with gel nail polish)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any nail artist who loves to have geometric nail art or who likes clean lines!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with these so far.</li>
            <li>then cut to more fit your nails help.</li>
            <li>The price is a complete steal for how great these are.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good variety!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it shreds so easily...</li>
            <li>These are really easy to apply and cut with a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>The tape is easy to work with -</li>
            <li>New and fascinating for my clients in this part of the world.  </li>
            <li>And they all fit into 2 tape dispensers for easy storage.</li>
            <li>This is fun, some of them don&#x27;t come off the roll very easy, but these are fun to play with and decorate you nails with or your kidos nails!</li>
            <li>order came way faster than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise, and the variety of colors and patterns was amazing.</li>
            <li>Fun times :)</li>
            <li>but I got different colors for every one and couldn&#x27;t be happier great product</li>
            <li>Free shipping takes a while.</li>
            <li>It keeps them dust free &amp; protected.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use my stripper tape</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to nail art, but these are really fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve received duplicates of the colors, but it doesn&#x27;t matter too much because there&#x27;s so many to choose from.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this Christmas and the next year will be colorful indeed!!!</li>
            <li>My teen loved them.</li>
            <li>The tape doesn&#x27;t stick very well even if you seal it with top coat.</li>
            <li>Within 24hrs, the tape started coming off, and it hadn&#x27;t been a full day yet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>They almost look exactly alike!</li>
            <li>I got them in the mail fairly quickly and tried it right away.</li>
            <li>As a professional nail technician this product is a must have customers love them and it adds variety and style to you client nails.</li>
            <li>i got my moneys worth thanx</li>
            <li>They are about as sticky as most nail art stickers as far as my experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not worried about the receiver seeing this, so thanks ever so much, Cheeky!!!</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice and some manual skills to get a really nice and clean design, but once you get a hang of it, the possibilities are endless.</li>
            <li>Super cute tapes, all different colors.</li>
            <li>I also found it best to wait no more than a minute after applying the top nail polish before ripping off the tape, but that might be different with different nail polish brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found easier if you precut the lengths first &amp; have tweezers to help place on your nails</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop using them and these a lot of pretty colors in them</li>
            <li>I had never used these before but was interested in trying it.</li>
            <li>I have done so many different designs with this already.</li>
            <li>pretty colors</li>
            <li>The amount of looks that this variety and giant selection inspires is almost overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love all of the different color choices.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal &amp; these should last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I tried out 4 colors on my mother with a double top coat to protect and they held up really well.</li>
            <li>Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are repeated, but they work really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to make sure that once they are on your nails that they stick very well otherwise, by the next day, the ends will start to come off your nails.</li>
            <li>Reviewing the actual product: they&#x27;re easy to work with and stick well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>large assortment of mail decoarting strips.  </li>
            <li>So yes i did get some duplicates (mostly in the pink department).</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>Pinterest is all I can say haha.</li>
            <li>There is enough of product to last me a life time, honestly.</li>
            <li>My first package nerve arrived but customer service responded fairly quickly and sent a second package.</li>
            <li>all the other 26 rolls were different, so I&#x27;m very pleased with that</li>
            <li>These nails are my first attempt and the tape left very clear lines</li>
            <li>And by applying the clear polish, the color of the tape faded on me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;GOLD (4), HOT PINK (4),</li>
            <li>If you look at the details of the hologram, it&#x27;s not that you get 2 of the same colors but that the patterns are differnt (tiny squares and large squares)</li>
            <li>After applying and covering with a clear top coat they last at least a week, that&#x27;s how long I keep one nail design.</li>
            <li>They are very thin and each comes in its own separate package when you receive them.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really tried to use to help put stripes or other designs yet.</li>
            <li>it can be a little tricky at first.</li>
            <li>any mixed lot of random colors runs that risk especially one with the amazing quantity this one has.</li>
            <li>sparkly pink vs pink vs metallic light pink.</li>
            <li>My advice would be to let the bottom nail polish dry completely before putting on the tape otherwise you&#x27;ll rip off the nail polish.</li>

            <li> But then again, like with any other nail art stickers, as long as you put on a layer of clear coat nail polish at the end, you&#x27;re all</li>
            <li> My only issue was how long it took to get them.</li>
            <li> The envelope was coming open a bit from the long journey.</li>
            <li> They came in a ton of different colors but they took a really really long time to get here</li>
            <li> There are 3 sets: flat, shinny and hologram.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, but I should have expected it with the cheap price.  </li>
            <li> GREEN (2), WHITE (2), PURPLE (2), SOFT PINK (2), SILVER (2), BABY BLUE (2), RED(2), BLUE (2), GREY (2)</li>
            <li> Other than these few things, I really like them.</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell if u got duplicates also because they could be very close for example..</li>
            <li> The striping tape is neat but hard to work with first few times .</li>

            <li> Great product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> The product works great. I did not get duplicates. The tape is shiny and beautiful. I used it last night to make designs on my nails for my Halloween costume. If you are not familiar with using nail tape, I recommend checking you tube bc it can be a little tricky at first. Hint, tweezers and cuticle scissors are your friend. They are easy to use and good quality. My only issue was how long it took to get them. It took almost a month and a half to get them (coming from China to the USA).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good variety!&lt;br /&gt;It was not that difficult for me to use :)&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited since I am nail art junkie :P</li>
            <li> New and fascinating for my clients in this part of the world.  Seen for the firts time in this country.</li>
            <li> Work Amazingly! And they all fit into 2 tape dispensers for easy storage. Will definitely buy angain!</li>
            <li> This item does not come off you can paint on them and peel or you could just simply leave it on your nail.</li>
            <li> Works okay. My teen loved them. Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This is going to be a Christmas gift. I&#x27;m not worried about the receiver seeing this, so thanks ever so much, Cheeky!!! I got this in plenty of time and I&#x27;m sure this Christmas and the next year will be colorful indeed!!!</li>
            <li> As a professional nail technician this product is a must have customers love them and it adds variety and style to you client nails.You should buy a few.</li>
            <li> They are A LOT smaller than I thought they would be.  Also very thin, don&#x27;t stick to the nail by their self and when I apply (clear) nail polish over them the color bleeds and it just turns silver.</li>
            <li> It arrived two weeks before the due date. Just as described. The envelope was coming open a bit from the long journey. All the product was intact and I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> Liked them. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting forever for these... While some colors are duplicated they are all beautiful! I can&#x27;t eat to use each one.</li>
            <li> They came in a ton of different colors but they took a really really long time to get here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with these so far. I bought them to paint over and make stripe patterns. These nails are my first attempt and the tape left very clear lines so I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re very easy to use. My advice would be to let the bottom nail polish dry completely before putting on the tape otherwise you&#x27;ll rip off the nail polish. I also found it best to wait no more than a minute after applying the top nail polish before ripping off the tape, but that might be different with different nail polish brands.</li>
            <li> These are a great addition to anyone&#x27;s nail designs. They are easy to apply with a curved tweezers and stays put when applying a top coat after application or my preference (sealing them with gel nail polish)</li>
            <li> This is fun, some of them don&#x27;t come off the roll very easy, but these are fun to play with and decorate you nails with or your kidos nails! Fun times :)</li>
            <li> For reference I got the FBA items. Yes i did in fact get 30 rolls, no i did not get 10x3. It is hard to tell if u got duplicates also because they could be very close for example.. sparkly pink vs pink vs metallic light pink. They almost look exactly alike! And a note, some colors look almost alike in shade. I got a gold and then another gold, but one is alittle darker in shade. I separated all mine and counted 26 different colors in my set. So yes i did get some duplicates (mostly in the pink department). I decided to do my nails right when i got these so ill upload a pic of them asap! btw.. one tape i used like split.. alittle thread on the side.. it was sooo annoying! I would recommend this to any nail artist who loves to have geometric nail art or who likes clean lines!</li>
            <li> Poor quality, but I should have expected it with the cheap price.  The color or design comes off the tape while trying to apply it to the nail. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay more.</li>
            <li> I initially thought they would be big, but they&#x27;re actually small. I didn&#x27;t like that it was difficult to locate the opening once the tip of the tape was used. But... No worries on that end, I found a great way to fix it. I used a scotch tape dispenser, removed the small tape and replaced them with the Tape Rolls. Some of the colors are repeated, but they work really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to make sure that once they are on your nails that they stick very well otherwise, by the next day, the ends will start to come off your nails. Other than these few things, I really like them.</li>
            <li> The striping tape is neat but hard to work with first few times . I&#x27;ve found easier if you precut the lengths first &amp; have tweezers to help place on your nails then cut to more fit your nails help. But I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong buy they started lifting off with in 24 hours. I will try again maybe with practice I will figure out how to keep them from lifting up. Haven&#x27;t really tried to use to help put stripes or other designs yet.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews saying that they were the same color for multiple ones but I got different colors for every one and couldn&#x27;t be happier great product thanks again</li>
            <li> These are awesome I love ever since I got them I can&#x27;t stop using them and these a lot of pretty colors in them this is like what every nail art shopper needs</li>
            <li> my sister has been wanting nail tape forever and is obsessed with it. might need to buy her some again soon :)</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TODAY BUT WAS SHORT TWO I READ OTHERS REVIEWS WHERE IT SAID IT WAS 3 SETS OF THE SAME BUT I RECEIVED ALMOST TWO SETS OF THE SAME WHICH IS 12 DIFFERENT COLORS THE FOLLOWING ARE THE COLORS I RECEIVED&lt;br /&gt;GOLD (4), HOT PINK (4), GREEN (2), WHITE (2), PURPLE (2), SOFT PINK (2), SILVER (2), BABY BLUE (2), RED(2), BLUE (2), GREY (2) AND SOMETHING CLOSE TO COPPER COLOR (2)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to nail art, but these are really fun and easy to use. It takes a bit of practice and some manual skills to get a really nice and clean design, but once you get a hang of it, the possibilities are endless. If you need inspiration, there are literally hundreds of YouTube tutorials to help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order came way faster than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise, and the variety of colors and patterns was amazing. I didn&#x27;t get any doubles in my order, though I probably wouldn&#x27;t mind either way, not for that prize! There is enough of product to last me a life time, honestly. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to order these again (though I totally would!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I could complain about is the quality of the glue. It just doesn&#x27;t always stick well. But then again, like with any other nail art stickers, as long as you put on a layer of clear coat nail polish at the end, you&#x27;re all good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was an awesome purchase and I&#x27;m really glad I gave these a try.</li>
            <li> large assortment of mail decoarting strips.  can be a little tricky to use especially for beginers but otherwise no complaints.</li>
            <li> Hard to work with. Colors were not sticking to the tape.</li>
            <li> Reviewing the actual product: they&#x27;re easy to work with and stick well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I only received 10 rolls, not 30 as advertised, so I&#x27;m slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Flat black, white&lt;br /&gt;Shiny blue, pink, red, magenta, silver, gold, green&lt;br /&gt;Shimmery yellow</li>
            <li> I had never used these before but was interested in trying it. I got them in the mail fairly quickly and tried it right away. It worked great and looked pretty on my nails.</li>
            <li> My first package nerve arrived but customer service responded fairly quickly and sent a second package. The tape itself is mediocre. The tape doesn&#x27;t stick very well even if you seal it with top coat. I haven&#x27;t tried all of them but the pink one stained my nail and even nail polish remover won&#x27;t take it off.</li>
            <li> Great variety. Sticks well , yet can be repositioned before adding your top coat . Can&#x27;t beat the price. Free shipping takes a while.</li>
            <li> Wish the tapes were wider</li>
            <li> It shreds. It&#x27;s great that this is 30 pieces of tape but it shreds so easily... I understand it&#x27;s very cheap but still...</li>
            <li> In love! They arrived a little sooner than expected and got NO REPEATS. There are 3 sets: flat, shinny and hologram. If you look at the details of the hologram, it&#x27;s not that you get 2 of the same colors but that the patterns are differnt (tiny squares and large squares) I posted a picture.</li>
            <li> Great value. I received item within 2 weeks. Great for striping nails but keeps lifting up regardless of what I do.</li>
            <li> Its wat i wanted n wat i was looking for n i got my moneys worth thanx a bunch luv it.</li>
            <li> Love These tapes!! Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> Super cute tapes, all different colors. Works great to make perfect lines on nails.</li>
            <li> I love the variety in this group. They came a few days before the beginning of the delivery estimate, even being shipped from China. These are really easy to apply and cut with a pair of scissors. After applying and covering with a clear top coat they last at least a week, that&#x27;s how long I keep one nail design.</li>
            <li> I have done so many different designs with this already. Love this item and would recommend to anyone! Pinterest is all I can say haha.</li>
            <li> I thought that they would be thicker... its a little difficult to remove the tape off the roll.I have done better since</li>
            <li> I always loved the stripper designs on YouTube and so I wanted to learn. I was excited to use my stripper tape and I was alittle disappointed. The tape didn&#x27;t want to adhere, so I had to use color tape. And by applying the clear polish, the color of the tape faded on me. Within 24hrs, the tape started coming off, and it hadn&#x27;t been a full day yet. But I am &amp;#34;NOT&amp;#34; going to count out the tape. I am determined to get the designs I want and get better with the application lol.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the colors!!~~</li>
            <li> Arrived during estimated delivery and I am happy. They are really thin but I am still able to do nail designs.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal &amp; these should last a very long time. The tape is easy to work with - I had no problems. You have so many options for creating nail designs like mixing or matching the striping tape to adding decals, pearls &amp; even rhinestones along with the tape for amazing nails ! I keep my striping tape inside the vinyl pockets of my Pueen nail plate storage case. It keeps them dust free &amp; protected. I did receive all 30 striping tape rolls with only 2 duplicate sets ( 2 metallic pinks &amp; 2 holographic silvers ) all the other 26 rolls were different, so I&#x27;m very pleased with that &amp; my order arrived way ahead of time. I&#x27;ll definitely order from this company again.</li>
            <li> These were ok. pretty colors but they dont stick good. also i would have loved some type of directions with them.</li>
            <li> I received the product by the promised date and immediately pulled up a pinterest board that showcased nail designs using nail tape. I tried out 4 colors on my mother with a double top coat to protect and they held up really well. She added another top coat after three days and they design held up for the week. I love how easy it is to use and even looked youtube videos using the tape for more ideas. Its a great buy and worth it for nail art lover like myself.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for creating all sorts of lines on your nails.  I&#x27;m just getting the hang of doing nail art and I love using these.  They are very thin and each comes in its own separate package when you receive them.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve received duplicates of the colors, but it doesn&#x27;t matter too much because there&#x27;s so many to choose from.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and can&#x27;t wait to use them again.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME. The diversity in designs and colors received was really great. I did have duplicates but any mixed lot of random colors runs that risk especially one with the amazing quantity this one has. The price is a complete steal for how great these are. They are about as sticky as most nail art stickers as far as my experience. The amount of looks that this variety and giant selection inspires is almost overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love all of the different color choices.</li>
