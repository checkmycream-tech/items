    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for my curly hair</li>
            <li>It was also packaged perfect so that none of it leaked or spilled out!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this product online.  </li>
            <li>Great product --- all curly heads out there --- this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great smell that stays with you throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great buy if you feel like spending the money.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>just being honest....</li>
            <li>nice smell.</li>
            <li>It is very good and wonderful feel, so much better than most professional shampoos and TONS better than store bought shampoo, but still I thought it would be phenomenal, and it isn&#x27;t all that.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo and conditioner I have used on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to bring out the natural wave &amp; curl of my hair.</li>
            <li>Duo]]I&#x27;d been using Tresemme but wanted to try Aveda because of their outstanding reputation.  </li>
            <li>I love these products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought them.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This set is great for people with sometimes curly/sometimes straight hair, like me.</li>
            <li>Came quicker than expected, sealed &amp; perfect</li>
            <li>The curly shampoo didn&#x27;t help my hair compared to the cheap off the shelf brands.</li>
            <li>Aveda products --- also use Smooth Infusion --- are far superior to anything on the market.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these products, definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li>No matter what new product I try from now on, I&#x27;ll make sure I have some Tresemme on hand to correct any damage.  </li>
            <li>I have some natural curl in my hair, I love the way these two products make my hair feel and look.  </li>
            <li>Really works for curly hair!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>so I use more than the recommended amount which means I wind up using the conditioner a lot faster than the shampoo or I just substitute a different conditioner.</li>
            <li>Loved the scent but made my hair super dry and flat.</li>
            <li>no tangles, super soft and manageable hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Aveda.</li>
            <li>I really like the Be Curly shampoo</li>
            <li>Got to try them first and liked them very much for my girls&#x27; hair, which is soft, thin and a bit curly.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t give me that much curl definition.  </li>
            <li>Soft, shinny and curly.</li>
            <li>conditioner may seem to not leave your hair soft but trust</li>
            <li>After using it several times, I found my hair actually losing its shape, becoming dry and feeling like hay.</li>
            <li>I thought the \\&quot;dry remedy\\&quot; worked on my hair much nicer.</li>
            <li>- it lathers really well with a tiny amount, even if you have long hair.</li>
            <li>I regularly use these products for my naturally curly 3A/B hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It made my hair flat which is the opposite of what I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> Will be switching back to DevaCurl products as soon as the bottles are empty!</li>
            <li> it works wonders for the curls once it gets dry.</li>
            <li> Her hair was not dried out or hard to detangle.</li>
            <li> and I had the hardest time just trying to comb thru my wet, conditioned hair.</li>
            <li> No longer needs to be washed every other day.</li>
            <li> Together with other shampoos and conditioner, it works.</li>

            <li> Made no significant improvment to my hair period much less add any curl to my hair....</li>
            <li> It helps, on those curly days, to have a little boost.</li>
            <li> Well, Be Curly Shampoo &amp; Conditioner dried out my curls</li>
            <li> Not easy to untangle, that&#x27;s why I was looking for quality hair care.</li>
            <li> The dry remedy gave it shine and decreased the frizz yet didn&#x27;t take away the curl.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> If anything it made it worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it just does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY disappointed and do not recommend this crap to anyone....</li>

            <li> Perfect for my curly hair and it didn&#x27;t make my hair oily or leave any film on it. It was also packaged perfect so that none of it leaked or spilled out!</li>

            <li> Makes my hair very heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have used on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair. I have tried them all.  Her hair was not dried out or hard to detangle. Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leave my hair super hard and dry.. Did not help at all with my curls.. If anything it made it worse.</li>
            <li> i guess it worked for my hair</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product online.  It is wonderful to bring out the natural wave &amp; curl of my hair.</li>
            <li> Really works for curly hair!</li>
            <li> Aveda products --- also use Smooth Infusion --- are far superior to anything on the market. Since they are all natural, I have seen a dramatic change in my hair. No longer needs to be washed every other day. It is shiny and curly. Great product --- all curly heads out there --- this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004YKS3A6 Aveda Be Curly Shampoo (8.5 oz) &amp; Conditioner (6.7 oz) Duo]]I&#x27;d been using Tresemme but wanted to try Aveda because of their outstanding reputation.  Well, Be Curly Shampoo &amp; Conditioner dried out my curls and I had the hardest time just trying to comb thru my wet, conditioned hair. Yikes! I had to resort back to Tresemme Moisture Shampoo and Moisture Conditioner for Curls to save me.  Sometimes expensive isn&#x27;t better.  No matter what new product I try from now on, I&#x27;ll make sure I have some Tresemme on hand to correct any damage.  I wish I had my $$ back!!</li>
            <li> I regularly use these products for my naturally curly 3A/B hair. Granted, it&#x27;s not organic, but I do notice the difference in my hair when I use this product, especially when I pair it with Aveda&#x27;s styling products.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great smell that stays with you throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great buy if you feel like spending the money.</li>
            <li> nice smell. no tangles, super soft and manageable hair.  I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t give me that much curl definition.  It is very good and wonderful feel, so much better than most professional shampoos and TONS better than store bought shampoo, but still I thought it would be phenomenal, and it isn&#x27;t all that.</li>
            <li> Got to try them first and liked them very much for my girls&#x27; hair, which is soft, thin and a bit curly. Not easy to untangle, that&#x27;s why I was looking for quality hair care. I am very pleased with these products, definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love these products.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought them.  It does exactly what it says it will.  I don&#x27;t have any chemicals in my hair anymore and I get my hair cut short.  I shampoo my hair and then use the conditioner and my hair immediately curls.  I love it.  Thanks Aveda.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  I have some natural curl in my hair, I love the way these two products make my hair feel and look.  Soft, shinny and curly.</li>
            <li> I really like the Be Curly shampoo - it lathers really well with a tiny amount, even if you have long hair. I&#x27;m used to a heavier conditioner so I use more than the recommended amount which means I wind up using the conditioner a lot faster than the shampoo or I just substitute a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> This set is great for people with sometimes curly/sometimes straight hair, like me. It helps, on those curly days, to have a little boost.</li>
            <li> What a shame. I now remember why I did not continue using this shampoo and conditioner years ago. Unfortunately, it just does not work for me. After using it several times, I found my hair actually losing its shape, becoming dry and feeling like hay. It made my hair flat which is the opposite of what I expected it to do. I suppose not all hair is the same. I would however like to recommend the curl enhancer. Together with other shampoos and conditioner, it works. The curls look shiny and curly, but not crunchy.</li>
            <li> my curly hair loves this shampoo., it leaves my curls perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner may seem to not leave your hair soft but trust&lt;br /&gt;me it works wonders for the curls once it gets dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the \\&quot;be curly\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner at all. I thought the \\&quot;dry remedy\\&quot; worked on my hair much nicer. The curly shampoo didn&#x27;t help my hair compared to the cheap off the shelf brands. The dry remedy gave it shine and decreased the frizz yet didn&#x27;t take away the curl.</li>
