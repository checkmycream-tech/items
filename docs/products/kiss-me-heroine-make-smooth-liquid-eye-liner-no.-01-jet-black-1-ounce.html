            <li>I love this product! :)</li>
            <li>My new favorite liner!!!</li>
            <li>and this is so far the best I have found.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to handle!</li>
            <li>Although these create very precise lines, they are not waterproof or should I say anything proof.</li>
            <li>Its ok, just thought it would be darker.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to put primer and eyeshadow on with it</li>
            <li>It was delivered in about 3 days which I was incredibly pleased about.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>This eyeliner has become one of my favorite ones.</li>
            <li>I actually love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s loads better than the ones I&#x27;ve used (or tried to use before).</li>
            <li>This is one of those eyeliners where you shake it so more ink gets onto the brush tip.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would buy this again.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and you can apply it in the area on top of your lashes.</li>
            <li>Overall, love it and very satisfied with it!!!</li>
            <li>most liquid eyeliners are markers or dip-brush.</li>
            <li>This was cute packaging and I was very excited to use this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>, it goes on very easily and gives a clean line.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to put on!</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.</li>
            <li>it has a felt tip which is easy to maneuver with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy application and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Easy to draw ur liner</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and easy to wrap off.  </li>
            <li>Tried so many different brands, this is the best one with a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to clean off with oil and the tip is very precise for drawing clean lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>very good product, water resistant, last for whole day, strongly recommended!</li>
            <li>Tip is extremely precise.</li>
            <li>The product is so precise</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for the price.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s oil free.</li>
            <li>Very nice to do the skinny lines and create the different shape of the eye, water proof not mass up even I went to the rafting.</li>
            <li>this eyeliner is very easy to apply, and goes on in a straight, smooth line.</li>
            <li>In comparison, Dolly Winky and Kat Von D tatto liner is super easy to apply -</li>
            <li>However, I do fine that it dries too quickly.</li>
            <li>It lasts for hours and the tip allows you to get a really fine line or go bold with your look as well.</li>
            <li>The tip has softened now so I can&#x27;t quite get the super fine lines anymore</li>
            <li>need to use eye makeup remover to clean it up.</li>
            <li>this is definitely not as black as most people described, even after adding more layers of it to intensify the ink.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, pristine lines and smooth application.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>its very pigmented and i love it</li>
            <li>Not bad though.</li>
            <li>Its really easy to apply and a very nice black.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>It is super waterproof and sweat-proof.</li>
            <li>The only downside to this product is that it requires more skill to apply, but this is the case for most liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>super good!easy to draw</li>
            <li>will be back to buy more!</li>
            <li>It is a brush and because it is a pan you can hold it as such and get a better line!</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone, especially if they are scared of making mistakes because it&#x27;s is fairly easy to remove compared to most eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for one to replace my used up Loreal Super Liner, since I really liked that the tip created sharp angles easily.</li>
            <li>The brown is great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it several times and haven&#x27;t experienced any thing.</li>
            <li>The result of my first time using this was not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It works very well, has a nice dark color and lasts better than the felt tip liner I am used to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very user friendly.</li>
            <li>Great eyeliner, easy to apply, long lasting even in this hot humid summer.</li>
            <li>Nice fine tip for a thin line and easily makes a wing if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>My cousin first sent me one from China after she&#x27;d gone on a trip to Japan.</li>
            <li>My first venture into the realm of liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I bought, price is cheaper than the other top brands, but quality is better!</li>
            <li>This mascara really sticks!</li>
            <li>Definately will try the next time. :-)</li>
            <li>This product is NOT a brush like I had hoped, but a marker that is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>You shake the pen back and forth to get the &#x27;ink&#x27; flowing, the more you use it the more you have to shake it to get the ink to flow properly.</li>
            <li>I noticed smearing when the weather was humid and if your foundation was kind of wet when you applied it.</li>
            <li>But this one works really well!</li>
            <li>The tip is also very fine, so this makes it easy to draw a thin line close to your lash line, or a fine cat-liner wing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is AMAZING like other people are gushing</li>
            <li>The lines are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>The color lasts pretty much all day, although it does tend to fade, but not too noticeably.</li>
            <li>This liner doesn&#x27;t drag and makes doing winged eyeliner super easy.</li>
            <li>This black is really nice to use for the darker look or evenings out.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick, I couldn&#x27;t read any of the directions since it was written in Chinese, but its eyeliner</li>
            <li>Accuracy is key though with this eyeliner, since the tip is so fine.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>And also thanks for your note and snacks.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It lasted for the whole day when I went to my friend&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li>Fast deliver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So simple to create precise line</li>
            <li>but I still, really, really like it and would repurchase it,</li>
            <li>This eyeliner, though a little challenging to get used to at first if you&#x27;re not familiar with the brush type, is an amazing true-to-color investment that I will assure you 1,000,000 x to buy.</li>
            <li>With both Stila and Eyeko, my eyeliner would last me more than 12-14 hours without reapplication, but I rarely ever need to go that long.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other eyeliners, it&#x27;s price is more affordable</li>
            <li>Not like other liquid eyeliners in which you need to dip the applicator in the bottom in order to get more eyeliner liquid.</li>
            <li>They disappear with light touches and fade quickly after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Love the brush tip, very pigmented black but</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these, so maybe the first one so far is a dud</li>
            <li>Long lasting, intense, easy to use!</li>
            <li>soft and fine eyeliner, super black.</li>
            <li>Lots of my friends recommended KissMe, but I don&#x27;t know whether it just doesn&#x27;t work for me or whether it&#x27;s the issue of this particular one</li>
            <li>High expectation for Jp cosmetic</li>
            <li>I would take this over high end eyeliner any day.</li>
            <li>it makes precise lines that used to take me much longer with other liner products.</li>
            <li>The shipping was not slow.</li>
            <li>Normally my eyeliner smudge is off even if it&#x27;s waterproof but not this.</li>
            <li>This is coming from a person who absolutely sucks at putting on eyeliner because my eyeliner always turns out looking like eye shadow to be honest.</li>
            <li>but the product is worth it simply for the packaging.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s far better than the typical drugstore-- and even high-end eyeliners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice deep black.</li>
            <li>right now the package is going back to HK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  would recommend this product to anyone who like the precision of liquid eyeliner and the sharp deep color, but may not have great skills with other types of brushes or applicators.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, but after a few uses it seems to be running a bit dry on me, still fluid coming out through, at a slower rate.</li>
            <li>But, since it makes such accurate lines I would definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li>, this eyeliner is definitely not waterproof.. be careful if you tend to tear a little because it will &amp;#34;crust&amp;#34; off a lot more easily.</li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth and dark.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The only draw back is that it doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 months.  </li>
            <li>I must say I am an eyeliner searcher, I have big Brown eyes and love black liner that stays put</li>
            <li>This brand is the only waterproof formula which I have tried that really works for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any extra curl, but it really defines your lashes.</li>
            <li>It last for whole day  and even when I cried.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, soft and perfect thin lines, won&#x27;t mess around even crying after it dried.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan to purchase this again, but I appreciate the low cost and will try others before going back to Stila.&lt;br /&gt;Again, like I said, I may have gotten a dud, and since I bought 2 of these, I will re-update my review if the other one turns out to be much better.</li>
            <li>Easy to well for everyday makeup!</li>
            <li>I have little Asian eyes, and this mascara makes huge difference.</li>
            <li>The ink, however, is a major issue...</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received it few days later after I placed the order on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I vastly preferred using a soft dip-brush however.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not good at make-up, but it is easy to draw.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run, doesn&#x27;t transfer (even on my oily lids), but it&#x27;s not exactly waterproof, which makes taking it off an absolute ease.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a steady hand and connect small strokes slowly when you use this product.</li>
            <li>this here by chance and saw that other reviewers said how this product goes on smooth and comes out very black, but I haven&#x27;t seen this to be the case.  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s super easy to put on!</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.</li>
            <li> it has a felt tip which is easy to maneuver with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy application and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Easy to draw ur liner</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and easy to wrap off.  </li>
            <li> Tried so many different brands, this is the best one with a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to clean off with oil and the tip is very precise for drawing clean lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> very good product, water resistant, last for whole day, strongly recommended!</li>
            <li> Tip is extremely precise.</li>
            <li> The product is so precise</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for the price.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s oil free.</li>
            <li> Very nice to do the skinny lines and create the different shape of the eye, water proof not mass up even I went to the rafting.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner is very easy to apply, and goes on in a straight, smooth line.</li>
            <li> In comparison, Dolly Winky and Kat Von D tatto liner is super easy to apply -</li>
            <li> However, I do fine that it dries too quickly.</li>
            <li> It lasts for hours and the tip allows you to get a really fine line or go bold with your look as well.</li>
            <li> The tip has softened now so I can&#x27;t quite get the super fine lines anymore</li>
            <li> need to use eye makeup remover to clean it up.</li>
            <li> this is definitely not as black as most people described, even after adding more layers of it to intensify the ink.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, pristine lines and smooth application.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> its very pigmented and i love it</li>
            <li> Not bad though.</li>
            <li> Its really easy to apply and a very nice black.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> It is super waterproof and sweat-proof.</li>
            <li> The only downside to this product is that it requires more skill to apply, but this is the case for most liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> super good!easy to draw</li>
            <li> will be back to buy more!</li>
            <li> It is a brush and because it is a pan you can hold it as such and get a better line!</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone, especially if they are scared of making mistakes because it&#x27;s is fairly easy to remove compared to most eyeliners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one to replace my used up Loreal Super Liner, since I really liked that the tip created sharp angles easily.</li>
            <li> The brown is great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it several times and haven&#x27;t experienced any thing.</li>
            <li> The result of my first time using this was not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It works very well, has a nice dark color and lasts better than the felt tip liner I am used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner, easy to apply, long lasting even in this hot humid summer.</li>
            <li> Nice fine tip for a thin line and easily makes a wing if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> My cousin first sent me one from China after she&#x27;d gone on a trip to Japan.</li>
            <li> My first venture into the realm of liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought, price is cheaper than the other top brands, but quality is better!</li>
            <li> This mascara really sticks!</li>
            <li> Definately will try the next time. :-)</li>
            <li> This product is NOT a brush like I had hoped, but a marker that is pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> You shake the pen back and forth to get the &#x27;ink&#x27; flowing, the more you use it the more you have to shake it to get the ink to flow properly.</li>
            <li> I noticed smearing when the weather was humid and if your foundation was kind of wet when you applied it.</li>
            <li> But this one works really well!</li>
            <li> The tip is also very fine, so this makes it easy to draw a thin line close to your lash line, or a fine cat-liner wing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is AMAZING like other people are gushing</li>
            <li> The lines are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> The color lasts pretty much all day, although it does tend to fade, but not too noticeably.</li>
            <li> This liner doesn&#x27;t drag and makes doing winged eyeliner super easy.</li>
            <li> This black is really nice to use for the darker look or evenings out.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick, I couldn&#x27;t read any of the directions since it was written in Chinese, but its eyeliner</li>
            <li> Accuracy is key though with this eyeliner, since the tip is so fine.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> And also thanks for your note and snacks.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It lasted for the whole day when I went to my friend&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li> Fast deliver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So simple to create precise line</li>
            <li> but I still, really, really like it and would repurchase it,</li>
            <li> This eyeliner, though a little challenging to get used to at first if you&#x27;re not familiar with the brush type, is an amazing true-to-color investment that I will assure you 1,000,000 x to buy.</li>
            <li> With both Stila and Eyeko, my eyeliner would last me more than 12-14 hours without reapplication, but I rarely ever need to go that long.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other eyeliners, it&#x27;s price is more affordable</li>
            <li> Not like other liquid eyeliners in which you need to dip the applicator in the bottom in order to get more eyeliner liquid.</li>
            <li> They disappear with light touches and fade quickly after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Love the brush tip, very pigmented black but</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, so maybe the first one so far is a dud</li>
            <li> Long lasting, intense, easy to use!</li>
            <li> soft and fine eyeliner, super black.</li>
            <li> Lots of my friends recommended KissMe, but I don&#x27;t know whether it just doesn&#x27;t work for me or whether it&#x27;s the issue of this particular one</li>
            <li> High expectation for Jp cosmetic</li>
            <li> I would take this over high end eyeliner any day.</li>
            <li> it makes precise lines that used to take me much longer with other liner products.</li>
            <li> The shipping was not slow.</li>
            <li> Normally my eyeliner smudge is off even if it&#x27;s waterproof but not this.</li>
            <li> This is coming from a person who absolutely sucks at putting on eyeliner because my eyeliner always turns out looking like eye shadow to be honest.</li>
            <li> but the product is worth it simply for the packaging.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s far better than the typical drugstore-- and even high-end eyeliners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice deep black.</li>
            <li> right now the package is going back to HK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  would recommend this product to anyone who like the precision of liquid eyeliner and the sharp deep color, but may not have great skills with other types of brushes or applicators.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but after a few uses it seems to be running a bit dry on me, still fluid coming out through, at a slower rate.</li>
            <li> But, since it makes such accurate lines I would definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> , this eyeliner is definitely not waterproof.. be careful if you tend to tear a little because it will &amp;#34;crust&amp;#34; off a lot more easily.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth and dark.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I must say I am an eyeliner searcher, I have big Brown eyes and love black liner that stays put</li>
            <li> This brand is the only waterproof formula which I have tried that really works for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any extra curl, but it really defines your lashes.</li>
            <li> It last for whole day  and even when I cried.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, soft and perfect thin lines, won&#x27;t mess around even crying after it dried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan to purchase this again, but I appreciate the low cost and will try others before going back to Stila.&lt;br /&gt;Again, like I said, I may have gotten a dud, and since I bought 2 of these, I will re-update my review if the other one turns out to be much better.</li>
            <li> Easy to well for everyday makeup!</li>
            <li> I have little Asian eyes, and this mascara makes huge difference.</li>
            <li> The ink, however, is a major issue...</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received it few days later after I placed the order on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I vastly preferred using a soft dip-brush however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at make-up, but it is easy to draw.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run, doesn&#x27;t transfer (even on my oily lids), but it&#x27;s not exactly waterproof, which makes taking it off an absolute ease.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have a steady hand and connect small strokes slowly when you use this product.</li>
            <li> this here by chance and saw that other reviewers said how this product goes on smooth and comes out very black, but I haven&#x27;t seen this to be the case.  </li>
            <li> Well, no matter how hard or often I shake the pen, it always felt super dry as if it was already out of ink!  </li>
            <li> The former usually lose their soft point quickly, dry out quickly, and start off real scratchy on the eyelid and the latter are hard to find and a little finicky in terms of use and packaging.</li>
            <li> only problem with this particular one is that it&#x27;s not quite as fluid and pigmented as the ones I&#x27;ve been sent (from China), and purchased in the past (from Sasa, also from Hong Kong).</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t give off the thick fake usual look that most people stay away from&lt;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as Stila or Eyeko either, and I always use primer before applying liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Nice,but not last long !</li>
            <li> I am wondering if this is the product itself or I just happened to get a dry one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I really like the brush tip; it is very thin and stiff and doesn&#x27;t bend much, so it makes it easier to use along your eyelid.  </li>
            <li> It has lasting power, the color is really dark, and doesn&#x27;t make much of a mess when applying.</li>
            <li> It is dry just in half month.</li>
            <li> small enough to carry around</li>
            <li> I used to buy crappy drug store eyeliners but after this I will never buy any other brand again.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner I received seems to be a little dry.</li>
            <li> This one lasts for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t run around the corners of my eyes, which is what happens usually with other eyeliners.</li>
            <li> application is smoother than any other brand that i have previously used.</li>
            <li> This pen is also really versatile in the sense that it can do really thin lines or thick lines depending on how you angle it.</li>
            <li> Half of the product gets wasted</li>
            <li> Now I use it everyday</li>
            <li> You will have to use a heavy duty makeup remover or something like coconut oil will work.</li>
            <li> I have to press a lot on my lid to get a few strokes in (it fades when trying to apply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on this</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not easy to apply, and it smudges.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very dark and thick.</li>
            <li> I usually get Stila&#x27;s or Eyeko&#x27;s waterproof liquid eyeliners from Sephora, but they are expensive to have to buy constantly</li>
            <li> This product has a brush, unlike the felt tip eyeliner I usually use.</li>
            <li> The ink was hard to be applied.</li>
            <li> so i suggest anyone who has the problem do slow strokes</li>
            <li> It is very thin and precise at the end, but thicker towards the base of the brush.</li>
            <li> I have shaky hand</li>
            <li> but my shaky hand messes it up</li>
            <li> Maybe it was a bad batch but for whatever reason, it just wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> if you have a hard time creating winged liner then this is for you!</li>
            <li> It is very hard to draw over the eyes, and it feels like it is out of ink.</li>
            <li> and I hate having to wait several days for them (not to mention they bleed around the corners of my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;Found</li>
            <li> also not as expensive as dollyeye but still gives the apperance of those &amp;#34;brand eyeliner drawn eyes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s totally useless for me now.</li>
            <li> I think it must be fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not happy with this!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this eye liner.  </li>
            <li> The line is very thin and versatile.</li>
            <li> However when I got the product, it was really bad.</li>
            <li> really bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a liquid eyeliner because of my friends&#x27; bad experiences of using this type of product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is my best eyeliner ever !!I will keep to use it !</li>
            <li> Love the brush tip, very pigmented black but the stain power is not that great after I rubbed with soap and water!!! High expectation for Jp cosmetic but this s not so great</li>
            <li> Its ok, just thought it would be darker.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply! I have shaky hand but it works quite well.</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use !!! :))</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I must say I am an eyeliner searcher, I have big Brown eyes and love black liner that stays put and this is so far the best I have found. Buy this, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite waterproof eyeliner. It is very thin and precise at the end, but thicker towards the base of the brush. Stays on all day. I would take this over high end eyeliner any day.</li>
            <li> very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;not waterproof and will smudge if you touch your eye.&lt;br /&gt;lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but after a few uses it seems to be running a bit dry on me, still fluid coming out through, at a slower rate. The color lasts pretty much all day, although it does tend to fade, but not too noticeably. Its easy to clean off with oil and the tip is very precise for drawing clean lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also not as expensive as dollyeye but still gives the apperance of those &amp;#34;brand eyeliner drawn eyes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner. However, I do fine that it dries too quickly. It doesn&#x27;t smudge but also doesn&#x27;t give me the room to fix a mistake. Not bad though.</li>
            <li> Very nice to do the skinny lines and create the different shape of the eye, water proof not mass up even I went to the rafting.</li>
            <li> Tip is extremely precise. Drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> This is the best liquid eyeliner EVER!  Good price too!  Thank you for the fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I will be back to buy more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for years. My cousin first sent me one from China after she&#x27;d gone on a trip to Japan. Its formula is probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t run, doesn&#x27;t transfer (even on my oily lids), but it&#x27;s not exactly waterproof, which makes taking it off an absolute ease. I would pay anywhere from $10 to $20 for this because it will last you for months. It may run out eventually but it never dries out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this particular one is that it&#x27;s not quite as fluid and pigmented as the ones I&#x27;ve been sent (from China), and purchased in the past (from Sasa, also from Hong Kong). Maybe it was a bad batch but for whatever reason, it just wasn&#x27;t the same. But it&#x27;s far better than the typical drugstore-- and even high-end eyeliners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase... only if Sasa is out of stock again.</li>
            <li> My first venture into the realm of liquid eyeliner. I really like this product, it goes on very easily and gives a clean line. I use it regularly as part of my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> One of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Just not what I needed</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! This is my third one over the years and I will continue looking for this when I run out again. Its really easy to apply and a very nice black. I like having this one and the brown one. This black is really nice to use for the darker look or evenings out. The brown is great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, intense, easy to use!</li>
            <li> It’s amazing ！I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for a year now. It is recommended to me by my make up school teacher. It is super waterproof and sweat-proof. I never have to reapply it during the day and it never smudges underneath my eyes. This will even last during your hottest days or snowiest days outdoors. However, it is also very easy to remove with make up remover. The tip is also very fine, so this makes it easy to draw a thin line close to your lash line, or a fine cat-liner wing. The only downside to this product is that it requires more skill to apply, but this is the case for most liquid eyeliners. Just make sure you have a steady hand and connect small strokes slowly when you use this product.</li>
            <li> very good product, water resistant, last for whole day, strongly recommended! This is the second one I bought, price is cheaper than the other top brands, but quality is better!</li>
            <li> Good quality with respect to the price! Easy to well for everyday makeup! Now I use it everyday cause it&#x27;s just what I want!凸^-^凸</li>
            <li> nice done but not waterproof</li>
            <li> Great product! The only problem is taking it to different altitudes. It blows up. Half of the product gets wasted</li>
            <li> soft and fine eyeliner, super black. need to use eye makeup remover to clean it up. small enough to carry around</li>
            <li> This brand is the only waterproof formula which I have tried that really works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner! I&#x27;ve been looking for one to replace my used up Loreal Super Liner, since I really liked that the tip created sharp angles easily. This one lasts for a long time, and doesn&#x27;t run around the corners of my eyes, which is what happens usually with other eyeliners. It has lasting power, the color is really dark, and doesn&#x27;t make much of a mess when applying. Accuracy is key though with this eyeliner, since the tip is so fine. I also absolutely love the packaging!</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!! It&#x27;s amazing, it stays on all day even in the heat.  Just be sure to put primer and eyeshadow on with it and you&#x27;ll  be good for the day!</li>
            <li> This mascara is very dark and thick. I didn&#x27;t notice any extra curl, but it really defines your lashes. You will have to use a heavy duty makeup remover or something like coconut oil will work. I had the mascara on for multiple days because I didn&#x27;t have a proper remover, soap and Almay makeup remover pads didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I like it. Very easy to apply and it&#x27;s long lasting. The shipping was not slow.</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner I have ever owned. It was delivered in about 3 days which I was incredibly pleased about. Great price for what it is. The product is so precise so is great for doing wings etc and it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily. I would recommend it to anyone who likes doing eyeliner. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> the only eyeliner that ever works for me! use it every day now.</li>
            <li> some of the best eyeliner i have ever used.  if you have a hard time creating winged liner then this is for you!</li>
            <li> this eyeliner is very easy to apply, and goes on in a straight, smooth line. application is smoother than any other brand that i have previously used.</li>
            <li> I have used this eyeliner before. It was supposed to be waterproofed but this one is actually not.</li>
            <li> Lots of my friends recommended KissMe, but I don&#x27;t know whether it just doesn&#x27;t work for me or whether it&#x27;s the issue of this particular one, it&#x27;s not easy to apply, and it smudges. In comparison, Dolly Winky and Kat Von D tatto liner is super easy to apply - I don&#x27;t need to worry about shaking. Also, it smudges to the area under my eyes all the times, which is not acceptable. So it&#x27;s totally useless for me now.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is  great for the beginner! love it</li>
            <li> This eyeliner has become one of my favorite ones. it has a felt tip which is easy to maneuver with.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone, especially if they are scared of making mistakes because it&#x27;s is fairly easy to remove compared to most eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Tried so many different brands, this is the best one with a reasonable price.  It last for whole day  and even when I cried.</li>
            <li> I think this product is very good, I love it, thank you. And also thanks for your note and snacks.</li>
            <li> Best eye liner I have ever used. Easy application and stays on all day. Normally my eyeliner smudge is off even if it&#x27;s waterproof but not this. Definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> My new favorite liner!!! Worth the money, pristine lines and smooth application.</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner, easy to apply, long lasting even in this hot humid summer.</li>
            <li> Workout, go out, running around all day? This mascara really sticks! I have little Asian eyes, and this mascara makes huge difference. Like all waterproof mascara though be prepared to do some work to get this mascara off at night.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth and dark. The lines are nice and sharp. This liner doesn&#x27;t drag and makes doing winged eyeliner super easy. This is a fantastic product for the price.</li>
            <li> I actually love this eyeliner. It&#x27;s not totally waterproof but it&#x27;s loads better than the ones I&#x27;ve used (or tried to use before). It stays and glides on well and it&#x27;s super easy to put on! This is coming from a person who absolutely sucks at putting on eyeliner because my eyeliner always turns out looking like eye shadow to be honest. I love this product! :)</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever!!! If you don&#x27;t have one please get one today!!!!!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is amazing!  It lasts for hours and the tip allows you to get a really fine line or go bold with your look as well. The shipping was very quick, I couldn&#x27;t read any of the directions since it was written in Chinese, but its eyeliner so you should know how to use it. I just didn&#x27;t know if I would have any allergies to it. So far I&#x27;ve used it several times and haven&#x27;t experienced any thing. It&#x27;s a great eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I heard this brand is very good and easy to use.  However when I got the product, it was really bad. The ink was hard to be applied. It is very hard to draw over the eyes, and it feels like it is out of ink. I think it must be fake.</li>
            <li> This was cute packaging and I was very excited to use this eyeliner. I usually get Stila&#x27;s or Eyeko&#x27;s waterproof liquid eyeliners from Sephora, but they are expensive to have to buy constantly and I hate having to wait several days for them (not to mention they bleed around the corners of my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;Found this here by chance and saw that other reviewers said how this product goes on smooth and comes out very black, but I haven&#x27;t seen this to be the case.  I bought 2 of these, so maybe the first one so far is a dud -- however, here&#x27;s my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I really like the brush tip; it is very thin and stiff and doesn&#x27;t bend much, so it makes it easier to use along your eyelid.  The ink, however, is a major issue... This is one of those eyeliners where you shake it so more ink gets onto the brush tip.  Well, no matter how hard or often I shake the pen, it always felt super dry as if it was already out of ink!  I have to press a lot on my lid to get a few strokes in (it fades when trying to apply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this eyeliner is definitely not waterproof.. be careful if you tend to tear a little because it will &amp;#34;crust&amp;#34; off a lot more easily. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as Stila or Eyeko either, and I always use primer before applying liquid eyeliner. With both Stila and Eyeko, my eyeliner would last me more than 12-14 hours without reapplication, but I rarely ever need to go that long.  This one lasts maybe 3-4 hours before you need to re-apply it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing: this is definitely not as black as most people described, even after adding more layers of it to intensify the ink. I don&#x27;t plan to purchase this again, but I appreciate the low cost and will try others before going back to Stila.&lt;br /&gt;Again, like I said, I may have gotten a dud, and since I bought 2 of these, I will re-update my review if the other one turns out to be much better.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I order this.  It is good!</li>
            <li> really bad. It is dry just in half month.</li>
            <li> I used to buy crappy drug store eyeliners but after this I will never buy any other brand again. Though I bought mine off Rakuten because when you combine multiple items and divide the shipping it&#x27;s actually cheaper than Amazon. Still I would recommend this eyeliner to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have to give them 5 star&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast. And the eyeliner was so great. I bought this eyeliner twice. I love it so much. Easy to draw ur liner</li>
            <li> very nice. will buy again.</li>
            <li> The best eyeliner ever. Very easy to use, soft and perfect thin lines, won&#x27;t mess around even crying after it dried.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner, though a little challenging to get used to at first if you&#x27;re not familiar with the brush type, is an amazing true-to-color investment that I will assure you 1,000,000 x to buy. Compared to other eyeliners, it&#x27;s price is more affordable and you get a great deal.</li>
            <li> This product has a brush, unlike the felt tip eyeliner I usually use. It works very well, has a nice dark color and lasts better than the felt tip liner I am used to. The tube has no wand, it works like a marker, only with a brush. I love it and would buy this again. Arrived far earlier than expected even though it was shipped from Japan.</li>
            <li> Wow! This eyeliner is amazing it makes precise lines that used to take me much longer with other liner products. The eyeliner I received seems to be a little dry. I am wondering if this is the product itself or I just happened to get a dry one. But, since it makes such accurate lines I would definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Not anything proof actually. It smears, even with primer on the bottom. Going back to k palette after I finish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it why the package need to be signatured. The postman deliver it when i was in the office!So right now the package is going back to HK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy with this!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Water proof. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use liquid eyeliner. One of my friends recommended this eyeliner, so I purchased it on Amazon. I was so excited when I received it few days later after I placed the order on Amazon. It&#x27;s very user friendly. All you need to do is shake it and you can apply it in the area on top of your lashes. Not like other liquid eyeliners in which you need to dip the applicator in the bottom in order to get more eyeliner liquid. The KissMe Heroine Make Eyeliner comes in one. The result of my first time using this was not bad at all. It lasted for the whole day when I went to my friend&#x27;s wedding. I didn&#x27;t need to apply again. Also, it&#x27;s oil free. Overall, love it and very satisfied with it!!!</li>
            <li> Nice,but not last long !</li>
            <li> its very pigmented and i love it but my shaky hand messes it up so i suggest anyone who has the problem do slow strokes</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this eye liner.  The only draw back is that it doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 months.  I&#x27;ve used this product since November and already, I&#x27;m on my third tube.  The line is very thin and versatile. Its like using a pen.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and easy to wrap off.  Good price.  Fast deliver. Good service!  Definately will try the next time. :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t give off the thick fake usual look that most people stay away from&lt;br /&gt;So simple to create precise line</li>
            <li> I  would recommend this product to anyone who like the precision of liquid eyeliner and the sharp deep color, but may not have great skills with other types of brushes or applicators. This pen is not! a felt tip! It is a brush and because it is a pan you can hold it as such and get a better line! This pen is also really versatile in the sense that it can do really thin lines or thick lines depending on how you angle it. I love this pen!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;m not good at make-up, but it is easy to draw.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on this</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner. Nice deep black. Nice fine tip for a thin line and easily makes a wing if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eyelinear</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is AMAZING like other people are gushing but the product is worth it simply for the packaging. It is so convenient. most liquid eyeliners are markers or dip-brush. The former usually lose their soft point quickly, dry out quickly, and start off real scratchy on the eyelid and the latter are hard to find and a little finicky in terms of use and packaging. I vastly preferred using a soft dip-brush however. This product is NOT a brush like I had hoped, but a marker that is pretty darn close. The marker tip is longer so you can apply at an angle and the marker tip isn&#x27;t scratchy. The tip has softened now so I can&#x27;t quite get the super fine lines anymore but it isn&#x27;t such a big deal. You shake the pen back and forth to get the &#x27;ink&#x27; flowing, the more you use it the more you have to shake it to get the ink to flow properly. I noticed smearing when the weather was humid and if your foundation was kind of wet when you applied it. I let my foundation settle now. It sounds like I have a lot of complaints but I still, really, really like it and would repurchase it,</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner. Would like the try the WP improved version next.</li>
            <li> super good!easy to draw</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a liquid eyeliner because of my friends&#x27; bad experiences of using this type of product. But this one works really well! It is really easy to handle! Love it!</li>
            <li> Although these create very precise lines, they are not waterproof or should I say anything proof. They disappear with light touches and fade quickly after a few hours.</li>
