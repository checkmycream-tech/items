            <li>Perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering this for a girl, and my girl want bright color showed in picture.</li>
            <li>I have reused many of them over and over - and have no metal!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>They are not as mini as I would have liked them to be, but they still&lt;br /&gt;work</li>
            <li>They burst very easily.</li>
            <li>They have very fine hair and these will hold the hair without damaging it when I take out their ponytails.</li>
            <li>I love these ponytail holder however, so I kept them.</li>
            <li>much better than the rubber band with no coating</li>
            <li>Great for my (almost) 2 years old&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li>Break easily.  </li>
            <li>They work just fine</li>
            <li>Perfect for little girls hair!!</li>
            <li>Maybe good for baby or toddler with very fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>only 1 time it´s the best for my little girl (1 year)</li>
            <li>I like that they are pretty sturdy -</li>
            <li>I really want to give a 0 star for this order!</li>
            <li>These are Much easier to use!</li>
            <li>The Goody mini plastic bands are much easier to use and stretch.</li>
            <li>They stay in my toddler&#x27;s hair very well--until she pulls them out without any hair tugging.  </li>
            <li>More trouble than it&#x27;s worth to return it.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for non-plastic rubberband for my toddlers long, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Especially for baby fine hair on my almost two year old.</li>
            <li>Too tight to get your fingers in to be able to put in a pony.  </li>
            <li>I know it said color may vary, but did not expect white, light blue and light purple and very few of light pink color in the whole box, which has nothing to do with the picture showed.</li>
            <li>These were supposed to be pastel colors but were nowhere near it.  </li>
            <li>I can not wrap my five year old&#x27;s hair twice with the band.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t even the light and dark pink that the picture showed.  </li>
            <li>so I have to have the right amount of hair in order to get the bands tight enough because they do not stretch.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my 16 month old daughter, whose hair is getting long enough for pigtails.</li>

            <li> These are tiny, which is what I wanted, but you cannot get a second twist out of them - not good unless you have very tiny fingers.</li>
            <li> The colors are dark red, dark pink, dark yellow, etc.</li>
            <li> Dark not very pretty colors.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using these since they don&#x27;t pull on her hair like other rubberbands/elastics do, however there is a lot of room for improvement on these.</li>
            <li> Being so tiny they are a little hard to maneuver</li>
            <li> The hairbands are not very elastic, so they are a bit hard to get around your fingers to then put into a toddler&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t care what color you get, go ahead and order, otherwise it&#x27;s waste of money and waste of time.</li>
            <li> Too hard to use.</li>
            <li> A bit hard to put in since they&#x27;re not that stretchy</li>
            <li> Really hard to get in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment!</li>
            <li> But if you can&#x27;t stretch with a thumb and a finger to grab the hair - they are useless.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is very thin</li>

            <li> I received pastels, not brights. I love these ponytail holder however, so I kept them. I like that they are pretty sturdy - I have reused many of them over and over - and have no metal!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I cannot found this in store... only 1 time it´s the best for my little girl (1 year)</li>
            <li> Perfect for little girls hair!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 16 month old daughter, whose hair is getting long enough for pigtails. The hairbands are not very elastic, so they are a bit hard to get around your fingers to then put into a toddler&#x27;s hair. Also, several of them have snapped as I am in the middle of putting them on. I will continue using these since they don&#x27;t pull on her hair like other rubberbands/elastics do, however there is a lot of room for improvement on these. They do come in a package of 50, probably because they know that several will break on you.</li>
            <li> I really want to give a 0 star for this order! I&#x27;m ordering this for a girl, and my girl want bright color showed in picture.

            <li> they are great on the fridge</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t even the light and dark pink that the picture showed.  They were orange and blue and red, etc.  Not pastel blues or reds.  Dark not very pretty colors.  More trouble than it&#x27;s worth to return it.  If you order it, just be prepared to get any shade of any color in the rainbow!</li>
            <li> Great for my (almost) 2 years old&#x27;s fine hair. Being so tiny they are a little hard to maneuver but that is par for the course when handling tiny things.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the ponytail holders for my 2 and 4 year olds. They have very fine hair and these will hold the hair without damaging it when I take out their ponytails.</li>
            <li> Maybe good for baby or toddler with very fine thin hair.  I can not wrap my five year old&#x27;s hair twice with the band. The Goody mini plastic bands are much easier to use and stretch.</li>
            <li> These are teeny-tiny which was what I was looking for. A bit hard to put in since they&#x27;re not that stretchy but they stay in which is good! Especially for baby fine hair on my almost two year old.</li>
            <li> They stay in my toddler&#x27;s hair very well--until she pulls them out without any hair tugging.  Perfect for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my puppy&#x27;s hair. She is a teacup Yorkie. They work great for her hair, I hate when they use the rubber bands I end up having to cut them out because they get so tangled. These are Much easier to use! Love them!</li>
            <li> These are tiny, which is what I wanted, but you cannot get a second twist out of them - not good unless you have very tiny fingers.</li>
            <li> much better than the rubber band with no coating</li>
            <li> They burst very easily. My toddler burst about 5 trying to tie her doll&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> They work just fine but they do not stretch.  My daughters hair is very thin so I have to have the right amount of hair in order to get the bands tight enough because they do not stretch.</li>
            <li> Perfect for baby hair!</li>

            <li> These don&#x27;t have a lot of stretch to them. Really hard to get in my daughters hair. And don&#x27;t stay in well</li>
