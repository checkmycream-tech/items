            <li>Most of the needles are either expired or close to being expired.</li>
            <li>There ok practice needles</li>
            <li>You can never have too many needles.</li>
            <li>More like a #10</li>
            <li>What else can I say, there are better needles out there</li>
            <li>Well Needles are Needles to most</li>
            <li>Those are the ones I needed the most.</li>
            <li>These needles are made pretty Damn good.</li>
            <li>but they otherwise are pretty good will buy again</li>
            <li>Quick Shipping!</li>
            <li>these were just what we needed to get for our kit and enjoy the price to pay is so affordable</li>
            <li>Cheap needles.</li>
            <li>High quality needles will for sure reorder more</li>
            <li>Needles are a good product but when mine came in a box was damaged and had to throw out 50 needles due to damage packing could have been better</li>
            <li>This product arrived in a very timely manner, was packaged securely and well within expiration dates.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>

            <li>Yes there is plenty I&#x27;m able to use, but I wouldn&#x27;t call this a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased, all needles sterilized not what i expected at all</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Most of my needles was open</li>
            <li>should have more liners per size for people that actually need the liners, maybe suggest contacting the seller to see if you can get some sizes alterated</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>a little to much mag action for a variety pack mags aren&#x27;t needed unless your a shade happy person that just wants to pack color into everything then this is for you.</li>
            <li>they seem to be better than average when it comes to factory solder flaws....</li>
            <li>I definitely will get my moneys worth out of my purchase though.</li>
            <li>I received 200 lining needles and no round shaderand no magnum shaders.</li>
            <li>I got alot of sizes I didn&#x27;t need and alot of the sizes that came that I expected weren&#x27;t the right quantity</li>
            <li>but my husband complained about it not having enough 9lL and 9M, it was mostly 5L and 5S.</li>
            <li>When I do tattoos I like to show that everything is new and sterile but with these needles I don&#x27;t want to do that because one person decided not to get a tattoo due to the expiration dates</li>
