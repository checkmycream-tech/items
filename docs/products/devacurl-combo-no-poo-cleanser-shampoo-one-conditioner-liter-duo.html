            <li>Love DevaCurl products, they&#x27;re wonderful for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the price is great!</li>
            <li>(I wash my hair every 3 days or so) you will be thrilled!</li>
            <li>An awesome duo that I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li>No complaints, just curly, healthy,  and happy hair!</li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many products with disappointments and almost gave up and told myself that that was the best my hair can get.</li>
            <li>Best hair shampoo and conditioner I have ever used, I like it much better then WEN</li>
            <li>That said, it is a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li>, I strongly recomend researching this product on Amazon for the best deal before buying it in the store.</li>
            <li>So happy I tried these......loving my hair/curls more than ever!</li>
            <li>great products, love the conditioner!</li>
            <li>this is a great product for curly hair, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and happy to be able to purchase using prime.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>Since I got this shampoo I got a lot of compliments on how good my hair smells</li>
            <li>Really good.</li>
            <li>Good luck and don&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li>I think this is a faulty product from this company because when I&#x27;ve used devacurl before I loved it this just made my hair frizzy</li>
            <li>Over all, I think this is a good hair set.</li>
            <li>so it does not lather but still cleans my hair and scalp and smells good too.  </li>
            <li>reliable, good shipping.</li>
            <li>It just felt so good and looked so good.</li>
            <li>This stuff doe some good detangling as well</li>
            <li>Combined with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather, AT ALL, I felt like there was no way it was doing any good.</li>
            <li>But the No-Poo DID do good.</li>
            <li>I look like a semi-drowned rat for awhile, but when my hair dries, it looks like those far-and-few-between good hair days</li>
            <li>and I LOVED the smell of all the products</li>
            <li>fact that my hair and scalp still smell good between washes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SMELLS GOOD TOO.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to find a good moisturizing shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>It helps maintaining curls and is good for your hair.  </li>
            <li>DevaCurl products are of good quality.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather, but it smells really good, it conditions, and I can see that it&#x27;s cleansing after I rinse.</li>
            <li>The cleanser and the conditioner both offer good slip for combing your hair out.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t stink it just doesn&#x27;t smell good to me.</li>
            <li>The No Poo shampoo is perfect for the cold/dry weather months in MI and keeps my hair clean but moisturized.</li>
            <li>At first I had to adjust the amount of the products I used to get the best results but my Deva stylist is a great resource for that too.</li>
            <li>It works best for your hair if you use the shampoo with another more moisturizing conditioner OR if you use another sulfate-free shampoo (even the low-pow would be better) and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Set it free works great and smells great.</li>
            <li>love, love, love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells so good and my hair has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!!!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I already use this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conditioner: I am very pleased with the One Conditioner.</li>
            <li>they smell very refreshing like rosemary or peppermint,&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased, and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Good product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with these products and the results I get.  </li>
            <li>this is a great deal for $50 with free ship!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have good hair.</li>
            <li>Either way, I love this product!</li>
            <li>Get the trial sizes first so you can figure out what works best for your type of hair.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff!</li>
            <li>Glad I found it!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>out!&lt;br /&gt;The large size works great for 2!</li>
            <li>The smell is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>My hair looks amazing every time I use it, and smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great no-sulfate and silicone free products.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Once I switched to DevaCurl, my curls bounced up so amazingly well that even my stylist commented that my hair seemed to be getting curlier every time she saw me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing price for a set.</li>
            <li>But the way this product makes my hair shine and curl and bounce is amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Since we have started using, both of our hair is easier to manage and I get compliments all the time on how nice my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>by a colleague who is also a curly head, I knew I liked what it was doing to her hair.</li>
            <li>I not only recommend this product because I have found it to be wonderful and to smell great</li>
            <li>This is the best system for my very curly hair ever.  </li>
            <li>Nice with color-treated hair too.</li>
            <li>The No-Poo and the conditioner have a nice floral smell (in my opinion), and they both have a nice creamy texture.</li>
            <li>husband has curly hair, too, and he decided to use this when he ran out of his own products.</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>- I HAVE THE MOST GORGEOUS NO</li>
            <li>I liked using the No-Poo, it felt creamy and silky, and a bit tingly.  </li>
            <li>This kind of washing process (cleansing/conditioning) was recommended for my hair type - and this product is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best.</li>
            <li>The conditioner does have a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I would be so greatful and a thrilled user if you took the scent out and the soy out.</li>
            <li>Girls is your hair is curly, these are the products to own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now going to try Milk for Hair, as I&#x27;ve heard many good things about it.</li>
            <li>And it also smells good :)</li>
            <li>While the No-Poo isn&#x27;t the best scented shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, it really helps keep the frizz under control.</li>
            <li>I will never use any thing else to wash with, totally worth the cost!!!</li>
            <li>Great products  leaves curly/wavy hair clean smelling and manageable.</li>
            <li>I feel like it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on leaving you with a clean hair</li>
            <li>Best curly hair products on the market, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>The best shampoo and conditioner ever for those with naturally curly hair!!</li>
            <li>My curls look amazing, but more than that, they&#x27;re healthy!</li>
            <li>The perfect solution for me would have been for them to mail me a new pump</li>
            <li>I have curly hair, and most shampoos leave my hair freeze or i have to use many products to make the curls look good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, they have a very strong, fruity smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain detergent, which most shampoos do, and therefore, allows your hair to look and feel shinier and healthier!  </li>
            <li>Plus I love the scent of both the no-poo shampoo and the one condition separately but when you us them together, the scent is magical!  </li>
            <li>Excellent products for my naturally curly hair with frizz tendencies!</li>
            <li>They are also good and seem to be working fine with my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft and my curls stay perfectly corkscrewed.</li>
            <li>I have used both the no-poo and the one condition for over 3 years with great success.</li>
            <li>I have the best curls on a 52 year old</li>
            <li>However, I suggest you make more of an effort to be courteous and inviting in your reply to your customers.</li>
            <li>Wonderful and the condiyioner leaves the hair feeling do soft.</li>
            <li>the no-poo and one condition smell awesome, made my curls nicer, and made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li>but I grew to enjoy it and the way it gets my hair nice nice nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the Deva duo from three sellers on Amazon now and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo and conditioner, by far, that I&#x27;ve used on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps it nice and shiny while allowing each &amp;#34;curl family&amp;#34; to look bouncy and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase, super value with the combo pack (at times, this price is better than the Subscribe &amp; Save options), and prompt delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>best no-poo and conditioner on the market...makes my curls look great and less frizz..</li>
            <li>Best and only conditioner I will use on my curly-girl hair - absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>Love love love these products!</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE the Deva Curl No Poo shampoo and One Condition condition!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>originally purchased the travel set and loved the smell and feel of my hair after shampooing and conditioning it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff when you are washing your hair, but it smells great when your hair has dried.</li>
            <li>, my hair looks healthy, shiny, and it&#x27;s very strong, never frizzy</li>
            <li>Gets my curls nice and clean!</li>
            <li>and this was great to have during the hot humid months.  </li>
            <li>5 Stars for the product - 0 Stars for the Seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product in general is a great product!</li>
            <li>It feels very light --</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing conditioner and moisturizing conditioner for my fine, curly hair!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this system.  </li>
            <li>still looks great even straight</li>
            <li>Even better, my hair stylist commented that my hair looks healthier than ever.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I have been getting my hair cut more often (</li>
            <li>still looks great even straight</li>
            <li>Even better, my hair stylist commented that my hair looks healthier than ever.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I have been getting my hair cut more often (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and tingling</li>
            <li>and I love all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so glad my stylist put me on to it.</li>
            <li>I love these two products - both</li>
            <li>i really love using this product..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much more pleased w/</li>
            <li>and I have fallen in love with the DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.. been using it for years ...</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I will ever use and it is AWESOME for curly hair peeps.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I simply love it.</li>
            <li>So much love for this product.</li>
            <li>But I love it.</li>
            <li>so those of us with ingredient sensitivities could have more choice.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is okay.</li>
            <li>It made my hair look curlier, for sure, but a drier and frizzier curl than it was before.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not specifically curly hair products, but they keep hair much more moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase, and I&#x27;ll be back for more when my bottles run out.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>curls are looking better already.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the Deva because I color my hair twice a year and perm once a year</li>
            <li>I love the Devacurl line</li>
            <li>Make sure you spread the shampoo evenly across your scalp and you won&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li>I love the product, it works for my hair.</li>
            <li>Healthy hair &amp; less/</li>
            <li>In any case, I am grateful that I have been able to try both at competitive prices and compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, defines curls and has eliminated any frizz from my curly/wavy</li>
            <li>Was so glad it also had pump on the top of each for convenience in the shower.</li>
            <li>And it does not make my curls bouncy and lovely</li>
            <li>Ever since I switched to devacurl my hair has never been in such great shape!  </li>
            <li>It smells great and really gets out the tangles.</li>
            <li>I have tried most salon shampoos - this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have also found that I don&#x27;t have to shampoo my hair as often any more.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you scrunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope this helps you make an important decision!</li>
            <li>I leave most of the conditioner on post shower and scrunch in the gel as I go.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely pleased with the No Poo and One condition products.</li>
            <li>I have been using these hair products for many years</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>The top was supposed to be a pump top that you turn and the pump pops up, but when I turned the top, the top didn&#x27;t pop up.</li>
            <li>All their products are outstanding.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I started using this in August 2012, and we love it.</li>
            <li>It seems pricey but buying it this way is a better deal than shopping at brick and mortar store Ulta.</li>
            <li>Excellent product,  would definitely recommend it to anyone who has out of control frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>They love it...</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the DevaCurl line.</li>
            <li>but hey I love it</li>
            <li>normal/mixed skin make sure it does not fall on your face.</li>
            <li>I have been using these products for about 4 years now and love them.  </li>
            <li>My hair is in much better shape and my curls are better defined.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo with sulphates strips your hair of oils, and your scalp then compensates by creating more oil...</li>
            <li>This is better for my type hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the revamped difuser as well.</li>
            <li>I love the no-poo and one conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have been using both for a while now and love how my hair feels and smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For now, I&#x27;m very very happy with my current regimen.</li>
            <li>So glad I have found a product made just for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner does not build up, is light and also smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Love this product line.  </li>
            <li>Love this combo on my hair.</li>
            <li>Must have for anyone battling curly hair. :)</li>

            <li>I love the smells, too.</li>
            <li>The No-Poo smell is not my favorite, but I think One Condition smells like gumdrops and AnGEL smells like peaches.</li>
            <li>I think most salons will have it, but if they don&#x27;t, ask your hair dresser.</li>
            <li>Love the No poo, still iffy on the condish.</li>
            <li>Been hooked on Deva for years now, nothing else compares and trust me when I tell you I have tried many, many products over the years.</li>

            <li>BUT I love the product she used.</li>

            <li>Love the smell and it works great for naturally frizzy hair</li>
            <li>My hair became kind of matted and yet super poofy</li>
            <li>The NOPOO smells lovely and works easily and well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product because I loved the way my hair felt after washing it</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair!</li>
            <li>My hair looks great, is clean, and I really like the way it smells: not fruity, just a neutral smell, reminds me of something you would smell at a health food store, though I can&#x27;t name it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you right now, i&#x27;d rather pay $16 more than $66!</li>
            <li>But then when comparing prices I realized that DevaCurl was much, much more affordable and would still allow me to use sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li>If you wash your hair in the morning before starting your day the shampoo releases this sweet, minty, flowery, just delicious scent which is so invigorating.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, does wonders for my curly locks, and my hair looks healthier :)</li>
            <li>I love Deva Curl light gel.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo (sulfate free) and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t ever brush my hair anymore, and it somehow looks nice with smooth curls and isn&#x27;t full of dreadlocks.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to say these products are now my staple products for cleansing and conditioning my naturally curly hair (curl pattern 3b).</li>
            <li>I now also use it in combination with deva curl light defining gel and love the combined effect.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair...and DevaCurl makes my hair look great..</li>
            <li>This and an old t-shirt instead of a towel and your hair will be happy.</li>
            <li>Love the chemical free shampoo set.  </li>
            <li>Works great for natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love these products-I like the shampoo better but the conditioner is not bad</li>
            <li>works good, daughter said it works really well</li>
            <li>I have super kinky curly blonde hair and heard about this stuff from a stylist it is the best product I have ever used my hair is bouncy and shiny instead of frizzy.</li>
            <li>My curls are frizz free and shape perfectly on their own with very little product.</li>
            <li>Used it today and my hair looks great!Soft full curls!</li>
            <li>Now my hair looks like the girls in the commercials, but with DevaCurl you ACTUALLY get your hair to look that good!</li>
            <li>The feel and smell is healthy, gentle and amazing.</li>
            <li>arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>With DevaCurl products, my hair stays clean longer and the curls are more pronounced (</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner are creamy and  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard fabulous things about this product, and would love to say that it&#x27;s fantastic, but it&#x27;s been 13 days</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy.</li>
            <li>also love that I can use no-poo and then successfully go a whole day without any kind of frizz, no matter</li>
            <li>I like the Deva Curl products but have quit using them because I have purchased some that have a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>The pumps are nice, but it would be good to get regular caps, too, so I can turn the bottles over as they run out.</li>
            <li>and the smell is just as strong.</li>
            <li>I just wish the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li>I had resigned myself to just having to be ok with super high maintenance hair that looked decent at best...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true, the scent stays with you most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t smell like a sweet fruit basket.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that needs the extra boost for Beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li>Hands down best product for Curls</li>
            <li>Hands down the best.</li>
            <li>Am always surprised at how clean my hair feels and the great texture my curls have when using this.</li>
            <li>but they seem very good for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>The product is fine but the pump on the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work...at all.</li>
            <li>The shampoo seemed fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and color my hair.</li>
            <li>Fine in texture, porous</li>
            <li>My curls (and waves) look neater, more defined, shiny, and just good in general.</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a curly hair girl and ever since I stumbled upon Deva salon and products, my hair has looked fabulous and it&#x27;s been easy to manage.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was fine.</li>
            <li>The product smelled nice and was smoothing during use in the shower, but after more than two weeks of use, my hair was becoming more and more frizzy, dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference after the very first use and the results are getting better with each wash.</li>
            <li>The light defining gel worked just fine</li>
            <li>The gel does make my hair a bit tangled underneath, but that is also because my hair is fine and light weight.</li>
            <li>Its really great, with these large bottles you dont have to buy it very often,  I probably go through 3 bottles of conditioner and 2 bottles of no poo a year.</li>
            <li>The DevaCurl process took some getting used to at first (as did the price!), but I honestly believe it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair and its accompanying frizz was a huge part of my life.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in my hair though.  </li>
            <li>Like Merida huge.</li>
            <li>but the 2 in1 men hair products and after using this for a week he saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten huge compliments on my hair since I started using deva curl.</li>
            <li>It leaves my curls defined and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>DevaCurl is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>It Free, and No Poo shampoo with One Condition</li>
            <li>Not yet sure whether they are worth the money</li>
            <li>Thoughtful botanical extracts and no animal testing make it a conscientious product as well.  </li>
            <li>DevaCurl Frizz Free Foam&lt;br /&gt;Pineapple</li>
            <li>1 pump of DevaCurl Frizz Free Foam.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I find that reapplying a bit of &amp;#34;water downed&amp;#34; conditioner works well as a leave-in conditioner in combination with the cream or light gel.</li>
            <li>It Free product yet from DevaCurl,</li>
            <li>It is sulfate free</li>
            <li>, THIS IS IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>The price is great compared to what you can find locally.</li>
            <li>We have gone sulfate free.</li>
            <li>this stuff works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>A reviewer said to use silicon free products.</li>
            <li>I also use Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Gel and it is great together!!</li>
            <li>Product is great but total pain to get to it.</li>
            <li>I also get the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel to finish off my style after using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now use the Deva shampoo, conditioner, light gel and set-it-free spray.</li>
            <li>this stuff is fabulous</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t use this product until Diva Curl comes out with an unscented, soy free version.</li>
            <li>(Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam,</li>
            <li>my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free</li>
            <li>Product is amazing.. seller not so much</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing the gel, as soon as I run out of my cheap CVS stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few months of use, I cannot say that I am impressed at all.  </li>
            <li>That of course can be remedied with some nice smelling hair styling products, but still, at this price, one would expect a product that doesn&#x27;t smell like it came straight from a chemistry lab.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am trying to learn to enjoy it .. and not straighten it all the time ..</li>
            <li>This is the second time I order this set, and I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I used the Deva Curl Shampoo and Conditioner in conjunction with the Deva Curl light defining gel</li>
            <li>ONE wash and gel using the method detailed for my hair in the book</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to the traditional shampoo/ conditioner cycle...</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m absolutely loving DevaCurl and can&#x27;t wait to try more products in the line.  </li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m absolutely loving DevaCurl and can&#x27;t wait to try more products in the line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products for my curls and none of them have been as good as Deva products.</li>
            <li>I love devacurl and feel it has made my hair much healthier, but when I received the product, I realized most of the product had spilled from the cap into the plastic package it was wrapped in.</li>
            <li>I like the Deva Care just as much as Deva Curl- maybe more, as it seems more hydrating.</li>
            <li>love this product and price was great, arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt better healthy soft n hydrated!!!</li>
            <li>Smells good leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I note that by the end of the 24 hours between washings, it looks a bit more greasy than it does with normal shampoo, but I shower in the mornings in order to activate my curls every day, so that is not a deal breaker, and with longer use, it may even get better (</li>
            <li>this particular purchase, I am thrilled to discover that both bottles have pump dispensers.</li>
            <li>It was great the first wash, my hair was super soft...almost too soft to do anything with actually, and it did smell great.</li>
            <li>I just spray a little more water and the finishing setter that smells good and scrunch it more to set my curls</li>
            <li>I just spray a little more water and the finishing setter that smells good and scrunch it more to set my curls again.  </li>
            <li>Been using their products for about two years, such an amazing improvement in my hair!</li>
            <li>My daughter has had curly hair most of her life and this is the first shampoo she is excited about using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a significant increase in the definition of my curls.</li>
            <li>The shipping of this set was even quicker than originally estimated.</li>
            <li>fun with the curls!</li>
            <li>We originally bought it for me,</li>
            <li>I may continue to use the ultra defining gel, because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>For the One Condition, we don&#x27;t first put it in and rinse and then add more to leave in.</li>
            <li>which means the frizz has diminished significantly).  </li>
            <li>and I was excited to try this product set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m against a long routine so this are great.</li>
            <li>Use it religiously and your hair will love you back with beautiful curls!!!!</li>
            <li>I originally bought a travel kit</li>
            <li>Also on the up side for me is their products are vegan friendly ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone with curly hair, and i&#x27;m sure people with straight hair could even use it!</li>
            <li>They are worth the money!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Thanks D! :)</li>
            <li>Thanks D! :)  </li>
            <li>had my hair cut that way (added in the Deva Curl Set it Free moisture locking spray because I live in a high humidity climate) and it looks beautiful for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting compliments right and left, and best of all, I am finally liberated, because these products truly, really bring out the best in your natural curl.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the DevaCurl concept of not stripping the hair of natural oils needed for healthy locks.....</li>
            <li>Great for curly dry hair.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo and conditioner combo my waves are closer to curls and look great even when I just let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair clean and leaves it silky even without the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The No-Poo gets my scalp clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>they leave my hair clean and well moisturized, and lastly,&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me it smells like clean laundry and  orange blossoms.</li>
            <li>You get used to the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and my hair still feels just as clean.</li>
            <li>The fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather doesn&#x27;t bother me because my hair feels just as clean after washing it out.</li>
            <li>It rinses cleanly and gives hair that slippery feeling.  </li>
            <li>what products I put in my hair because there is a big change in how healthy and nice it looks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confused after so many awesome reviews....</li>
            <li>I can see where this would be great for curly hair because curly hair is SO dry in nature to begin with.</li>
            <li>unlike deva curls, which keeps my daughters hair moisturized and feeling very soft and her curls look amazing.</li>
            <li>I use these products along with T.I.G.I.&#x27;s Curls Rock amplifier and have amazing natural curls!</li>
            <li>While the product may be great, I suggest you find it locally if you want to try it right away.</li>
            <li>and this is gentle but very effective for keeping my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my first super curly, pixie cut--sort of like Halle Berry or Toni Braxton  &#x3D;) since Dec.2014.  </li>
            <li>My hair always feels very clean and dries much smoother with these products that even sulphate free lathering formulas.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on line and cheap enough to afford and easy to order.  </li>
            <li>and I assumed she got some special salon treatment</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it comes in a large quantity.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the DevaCurl products, they cleanse and hydrate my wavy/curly hair like no other and all silicone /sulfate free!</li>
            <li>I received the product on time and the product is great, just what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a gentle shampoo for my curly hair for many years.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t sud much (get over that:-)</li>
            <li>The no-poo cleans my hair without removing moisture, and the conditioner thick and smells great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to smell fruity or perfume-y, or really anything at all most times.  </li>
            <li>If you have ever used real DevaCurl products, you will be able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>It was a lot of straight pieces and wavy on top and some corkscrew curls interspersed throughout.</li>
            <li>My curls hold nicely are soft and bouncy and I get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love that these come together and for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Definitely takes some work and product to make it look good.</li>
            <li>I found that this shampoo/conditioner enhances my curls and leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve actually had someone say that they could smell my hair when I walked into their office and it smelled really good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had someone say that they could smell my hair when I walked into their office and it smelled really good</li>
            <li>I have thick and waivy hair and this product works the best.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much</li>
            <li>I can get a full year out of these.</li>
            <li>Perfect for thick, curly and unruly hair A+++</li>
            <li>my NoPoo wasn&#x27;t full</li>
            <li>My wavy hairs have been transformed into lovely curls, thanks to DevaCurl.</li>
            <li>I have been using Wen for the last 6-10 months and I loved it.</li>
            <li>To me it smells a bit like chemicals, but not bad</li>
            <li>and it was very light, but I personally need more to get definition to say; which is why I switched gels.</li>
            <li>For those who use DevaCurl products you&#x27;re obviously familiar with the distinct smells of each product.</li>
            <li>Not only is DevaCurl a huge bargain based on quality, but it&#x27;s optimized for curly &amp; wavy hair types, and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I just wish there were many more hair care products formulated with a similar philosophy</li>
            <li>Quick delivery from this vendor.  </li>
            <li>but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>The products came as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Lucky me</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair</li>
            <li>next time you have a better buying experience.&amp;#34;  It won&#x27;t be thru them, for sure.</li>
            <li>Love how soft, and curly my hair is when using DevaCurl!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been willing to spend much on beauty products of any kind, but this system really does work for me, and I will be sticking with it!</li>
            <li>Immediatly, the very first time, I felt a difference in the texture and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li>have been using Deva curl for a couple of years now and am very satisfied with the extra curl it gives me.</li>
            <li>The only product that has been able to tame my unruly curls and turn them beautiful!</li>
            <li>LOVE it, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have less fly away and frizzie hairs.</li>
            <li>I think they are particularly good for dry hair, but would work with any hair type.</li>
            <li>Its much healthier and curlier and so easy to manage.</li>
            <li>My daughter has curly and dry hair and loved this shampoo and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that easily becomes a frizzy rats nest.  </li>
            <li>I love deva girl, they have change my life from high maintenance to just the right amount of maintenance.</li>
            <li>I have been using Deva Curl for a really long time now, and I&#x27;m happy I was able to purchase both 32oz bottles at the same time.</li>
            <li>I had pretty much given up on my naturally curly hair ever looking good again.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m still trying to get used to not washing my hair every other day; 5 days is the longest I&#x27;ve gone and could not believe my hair and scalp still smelled nice!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t build up, it smells refreshing without being over-perfumed and it leaves my hair glossy and my curls soft!</li>
            <li>need to get the whole line ladies!!</li>
            <li>TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED!</li>
            <li>It was a huge mess, and I lost a good deal of the product itself.</li>
            <li>I swear my hair has never been so soft and I have tried everything!!!!!  </li>
            <li>DevaCurl really helps my hair get light and curly.</li>
            <li>While they aren&#x27;t cheap, I&#x27;d much rather spend the money and feel great than waste money on what doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li>I use the conditioner alone in between shampooing and make sure to not wash it off completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways DevaCurl No-poo is definitely worth it</li>
            <li>My curls last longer than ever, are bouncier than ever, feel soft, and smell great.  </li>
            <li>This product works far better for me than any kind of foaming shampoo, no matter how natural or gentle they are supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, hair stays really soft.</li>
            <li>I love it more than I expected to.</li>
            <li>I still feel the need to use a regular shampoo maybe once a week, to really get a good lather</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the shampoo.</li>
            <li>they contain healthy ingredients for my naturally curly hair (type 3b),&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra $$ to have nice hair.</li>
            <li>If you want to know if this is worth it?</li>
            <li>the smell of the product line, fresh hair smell</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s different and really nice...</li>
            <li>this stuff works really well, love the smell of the One conditioner, we actually pit it in a spray bottle mixed with water as a spray leave in, works great when you just want to revive your curls with out washing your hair..</li>
            <li>My hair is no longer frizzy and I have nice big bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair is soft, curly, never frizzy with these products.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>far as how well these products work, I am always pleased.</li>
            <li>Yes its costly but worth every penny</li>
            <li>And the price is far better than purchasing it in a salon.</li>
            <li>Shiny, healthy and completely under control.</li>
            <li>It definitely is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The products are not overpowering, they smell fresh and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently used some genuine devacurl product from a travel pack, and my hair feels so much better.</li>
            <li>But I have found that I can dry my hair with a Terri cloth towel while plopping and scrunching to create a nice full head of beachy waves, thus avoiding styling with curling iron.</li>
            <li>the difference I&#x27;ve noticed in the health of my hair is AWESOME, I will never go back to other products.  </li>
            <li>The no poo shampoo is kind of strange at first because it doesn&#x27;t make suds but your hair will definitely be clean.</li>
            <li>Products are as stated, unfortunately not sent as quickly as prime, but that was disclosed.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Her advice was that if I was going to only go with a cream (and not switch my shampoo or conditioner) I&#x27;d be better off going with Livingproof, but I was willing to do the whole system, she thought I&#x27;d like DevaCurl better.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, full of moisture and the curls are so much prettier and more manageable ..</li>
            <li>I followed up with the conditioner, and my hair is still air-drying right now.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>she was right.  </li>
            <li>Mister right, and soommmmee times  </li>
            <li>, I bought the full-size versions of the No-Poo Cleanser and the One Conditioner right away.</li>
            <li>It really does get hair clean without stripping needed oils.  </li>
            <li>Light for sweet soft scrunchy curls.</li>
            <li>Took me a while to get used to the very little/no lather in shampoo, but hair comes out clean without feeling :&amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner like no other.</li>
            <li>You also get a very large quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was astoundingly good for my very long straight  thinning hair.</li>
            <li>If I had to do it over again, I would buy these products but in a smaller size that would fit easily on my shower shelf and in my hands..</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, product is the same as in stores but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased DevaCurl One products separately from Amazon -- No Poo, Low Poo, One Conditioner, &amp; Set It Free, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the smell at first, it will just take a while to get used to, but trust me, it&#x27;s SO WORTH</li>
            <li>The no poo is gentle on my hair and leaves my hair feeling clean and the one condition leaves it soft and make it easy to finger-comb my hair and get the tangles out before i get out the shower.</li>
            <li>is that this older version of the product is likely not as good as the most current formulation.</li>
            <li>And the smell is lovely, yes at the beginning it might be a little overwhelming</li>
            <li>I live overseas, and often times beauty products will not be available to ship to APO addresses, but all stars beauty did with no problem.</li>
            <li>The One Conditioner is an exceptional value, performs as well as any high-end salon brand I&#x27;ve used, and keeps my hair balanced through the different New England seasons.</li>
            <li>Also a great option if you need just a very  mosturizing non harsh type of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I buy the larger sized containers and tend to combine the products as it is more economical to do that.</li>
            <li>It took me a bit to get use to not having any foam when washing my hair, but it leaves my hair soft and very curly and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, very hydrating</li>
            <li>Ordering the bigger bottles online is more cost-effective, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and makes my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>She loves the fact that she can go several days now without her hair becoming super greasy.</li>
            <li>I do not like the Conditioner very much, it leaves my hair straw feeling.</li>
            <li>My hair is very very moisturized and is never ever oily.  </li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner for my dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been fine on my husbands hair</li>
            <li>Now my hair looks good every day, with so little effort.</li>
            <li>It seemed to clean my hair well, and left it detangled and smooth.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle on hair, smell delightful, makes your hair nice, shiny, full of body, and clean without horrible chemicals.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give this five stars is because most of the time, the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>have been through hundreds of products ranging from cheap to seriously expensive and the Deva line is by far the best for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the big bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Devo Curl for several days now, and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>It worked better for me if I use de conditioning only at the ends avoiding the scalp.</li>
            <li>First, I wish that this was a gluten-free formula as I have a wheat allergy</li>
            <li>but it cleans very well!</li>
            <li>It was incredibly thick and makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li>those interested, my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you can just rinse between cleanse days, with just the conditioner by eliminating just the first step above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product and first used it on myself.  </li>
            <li>First I bought the trial kit - wanted to try this product line.</li>
            <li>Where were they my whole life?!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with my very curly hair forever but not anymore!</li>
            <li>These products really work!</li>
            <li>Thanks Deva!</li>
            <li>I always come back because my hair and scalp are so much better using DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li>anyone is interested, here is my hair care routine, too:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will get back to you about with a better review soon....</li>
            <li>I started using the DevaCurl products including the shampoo and conditioner, then had a hair appointment/consultation at a salon with a DevaCurl trained stylist and get much better results now with the instruction I received from the stylist than I had prior.  </li>
            <li>Even when i bleached my hair it only took 2-3 weeks to get healthy again.</li>
            <li>:) These products are your starting point.</li>
            <li>HAD STRAIGHT HAIR, THE BATTLE IS OVER!  </li>
            <li>they do exactly what they&#x27;re intended to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a must have if you have the kind of curls that fluff up</li>
            <li>First this product</li>
            <li>I will continue using this until I come close to running out before I make my final decision about making this a permanent part of my routine. :)</li>
            <li>I went from blowing out my hair every day to allowing my natural curl and Deva product enhanced curls to rain free.  </li>
            <li>but I promise you&#x27;ll be hooked after the first wash.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be of the same quality as the retailer at a better price.</li>
            <li>It is just too much!</li>
            <li>Same stuff you get in your salon for a much more competitive price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>look elsewhere to buy this item - just to be sure I get what I actually paid for.</li>
            <li>Arrived well packaged, on time and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Thank you do much Divs Curl!</li>
            <li>The only gripe I have is that it could smell better.</li>
            <li>but I have had a few people comment on how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li>Now I have to go pay full price at a salon because my wife won&#x27;t use it in her hair (which I am glad because I would have to live in the guest house in the back because I an;t take the smell).</li>
            <li>Anyway - very happy with these products and other DevaCurl styling products I&#x27;ve tried and won&#x27;t be going back to my old routine anytime soon.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different products over the years for my naturally curly hair and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>It has really changed the texture of my daughters hair and is now more tamable, less frizzy and more hydrated than normal.</li>
            <li>Hard to get used to at first with no foam, but it does amazing things for my hair!</li>
            <li>The NoPoo is designed to clean dirt but not remove oil, so it keeps hair from drying out, meaning less frizz and more curl.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, wiry hair and have trouble finding good product to use on it.</li>
            <li>I felt like my hair was so much drier and more fragile after switching to DevaCurl.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it seems to be the only hair care products that don&#x27;t make my hair straight or wavy.</li>
            <li>I am able to get real curl that last day after day.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I first used the shampoo and conditioner was that my hair felt much lighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I bought a large size from this vendor, I will try it and update the review.</li>
            <li>My hair is full and does not lose the color as fast as most other salon shampoos.</li>
            <li>Seemed to be the real deal, and very gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>Finally, I can have clean, beautiful curls without drying out my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li>The only thing I really have to say about it is if you do have hair that is prone to being really oily, make sure you get the low-poo and not the no-poo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do really like tris stuff ;) been using it hor almost a year now</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, I will edit this review after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and curly and these products work really well with no wet look or overly crunchy.</li>
            <li>I live on the coast and it&#x27;s always very hot and very humid.  </li>
            <li>I love my long curly hair now!</li>
            <li>The other products in the trial package are great too, but they last much longer.</li>
            <li>Deva Curl is gentle and light enough that Day 2 hair is just as great as (if not better than) Day 1!</li>
            <li>I also love that when I curl my hair with a curling iron, the curls stay in place and retain their shape without looking dry and wiry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then, after hair is dry, you can slide your fingers under the top layers of hair and hand scrub your scalp to loosen up the curls and then scrunch again the outer curls to break up the cast from the gel.  </li>
            <li>I have issues with dry hair and this worked better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>It eleminates frizz while returning moisture to the hair making curls more defined, bouncy and no longer dry.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair at all &amp; makes it super soft.</li>
            <li>the conditioner has enough slip to easily finger-detangle my curly hair,&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Kind of reminded me of the smell that hits you when you walk into a salon (slightly).</li>
            <li>Just make sure you drip dry.</li>
            <li>but now I love moving the cream through my hair .. and it cured my dry scalp as well .</li>
            <li>Almost as if I smeared pure aloe goo on it.  </li>
            <li>The pumps on these large 32 oz containers do not work.</li>
            <li>I am certain it is because of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I wet my hair on non-wash days and only condition and my hair is clean, smells fresh, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have very long and very curly hair and most products that lather</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with it being extremely dry and itchy in the wintertime and have struggled to find shampoo that is salon-quality AND good for my scalp, but this finally fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with it being extremely dry and itchy in the wintertime and have struggled to find shampoo that is salon-quality AND good for my scalp, but this finally fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially, if you have fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>As long as there is Deva Curl on the market, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any other products (except for my Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner because that stuff is also great)!</li>
            <li>For years I have fought and battled my very curly fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Great product, with a fantastic scent that really accentuates your curls without the excessive drying out feeling that we get from other products.</li>
            <li>The color of the Amazon products are pure white whereas the salon bottle (conditioner, threw out shampoo) product has a light orange tint.</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft, feels clean, my curls are controlled but not stiff!</li>
            <li>I have struggled with my curls my whole life.</li>
            <li>In the summer months I switch to the Lo Poo shampoo - still moisturizing but with MI humidity I need something that cleanses but doesn&#x27;t add as much moisture to my hair as the No Poo.</li>
            <li>Deva curl isn&#x27;t cheap no matter where you look but it definitely does the job!</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>Deva Curl Light Defining Gel (Formerly Angel) 32oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>it cleans your hair very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the Deva Curl Combo.</li>
            <li>My scalp just produces too much oil, and if my hair is \\&quot;trainable\\</li>
            <li>Just that bit of sulfate on my scalp and not that often seems to give my hair what it needs to really shine and look great.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but still struggle with how well the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; cuts the grease in my  hair.</li>
            <li>I use it as directed, but do sometimes comb out my hair gently after showering.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing for curly hair.</li>
            <li>These products has me looking at people with straight hair like &amp;#34;what</li>
            <li>This set, not so much.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon bottles smell very soapy like Dove or another bar soap.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a curly-haired person like me who wants to avoid damaging sulfates, try Deva Curl.</li>
            <li>I need to keep using them for a while to really test how my hair reacts to them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t splurge on much...</li>
            <li>My product arrived very promptly (within a week.)</li>
            <li>one star for  lack of reasonable packaging.</li>
            <li>I am hooked and it is much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but it was the real deal.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really curly (wavy).</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much happier than it used to.</li>
            <li>You can then take a microfiber towel and continue to gently scrunch as you remove</li>
            <li>I have straight hair, but it needs help too.  </li>
            <li>Got it for my friends daughter who has really curly hair.</li>
            <li>I swore I woulnd&#x27;t pay this much for shampoo</li>
            <li>Just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much....</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Really helped my damaged hair....</li>
            <li>I really like what both of these do for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair loves it, my skin not so much.</li>
            <li>But then again too much oil also causes me to break out.</li>
            <li>Also, this product really does fight curly hair frizz.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my curls so much easier to style.</li>
            <li>It works really well and the curls stay hydrated and without frizz for the duration of the day,</li>
            <li>No poo is no lather, but seems to be just what my scalp wants.</li>
            <li>The Handbook by Michelle Bender, who recommends and/or created this product is an absolute must.  </li>
            <li>Its not the real product.</li>
            <li>I really like these products</li>
            <li>This is intended for curly-wavy hair, but can be used on any type of hair since all it really does is add moisture.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair really well</li>
            <li>After 2 days my hair is very greasy looking.</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked for me.</li>
            <li>My mom had straight hair and couldn&#x27;t help me with my problem.</li>
            <li>It detangles really well.</li>
            <li>the conditioner can be used for co-washing,&lt;br /&gt;- they cleanse and condition my hair very well,&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;As described the cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather - doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>You must rinse the product our thoroughly or you risk too much build up.</li>
            <li>the flyaway/frizzy hair syndrome I&#x27;ve always had was so much a part of me</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my hair and makes it very manageable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I lost SO MUCH HAIR using this product.  </li>
            <li>she couldn&#x27;t believe how much hair I&#x27;d lost, she apologized over and over because she introduce it to me</li>
            <li>For those noticing a lot of build-up, there&#x27;s a reason that the whole line doesn&#x27;t contain silicones--don&#x27;t use sulfate-free shampoo like this and think it&#x27;ll remove products with a lot of silicone.</li>
            <li>Absolutely changed my hair.  </li>
            <li>It has saved so much time.</li>
            <li>so the towel doesn&#x27;t absorb too much moisture from your hair.</li>
            <li>This will save you so much money if you use these bottles sparingly</li>
            <li>This really thrills me.</li>
            <li>As well as it looks and feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li>This has worked really well.</li>
            <li>This is not the real product.</li>
            <li>It took some time to get used to the no foaming thing but all in all i really like this project and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to a T and everyone who knows me wants to know what I did to my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like DevaCurl</li>
            <li>So I decided to try something else out for a while to see if my concerns are real.</li>
            <li>And it is much cheaper than the Wen even with having to buy two bottles instead of one.</li>
            <li>The No-Poo is leaving my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with straight hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very perfumey.</li>
            <li>Really encourages the curls and her hair</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and healthy and the wave definition is definitely on par with what I was getting from Livingproof.  </li>
            <li>While in the shower, after cleansing and conditioning with DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition (don&#x27;t squeeze out water after rinsing out conditioner), bend at the waist and apply a generous amount of Ultra Defining Gel to soaking wet hair by coating product gently over the bottom, top and each side of hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair actually curls up more but they are shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>She is growing out her natural color and is trying to get her hair as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li>This really makes her curls come alive!!!</li>
            <li>Love this product as usual, it&#x27;s a great product for curls (especially if you suffer from dry hair like me).</li>
            <li>Upon opening and dispensing for the first time, the product was already loaded and ready to go, unlike the newly packaged shampoo which took about 5 pumps before anything came</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not pictured but the bottles come with pumps which was a pleasant surprise since I usually save a pump from an old bottle just in case.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is OK - other conditioners seem to work as well for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>So, let me preface this by saying I do just fine with normal shampoo and conditioner and daily washings.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to start using a sulfur free shampoo on it once every few weeks to get it thoroughly clean and to help with the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first to try but figured I&#x27;d try it after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li>My hair shines and has body and looks better than with any other hair care product I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; however, I didn&#x27;t notice that this product was more pungent than any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had originally wondered if I just needed to switch shampoos, but after reading some other customers reviews expressing similar problems, I may try purchasing the products from another seller or wesbite to see if they work better.</li>
            <li>Second and third day hair can be even better than first day hair.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to find any other product like it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has been on the &amp;#34;perpetual search&amp;#34; for a hair product that is free from harmful chemicals and actually works!</li>
            <li>Drying method is super important though -- make sure you hang upside down and scrunch a lot of the water out, then dry with an old t-shirt to maximize your results.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t continue to use them because I&#x27;ve found other products more suitable for me, but I definitely recommend this for anyone starting their curly girl method.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great release from all the other coconut/shea butter/olive oil scented shampoos that other curly hair products seem to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo however doesn&#x27;t quiet clean my hair,after a day my hair feels itchy.</li>
            <li>It does not tangle during shampooing and only around a tablespoon to two tablespoons is needed to clean my hair on my one wash day of the week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been struggling for years to find a product kind to my \\&quot;s&#x27;wavy\\&quot; hair, which is loosely curly, wavy, and straight at the same time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to those with curly or very wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the DevaCurl line to anybody - curly hair or straight.</li>
            <li>Before I got a special curly haircut and started using DevaCurl products, my hair was big.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast, I ordered on Thanksgiving and relieved it the next Monday!</li>
            <li>My husband has super curly hair and that is why I purchased it...also hoping I could use it on my relatively straight hair and avoid the sulphates in regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews on here are from people with thick coarse hair who need moisture for their curls and have found love with Devo Curl.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DevaCurl, while a bit pricey, is totally worth it, and you really don&#x27;t use that much of the No-Poo, as you&#x27;re only supposed to cleanse your hair twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>At first, my hair got greasy using it, but it soon djusted and stopped making excess oil because I stopped stripping it of its natural oil.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use these products for a full month before giving a review, but I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and had to switch back.</li>
            <li>I have very thin, fine, curly hair and my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Great product recommend it to anyone with mixed or curly hair even kinky tight hair can benefit!!</li>
            <li>New lifetime user!</li>
            <li>I finally broke down and ordered it and committed to really giving it the good old college try.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and have searched for many years for the right products; some were made my hair stiff, some dryed it out</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;d gotten used to having more bad hair days than good hair days.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, more manageable and much less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about one and one half years and love it.  </li>
            <li>But with a wide tooth comb, I do not rip or break my hair and it easily slips through in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I too wonder if this is an older formulation or product has been diluted.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take multiple rotations, it just requires the middle section to go clockwise and the top section to go counterclockwise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to heavy fragrances which is why I liked the salon version.</li>
            <li>Buyers beware: Sellers are selling their stockpiles of much older version of this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like this product but the fact that there are much older forumations of it floating around on Amazon and sellers aren&#x27;t required to disclose this information</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly but had not been packaged properly and it had leaked out all over.</li>
            <li>We only use it as a leave in, per the instructions from the stylist who cut my daughter&#x27;s hair (10 inches for Locks of Love) taking her to a short, curly style!</li>
            <li>I wash, condition and use the light gel; and my hair stay frizz free for at least 3 days.</li>
            <li>decent scent and seems to leave hair feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>Also, because you only wash your hair once or twice a week with this product, the travel set lasted me nearly a month and gave me an opportunity to try the No-Poo, Conditioner, Light Defining Gel and Set it Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These products have improved the condition of my hair to such an extent that it&#x27;s curling more, and actually looks like something someone might do to their hair on purpose.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived super quick however it is not giving the same effect as the same product I bought in the salon!</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s the real, actual product, not fake.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help all that much with the frizz, but it makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the conditioner because you go through a lot</li>
            <li>It smells like a high end salon, but not in an overly chemically way.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to everyone with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li>where was this product when I was in high school?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to every &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly, but it smelled kind of different than the smaller DevaCurl No-Poo and One Condition I had purchased earlier, and had a different consistency.</li>
            <li>I love having the large bottles so I can refill my small bottles.</li>
            <li>And it leaves my hair clean without being dry.</li>
            <li>which is great for me because sulfates in regular shampoos were destroying my scalp, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>My hair is really shiny now and soft.</li>
            <li>my daughter loves this helps keep her very curly hair under control without getting frizz and keeps it soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also very frizzy and at the first sign of humidity, likes to split all up into a giant frizz</li>
            <li>After a solid 4 weeks of use on my own, I can say I&#x27;ll never go back to &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have had trouble with my curls for many years.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $ in my opinion...lasts a long time too, you don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I use so much of the conditioner, I always run out of it first.  </li>
            <li>DevaCurl has been such a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad strange, though.</li>
            <li>I can easily wear 2nd and 3rd day curls without a problem.  </li>
            <li>*so much less work* than blowing it out and straightening, and I&#x27;m thrilled to finally have found something that will work for me.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I have a lot of thin super curly hair and this is the only hair shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair super soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>If used right this product will actually heal your hair!!!</li>
            <li>I actually have fine, blonde and highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair you cannot live without DevaCurl.</li>
            <li>Being a Curly Girl I couldn&#x27;t live with out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also new to this styling regimen</li>
            <li>Now I have to unscrew th new bottles and squeeze the stuff out of the bottles.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without these products.  </li>
            <li>Live this stuff</li>
            <li>I always buy new items from them that way if I don&#x27;t like it I can return it for a refund.</li>
            <li>Hold it very tight, with pliers if need be, and twist the top section counter clockwise.  </li>
            <li>I have trouble rinsing it out, but overall the smell is really nice and combined with the defining gel</li>
            <li>it was recommended to me by a friend for my daughters hair... since her hair is coarse and very very curly..</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to others that want to show off their natural curls.</li>
            <li>Shampoo in this package is great, conditioner seems watered down to me, compared to other bottles of the same conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li>I mean, I definitely did have good hair days</li>
            <li>I have not had an issue so far with this, so I am risking it!  </li>
            <li>I found the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>pump at the top of the bottle was broken, but the actual conditioner is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive and I have been strictly a cheapest shampoo in the aisle shopper for years, but I bought this stuff because it was remarkable for three days after washing.</li>
            <li>I have used so many products in the past</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and my curls are defined again!</li>
            <li>My first purchase was at her salon, but i began doubting I could afford such prices that were displayed at the establishment.</li>
            <li>I wear glasses, so in the shower, the shampoo and conditioner bottle look exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I bought these to refill the smaller bottles I purchased when I first began using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products for several months now, exactly as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a couple years ago by getting the Brazilian straightening done on my naturally curly hair...DISASTER!  </li>
            <li>and when I wear it straight actually looks better when I don&#x27;t wash it for a few days.  </li>
            <li>and when I wear it straight actually looks better when I don&#x27;t wash it for a few days.  </li>
            <li>Only problem I have is that I never know how clean my hair is when I use the no poo, since I&#x27;m used to the foam of regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, I bought this for the first time in December and recent got new ones.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to wash three or four times to feel like it&#x27;s really clean but wash once maybe twice like any other shampoo</li>
            <li>The conditioner is also great, you can put it in your hair during your shower and rinse it out just a little and leave some conditioner in (like a leave-in) and style as usual.</li>
            <li>it sounds like I might need to use a clarifying shampoo every so often to reduce build up, but for now this seems fine, especially since my hair is naturally dry</li>
            <li>it sounds like I might need to use a clarifying shampoo every so often to reduce build up, but for now this seems fine, especially since my hair is naturally dry</li>
            <li>I have fine, relatively straight and very long hair, and I tried this to help soothe my very dry and irritated scalp.  </li>
            <li>The large bottles last a long time and are worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very sensitive to climate changes and product, I wanted something to enhance the natural textures of my hair.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that it is more perfumy than I like.</li>
            <li>You feel a slightly cool tingly sensation after applying a decent amount, and in my case, I add a little water using my hands to help distribute the product through my hair.</li>
            <li>So much better for my daughter&#x27;s long curly hair than other shampoos.</li>
            <li>Blood under my fingernails from scratching itches, and I still have a large portion of the bottle left.</li>
            <li>After blowdrying, using straightening irons, not leaving the house without checking the&lt;br /&gt;relative humidity (as a teen I tied my hoodie tightly under my neck to avoid frizz at the bus top), all culminating in three Brazilian straightening treatments which made me almost bald from breakage, DEVA CURL HAS CHANGED MY LIFE.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and it works amazing on my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great, low lather, and smells faintly of rosemary.  </li>
            <li>I easily fixed this by applying some Moroccan oil after showering, so this really isn&#x27;t that big of a problem.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair</li>
            <li>THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair</li>
            <li>The conditioner is much the same.</li>
            <li>It keeps my curls soft and well conditioned.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and de tangled.</li>
            <li>It Is as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>Also my hair is all natural no relaxer anymore.</li>
            <li>With this product and a bit of gel, my curls are soft and downright bouncy.</li>
            <li>It reminds me a bit of the old Aveda hair care products....</li>
            <li>I have purchased about every product out that claims to prevent FRIZ and give soft natural curls</li>
            <li>I like that it is moisturizing, yet not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft, And manageable</li>
            <li>I feel completely duped.</li>
            <li>Curly haired old girls like me are so grateful for this product, along with their hair gel-</li>
            <li>I use this on my 3 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li>, I have about 6 inches in shrinkage and my curls are soft and bouncy and defined.</li>
            <li>My order delivered the next day, shipping was fast, thank you.</li>
            <li>I suggest this for anyone with naturally curly hair as well as the Curly Girl e book.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of it natural oils and it leaves my hair so curly and hydrated..</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the product or feel that it helped with my natural curls.</li>
            <li>I know that I personally have tried every solution to try and make my hair straight.</li>
            <li>This is my go-to shampoo and conditioner for natural wavy hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised that I don&#x27;t miss the foam.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t think the poo and conditioner were necessary.  </li>
            <li>My natural curly hair is graying and chemically colored.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it several times from this distributor and the prices are always reasonable and it arrives well packaged and on time.</li>
            <li>I also used to have a problem with my hair getting very oily - especially at my scalp.  </li>
            <li>We both especially like the gentle No Poo.</li>
            <li>No filmy feeling an soft defined curls.</li>
            <li>I cowash with Tresseme Natural and use the One Conditioner as a LI.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, frizzy, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>and I also use it for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>If you were like me, you probably bought the old run-of-the-mill products you can purchase anywhere.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the saving grace for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t retain moisture very well and is coarse.</li>
            <li>I have semi naturally curly hair and</li>
            <li>Once I read the book, and understood my hair (and all the ways that it&#x27;s different from straight hair)</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend who has naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>- just soft and curly.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>If you have naturally curly hair, these products are for you.  </li>
            <li>You need to use it properly though or else you may end up using too much product.</li>
            <li>I do still put a smoothing balm in my hair because it doesn&#x27;t take the frizz completely away.</li>
            <li>I WATCHED THE DEVA CURL VIDEOS AND HAVE BEEN DRYING MY HAIR NATURALLY</li>
            <li>This product has definitely de-poofed my hair, maybe too much.</li>
            <li>We beachy girls tend like natural non smelly stuff.</li>
            <li>Nothing can bit Deva Curls so far.</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans well while keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Your hair will be soft and shiny beyond belief.</li>
            <li>but that could be on account of my hair being totally impenetrable by absolutely any shampoo.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my 2 1/2 year old who has curly hair just like me.</li>
            <li>Find a salon near you that specialize in the \\&quot;Deva Cut\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>look up a salon near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works, curls are soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and Deva Curl</li>
            <li>While I understand that the DevaCurl system is much more expensive compared to the Pantene Pro-V curl line that I was using, I feel like it&#x27;s been worth it.</li>
            <li>So with my busy mom schedule I had to take time to clean up the mess it made.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for having this available for half the price as you would get them in the salon!</li>
            <li>It leaves my impossibly curly hair in beautiful ringlets - softer - and shinier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most other items on the market leave curls feeling dry, heavy and full of product while DevaCurl moisturizes and hides split ends and frizz.</li>
            <li>only sorry that it took so many years for me to find out about the products and the special hair stylist that knows how to cut curly hair.</li>
            <li>I also have kind of half curly, half wavy hair that always just looks like I slept on it.  </li>
            <li>The Dev products get my hair clean without stripping it and let the natural curl come out--the conditioner is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>It was hard convincing my family that I actually had curly hair and wasn&#x27;t about to go live in the jungle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are new to being natural, you should definitely try these products as they cater to curly and natural hair types.</li>
            <li>My hair started out very flat and my curls were practically pulled straight down/out.</li>
            <li>seriously thought my hair looked OK before --</li>
            <li>Then first time using the conditioner it had a stale smell and was more runny than it should have been.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to hydrate your hair more than rinsing it all out - not sure if that actually happens</li>
            <li>It actually makes my curly hair (which is fine to begin with) a little too soft.  </li>
            <li>So, I was hoping this product was a stepped down solution from washing my hair with regular cheap shampoos every day.  </li>
            <li>at least I loved other aspects of my appearance! ...</li>
            <li>My daughter is 11, a low maintenance girl in a high maintenance body.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again and I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>For a long time I thought it didn&#x27;t like my hair wavy, but then realized it was only because I hadn&#x27;t found the right product to style it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping from this vendor was quick and received the packaged just as I was forcing the last dregs out of my empty Deva One Condition bottle.</li>
            <li>I have super curly brown hair with tight curls and a ton of frizz by the scalp</li>
            <li>For all of their products, a lot really does go a long way.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers mentioned, my bottle of No-Poo was only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>I tried many other ones, both cheaper and the more expensive salon brands for curly hair and have always come back to Deva Curl and it keeps curls but gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li>But so far so good, the negative reviews are not accurate and there was no itching or chemical smell to the products.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend and this size lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>I can brush my hair out as it dries and blow dry it for straight hair, or I can twist and scrunch my hair as it air-dries for waves.  </li>
            <li>up straight and \\&quot;don&#x27;t touch\\&quot; your curls again until they are dry.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing for my dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>I learned so much about how to properly care for my hair and that there are different curl types!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d strongly recommend seeing a DevaCurl trained stylist if possible in your area as the use of the products is very different than what I had been doing for my curly hair previously.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product and the extremely strong, old-lady scent forced me to rewash my hair and stop using it.</li>
            <li>So manageable, and not dry at the ends anymore!!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner gives the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down or making it feel waxy.</li>
            <li>The only downside that I find with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Add conditioner, enough that hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li>No other products can compare.</li>
            <li>The only product I will buy for my natural curls!</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner, you only need a small amount so this should last months!  </li>
            <li>You can put some clips on small sections on top to allow the hair to dry with some height.  </li>
            <li>Neither product helps with detangling, my hair was constantly full of knots wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I mean the smell is really strong.</li>
            <li>I have natural very curly dry and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner seems very runny and not particularly moisturizing for my curls.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time spinning the top around endlessly.  </li>
            <li>(I have baby fine, thick, wavy/curly, non-porous hair)</li>
            <li>I have VERY dry hair and these products don&#x27;t seem to maintain the moisture in my hair, although my hair is very curly.</li>
            <li>Deva conditioners don&#x27;t have a lot of slip imo, but love the smell and that they don&#x27;t leave my hair weighted down, even though I do use a little as a leave-in at the end.</li>
            <li>The smell issue is pretty bad on its own but another thing to consider as well</li>
            <li>The title clearly states one conditioner + no poo, however the package is 2 bottles of the same no poo shampoo.</li>
            <li>about 1/2 the time to wear it straight and the rest of the time I scrunch it when wet to wear it wavy.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor, and buy directly from a salon or deva&#x27;s website, which only charges $1 for shipping.</li>
            <li>She is mixed with soft kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li>These two products left my hair soft and moisturized my curls.</li>
            <li>Today, I now embrace my natural curl and have found all Deva hair products to work very well if you go with your natural curl - never to use harsh products or curl/</li>
            <li>After using it for a while, my hair isn&#x27;t quite as soft as it was with the earlier products I was using, but I guess that could be the seasonal change?</li>
            <li>--my local salon offers the 16 oz bottles for $21.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that will consistantly get all the tangles out of my child&#x27;s hair and leaves it soft</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for people who want naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser has suggested going back to my old shampoo and conditioner for a while</li>
            <li>but all in all it didn&#x27;t really do what I had expected it to do to my hair.</li>
            <li>Expensive but so nice for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>The products came in a timely fashion, but one of the bottles came with a broken top.</li>
            <li>It made it thick and lustrous and smooth.</li>
            <li>As for the smell of the shampoo.. not great but not terrible either.</li>
            <li>Follow instructions and watch the video as well as it shows you certain tricks to help as well such as using a microfiber towel to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>This product weighs my hair down with the first use.</li>
            <li>After I got past the first month of using this system (your hair might go through a transition period as it adjusts to this new formula you&#x27;re introducing which has none of the chemicals it&#x27;s used to if you&#x27;ve been using products with parabens and sulfates etc...)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a curly girl, before you start using these products or continue to use these products, go get a dry haircut by someone who is experienced in cutting curly hair.</li>
            <li>I mean huge.</li>
            <li>I cannot cut out my use of oil completely, my scalp still needs a little jojoba oil once a day, but for the most part, I don&#x27;t need any other extra heavy creams or balms so much.</li>
            <li>I constantly had the &#x27;lampshade effect&#x27; (flat on top, blown out at the bottom, you fellow curly girls will know what I mean).</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, but it is quite fine and thin.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is very coarse, very dry, very knotty ... and this product is truly a miracle.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I used to with other products since the No Poo shampoo is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have used this product from the store and loved it, but when I received these products they smell poorly and even stung my scalp a little.</li>
            <li>It is INCREDIBLY EXTREMELY THICK, which makes it look awfully HUGE and puffy (as one of the other comments said, Merida huge), extremely frizzy, and very textured, so I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a product that can make my hair look less… of well, all of that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Deva Curl is the only shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve found that makes my hair feel soft and actually reduces the frizz.</li>
            <li>, he likes it enough so far, but hates the price and probably will be deterred by future use on that count alone.</li>
            <li>Not dry, not frizzy or crunchy</li>
            <li>The way my hair feels after shampooing, not dry or stripped&lt;br</li>
            <li>does not dry out my hair and it is not tangled when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Its very very watered down!</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about it at first because I&#x27;m so used to the bubbly and foamy shampoos, and I have naturally curly hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow out more.</li>
            <li>Huge bottles, hands wet no pumps not easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>I normally wash twice a week, with dry shampoo on the last day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite apparent no product works the same on everyone.</li>
            <li>* update: I&#x27;m switching to 5 stars because I am (strangely) no longer bothered by the smell of shampoo.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t mind and figured the smell would go away after wearing it for a few days, but I&#x27;m now on day three</li>
            <li>Then when the top is still wet but underneath is dry, squirt about the size of a nickel into your hand, rub your hands together, rub a little of your fingertips, then SCRUNCH!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dry enough where I live, and sudsing shampoos just compound this problem.  </li>
            <li>It really softens my curls and doesn&#x27;t weigh them down.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry my  hair, my natural curl responds well to the line.</li>
            <li>I have straightened with Keratin, Blown dry, tried to go natural and used every product from Wen to Dr. Miracle.</li>
            <li>In the book they teach you things like how you should dry your hair with an old t-shirt rather than a terry cloth towel</li>
            <li>I try to aoid lathering products because I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out or break out.</li>
            <li>My hair is considered to be straight with slight wave.</li>
            <li>I have super thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>The aroma is pleasant but a little weird.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using the product made my own shampoo using Coconut Milk Cream and a few other oils and tiny bit of baking soda and used Apple Cider Vinegar as my conditioner and a few months later</li>
            <li>yes I could send it back half empty but is it worth it</li>
            <li>Not tight, corkscrew curls or anything, just waves and some loose curls thrown in.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems like the No Poo scent is a bit stronger than the Low Poo scent, and the floral is a little too much for me.</li>
            <li>Now I shower, put in a little extra One Condition before getting out, then put in a touch of the DevaCurl Style Gel after GENTLY drying my hair with a towel.</li>

            <li> (just wish my salon would carry DevaCurl products so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to bring my own!.)</li>
            <li> Love DevaCurl products, they&#x27;re wonderful for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price is great!</li>
            <li> (I wash my hair every 3 days or so) you will be thrilled!</li>
            <li> An awesome duo that I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> No complaints, just curly, healthy,  and happy hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many products with disappointments and almost gave up and told myself that that was the best my hair can get.</li>
            <li> Best hair shampoo and conditioner I have ever used, I like it much better then WEN</li>
            <li> That said, it is a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t pleasant.  </li>
            <li> , I strongly recomend researching this product on Amazon for the best deal before buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> So happy I tried these......loving my hair/curls more than ever!</li>
            <li> great products, love the conditioner!</li>
            <li> this is a great product for curly hair, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and happy to be able to purchase using prime.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Since I got this shampoo I got a lot of compliments on how good my hair smells</li>
            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> Good luck and don&#x27;t hurt</li>
            <li> I think this is a faulty product from this company because when I&#x27;ve used devacurl before I loved it this just made my hair frizzy</li>
            <li> Over all, I think this is a good hair set.</li>
            <li> so it does not lather but still cleans my hair and scalp and smells good too.  </li>
            <li> reliable, good shipping.</li>
            <li> It just felt so good and looked so good.</li>
            <li> This stuff doe some good detangling as well</li>
            <li> Combined with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather, AT ALL, I felt like there was no way it was doing any good.</li>
            <li> But the No-Poo DID do good.</li>
            <li> I look like a semi-drowned rat for awhile, but when my hair dries, it looks like those far-and-few-between good hair days</li>
            <li> and I LOVED the smell of all the products</li>
            <li> fact that my hair and scalp still smell good between washes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD TOO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled to find a good moisturizing shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> It helps maintaining curls and is good for your hair.  </li>
            <li> DevaCurl products are of good quality.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather, but it smells really good, it conditions, and I can see that it&#x27;s cleansing after I rinse.</li>
            <li> The cleanser and the conditioner both offer good slip for combing your hair out.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stink it just doesn&#x27;t smell good to me.</li>
            <li> The No Poo shampoo is perfect for the cold/dry weather months in MI and keeps my hair clean but moisturized.</li>
            <li> At first I had to adjust the amount of the products I used to get the best results but my Deva stylist is a great resource for that too.</li>
            <li> It works best for your hair if you use the shampoo with another more moisturizing conditioner OR if you use another sulfate-free shampoo (even the low-pow would be better) and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Set it free works great and smells great.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and my hair has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I already use this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conditioner: I am very pleased with the One Conditioner.</li>
            <li> they smell very refreshing like rosemary or peppermint,&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Good product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with these products and the results I get.  </li>
            <li> this is a great deal for $50 with free ship!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have good hair.</li>
            <li> Either way, I love this product!</li>
            <li> Get the trial sizes first so you can figure out what works best for your type of hair.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff!</li>
            <li> Glad I found it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ALL!</li>
            <li> It took about a month to acclimate to it, but my hair is consistently softer than before and looks great!</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The hair gel is magical too!  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combo!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> out!&lt;br /&gt;The large size works great for 2!</li>
            <li> The smell is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> My hair looks amazing every time I use it, and smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great no-sulfate and silicone free products.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Once I switched to DevaCurl, my curls bounced up so amazingly well that even my stylist commented that my hair seemed to be getting curlier every time she saw me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing price for a set.</li>
            <li> But the way this product makes my hair shine and curl and bounce is amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> Since we have started using, both of our hair is easier to manage and I get compliments all the time on how nice my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> by a colleague who is also a curly head, I knew I liked what it was doing to her hair.</li>
            <li> I not only recommend this product because I have found it to be wonderful and to smell great</li>
            <li> This is the best system for my very curly hair ever.  </li>
            <li> Nice with color-treated hair too.</li>
            <li> The No-Poo and the conditioner have a nice floral smell (in my opinion), and they both have a nice creamy texture.</li>
            <li> husband has curly hair, too, and he decided to use this when he ran out of his own products.</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> - I HAVE THE MOST GORGEOUS NO</li>
            <li> I liked using the No-Poo, it felt creamy and silky, and a bit tingly.  </li>
            <li> This kind of washing process (cleansing/conditioning) was recommended for my hair type - and this product is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does have a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I would be so greatful and a thrilled user if you took the scent out and the soy out.</li>
            <li> Girls is your hair is curly, these are the products to own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now going to try Milk for Hair, as I&#x27;ve heard many good things about it.</li>
            <li> And it also smells good :)</li>
            <li> While the No-Poo isn&#x27;t the best scented shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, it really helps keep the frizz under control.</li>
            <li> I will never use any thing else to wash with, totally worth the cost!!!</li>
            <li> Great products  leaves curly/wavy hair clean smelling and manageable.</li>
            <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on leaving you with a clean hair</li>
            <li> Best curly hair products on the market, I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner ever for those with naturally curly hair!!</li>
            <li> My curls look amazing, but more than that, they&#x27;re healthy!</li>
            <li> The perfect solution for me would have been for them to mail me a new pump</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and most shampoos leave my hair freeze or i have to use many products to make the curls look good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, they have a very strong, fruity smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain detergent, which most shampoos do, and therefore, allows your hair to look and feel shinier and healthier!  </li>
            <li> Plus I love the scent of both the no-poo shampoo and the one condition separately but when you us them together, the scent is magical!  </li>
            <li> Excellent products for my naturally curly hair with frizz tendencies!</li>
            <li> They are also good and seem to be working fine with my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft and my curls stay perfectly corkscrewed.</li>
            <li> I have used both the no-poo and the one condition for over 3 years with great success.</li>
            <li> I have the best curls on a 52 year old</li>
            <li> However, I suggest you make more of an effort to be courteous and inviting in your reply to your customers.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and the condiyioner leaves the hair feeling do soft.</li>
            <li> the no-poo and one condition smell awesome, made my curls nicer, and made my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li> but I grew to enjoy it and the way it gets my hair nice nice nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the Deva duo from three sellers on Amazon now and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner, by far, that I&#x27;ve used on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps it nice and shiny while allowing each &amp;#34;curl family&amp;#34; to look bouncy and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Great purchase, super value with the combo pack (at times, this price is better than the Subscribe &amp; Save options), and prompt delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> best no-poo and conditioner on the market...makes my curls look great and less frizz..</li>
            <li> Best and only conditioner I will use on my curly-girl hair - absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> Love love love these products!</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE the Deva Curl No Poo shampoo and One Condition condition!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> originally purchased the travel set and loved the smell and feel of my hair after shampooing and conditioning it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff when you are washing your hair, but it smells great when your hair has dried.</li>
            <li> , my hair looks healthy, shiny, and it&#x27;s very strong, never frizzy</li>
            <li> Gets my curls nice and clean!</li>
            <li> and this was great to have during the hot humid months.  </li>
            <li> 5 Stars for the product - 0 Stars for the Seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product in general is a great product!</li>
            <li> It feels very light --</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner and moisturizing conditioner for my fine, curly hair!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this system.  </li>
            <li> still looks great even straight</li>
            <li> Even better, my hair stylist commented that my hair looks healthier than ever.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I have been getting my hair cut more often (</li>
            <li> still looks great even straight</li>
            <li> Even better, my hair stylist commented that my hair looks healthier than ever.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I have been getting my hair cut more often (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and tingling</li>
            <li> and I love all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am so glad my stylist put me on to it.</li>
            <li> I love these two products - both</li>
            <li> i really love using this product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much more pleased w/</li>
            <li> and I have fallen in love with the DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. been using it for years ...</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I will ever use and it is AWESOME for curly hair peeps.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I simply love it.</li>
            <li> So much love for this product.</li>
            <li> But I love it.</li>
            <li> so those of us with ingredient sensitivities could have more choice.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is okay.</li>
            <li> It made my hair look curlier, for sure, but a drier and frizzier curl than it was before.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not specifically curly hair products, but they keep hair much more moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase, and I&#x27;ll be back for more when my bottles run out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> curls are looking better already.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Deva because I color my hair twice a year and perm once a year</li>
            <li> I love the Devacurl line</li>
            <li> Make sure you spread the shampoo evenly across your scalp and you won&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it works for my hair.</li>
            <li> Healthy hair &amp; less/</li>
            <li> In any case, I am grateful that I have been able to try both at competitive prices and compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, defines curls and has eliminated any frizz from my curly/wavy</li>
            <li> Was so glad it also had pump on the top of each for convenience in the shower.</li>
            <li> And it does not make my curls bouncy and lovely</li>
            <li> Ever since I switched to devacurl my hair has never been in such great shape!  </li>
            <li> It smells great and really gets out the tangles.</li>
            <li> I have tried most salon shampoos - this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have also found that I don&#x27;t have to shampoo my hair as often any more.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you scrunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope this helps you make an important decision!</li>
            <li> I leave most of the conditioner on post shower and scrunch in the gel as I go.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely pleased with the No Poo and One condition products.</li>
            <li> I have been using these hair products for many years</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> The top was supposed to be a pump top that you turn and the pump pops up, but when I turned the top, the top didn&#x27;t pop up.</li>
            <li> All their products are outstanding.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I started using this in August 2012, and we love it.</li>
            <li> It seems pricey but buying it this way is a better deal than shopping at brick and mortar store Ulta.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  would definitely recommend it to anyone who has out of control frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> They love it...</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the DevaCurl line.</li>
            <li> but hey I love it</li>
            <li> normal/mixed skin make sure it does not fall on your face.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about 4 years now and love them.  </li>
            <li> My hair is in much better shape and my curls are better defined.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo with sulphates strips your hair of oils, and your scalp then compensates by creating more oil...</li>
            <li> This is better for my type hair.  </li>
            <li> Love the revamped difuser as well.</li>
            <li> I love the no-poo and one conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using both for a while now and love how my hair feels and smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> More effort needed, however, to improve packaging so the bottles arrive without damaged caps.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of after going to the salon, which I love also.</li>

            <li> I love Deva Curl and the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I payed more at the salon for the 8oz.</li>
            <li> my experience with all of them together is fantastic!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product</li>

            <li> She says her hair has never felt better and it easier to manage.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, I love Deva and have been using it forever.</li>
            <li> love it My daughter in law put me on this product.  </li>
            <li> Really glad another curly haired friend recommended it to us. :)</li>
            <li> My hair looks nice and clean after washing it as directed.  </li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel clean on its own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product and really helps curly girls embrace and enjoy their fun</li>
            <li> This set is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Also the shipping was prompt and in good condition, thanks!</li>
            <li> so I gave it three because it still does pretty good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the clean tingly feeliing and most of all, I love how shiny, healthy and bouncy</li>
            <li> This stuff made my curls curlier, spiral and calm!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works great for naturally frizzy hair</li>
            <li> My hair became kind of matted and yet super poofy</li>
            <li> The NOPOO smells lovely and works easily and well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because I loved the way my hair felt after washing it</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair!</li>
            <li> My hair looks great, is clean, and I really like the way it smells: not fruity, just a neutral smell, reminds me of something you would smell at a health food store, though I can&#x27;t name it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you right now, i&#x27;d rather pay $16 more than $66!</li>
            <li> But then when comparing prices I realized that DevaCurl was much, much more affordable and would still allow me to use sulfate free products.  </li>
            <li> If you wash your hair in the morning before starting your day the shampoo releases this sweet, minty, flowery, just delicious scent which is so invigorating.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, does wonders for my curly locks, and my hair looks healthier :)</li>
            <li> I love Deva Curl light gel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo (sulfate free) and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t ever brush my hair anymore, and it somehow looks nice with smooth curls and isn&#x27;t full of dreadlocks.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to say these products are now my staple products for cleansing and conditioning my naturally curly hair (curl pattern 3b).</li>
            <li> I now also use it in combination with deva curl light defining gel and love the combined effect.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair...and DevaCurl makes my hair look great..</li>
            <li> This and an old t-shirt instead of a towel and your hair will be happy.</li>
            <li> Love the chemical free shampoo set.  </li>
            <li> Works great for natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love these products-I like the shampoo better but the conditioner is not bad</li>
            <li> works good, daughter said it works really well</li>
            <li> I have super kinky curly blonde hair and heard about this stuff from a stylist it is the best product I have ever used my hair is bouncy and shiny instead of frizzy.</li>
            <li> My curls are frizz free and shape perfectly on their own with very little product.</li>
            <li> Used it today and my hair looks great!Soft full curls!</li>
            <li> Now my hair looks like the girls in the commercials, but with DevaCurl you ACTUALLY get your hair to look that good!</li>
            <li> The feel and smell is healthy, gentle and amazing.</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> With DevaCurl products, my hair stays clean longer and the curls are more pronounced (</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner are creamy and  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard fabulous things about this product, and would love to say that it&#x27;s fantastic, but it&#x27;s been 13 days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy.</li>
            <li> also love that I can use no-poo and then successfully go a whole day without any kind of frizz, no matter</li>
            <li> I like the Deva Curl products but have quit using them because I have purchased some that have a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> The pumps are nice, but it would be good to get regular caps, too, so I can turn the bottles over as they run out.</li>
            <li> and the smell is just as strong.</li>
            <li> I just wish the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong.</li>
            <li> I had resigned myself to just having to be ok with super high maintenance hair that looked decent at best...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true, the scent stays with you most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t smell like a sweet fruit basket.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that needs the extra boost for Beautiful curls.  </li>
            <li> Hands down best product for Curls</li>
            <li> Hands down the best.</li>
            <li> Am always surprised at how clean my hair feels and the great texture my curls have when using this.</li>
            <li> but they seem very good for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> The product is fine but the pump on the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work...at all.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seemed fine</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and color my hair.</li>
            <li> Fine in texture, porous</li>
            <li> My curls (and waves) look neater, more defined, shiny, and just good in general.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a curly hair girl and ever since I stumbled upon Deva salon and products, my hair has looked fabulous and it&#x27;s been easy to manage.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was fine.</li>
            <li> The product smelled nice and was smoothing during use in the shower, but after more than two weeks of use, my hair was becoming more and more frizzy, dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference after the very first use and the results are getting better with each wash.</li>
            <li> The light defining gel worked just fine</li>
            <li> The gel does make my hair a bit tangled underneath, but that is also because my hair is fine and light weight.</li>
            <li> Its really great, with these large bottles you dont have to buy it very often,  I probably go through 3 bottles of conditioner and 2 bottles of no poo a year.</li>
            <li> The DevaCurl process took some getting used to at first (as did the price!), but I honestly believe it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair and its accompanying frizz was a huge part of my life.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in my hair though.  </li>
            <li> Like Merida huge.</li>
            <li> but the 2 in1 men hair products and after using this for a week he saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten huge compliments on my hair since I started using deva curl.</li>
            <li> It leaves my curls defined and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> DevaCurl is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> It Free, and No Poo shampoo with One Condition</li>
            <li> Not yet sure whether they are worth the money</li>
            <li> Thoughtful botanical extracts and no animal testing make it a conscientious product as well.  </li>
            <li> DevaCurl Frizz Free Foam&lt;br /&gt;Pineapple</li>
            <li> 1 pump of DevaCurl Frizz Free Foam.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I find that reapplying a bit of &amp;#34;water downed&amp;#34; conditioner works well as a leave-in conditioner in combination with the cream or light gel.</li>
            <li> It Free product yet from DevaCurl,</li>
            <li> It is sulfate free</li>
            <li> , THIS IS IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> The price is great compared to what you can find locally.</li>
            <li> We have gone sulfate free.</li>
            <li> this stuff works fantastic.  </li>
            <li> A reviewer said to use silicon free products.</li>
            <li> I also use Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Gel and it is great together!!</li>
            <li> Product is great but total pain to get to it.</li>
            <li> I also get the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel to finish off my style after using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now use the Deva shampoo, conditioner, light gel and set-it-free spray.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fabulous</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t use this product until Diva Curl comes out with an unscented, soy free version.</li>
            <li> (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam,</li>
            <li> my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free</li>
            <li> Product is amazing.. seller not so much</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the gel, as soon as I run out of my cheap CVS stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few months of use, I cannot say that I am impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> That of course can be remedied with some nice smelling hair styling products, but still, at this price, one would expect a product that doesn&#x27;t smell like it came straight from a chemistry lab.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am trying to learn to enjoy it .. and not straighten it all the time ..</li>
            <li> This is the second time I order this set, and I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I used the Deva Curl Shampoo and Conditioner in conjunction with the Deva Curl light defining gel</li>
            <li> ONE wash and gel using the method detailed for my hair in the book</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the traditional shampoo/ conditioner cycle...</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m absolutely loving DevaCurl and can&#x27;t wait to try more products in the line.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m absolutely loving DevaCurl and can&#x27;t wait to try more products in the line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products for my curls and none of them have been as good as Deva products.</li>
            <li> I love devacurl and feel it has made my hair much healthier, but when I received the product, I realized most of the product had spilled from the cap into the plastic package it was wrapped in.</li>
            <li> I like the Deva Care just as much as Deva Curl- maybe more, as it seems more hydrating.</li>
            <li> love this product and price was great, arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better healthy soft n hydrated!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good leaves my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I note that by the end of the 24 hours between washings, it looks a bit more greasy than it does with normal shampoo, but I shower in the mornings in order to activate my curls every day, so that is not a deal breaker, and with longer use, it may even get better (</li>
            <li> this particular purchase, I am thrilled to discover that both bottles have pump dispensers.</li>
            <li> It was great the first wash, my hair was super soft...almost too soft to do anything with actually, and it did smell great.</li>
            <li> I just spray a little more water and the finishing setter that smells good and scrunch it more to set my curls</li>
            <li> I just spray a little more water and the finishing setter that smells good and scrunch it more to set my curls again.  </li>
            <li> Been using their products for about two years, such an amazing improvement in my hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter has had curly hair most of her life and this is the first shampoo she is excited about using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a significant increase in the definition of my curls.</li>
            <li> The shipping of this set was even quicker than originally estimated.</li>
            <li> fun with the curls!</li>
            <li> We originally bought it for me,</li>
            <li> I may continue to use the ultra defining gel, because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> For the One Condition, we don&#x27;t first put it in and rinse and then add more to leave in.</li>
            <li> which means the frizz has diminished significantly).  </li>
            <li> and I was excited to try this product set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m against a long routine so this are great.</li>
            <li> Use it religiously and your hair will love you back with beautiful curls!!!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought a travel kit</li>
            <li> Also on the up side for me is their products are vegan friendly ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone with curly hair, and i&#x27;m sure people with straight hair could even use it!</li>
            <li> They are worth the money!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Thanks D! :)</li>
            <li> Thanks D! :)  </li>
            <li> had my hair cut that way (added in the Deva Curl Set it Free moisture locking spray because I live in a high humidity climate) and it looks beautiful for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting compliments right and left, and best of all, I am finally liberated, because these products truly, really bring out the best in your natural curl.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and the DevaCurl concept of not stripping the hair of natural oils needed for healthy locks.....</li>
            <li> Great for curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo and conditioner combo my waves are closer to curls and look great even when I just let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> It gets my hair clean and leaves it silky even without the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The No-Poo gets my scalp clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> they leave my hair clean and well moisturized, and lastly,&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me it smells like clean laundry and  orange blossoms.</li>
            <li> You get used to the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and my hair still feels just as clean.</li>
            <li> The fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather doesn&#x27;t bother me because my hair feels just as clean after washing it out.</li>
            <li> It rinses cleanly and gives hair that slippery feeling.  </li>
            <li> what products I put in my hair because there is a big change in how healthy and nice it looks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused after so many awesome reviews....</li>
            <li> I can see where this would be great for curly hair because curly hair is SO dry in nature to begin with.</li>
            <li> unlike deva curls, which keeps my daughters hair moisturized and feeling very soft and her curls look amazing.</li>
            <li> I use these products along with T.I.G.I.&#x27;s Curls Rock amplifier and have amazing natural curls!</li>
            <li> While the product may be great, I suggest you find it locally if you want to try it right away.</li>
            <li> and this is gentle but very effective for keeping my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first super curly, pixie cut--sort of like Halle Berry or Toni Braxton  &#x3D;) since Dec.2014.  </li>
            <li> My hair always feels very clean and dries much smoother with these products that even sulphate free lathering formulas.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it on line and cheap enough to afford and easy to order.  </li>
            <li> and I assumed she got some special salon treatment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it comes in a large quantity.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the DevaCurl products, they cleanse and hydrate my wavy/curly hair like no other and all silicone /sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and the product is great, just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a gentle shampoo for my curly hair for many years.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t sud much (get over that:-)</li>
            <li> The no-poo cleans my hair without removing moisture, and the conditioner thick and smells great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to smell fruity or perfume-y, or really anything at all most times.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever used real DevaCurl products, you will be able to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> It was a lot of straight pieces and wavy on top and some corkscrew curls interspersed throughout.</li>
            <li> My curls hold nicely are soft and bouncy and I get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love that these come together and for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Definitely takes some work and product to make it look good.</li>
            <li> I found that this shampoo/conditioner enhances my curls and leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually had someone say that they could smell my hair when I walked into their office and it smelled really good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had someone say that they could smell my hair when I walked into their office and it smelled really good</li>
            <li> I have thick and waivy hair and this product works the best.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much</li>
            <li> I can get a full year out of these.</li>
            <li> Perfect for thick, curly and unruly hair A+++</li>
            <li> my NoPoo wasn&#x27;t full</li>
            <li> My wavy hairs have been transformed into lovely curls, thanks to DevaCurl.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for the last 6-10 months and I loved it.</li>
            <li> To me it smells a bit like chemicals, but not bad</li>
            <li> and it was very light, but I personally need more to get definition to say; which is why I switched gels.</li>
            <li> For those who use DevaCurl products you&#x27;re obviously familiar with the distinct smells of each product.</li>
            <li> Not only is DevaCurl a huge bargain based on quality, but it&#x27;s optimized for curly &amp; wavy hair types, and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I just wish there were many more hair care products formulated with a similar philosophy</li>
            <li> Quick delivery from this vendor.  </li>
            <li> but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> The products came as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Lucky me</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair</li>
            <li> next time you have a better buying experience.&amp;#34;  It won&#x27;t be thru them, for sure.</li>
            <li> Love how soft, and curly my hair is when using DevaCurl!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been willing to spend much on beauty products of any kind, but this system really does work for me, and I will be sticking with it!</li>
            <li> Immediatly, the very first time, I felt a difference in the texture and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> have been using Deva curl for a couple of years now and am very satisfied with the extra curl it gives me.</li>
            <li> The only product that has been able to tame my unruly curls and turn them beautiful!</li>
            <li> LOVE it, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have less fly away and frizzie hairs.</li>
            <li> I think they are particularly good for dry hair, but would work with any hair type.</li>
            <li> Its much healthier and curlier and so easy to manage.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly and dry hair and loved this shampoo and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that easily becomes a frizzy rats nest.  </li>
            <li> I love deva girl, they have change my life from high maintenance to just the right amount of maintenance.</li>
            <li> I have been using Deva Curl for a really long time now, and I&#x27;m happy I was able to purchase both 32oz bottles at the same time.</li>
            <li> I had pretty much given up on my naturally curly hair ever looking good again.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m still trying to get used to not washing my hair every other day; 5 days is the longest I&#x27;ve gone and could not believe my hair and scalp still smelled nice!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t build up, it smells refreshing without being over-perfumed and it leaves my hair glossy and my curls soft!</li>
            <li> need to get the whole line ladies!!</li>
            <li> TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED!</li>
            <li> It was a huge mess, and I lost a good deal of the product itself.</li>
            <li> I swear my hair has never been so soft and I have tried everything!!!!!  </li>
            <li> DevaCurl really helps my hair get light and curly.</li>
            <li> While they aren&#x27;t cheap, I&#x27;d much rather spend the money and feel great than waste money on what doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner alone in between shampooing and make sure to not wash it off completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways DevaCurl No-poo is definitely worth it</li>
            <li> My curls last longer than ever, are bouncier than ever, feel soft, and smell great.  </li>
            <li> This product works far better for me than any kind of foaming shampoo, no matter how natural or gentle they are supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, hair stays really soft.</li>
            <li> I love it more than I expected to.</li>
            <li> I still feel the need to use a regular shampoo maybe once a week, to really get a good lather</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about the shampoo.</li>
            <li> they contain healthy ingredients for my naturally curly hair (type 3b),&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra $$ to have nice hair.</li>
            <li> If you want to know if this is worth it?</li>
            <li> the smell of the product line, fresh hair smell</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s different and really nice...</li>
            <li> this stuff works really well, love the smell of the One conditioner, we actually pit it in a spray bottle mixed with water as a spray leave in, works great when you just want to revive your curls with out washing your hair..</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer frizzy and I have nice big bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair is soft, curly, never frizzy with these products.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> far as how well these products work, I am always pleased.</li>
            <li> Yes its costly but worth every penny</li>
            <li> And the price is far better than purchasing it in a salon.</li>
            <li> Shiny, healthy and completely under control.</li>
            <li> It definitely is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The products are not overpowering, they smell fresh and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently used some genuine devacurl product from a travel pack, and my hair feels so much better.</li>
            <li> But I have found that I can dry my hair with a Terri cloth towel while plopping and scrunching to create a nice full head of beachy waves, thus avoiding styling with curling iron.</li>
            <li> the difference I&#x27;ve noticed in the health of my hair is AWESOME, I will never go back to other products.  </li>
            <li> The no poo shampoo is kind of strange at first because it doesn&#x27;t make suds but your hair will definitely be clean.</li>
            <li> Products are as stated, unfortunately not sent as quickly as prime, but that was disclosed.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, product is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Her advice was that if I was going to only go with a cream (and not switch my shampoo or conditioner) I&#x27;d be better off going with Livingproof, but I was willing to do the whole system, she thought I&#x27;d like DevaCurl better.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, full of moisture and the curls are so much prettier and more manageable ..</li>
            <li> I followed up with the conditioner, and my hair is still air-drying right now.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> she was right.  </li>
            <li> Mister right, and soommmmee times  </li>
            <li> , I bought the full-size versions of the No-Poo Cleanser and the One Conditioner right away.</li>
            <li> It really does get hair clean without stripping needed oils.  </li>
            <li> Light for sweet soft scrunchy curls.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to get used to the very little/no lather in shampoo, but hair comes out clean without feeling :&amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner like no other.</li>
            <li> You also get a very large quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was astoundingly good for my very long straight  thinning hair.</li>
            <li> If I had to do it over again, I would buy these products but in a smaller size that would fit easily on my shower shelf and in my hands..</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, product is the same as in stores but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased DevaCurl One products separately from Amazon -- No Poo, Low Poo, One Conditioner, &amp; Set It Free, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell at first, it will just take a while to get used to, but trust me, it&#x27;s SO WORTH</li>
            <li> The no poo is gentle on my hair and leaves my hair feeling clean and the one condition leaves it soft and make it easy to finger-comb my hair and get the tangles out before i get out the shower.</li>
            <li> is that this older version of the product is likely not as good as the most current formulation.</li>
            <li> And the smell is lovely, yes at the beginning it might be a little overwhelming</li>
            <li> I live overseas, and often times beauty products will not be available to ship to APO addresses, but all stars beauty did with no problem.</li>
            <li> The One Conditioner is an exceptional value, performs as well as any high-end salon brand I&#x27;ve used, and keeps my hair balanced through the different New England seasons.</li>
            <li> Also a great option if you need just a very  mosturizing non harsh type of shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I buy the larger sized containers and tend to combine the products as it is more economical to do that.</li>
            <li> It took me a bit to get use to not having any foam when washing my hair, but it leaves my hair soft and very curly and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, very hydrating</li>
            <li> Ordering the bigger bottles online is more cost-effective, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> It has a light scent and makes my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> She loves the fact that she can go several days now without her hair becoming super greasy.</li>
            <li> I do not like the Conditioner very much, it leaves my hair straw feeling.</li>
            <li> My hair is very very moisturized and is never ever oily.  </li>
            <li> I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner for my dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been fine on my husbands hair</li>
            <li> Now my hair looks good every day, with so little effort.</li>
            <li> It seemed to clean my hair well, and left it detangled and smooth.  </li>
            <li> They are gentle on hair, smell delightful, makes your hair nice, shiny, full of body, and clean without horrible chemicals.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give this five stars is because most of the time, the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> have been through hundreds of products ranging from cheap to seriously expensive and the Deva line is by far the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the big bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Devo Curl for several days now, and am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> It worked better for me if I use de conditioning only at the ends avoiding the scalp.</li>
            <li> First, I wish that this was a gluten-free formula as I have a wheat allergy</li>
            <li> but it cleans very well!</li>
            <li> It was incredibly thick and makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> those interested, my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you can just rinse between cleanse days, with just the conditioner by eliminating just the first step above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product and first used it on myself.  </li>
            <li> First I bought the trial kit - wanted to try this product line.</li>
            <li> Where were they my whole life?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with my very curly hair forever but not anymore!</li>
            <li> These products really work!</li>
            <li> Thanks Deva!</li>
            <li> I always come back because my hair and scalp are so much better using DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> anyone is interested, here is my hair care routine, too:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will get back to you about with a better review soon....</li>
            <li> I started using the DevaCurl products including the shampoo and conditioner, then had a hair appointment/consultation at a salon with a DevaCurl trained stylist and get much better results now with the instruction I received from the stylist than I had prior.  </li>
            <li> Even when i bleached my hair it only took 2-3 weeks to get healthy again.</li>
            <li> :) These products are your starting point.</li>
            <li> HAD STRAIGHT HAIR, THE BATTLE IS OVER!  </li>
            <li> they do exactly what they&#x27;re intended to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a must have if you have the kind of curls that fluff up</li>
            <li> First this product</li>
            <li> I will continue using this until I come close to running out before I make my final decision about making this a permanent part of my routine. :)</li>
            <li> I went from blowing out my hair every day to allowing my natural curl and Deva product enhanced curls to rain free.  </li>
            <li> but I promise you&#x27;ll be hooked after the first wash.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be of the same quality as the retailer at a better price.</li>
            <li> It is just too much!</li>
            <li> Same stuff you get in your salon for a much more competitive price.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> look elsewhere to buy this item - just to be sure I get what I actually paid for.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged, on time and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Thank you do much Divs Curl!</li>
            <li> The only gripe I have is that it could smell better.</li>
            <li> but I have had a few people comment on how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li> Now I have to go pay full price at a salon because my wife won&#x27;t use it in her hair (which I am glad because I would have to live in the guest house in the back because I an;t take the smell).</li>
            <li> Anyway - very happy with these products and other DevaCurl styling products I&#x27;ve tried and won&#x27;t be going back to my old routine anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products over the years for my naturally curly hair and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> It has really changed the texture of my daughters hair and is now more tamable, less frizzy and more hydrated than normal.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to at first with no foam, but it does amazing things for my hair!</li>
            <li> The NoPoo is designed to clean dirt but not remove oil, so it keeps hair from drying out, meaning less frizz and more curl.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, wiry hair and have trouble finding good product to use on it.</li>
            <li> I felt like my hair was so much drier and more fragile after switching to DevaCurl.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it seems to be the only hair care products that don&#x27;t make my hair straight or wavy.</li>
            <li> I am able to get real curl that last day after day.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I first used the shampoo and conditioner was that my hair felt much lighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I bought a large size from this vendor, I will try it and update the review.</li>
            <li> My hair is full and does not lose the color as fast as most other salon shampoos.</li>
            <li> Seemed to be the real deal, and very gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, I can have clean, beautiful curls without drying out my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> The only thing I really have to say about it is if you do have hair that is prone to being really oily, make sure you get the low-poo and not the no-poo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do really like tris stuff ;) been using it hor almost a year now</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, I will edit this review after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and curly and these products work really well with no wet look or overly crunchy.</li>
            <li> I live on the coast and it&#x27;s always very hot and very humid.  </li>
            <li> I love my long curly hair now!</li>
            <li> The other products in the trial package are great too, but they last much longer.</li>
            <li> Deva Curl is gentle and light enough that Day 2 hair is just as great as (if not better than) Day 1!</li>
            <li> I also love that when I curl my hair with a curling iron, the curls stay in place and retain their shape without looking dry and wiry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then, after hair is dry, you can slide your fingers under the top layers of hair and hand scrub your scalp to loosen up the curls and then scrunch again the outer curls to break up the cast from the gel.  </li>
            <li> I have issues with dry hair and this worked better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> It eleminates frizz while returning moisture to the hair making curls more defined, bouncy and no longer dry.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair at all &amp; makes it super soft.</li>
            <li> the conditioner has enough slip to easily finger-detangle my curly hair,&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Kind of reminded me of the smell that hits you when you walk into a salon (slightly).</li>
            <li> Just make sure you drip dry.</li>
            <li> but now I love moving the cream through my hair .. and it cured my dry scalp as well .</li>
            <li> Almost as if I smeared pure aloe goo on it.  </li>
            <li> The pumps on these large 32 oz containers do not work.</li>
            <li> I am certain it is because of this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I wet my hair on non-wash days and only condition and my hair is clean, smells fresh, and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and very curly hair and most products that lather</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with it being extremely dry and itchy in the wintertime and have struggled to find shampoo that is salon-quality AND good for my scalp, but this finally fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with it being extremely dry and itchy in the wintertime and have struggled to find shampoo that is salon-quality AND good for my scalp, but this finally fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially, if you have fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> As long as there is Deva Curl on the market, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any other products (except for my Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner because that stuff is also great)!</li>
            <li> For years I have fought and battled my very curly fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, with a fantastic scent that really accentuates your curls without the excessive drying out feeling that we get from other products.</li>
            <li> The color of the Amazon products are pure white whereas the salon bottle (conditioner, threw out shampoo) product has a light orange tint.</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft, feels clean, my curls are controlled but not stiff!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my curls my whole life.</li>
            <li> In the summer months I switch to the Lo Poo shampoo - still moisturizing but with MI humidity I need something that cleanses but doesn&#x27;t add as much moisture to my hair as the No Poo.</li>
            <li> Deva curl isn&#x27;t cheap no matter where you look but it definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li> Deva Curl Light Defining Gel (Formerly Angel) 32oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> it cleans your hair very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the Deva Curl Combo.</li>
            <li> My scalp just produces too much oil, and if my hair is \\&quot;trainable\\</li>
            <li> Just that bit of sulfate on my scalp and not that often seems to give my hair what it needs to really shine and look great.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but still struggle with how well the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; cuts the grease in my  hair.</li>
            <li> I use it as directed, but do sometimes comb out my hair gently after showering.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for curly hair.</li>
            <li> These products has me looking at people with straight hair like &amp;#34;what</li>
            <li> This set, not so much.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon bottles smell very soapy like Dove or another bar soap.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a curly-haired person like me who wants to avoid damaging sulfates, try Deva Curl.</li>
            <li> I need to keep using them for a while to really test how my hair reacts to them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t splurge on much...</li>
            <li> My product arrived very promptly (within a week.)</li>
            <li> one star for  lack of reasonable packaging.</li>
            <li> I am hooked and it is much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> but it was the real deal.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really curly (wavy).</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much happier than it used to.</li>
            <li> You can then take a microfiber towel and continue to gently scrunch as you remove</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, but it needs help too.  </li>
            <li> Got it for my friends daughter who has really curly hair.</li>
            <li> I swore I woulnd&#x27;t pay this much for shampoo</li>
            <li> Just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much....</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Really helped my damaged hair....</li>
            <li> I really like what both of these do for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair loves it, my skin not so much.</li>
            <li> But then again too much oil also causes me to break out.</li>
            <li> Also, this product really does fight curly hair frizz.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner makes my curls so much easier to style.</li>
            <li> It works really well and the curls stay hydrated and without frizz for the duration of the day,</li>
            <li> No poo is no lather, but seems to be just what my scalp wants.</li>
            <li> The Handbook by Michelle Bender, who recommends and/or created this product is an absolute must.  </li>
            <li> Its not the real product.</li>
            <li> I really like these products</li>
            <li> This is intended for curly-wavy hair, but can be used on any type of hair since all it really does is add moisture.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair really well</li>
            <li> After 2 days my hair is very greasy looking.</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked for me.</li>
            <li> My mom had straight hair and couldn&#x27;t help me with my problem.</li>
            <li> It detangles really well.</li>
            <li> the conditioner can be used for co-washing,&lt;br /&gt;- they cleanse and condition my hair very well,&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;As described the cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather - doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> You must rinse the product our thoroughly or you risk too much build up.</li>
            <li> the flyaway/frizzy hair syndrome I&#x27;ve always had was so much a part of me</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my hair and makes it very manageable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I lost SO MUCH HAIR using this product.  </li>
            <li> she couldn&#x27;t believe how much hair I&#x27;d lost, she apologized over and over because she introduce it to me</li>
            <li> For those noticing a lot of build-up, there&#x27;s a reason that the whole line doesn&#x27;t contain silicones--don&#x27;t use sulfate-free shampoo like this and think it&#x27;ll remove products with a lot of silicone.</li>
            <li> Absolutely changed my hair.  </li>
            <li> It has saved so much time.</li>
            <li> so the towel doesn&#x27;t absorb too much moisture from your hair.</li>
            <li> This will save you so much money if you use these bottles sparingly</li>
            <li> This really thrills me.</li>
            <li> As well as it looks and feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well.</li>
            <li> This is not the real product.</li>
            <li> It took some time to get used to the no foaming thing but all in all i really like this project and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T and everyone who knows me wants to know what I did to my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like DevaCurl</li>
            <li> So I decided to try something else out for a while to see if my concerns are real.</li>
            <li> And it is much cheaper than the Wen even with having to buy two bottles instead of one.</li>
            <li> The No-Poo is leaving my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with straight hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very perfumey.</li>
            <li> Really encourages the curls and her hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and healthy and the wave definition is definitely on par with what I was getting from Livingproof.  </li>
            <li> While in the shower, after cleansing and conditioning with DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition (don&#x27;t squeeze out water after rinsing out conditioner), bend at the waist and apply a generous amount of Ultra Defining Gel to soaking wet hair by coating product gently over the bottom, top and each side of hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair actually curls up more but they are shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> She is growing out her natural color and is trying to get her hair as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li> This really makes her curls come alive!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product as usual, it&#x27;s a great product for curls (especially if you suffer from dry hair like me).</li>
            <li> Upon opening and dispensing for the first time, the product was already loaded and ready to go, unlike the newly packaged shampoo which took about 5 pumps before anything came</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pictured but the bottles come with pumps which was a pleasant surprise since I usually save a pump from an old bottle just in case.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is OK - other conditioners seem to work as well for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> So, let me preface this by saying I do just fine with normal shampoo and conditioner and daily washings.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to start using a sulfur free shampoo on it once every few weeks to get it thoroughly clean and to help with the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first to try but figured I&#x27;d try it after reading many reviews.  </li>
            <li> My hair shines and has body and looks better than with any other hair care product I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; however, I didn&#x27;t notice that this product was more pungent than any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had originally wondered if I just needed to switch shampoos, but after reading some other customers reviews expressing similar problems, I may try purchasing the products from another seller or wesbite to see if they work better.</li>
            <li> Second and third day hair can be even better than first day hair.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to find any other product like it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has been on the &amp;#34;perpetual search&amp;#34; for a hair product that is free from harmful chemicals and actually works!</li>
            <li> Drying method is super important though -- make sure you hang upside down and scrunch a lot of the water out, then dry with an old t-shirt to maximize your results.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t continue to use them because I&#x27;ve found other products more suitable for me, but I definitely recommend this for anyone starting their curly girl method.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great release from all the other coconut/shea butter/olive oil scented shampoos that other curly hair products seem to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo however doesn&#x27;t quiet clean my hair,after a day my hair feels itchy.</li>
            <li> It does not tangle during shampooing and only around a tablespoon to two tablespoons is needed to clean my hair on my one wash day of the week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been struggling for years to find a product kind to my \\&quot;s&#x27;wavy\\&quot; hair, which is loosely curly, wavy, and straight at the same time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to those with curly or very wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the DevaCurl line to anybody - curly hair or straight.</li>
            <li> Before I got a special curly haircut and started using DevaCurl products, my hair was big.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast, I ordered on Thanksgiving and relieved it the next Monday!</li>
            <li> My husband has super curly hair and that is why I purchased it...also hoping I could use it on my relatively straight hair and avoid the sulphates in regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews on here are from people with thick coarse hair who need moisture for their curls and have found love with Devo Curl.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DevaCurl, while a bit pricey, is totally worth it, and you really don&#x27;t use that much of the No-Poo, as you&#x27;re only supposed to cleanse your hair twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> At first, my hair got greasy using it, but it soon djusted and stopped making excess oil because I stopped stripping it of its natural oil.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use these products for a full month before giving a review, but I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and had to switch back.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine, curly hair and my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Great product recommend it to anyone with mixed or curly hair even kinky tight hair can benefit!!</li>
            <li> New lifetime user!</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and ordered it and committed to really giving it the good old college try.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have searched for many years for the right products; some were made my hair stiff, some dryed it out</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d gotten used to having more bad hair days than good hair days.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, more manageable and much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about one and one half years and love it.  </li>
            <li> But with a wide tooth comb, I do not rip or break my hair and it easily slips through in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I too wonder if this is an older formulation or product has been diluted.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take multiple rotations, it just requires the middle section to go clockwise and the top section to go counterclockwise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to heavy fragrances which is why I liked the salon version.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware: Sellers are selling their stockpiles of much older version of this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this product but the fact that there are much older forumations of it floating around on Amazon and sellers aren&#x27;t required to disclose this information</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly but had not been packaged properly and it had leaked out all over.</li>
            <li> We only use it as a leave in, per the instructions from the stylist who cut my daughter&#x27;s hair (10 inches for Locks of Love) taking her to a short, curly style!</li>
            <li> I wash, condition and use the light gel; and my hair stay frizz free for at least 3 days.</li>
            <li> decent scent and seems to leave hair feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> Also, because you only wash your hair once or twice a week with this product, the travel set lasted me nearly a month and gave me an opportunity to try the No-Poo, Conditioner, Light Defining Gel and Set it Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These products have improved the condition of my hair to such an extent that it&#x27;s curling more, and actually looks like something someone might do to their hair on purpose.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived super quick however it is not giving the same effect as the same product I bought in the salon!</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s the real, actual product, not fake.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help all that much with the frizz, but it makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the conditioner because you go through a lot</li>
            <li> It smells like a high end salon, but not in an overly chemically way.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to everyone with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> where was this product when I was in high school?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them to every &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly, but it smelled kind of different than the smaller DevaCurl No-Poo and One Condition I had purchased earlier, and had a different consistency.</li>
            <li> I love having the large bottles so I can refill my small bottles.</li>
            <li> And it leaves my hair clean without being dry.</li>
            <li> which is great for me because sulfates in regular shampoos were destroying my scalp, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> My hair is really shiny now and soft.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this helps keep her very curly hair under control without getting frizz and keeps it soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also very frizzy and at the first sign of humidity, likes to split all up into a giant frizz</li>
            <li> After a solid 4 weeks of use on my own, I can say I&#x27;ll never go back to &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with my curls for many years.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $ in my opinion...lasts a long time too, you don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I use so much of the conditioner, I always run out of it first.  </li>
            <li> DevaCurl has been such a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad strange, though.</li>
            <li> I can easily wear 2nd and 3rd day curls without a problem.  </li>
            <li> *so much less work* than blowing it out and straightening, and I&#x27;m thrilled to finally have found something that will work for me.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have a lot of thin super curly hair and this is the only hair shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair super soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> If used right this product will actually heal your hair!!!</li>
            <li> I actually have fine, blonde and highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair you cannot live without DevaCurl.</li>
            <li> Being a Curly Girl I couldn&#x27;t live with out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also new to this styling regimen</li>
            <li> Now I have to unscrew th new bottles and squeeze the stuff out of the bottles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these products.  </li>
            <li> Live this stuff</li>
            <li> I always buy new items from them that way if I don&#x27;t like it I can return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Hold it very tight, with pliers if need be, and twist the top section counter clockwise.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble rinsing it out, but overall the smell is really nice and combined with the defining gel</li>
            <li> it was recommended to me by a friend for my daughters hair... since her hair is coarse and very very curly..</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to others that want to show off their natural curls.</li>
            <li> Shampoo in this package is great, conditioner seems watered down to me, compared to other bottles of the same conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li> I mean, I definitely did have good hair days</li>
            <li> I have not had an issue so far with this, so I am risking it!  </li>
            <li> I found the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> pump at the top of the bottle was broken, but the actual conditioner is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive and I have been strictly a cheapest shampoo in the aisle shopper for years, but I bought this stuff because it was remarkable for three days after washing.</li>
            <li> I have used so many products in the past</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and my curls are defined again!</li>
            <li> My first purchase was at her salon, but i began doubting I could afford such prices that were displayed at the establishment.</li>
            <li> I wear glasses, so in the shower, the shampoo and conditioner bottle look exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I bought these to refill the smaller bottles I purchased when I first began using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for several months now, exactly as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a couple years ago by getting the Brazilian straightening done on my naturally curly hair...DISASTER!  </li>
            <li> and when I wear it straight actually looks better when I don&#x27;t wash it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> and when I wear it straight actually looks better when I don&#x27;t wash it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Only problem I have is that I never know how clean my hair is when I use the no poo, since I&#x27;m used to the foam of regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, I bought this for the first time in December and recent got new ones.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to wash three or four times to feel like it&#x27;s really clean but wash once maybe twice like any other shampoo</li>
            <li> The conditioner is also great, you can put it in your hair during your shower and rinse it out just a little and leave some conditioner in (like a leave-in) and style as usual.</li>
            <li> it sounds like I might need to use a clarifying shampoo every so often to reduce build up, but for now this seems fine, especially since my hair is naturally dry</li>
            <li> it sounds like I might need to use a clarifying shampoo every so often to reduce build up, but for now this seems fine, especially since my hair is naturally dry</li>
            <li> I have fine, relatively straight and very long hair, and I tried this to help soothe my very dry and irritated scalp.  </li>
            <li> The large bottles last a long time and are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive to climate changes and product, I wanted something to enhance the natural textures of my hair.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it is more perfumy than I like.</li>
            <li> You feel a slightly cool tingly sensation after applying a decent amount, and in my case, I add a little water using my hands to help distribute the product through my hair.</li>
            <li> So much better for my daughter&#x27;s long curly hair than other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Blood under my fingernails from scratching itches, and I still have a large portion of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> After blowdrying, using straightening irons, not leaving the house without checking the&lt;br /&gt;relative humidity (as a teen I tied my hoodie tightly under my neck to avoid frizz at the bus top), all culminating in three Brazilian straightening treatments which made me almost bald from breakage, DEVA CURL HAS CHANGED MY LIFE.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and it works amazing on my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great, low lather, and smells faintly of rosemary.  </li>
            <li> I easily fixed this by applying some Moroccan oil after showering, so this really isn&#x27;t that big of a problem.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair</li>
            <li> THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair</li>
            <li> The conditioner is much the same.</li>
            <li> It keeps my curls soft and well conditioned.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and de tangled.</li>
            <li> It Is as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> Also my hair is all natural no relaxer anymore.</li>
            <li> With this product and a bit of gel, my curls are soft and downright bouncy.</li>
            <li> It reminds me a bit of the old Aveda hair care products....</li>
            <li> I have purchased about every product out that claims to prevent FRIZ and give soft natural curls</li>
            <li> I like that it is moisturizing, yet not heavy.  </li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft, And manageable</li>
            <li> I feel completely duped.</li>
            <li> Curly haired old girls like me are so grateful for this product, along with their hair gel-</li>
            <li> I use this on my 3 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li> , I have about 6 inches in shrinkage and my curls are soft and bouncy and defined.</li>
            <li> My order delivered the next day, shipping was fast, thank you.</li>
            <li> I suggest this for anyone with naturally curly hair as well as the Curly Girl e book.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of it natural oils and it leaves my hair so curly and hydrated..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product or feel that it helped with my natural curls.</li>
            <li> I know that I personally have tried every solution to try and make my hair straight.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to shampoo and conditioner for natural wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised that I don&#x27;t miss the foam.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t think the poo and conditioner were necessary.  </li>
            <li> My natural curly hair is graying and chemically colored.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it several times from this distributor and the prices are always reasonable and it arrives well packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> I also used to have a problem with my hair getting very oily - especially at my scalp.  </li>
            <li> We both especially like the gentle No Poo.</li>
            <li> No filmy feeling an soft defined curls.</li>
            <li> I cowash with Tresseme Natural and use the One Conditioner as a LI.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> and I also use it for my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> If you were like me, you probably bought the old run-of-the-mill products you can purchase anywhere.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the saving grace for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t retain moisture very well and is coarse.</li>
            <li> I have semi naturally curly hair and</li>
            <li> Once I read the book, and understood my hair (and all the ways that it&#x27;s different from straight hair)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who has naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> - just soft and curly.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, these products are for you.  </li>
            <li> You need to use it properly though or else you may end up using too much product.</li>
            <li> I do still put a smoothing balm in my hair because it doesn&#x27;t take the frizz completely away.</li>
            <li> I WATCHED THE DEVA CURL VIDEOS AND HAVE BEEN DRYING MY HAIR NATURALLY</li>
            <li> This product has definitely de-poofed my hair, maybe too much.</li>
            <li> We beachy girls tend like natural non smelly stuff.</li>
            <li> Nothing can bit Deva Curls so far.</li>
            <li> The shampoo cleans well while keeping my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Your hair will be soft and shiny beyond belief.</li>
            <li> but that could be on account of my hair being totally impenetrable by absolutely any shampoo.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my 2 1/2 year old who has curly hair just like me.</li>
            <li> Find a salon near you that specialize in the \\&quot;Deva Cut\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> look up a salon near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works, curls are soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and Deva Curl</li>
            <li> While I understand that the DevaCurl system is much more expensive compared to the Pantene Pro-V curl line that I was using, I feel like it&#x27;s been worth it.</li>
            <li> So with my busy mom schedule I had to take time to clean up the mess it made.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for having this available for half the price as you would get them in the salon!</li>
            <li> It leaves my impossibly curly hair in beautiful ringlets - softer - and shinier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most other items on the market leave curls feeling dry, heavy and full of product while DevaCurl moisturizes and hides split ends and frizz.</li>
            <li> only sorry that it took so many years for me to find out about the products and the special hair stylist that knows how to cut curly hair.</li>
            <li> I also have kind of half curly, half wavy hair that always just looks like I slept on it.  </li>
            <li> The Dev products get my hair clean without stripping it and let the natural curl come out--the conditioner is not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It was hard convincing my family that I actually had curly hair and wasn&#x27;t about to go live in the jungle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are new to being natural, you should definitely try these products as they cater to curly and natural hair types.</li>
            <li> My hair started out very flat and my curls were practically pulled straight down/out.</li>
            <li> seriously thought my hair looked OK before --</li>
            <li> Then first time using the conditioner it had a stale smell and was more runny than it should have been.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to hydrate your hair more than rinsing it all out - not sure if that actually happens</li>
            <li> It actually makes my curly hair (which is fine to begin with) a little too soft.  </li>
            <li> So, I was hoping this product was a stepped down solution from washing my hair with regular cheap shampoos every day.  </li>
            <li> at least I loved other aspects of my appearance! ...</li>
            <li> My daughter is 11, a low maintenance girl in a high maintenance body.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again and I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> For a long time I thought it didn&#x27;t like my hair wavy, but then realized it was only because I hadn&#x27;t found the right product to style it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping from this vendor was quick and received the packaged just as I was forcing the last dregs out of my empty Deva One Condition bottle.</li>
            <li> I have super curly brown hair with tight curls and a ton of frizz by the scalp</li>
            <li> For all of their products, a lot really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, my bottle of No-Poo was only 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> I tried many other ones, both cheaper and the more expensive salon brands for curly hair and have always come back to Deva Curl and it keeps curls but gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> But so far so good, the negative reviews are not accurate and there was no itching or chemical smell to the products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend and this size lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I can brush my hair out as it dries and blow dry it for straight hair, or I can twist and scrunch my hair as it air-dries for waves.  </li>
            <li> up straight and \\&quot;don&#x27;t touch\\&quot; your curls again until they are dry.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for my dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> I learned so much about how to properly care for my hair and that there are different curl types!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d strongly recommend seeing a DevaCurl trained stylist if possible in your area as the use of the products is very different than what I had been doing for my curly hair previously.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product and the extremely strong, old-lady scent forced me to rewash my hair and stop using it.</li>
            <li> So manageable, and not dry at the ends anymore!!!</li>
            <li> The conditioner gives the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down or making it feel waxy.</li>
            <li> The only downside that I find with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Add conditioner, enough that hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li> No other products can compare.</li>
            <li> The only product I will buy for my natural curls!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner, you only need a small amount so this should last months!  </li>
            <li> You can put some clips on small sections on top to allow the hair to dry with some height.  </li>
            <li> Neither product helps with detangling, my hair was constantly full of knots wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I mean the smell is really strong.</li>
            <li> I have natural very curly dry and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner seems very runny and not particularly moisturizing for my curls.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time spinning the top around endlessly.  </li>
            <li> (I have baby fine, thick, wavy/curly, non-porous hair)</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry hair and these products don&#x27;t seem to maintain the moisture in my hair, although my hair is very curly.</li>
            <li> Deva conditioners don&#x27;t have a lot of slip imo, but love the smell and that they don&#x27;t leave my hair weighted down, even though I do use a little as a leave-in at the end.</li>
            <li> The smell issue is pretty bad on its own but another thing to consider as well</li>
            <li> The title clearly states one conditioner + no poo, however the package is 2 bottles of the same no poo shampoo.</li>
            <li> about 1/2 the time to wear it straight and the rest of the time I scrunch it when wet to wear it wavy.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, and buy directly from a salon or deva&#x27;s website, which only charges $1 for shipping.</li>
            <li> She is mixed with soft kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> These two products left my hair soft and moisturized my curls.</li>
            <li> Today, I now embrace my natural curl and have found all Deva hair products to work very well if you go with your natural curl - never to use harsh products or curl/</li>
            <li> After using it for a while, my hair isn&#x27;t quite as soft as it was with the earlier products I was using, but I guess that could be the seasonal change?</li>
            <li> --my local salon offers the 16 oz bottles for $21.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that will consistantly get all the tangles out of my child&#x27;s hair and leaves it soft</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for people who want naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has suggested going back to my old shampoo and conditioner for a while</li>
            <li> but all in all it didn&#x27;t really do what I had expected it to do to my hair.</li>
            <li> Expensive but so nice for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> The products came in a timely fashion, but one of the bottles came with a broken top.</li>
            <li> It made it thick and lustrous and smooth.</li>
            <li> As for the smell of the shampoo.. not great but not terrible either.</li>
            <li> Follow instructions and watch the video as well as it shows you certain tricks to help as well such as using a microfiber towel to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> This product weighs my hair down with the first use.</li>
            <li> After I got past the first month of using this system (your hair might go through a transition period as it adjusts to this new formula you&#x27;re introducing which has none of the chemicals it&#x27;s used to if you&#x27;ve been using products with parabens and sulfates etc...)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a curly girl, before you start using these products or continue to use these products, go get a dry haircut by someone who is experienced in cutting curly hair.</li>
            <li> I mean huge.</li>
            <li> I cannot cut out my use of oil completely, my scalp still needs a little jojoba oil once a day, but for the most part, I don&#x27;t need any other extra heavy creams or balms so much.</li>
            <li> I constantly had the &#x27;lampshade effect&#x27; (flat on top, blown out at the bottom, you fellow curly girls will know what I mean).</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but it is quite fine and thin.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is very coarse, very dry, very knotty ... and this product is truly a miracle.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I used to with other products since the No Poo shampoo is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product from the store and loved it, but when I received these products they smell poorly and even stung my scalp a little.</li>
            <li> It is INCREDIBLY EXTREMELY THICK, which makes it look awfully HUGE and puffy (as one of the other comments said, Merida huge), extremely frizzy, and very textured, so I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a product that can make my hair look less… of well, all of that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Deva Curl is the only shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve found that makes my hair feel soft and actually reduces the frizz.</li>
            <li> , he likes it enough so far, but hates the price and probably will be deterred by future use on that count alone.</li>
            <li> Not dry, not frizzy or crunchy</li>
            <li> The way my hair feels after shampooing, not dry or stripped&lt;br</li>
            <li> does not dry out my hair and it is not tangled when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Its very very watered down!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about it at first because I&#x27;m so used to the bubbly and foamy shampoos, and I have naturally curly hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow out more.</li>
            <li> Huge bottles, hands wet no pumps not easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> I normally wash twice a week, with dry shampoo on the last day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite apparent no product works the same on everyone.</li>
            <li> * update: I&#x27;m switching to 5 stars because I am (strangely) no longer bothered by the smell of shampoo.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t mind and figured the smell would go away after wearing it for a few days, but I&#x27;m now on day three</li>
            <li> Then when the top is still wet but underneath is dry, squirt about the size of a nickel into your hand, rub your hands together, rub a little of your fingertips, then SCRUNCH!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry enough where I live, and sudsing shampoos just compound this problem.  </li>
            <li> It really softens my curls and doesn&#x27;t weigh them down.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry my  hair, my natural curl responds well to the line.</li>
            <li> I have straightened with Keratin, Blown dry, tried to go natural and used every product from Wen to Dr. Miracle.</li>
            <li> In the book they teach you things like how you should dry your hair with an old t-shirt rather than a terry cloth towel</li>
            <li> I try to aoid lathering products because I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out or break out.</li>
            <li> My hair is considered to be straight with slight wave.</li>
            <li> I have super thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> The aroma is pleasant but a little weird.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using the product made my own shampoo using Coconut Milk Cream and a few other oils and tiny bit of baking soda and used Apple Cider Vinegar as my conditioner and a few months later</li>
            <li> yes I could send it back half empty but is it worth it</li>
            <li> Not tight, corkscrew curls or anything, just waves and some loose curls thrown in.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems like the No Poo scent is a bit stronger than the Low Poo scent, and the floral is a little too much for me.</li>
            <li> Now I shower, put in a little extra One Condition before getting out, then put in a touch of the DevaCurl Style Gel after GENTLY drying my hair with a towel.</li>
            <li> You could be paying approximately 5 bucks a month for shampoo and conditioner that works so much better than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I love the Deva Curl product, but when these were delivered the pump to one of them was broken and the other had leaked a lot of shampoo.</li>
            <li> Curly hair can be hard to manage, it is nice to have a product that works well and doesn&#x27;t dry it out or make it look dull.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of the shampoo at the roots to take care of any build up and its so rich that I use very little conditioner --just on the ends.</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting hair powder (dry shampoo) to tame the slight excess oiliness at first from your scalp taking a few weeks to get used to not having to produce so much oil to make up for the old oil-stripping shampoos.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and have to admit that the shampoo is something you have to get used to since it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  </li>
            <li> This duo lends moisture while helping my color last much longer than usual.</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive, but a decent value, especially if you consider what your stylist would charge for similar products.</li>
            <li> Okay, so the title sounds rather dramatic but combined with a Deva haircut, these products rule!</li>
            <li> DevaCurl is all I&#x27;ve been using for the last 3 months and my hair stays curly, soft and less frizzy than ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the No-Poo Cleanser and Conditioner on the days I flat iron my hair along with my Davines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the No-Poo Cleanser and Conditioner on the days I flat iron my hair along with my Davines</li>
            <li> flat irons</li>
            <li> throw away that flat iron and just let it be itself.</li>
            <li> On days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I usually just mist my curls with a little water, and occasionally add a little more Style Gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> P.S. Also did not clean my hair near the scalp well; not only would it leave it greasier there, It would stink.</li>
            <li> They are creamy, and leave your hair feeling soft, not weighted down.</li>
            <li> I think the old stuff I had been using (Nioxin, Redkin etc..) must have been weighing it down.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the quantity I have to use because I have so much hair, but I put it just on the scalp and massage it, then put my head in running shower for a second or two and let the no-poo dilute a little bit and run down the reset of my hair.</li>
            <li> so I think at least the shampoo and conditioner are versatile enough to use on straight and wavy days.  </li>
            <li> so I think at least the shampoo and conditioner are versatile enough to use on straight and wavy days.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of times to train it to be washed less frequently, but I just couldn&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out your scalp and the conditioner can be used as a leave in product daily after you wash.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t last long since I have really long hair</li>
            <li> My husband has thick, straight, course, porous hair and this is the only shampoo/conditioner we&#x27;ve ever found that makes his hair behave itself.</li>
            <li> However sadly, the strong smell of these products Is a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> Love the products, but poorly wrapped for shipping- leaked and made a mess!</li>
            <li> They sell this now at Target but only the small size which isn&#x27;t worth it because it only comes in a small size.</li>
            <li> Finally, I can let my hair air dry without hating the results!  </li>
            <li> My only other option would be to mail both products back, return them and get replacements, which I don&#x27;t want to do because I want to hold on to the products.  </li>
            <li> But after reading other reviews commenting on the smell and wondering if it was different, makes me think it&#x27;s a different product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and always come back to deva ( I stray and only gave 4 stars because I am not all that fond of the scent.</li>
            <li> Works well with my very dry hair, especially the shampoo.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s colored and tends to be very dry, especially at the ends.</li>
            <li> I finish with a mixture of B&amp;B Curl Conscious Curl Calming Creme and a little bit of DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel.</li>
            <li> You shampoo (takes a while to get used to no lather), then apply much more conditioner than I ever had before, barely rinse the conditioner out with cold water (to keep the cuticle of the hair closed), and then apply the styling products with your hair still dripping wet before &amp;#34;scrunching&amp;#34; with a microfiber towel or t-shirt fabric.  </li>
            <li> &quot; then it is going to take too long of a time commitment while suffering horridly greasy hair for me to weather it.  </li>
            <li> After using both, I am partial to the Low Poo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a winner, and I will be using it for a long time.time.</li>
            <li> I spent my entire life hating my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long corkscrew curly hair</li>
            <li> And it smelled strange.</li>
            <li> As you&#x27;ll see from other reviews here (and for other curly hair products) it&#x27;s quite apparent no product works the same on everyone.</li>
            <li> I use the No Poo after my long run of the week</li>
            <li> I smell this all day long and it is on my pillow</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick which is very helpful, and the shampoo is too.</li>
            <li> I need to add extra conditioner to keep the frizzies down though, not daily.</li>
            <li> It was totally matted, no shine or body to it, no curls, just a total mess.  </li>
            <li> (kerasilk),  and despite using other products along the way nothing compared, a year ago my hair dresser suggested these products, and I have never looked back since.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I would definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other curl product.</li>
            <li> Also---I wash my hair daily due to sweating at the gym</li>
            <li> it appears that women with curl have more bad hair days, however, I discovered the DivaCurl website and decided to take a chance on trying something different again.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and flatiron my hair</li>
            <li> My hair naturally dry and bleached.</li>
            <li> these combination works so well on my dry brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have curly hair, and mine is also dry.  </li>
            <li> hair with scrunchie until dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn into a frizz ball when I let it air dry, and if I decide to blow-dry my hair</li>
            <li> dry it out...</li>
            <li> but with curly hair you end up with dry curls and an oily scalp.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is not as dry and easier to detangle.</li>
            <li> I would have to cover my head in some type of dry shampoo if I ever wanted to skip washing my hair for a day.  </li>
            <li> The no-poo cleans my scalp and doesn&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li> with the DevaCurl system, she NEVER brushes her hair when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> After her shower, she combs her hair &amp; lets it air dry.  </li>
            <li> just dry my hair out and leave it frizzy,.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair either.</li>
            <li> My scalp tends to get dry and flakey but my stylist told me to always rinse the conditioner off of my scalp and add some conditioner to the tips of my hair to keep the moisture where it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> Let hair air dry or use with diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend letting your hair air dry and not messing with it.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair and wavy, and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it  on my hair to work.</li>
            <li> even my hair dresser said my hair is softer not so dry</li>
            <li> no longer looks dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> A few months back got the smaller 12 oz.</li>
            <li> My main complaint with my hair that I am looking to alleviate is greasiness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying my 3rd round of this 32 oz combo and I am total Devangelist!  </li>
            <li> I used to have to use at least three products ie leave in, mousse, serum, etc just to get a semi decent look with frizz control.</li>
            <li> These big bottles will last me at least 6 months, and I tend to use extra with long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a single mom.</li>
            <li> I only get cuts from the DevaChan salon in NYC and only use Deva products to tame my mane.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of high-end salon brands that are color-safe and nitrate and sulfate-free, which usually increases cost considerably.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inconvenient to use the bottle now as I have to open the top each time and product gets wasted.</li>
            <li> Hair changed from only mildly wavy to seriously wavy/mildly curly in late 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo completely drys my curls and makes them look dead!</li>
            <li> I find the other products heavy and leave considerable residue on your hair</li>
            <li> I have curly hair naturally, which I&#x27;ve spent most of my life straightening because I hate it.  </li>
            <li> and they give me the necessary amount of moisture without weighting my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight so it makes my hair extra curly because it&#x27;s not weighed down.</li>
            <li> so they last a long time and tend to save a little bit of money on a not-so-inexpensive product line.  </li>
            <li> After doing that, I discovered that the Nopoo and conditioner were too thick to come out of the new squeeze bottles I had bought.</li>
            <li> Do not comb when it&#x27;s dry!</li>
            <li> and I have had topical reactions from previous products with wheat in them.  </li>
            <li> Deva brings back my curls even when my curls lose they&#x27;re pattern due to extreme dryness.</li>
            <li> The product still works the same, just less convenient to dispense it this way.</li>
            <li> I use the conditioner and leave it in for a couple minutes and only wash about half of it out.</li>
            <li> The result was hair that looked oily and wet when completely dry.</li>
            <li> My old hair is a little less curly and a lot drier.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> 2 star only because it not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 6 months and the bottle is only half empty.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but it smells weird (not fruity or like other shampoos) and dries your hair out when used together.</li>
            <li> I also use a little One Conditioner as a leave-in after regular conditioning, rinsing, and wringing.</li>
            <li> , what makes it different from straight hair and what I&#x27;d been doing wrong all my life that made my hair such an unmanageable, unattractive mess.</li>
            <li> Now if I want I can go every other day (without using dry shampoo).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to change, especially when the products put such a dent in your wallet</li>
            <li> I will say my fiance doesn&#x27;t love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I love the curl and always wear it curly because it gives my hair body, which it badly needs.  </li>
            <li> I know that there are a lot of bad reviews, but i love this product.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the product labels were different colors.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of Deva Curl&#x27;s B&#x27;Leave In Curl Boost and Volumizer only because it caused me to have white dusty stuff flake off of my hair.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second round of the 32 ounce bottles.  </li>
            <li> The sudsless nature of it doesn&#x27;t bother me, as it was expected by the product directions.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems drier and harder to get curl.  </li>
            <li> As I expected.</li>
            <li> Since I had the empty bottle from the salon bought conditioner, I compared the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too heavy for regular use.</li>
            <li> These products are expensive, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> So therefore this was expected.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE SPENT YOUR LIFE</li>
            <li> I recommend watching YouTube videos on how to use these products properly - I promise by round 3 or 4</li>
            <li> The factory where the products were labeled must have produced a substantial amount incorrectly as I&#x27;ve found the same issue at a few beauty supply stores that carry the products as well.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> All of the products have the same color green labels.</li>
            <li> For those of us on hormone therapy, we have to be careful about soy.</li>
            <li> While in shower and hair is soaking wet add desired amount of gel to palm.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser also suggested that I fill a spray bottle with water and the conditioner and use that on days when I don&#x27;t want to get my hair soaking wet.</li>
            <li> We tried to use it on the kids so it wasn&#x27;t completely wasted, but we promptly sent them outside to play in the mud so they could try and get the stink out of their hair.</li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, somewhat coarse, hair that is also color treated blonde.  </li>
            <li> Only shampoo/conditioner that actually cleans and manages my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that is hard to tame</li>
            <li> And long, down to my waist.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made such a difference in bringing my curls to life and helping tame the frizzy component of being a Curly Girl.  </li>
            <li> Plus, i finally have a product that won&#x27;t make a mess of my curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair, but I have a ton of it, very thick and full of body, outside of using this product.</li>
            <li> So far not too bad, has a different texture to it than normal shampoo and conditioner and helps with frizz</li>
            <li> A little goes a a long way.  </li>
            <li> And sometimes I do want to revert (I had a special bond with my crazy hair, now everyone thinks that I style it), but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If anything goes wrong, I recommend using the Mist-er Right or watered down conditioner to get your waves to wake up from their slumber.</li>
            <li> From reading other reviews here</li>
            <li> From reading other reviews here</li>
            <li> have a two other complaints:  </li>
            <li> This gave me such a confidence boost that I started recommending this along with ANgel to any one who had no love for their curly hair.</li>
            <li> I shampoo and condition every other day.</li>
            <li> and I usually buy from local salon.</li>
            <li> It was extremely frizzy.</li>
            <li> You will reek for days even after trying to wash it out with other product.</li>
            <li> If you have extreme texture to your curls and need to return it moisture</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well on my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been a DevaCurl girl for years and have tried other products targeted for curly hair suggested by friends...</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Still like my other non-name brand products from Walmart (Tresemme).</li>
            <li> It is for me.or other curly hair products)</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The Cost, pretty expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m still trying to get used to not washing my hair every other day; 5 days is the longest I&#x27;ve gone and could not believe my hair and scalp still smelled</li>
            <li> pretty expensive -The amount of hair I lose when I wash it (wash it once to twice a week)  </li>
            <li> With other shampoos my hair would lose it&#x27;s wave by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The conditioner feels a bit watery - compared to deep conditioners I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of no-poo, brands of no sulfates but that still lathered.  </li>
            <li> (I wash my hair every other day).&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> but I do not care for the other products in their line.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner, but was highly disappointed when both the bottles arrived having spilled in the packaging.</li>
            <li> smell is kinda weird at first</li>
            <li> It started to dissipate after 3 or 4 days and washing with 2 other shampoos.</li>
            <li> your hair air dry for a little while.</li>
            <li> It was dry and limp, but DevaCurl works wonders.</li>
            <li> Only problem was cap wasn&#x27;t on very tight when it was shipped so some of the conditioner leaked and made a mess in the box.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I washed my hair the very first time, my hair looked and felt like it just got a cold gallon of water when it was lost in the desert.</li>
            <li> The conditioner appeared to be an opened item and was extremely watered down.</li>
            <li> I had been using the same hair products for at least 25 years</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the pump for the no-poo cleanser did not work...</li>
            <li> The only negative was that the shampoo had opened during shipping, and some of the contents had leaked out.</li>
            <li> I spent the first 40 years of my life with crazy, frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth cost</li>
            <li> My only complaint is for the seller-</li>
            <li> Good for your curls, terrible for your skin.</li>
            <li> , my hair is slowly growing back and getting longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m letting this product touch my hair that is slowly growing back.  </li>
            <li> I felt that this bottle had been watered down.</li>
            <li> It does not feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> and you want them to stay down rather than &amp;#34;poof out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, feeling a little concerned about some of the other reviews stating that it had been watered down.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products, expensive and not so expensive and I always return to DevaCurl.</li>
            <li> All other hair products are gone!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
            <li> After an evening of research, where among other things I found out there are labelled types of curly hair -- I&#x27;m a 2A-2B!</li>
            <li> On the other days I get my hair wet and add a small amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and the curls aren&#x27;t really tight, just soft.</li>
            <li> every other product i&#x27;ve used on her dried her hair out.</li>
            <li> Its just not like the typical shampoos/conditions.</li>
            <li> I received the travel/sampler package w/ the devatowel about a month and a half ago.</li>
            <li> So much less frizz.</li>
            <li> the no Poo leaked I lost half of the bottle</li>
            <li> I tried the DEVA system at a friend&#x27;s house over a year and a half ago and was CONVERTED.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a slightly minty smell that I like.</li>
            <li> My hair is ALOT less puffy, too.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the 32 ounce containers are too heavy to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one less thing to worry about.  </li>
            <li> Almost half the price of what salons charge</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a year and a half</li>
            <li> It has made my hair less frizzy and it is softer.</li>
            <li> Previously, I have bought the 12oz bottles from my hair salon.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, course, long, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of curly, thick, dry, corse hair</li>
            <li> But it does small a little like some other people said in their review.</li>
            <li> My hair is waist length and curly, but with a little bit of a wave as opposed to a corkscrew curl.</li>
            <li> I did put a little conditioner in her hair as leave in as well.  </li>
            <li> I put a little bit of Heaven In Hair in and use it as a styling cream.  </li>
            <li> In Hair (just a little) with the B&#x27;Leave In and water in a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> I thought little of it.</li>
            <li> product is a little pricey by my standards</li>
            <li> I apply the conditioner, and sometimes I rinse a little bit</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a few moms of little girls with curly hair after I had asked what can I do to detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> It was impossible for me to ever leave my hair out and natural after all the years of flat ironing (shudders).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday with shampoo as well.  </li>
            <li> i actually use this myself and i have thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and learned that this pump is not available, so they gave me a credit for the cost of the pump, which I will find elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> follow with Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how my hair feels oily on my scalp after a few days of using the no-poo.</li>
            <li> I recommend for anybody with natural curly hair, Expensive</li>
            <li> , it makes them limp.</li>
            <li> And lose our on the wasted  product.</li>
            <li> refresh limp hair, get a water spritz bottle and thoroughly dampen hair.</li>
            <li> it came broken when i open the package and stunk up my house.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling almost worse than before getting in the shower.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have curly hair and avoid harsh products.</li>
            <li> I used to straightened my hair everyday because I couldn&#x27;t control the frizz.  </li>
            <li> You might have even towel dried your hair.</li>
            <li> These tend to leave my hair feeling heavy and oily.  </li>
            <li> these products are too heavy and do not allow my hair to breathe.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i HAVE TRIED QUITE A FEW PRODUCTS FOR MY CURLY FRIZZY HAIR.</li>
            <li> On the few occasions I founds myself in a hotel and had to use the local products, my hair went back to crazy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been buying it thru Amazon for a few years now</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t waste my money on this again.  </li>
            <li> My hair never feels heavy.</li>
            <li> , you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> and I am always on the hunt for a product that eliminates my frizz but does not make my hair crunchy and stiff..</li>
            <li> Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner tame curly hair.</li>
            <li> The product helps moisturizer my daughter&#x27;s hair and tame the curls and frizz.</li>
            <li> I would guess it is for people whom need to tame there curls.</li>
            <li> , I am hoping to tame my frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> Im  going to buy only directly from the company from now on :(</li>
            <li> Not cool!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the bad, I would still very much recommend this product.</li>
            <li> DevaCurl is generally quite expensive when I buy from my stylist.</li>
            <li> but since I was also annoyed that they discontinued their largest size (having thick, long-ish hair, I&#x27;m all about buying in bulk), I decided to keep my options open.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still skeptical do what I did and start with the 12oz bottles or the even smaller travel size bottles they have.</li>
            <li> There is no more frizz or &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; looking curls.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m trying to recover from excessive use of heat.</li>
            <li> I finally got it to pop up, no thanks to the very vague suggestions I&#x27;ve seen online.  </li>
            <li> With the No Poo, it&#x27;s really difficult to know when you&#x27;ve applied enough to cleanse your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened to it</li>
            <li> small pump of conditioner for leave-in purposes</li>
            <li> Sadly with the same result each time.</li>
            <li> The pump for one of the bottles was not attached when I opened the package leaving space for bacteria and small particles to get in.</li>
            <li> and I was never satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> but I can not get past the smell.</li>
            <li> It makes my curls pop without styling, smooths my frizz, and keeps my hair crazy soft.</li>
            <li> I usually leave about 50% of it.</li>
            <li> If your hair is extra-dry, I recommend washing, conditioning as usual, and then adding a small (dime-sized) amount to the ends of your towel-dried hair.</li>
            <li> Product was not authentic as it is advertised.</li>
            <li> I usually end up ordering it from Amazon after that.</li>
            <li> I am writing this so at least one less curly haired person will no longer suffer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to flush $100 down the toilet</li>
            <li> Otherwise it held my curls well and made my hair soft, but the white dusty stuff was annoying.</li>
            <li> Disappointed by whole system.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; shampoo because i am so used to the lather which this doesnt have</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to the &#x27;no lather&#x27; shampoo, but it makes my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> It was so runny, I could hardly hold it in my hands.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed after the results and having spent so much money on this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and it also came late</li>
            <li> This package came late and had leaked in transit.</li>
            <li> but at least there&#x27;s no sticky residue after drying when I leave some in.</li>
            <li> I could get away with a 12 oz bottle of no poo, and 32 oz of conditioner and gel since i use the no poo the least.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband complained.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick wavy hair that is colored.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised for thick and curly hair (hmmm?).</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and course with S curls.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I was putting a thick moisturizing lotion on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair...</li>
            <li> hair is course and rather thick, with tighter curls towards the bottom of my head, and looser curls around the crown.  </li>
            <li> so I know what it should be like - not runny, but thick.</li>
            <li> I use them to refill my small travel sizes too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this is a knockoff or if the formula has changed, but my scalp ITCHES!</li>
            <li> No more poodle head!</li>
            <li> My only frustration is that it&#x27;s impossible to contact Beauty</li>
            <li> The smell of both products is herbal and heavenly while in the shower, but subtle after.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> so I get some serious sweat in my hair) and it cleanses and is a pleasing smell.  </li>
            <li> Waste of expensive product</li>
            <li> I do notice some dander-looking stuff by my scalp (may be the moisture lock spray in the line), and I do find that it looks dirty a bit faster than other shampoos.</li>
            <li> The seller replaced the actual Deva products with some sort of hand lotion or other terrible smelling product.</li>
            <li> The smell was pretty awful.</li>
            <li> My hair is as luminous, thick and curly as it can be!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried very hard to embrace my curls with no luck.  </li>
            <li> It cuts down on the care time, and I&#x27;m all for that!!!!</li>
            <li> Gone are the tangles, the split ends, and the painful brushing - in comes the long hair and compliments!  </li>
            <li> I thought the smell was like Dove bar soap, which isn&#x27;t bad ... and the smell diminishes once hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> As a curly girl with a VERY thick head of curly hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course curly hair ..</li>
            <li> However, the No-Poo Cleanser had leaked onto both bottles and the pump is broken.  </li>
            <li> Downside, the pump arrived broken.</li>
            <li> To get the pump to pop up, you hold not to the base of the pump, but the MIDDLE SECTION.  </li>
            <li> My ends are also in worse shape after my switch.</li>
            <li> However, the pump on the product is usually broken and won&#x27;t pump the product out.  </li>
            <li> not happy</li>
            <li> I have thin, highlighted, wavy curls</li>
            <li> The conditioner was thin and runny.  </li>
            <li> Not happy and will not buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> The product was received in a timely manner, however the conditioner was spilt inside the package and the pump is now broken.</li>
            <li> Foul odor and poor cleansing.</li>
            <li> Pumps where broken.</li>
            <li> It has also caused skin breakouts on my forehead that I&#x27;ve never experienced.  </li>
            <li> I was using Redken before I switched to DevaCurl, and I was really disappointed with how loose my curls seemed to be.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t repeat:( disappointed since the reviews were stellar before I made my purchase.</li>
            <li> finally my hair looks not so bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and have been suuuuper disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am a DevaCurl fanatic and you could imagine my disappointment when I received counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, dry hair and get terrible dandruff with anything that foams.</li>
            <li> I really hated the way this product smelled, and it took a VERY long time to get used to</li>
            <li> unfortunately this product seems to make the curls frizz</li>
            <li> Not only can I smell and see the difference in texture, my hair feels disgusting after thoroughly washing and rinsing.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with DevaCurl.</li>
            <li> It also has a weird citrus bathroom cleaner smell.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does have a drying affect not in my hair but on my scalp</li>
            <li> After using it and rinsing it out, it felt like there was a weird film over my hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t complain when things like that happen because I understand that these things happen during delivery, but because of how expensive the product is I was rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is too expensive to use a lot.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately had to return this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I was using the wrong products and doing all the wrong things.</li>
            <li> From the no-poo and conditioner to the gels, creams and sprays, you cannot go wrong.  </li>
            <li> ( anyone else get those painful knots at base of your skull especially with a scarf or collar???)</li>
            <li> I struggled for years jumping from one shampoo brand to another until I was introduced to these products and now I&#x27;m absolutely addicted to them because they leave my curls looking well hydrated and shaped!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve resisted buying Deva Curl because it&#x27;s just so darn expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so sad to have to give it up.</li>
            <li> However, the items purchased from this seller are questionable.</li>
            <li> That is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Again disappointed in the shipping and broken pump which is why I won&#x27;t give it a 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Overall, a horrible experience and I would not recommend. :(</li>
            <li> but it des seem like it cleans the dirty out</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s missing all those nasty chemicals that would damage my color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> My curly hair was driving me crazy until I found these.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is too expensive to have it leaking!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very disappointing considering how expensive this product is.</li>
            <li> Very sad.</li>
            <li> The PUMP is just about impossible to get to pop up.  </li>
            <li> , I had a bad color job done on my hair</li>
            <li> or maybe I received a bad batch, but my scalp was SOOOO itchy from this.</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair so bad</li>
            <li> I was fearful that I would get some fake stuff</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was very disappointed by this shipment.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, need to purchase conditioner separately.</li>
            <li> and my mother was disappointed on that</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the cut the stylist gave me, a &amp;#34;DevaCut&amp;#34;, was awful</li>
            <li> I asked my hairstylist sister-in-law what products to use on curly hair after being severely disappointed by another brand.</li>
            <li> bottles just to try it out; haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks very badly.</li>
            <li> What I hate is that I never received the conditioner</li>
            <li> Hated it.</li>
            <li> and I hated the way they looked without heat styling.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase and will not purchase from this location again.</li>
            <li> If you are a curly girl at your wits end with all of the terrible products out there that do nothing for curly hair, I suggest trying Deva Curl.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff smells horrible, my husband hates it too.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smelled horrible, like rubbing alcohol and orange sherbert</li>
            <li> But the shipping was awful.</li>
            <li> Worst smelling shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Made my hair so greasy. It was caked into my scalp and nothing worked to get it out. Hated it.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my curls my whole life. After a friend suggested DevaCurl, I ordered this combo and I will never go back. My hair is softer, more manageable and much less frizzy. I will say my fiance doesn&#x27;t love the scent, but it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. Its just not like the typical shampoos/conditions. Either way, I love this product!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my thin curly hair. Great products.</li>
            <li> Every curly girl should be a Deva Curl girl. I have 3B curls and switched over to Deva Curl about 9 months ago and I have never regretted it. The No Poo shampoo is perfect for the cold/dry weather months in MI and keeps my hair clean but moisturized. The One Condition conditioner is great and I don&#x27;t need to use as much as I used to with other products since the No Poo shampoo is so moisturizing. In the summer months I switch to the Lo Poo shampoo - still moisturizing but with MI humidity I need something that cleanses but doesn&#x27;t add as much moisture to my hair as the No Poo. For my daily routine I combine Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner with Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner and then Deva Curl Ultra Defining Gel. My hair stays soft and my curls stay perfectly corkscrewed. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of Deva Curl&#x27;s B&#x27;Leave In Curl Boost and Volumizer only because it caused me to have white dusty stuff flake off of my hair. Otherwise it held my curls well and made my hair soft, but the white dusty stuff was annoying. If you are a curly girl at your wits end with all of the terrible products out there that do nothing for curly hair, I suggest trying Deva Curl. Get the trial sizes first so you can figure out what works best for your type of hair. As long as there is Deva Curl on the market, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any other products (except for my Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner because that stuff is also great)!</li>
            <li> Hands down best product for Curls</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, my bottle of No-Poo was only 3/4 full. I too wonder if this is an older formulation or product has been diluted.</li>
            <li> Love this line of shampoo and conditioners!! I have been looking for a gentle shampoo for my curly hair for many years. This one is the best.</li>
            <li> I have used both the no-poo and the one condition for over 3 years with great success. I no longer have snarls at the nape of my neck and I have curls instead of frizz!</li>
            <li> I have used this product from the store and loved it, but when I received these products they smell poorly and even stung my scalp a little.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick wavy hair that is colored.  The DevaCurl keeps everything under control.  It took a few times to get used to the shampoo not lathering, but it really moisturizes my hair.  I sometimes use a pomade on my hair to style it and the No-Poo cleanser gets it all out.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give this five stars is because most of the time, the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  If you order the big bottles, save any pump that works.  You&#x27;ll need it.</li>
            <li> Works well with my very dry hair, especially the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product... I think it is the best product for curly hair.. I have tried it all! Deva curl isn&#x27;t cheap no matter where you look but it definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that has a tendency to frizz. I received these products as a gift from a curly hair friend.  I LOVE it.  The feel and smell is healthy, gentle and amazing. It leaves my curls defined and frizz free.  Follow instructions and watch the video as well as it shows you certain tricks to help as well such as using a microfiber towel to dry your hair.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t sud much (get over that:-) you don&#x27;t need to use much.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday with shampoo as well.  I use the conditioner alone in between shampooing and make sure to not wash it off completely. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great deal Sent quickly Very Happy!! Would order again!</li>
            <li> Best and only conditioner I will use on my curly-girl hair - absolutely love it!  I even take it with me to the salon when I have my hair cut/colored as I don&#x27;t want anything else used on my hair (just wish my salon would carry DevaCurl products so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to bring my own!.)</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, somewhat coarse, hair that is also color treated blonde.  I blow dry and flatiron my hair about 1/2 the time to wear it straight and the rest of the time I scrunch it when wet to wear it wavy.  For a long time I thought it didn&#x27;t like my hair wavy, but then realized it was only because I hadn&#x27;t found the right product to style it. Up until recently I was using (and loved)a Livingproof No Friz product for curly/wavy hair, but then they seemed to have discontinued the one I was using.  I thought about switching to something else in their line but since I was also annoyed that they discontinued their largest size (having thick, long-ish hair, I&#x27;m all about buying in bulk), I decided to keep my options open.  I discussed it with an employee at Sephora who also had wavy hair.  Her advice was that if I was going to only go with a cream (and not switch my shampoo or conditioner) I&#x27;d be better off going with Livingproof, but I was willing to do the whole system, she thought I&#x27;d like DevaCurl better.  Initially I wasn&#x27;t keen on switching my shampoo and conditioner since I&#x27;d finally found a system that worked (I&#x27;ve been using Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel 2x a week to counteract brassiness, and Davines Oi the rest of the time for moisture).  But then when comparing prices I realized that DevaCurl was much, much more affordable and would still allow me to use sulfate free products.  So I figured, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  If it didn&#x27;t work out, I could always return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ended up purchasing the [[ASIN:B000NE6QP6 DevaCurl No-Poo Cleanser, 945 ml / 32 oz]], [[ASIN:B000HJ4IPW Deva Devacurl One Condition Conditioner, 12 Ounce]], [[ASIN:B006K26D9E Devaconcepts DevaCurl Styling Cream, 5.1 Oz]], and [[ASIN:B003E0Z3JQ Deva Curl Light Defining Gel (Formerly Angel) 32oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them for four months and I absolutely love this system.  My hair feels soft and healthy and the wave definition is definitely on par with what I was getting from Livingproof.  My waves stay put all day and look beautifully defined.  I&#x27;ve also tried the No-Poo Cleanser and Conditioner on the days I flat iron my hair along with my Davines THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID and Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion and my hair still looks great even straight so I think at least the shampoo and conditioner are versatile enough to use on straight and wavy days.  From reading other reviews here it sounds like I might need to use a clarifying shampoo every so often to reduce build up, but for now this seems fine, especially since my hair is naturally dry and when I wear it straight actually looks better when I don&#x27;t wash it for a few days.  My scalp also feels the best it&#x27;s every been.  I&#x27;ve had issues with it being extremely dry and itchy in the wintertime and have struggled to find shampoo that is salon-quality AND good for my scalp, but this finally fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m absolutely loving DevaCurl and can&#x27;t wait to try more products in the line.  Even better, my hair stylist commented that my hair looks healthier than ever.  Granted, I have been getting my hair cut more often (every 3 months vs. 2 times a year), but this is the only product change I&#x27;ve made..  My waves stay put all day and look beautifully defined.

            <li> Love the stuff! Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner like no other. A few months back got the smaller 12 oz. bottles but now I&#x27;m going for the big long-lasting bottles. I was a little skeptical about it at first because I&#x27;m so used to the bubbly and foamy shampoos, and I have naturally curly hair that I&#x27;m trying to grow out more. The smell is AMAZING. If you wash your hair in the morning before starting your day the shampoo releases this sweet, minty, flowery, just delicious scent which is so invigorating.The conditioner is much the same. It&#x27;s refreshing and tingling and it&#x27;s just a great way to start your day. It&#x27;s also a great release from all the other coconut/shea butter/olive oil scented shampoos that other curly hair products seem to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it cleans your hair very well. I thought I would have to wash three or four times to feel like it&#x27;s really clean but wash once maybe twice like any other shampoo and you&#x27;re good. Since I got this shampoo I got a lot of compliments on how good my hair smells and it&#x27;s true, the scent stays with you most of the day. Sometimes the wind will blow or whatever and you think &amp;#34;Oh that&#x27;s nice, what is that smell? Oh! It&#x27;s my hair!&amp;#34; &amp;#60;&amp;#60;Thought that a lot. That may bother some people but personally I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways DevaCurl No-poo is definitely worth it and you should give it a go. If you&#x27;re still skeptical do what I did and start with the 12oz bottles or the even smaller travel size bottles they have.</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  I was a little hesitant at first to try but figured I&#x27;d try it after reading many reviews.  Don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to regular shampoo.  It really does get hair clean without stripping needed oils.  My hair naturally dry and bleached.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had curly hair most of her life and this is the first shampoo she is excited about using.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 11, a low maintenance girl in a high maintenance body. Deva Curl products are a blessing, helping her keep her curls under control and beautiful. Now her hair is wash and wear!</li>
            <li> DevaCurl is fantastic stuff. It keeps my curls soft and well conditioned. I have less fly away and frizzie hairs. The price of this set was great! DevaCurl is generally quite expensive when I buy from my stylist.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine, curly hair and my hair has never looked better! I use the B&#x27;Leave in Curl Booster, the Set It Free, and No Poo shampoo with One Condition and I love all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I have been through hundreds of products ranging from cheap to seriously expensive and the Deva line is by far the best for my hair. I am so glad my stylist put me on to it. WOOHOO!! I will be using these products from now on!</li>
            <li> Best curly hair shampoo products. Make my curls look their best.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to at first with no foam, but it does amazing things for my hair! So manageable, and not dry at the ends anymore!!! Glad I found it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ALL! THe best for curly hair</li>
            <li> For my daughter in law.</li>
            <li> these combination works so well on my dry brittle hair.  The no-poo cleans my hair without removing moisture, and the conditioner thick and smells great!</li>
            <li> Both items are as advertised. Arrived quickly. Not yet sure whether they are worth the money but they seem very good for dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> Deva products are great!</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and price. Will continue to order</li>
            <li> I love these two products - both the &#x27;non-sudsing&#x27; no sulfate good for your hair shampoo and the wonderful conditioner.  My daughter&#x27;s and I have curly hair, and mine is also dry.  These products leave our hair bouncy, shiny and revitalized.  Thoughtful botanical extracts and no animal testing make it a conscientious product as well.  Love the smell and the DevaCurl concept of not stripping the hair of natural oils needed for healthy locks.....</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> i really love using this product.. it was recommended to me by a friend for my daughters hair... since her hair is coarse and very very curly.. every other product i&#x27;ve used on her dried her hair out. unlike deva curls, which keeps my daughters hair moisturized and feeling very soft and her curls look amazing. i actually use this myself and i have thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;swavy\\&quot;/wavy hair according to DevaCurl. I received the travel/sampler package w/ the devatowel about a month and a half ago. I have taken pictures of my hair after every use, and I can definitely see an improvement. My hair started out very flat and my curls were practically pulled straight down/out. Since using DevaCurl No-Poo, One Condition, and AnGEL I&#x27;ve seen a significant increase in the definition of my curls. While I understand that the DevaCurl system is much more expensive compared to the Pantene Pro-V curl line that I was using, I feel like it&#x27;s been worth it. I&#x27;m much more pleased w/ the look of my hair since using these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fought the frizz of curly hair for years.  I definitely see a difference with these products.  So much less frizz.</li>
            <li> Disappointed by whole system. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and de tangled. My sister uses this product and recommended to me. However not for me</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair and I have fallen in love with the DevaCurl products. It took about a month to acclimate to it, but my hair is consistently softer than before and looks great!</li>
            <li> Great for curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> The seller replaced the actual Deva products with some sort of hand lotion or other terrible smelling product. These are not the same color or consistency as the Deva products. Don&#x27;t buy from them!</li>
            <li> Amazing for curly hair!</li>
            <li> The only product that has been able to tame my unruly curls and turn them beautiful!</li>
            <li> Favorite poo and conditioner around for my curls! Love the big bottles. I use them to refill my small travel sizes too!</li>
            <li> I really like the Deva Curl Combo. It is an excellent product for the curly ones out there.  Also a great option if you need just a very  mosturizing non harsh type of shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve been using for a while now. It&#x27;s the first time I bought a large size from this vendor, I will try it and update the review.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second round of the 32 ounce bottles.  These products WORK! My daughter and I both have thick curly hair.  Since we have started using, both of our hair is easier to manage and I get compliments all the time on how nice my hair looks.  Curly hair can be hard to manage, it is nice to have a product that works well and doesn&#x27;t dry it out or make it look dull.</li>
            <li> This set saved my hair!! There is no more frizz or &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; looking curls. I have very curly hair that is hard to tame but this, along with the styling clips and ultra defining gel works WONDERS! A MUST HAVE for curly girls.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells fantastic, does wonders for my curly locks, and my hair looks healthier :)</li>
            <li> For some reason the &amp;#34;Leave Seller Feedback&amp;#34; option is not working for me.  I received the product on time and the product is great, just what I expected.  However, the No-Poo Cleanser had leaked onto both bottles and the pump is broken.  I contacted Amazon and learned that this pump is not available, so they gave me a credit for the cost of the pump, which I will find elsewhere.  My only other option would be to mail both products back, return them and get replacements, which I don&#x27;t want to do because I want to hold on to the products.  My only frustration is that it&#x27;s impossible to contact Beauty It Is as far as I can tell.  The perfect solution for me would have been for them to mail me a new pump but this doesn&#x27;t see like an option.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. been using it for years ... I have the best curls on a 52 year old</li>
            <li> Great product recommend it to anyone with mixed or curly hair even kinky tight hair can benefit!!</li>
            <li> Not bad, but it smells weird (not fruity or like other shampoos) and dries your hair out when used together. It works best for your hair if you use the shampoo with another more moisturizing conditioner OR if you use another sulfate-free shampoo (even the low-pow would be better) and the conditioner. If you have oily hair, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I will ever use and it is AWESOME for curly hair peeps.</li>
            <li> Love these products for my curly hair!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.!!!!  I had been using the same hair products for at least 25 years (kerasilk),  and despite using other products along the way nothing compared, a year ago my hair dresser suggested these products, and I have never looked back since.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and most shampoos leave my hair freeze or i have to use many products to make the curls look good. With this product, i do not need anything but read the instructions of devacurl web page. Everyone think that i did something with my hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> I get complements all the time now on my hair. I tell everyone that it&#x27;s Devacurls. I&#x27;ve found for the best results follow with Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Hold Defining Gel.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!  Keeps my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does everything it claims it does. Before using the product my curls were frizzy waves and I hated the way they looked without heat styling. After using this shampoo and conditioner combo my waves are closer to curls and look great even when I just let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> This Deva Curl has changed my life now it only takes me 15 minutes to do my hair no hassle no dreading wash hair day. I simply love it. Also my hair is all natural no relaxer anymore. Highly recommend the conditioner because you go through a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these haircare products for several years. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry my  hair, my natural curl responds well to the line.</li>
            <li> So much love for this product. It has change my life. My hair and its accompanying frizz was a huge part of my life. Every day is a good hair day now! My curls look amazing, but more than that, they&#x27;re healthy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the DevaCurl products, they cleanse and hydrate my wavy/curly hair like no other and all silicone /sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I have super kinky curly blonde hair and heard about this stuff from a stylist it is the best product I have ever used my hair is bouncy and shiny instead of frizzy. It.is.magical.</li>
            <li> Not all curly hair is created equal.  Many of the reviews on here are from people with thick coarse hair who need moisture for their curls and have found love with Devo Curl.  I have naturally curly hair, but it is quite fine and thin.  I love the curl and always wear it curly because it gives my hair body, which it badly needs.  So, let me preface this by saying I do just fine with normal shampoo and conditioner and daily washings.  My main complaint with my hair that I am looking to alleviate is greasiness.  My hair cannot go longer than 24 hours between washes without looking greasy.  I have tried a couple of times to train it to be washed less frequently, but I just couldn&#x27;t do it.  My scalp just produces too much oil, and if my hair is \\&quot;trainable\\&quot; then it is going to take too long of a time commitment while suffering horridly greasy hair for me to weather it.  So, I was hoping this product was a stepped down solution from washing my hair with regular cheap shampoos every day.  I&#x27;ve been using Devo Curl for several days now, and am pleased with the results.  My hair looks nice and clean after washing it as directed.  The sudsless nature of it doesn&#x27;t bother me, as it was expected by the product directions.  I note that by the end of the 24 hours between washings, it looks a bit more greasy than it does with normal shampoo, but I shower in the mornings in order to activate my curls every day, so that is not a deal breaker, and with longer use, it may even get better (if so I will update this review).  One additional mention:  I dislike the smell of 95% of hair and skin products that I have tried.  I don&#x27;t want to smell fruity or perfume-y, or really anything at all most times.  The smell of this is heavenly.  It smells like a high end salon, but not in an overly chemically way.  You may not like it, plenty of reviews on here complain of the smell.  But I love it.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, wiry hair and have trouble finding good product to use on it. My hair is also very frizzy and at the first sign of humidity, likes to split all up into a giant frizz ball.&lt;br /&gt;Enter No-poo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by a colleague who is also a curly head, I knew I liked what it was doing to her hair. After a solid 4 weeks of use on my own, I can say I&#x27;ll never go back to &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo. With this product and a bit of gel, my curls are soft and downright bouncy. I also love that when I curl my hair with a curling iron, the curls stay in place and retain their shape without looking dry and wiry.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that I can use no-poo and then successfully go a whole day without any kind of frizz, no matter the humidity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;I still use a bit of moisturizing shampoo (that contains sulfate - the horror!) on my bangs every couple of days. I don&#x27;t like how my hair feels oily on my scalp after a few days of using the no-poo. Just that bit of sulfate on my scalp and not that often seems to give my hair what it needs to really shine and look great.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for how this product would smell. It reminds me a bit of the old Aveda hair care products.... but there is another scent that took some getting used to. If I could change one thing about the product, it would be the smell. (Though, my husband likes it, so that works)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the bad, I would still very much recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the DevaCurl! I have purchased about every product out that claims to prevent FRIZ and give soft natural curls BUT this shampoo and conditioner has actually done it!! I may stop getting my hair colored now it is that good! I get complements on my hair daily!! Thank You!!</li>
            <li> Really good. It worked better for me if I use de conditioning only at the ends avoiding the scalp. I have curly hair and I&#x27;m trying to recover from excessive use of heat.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and the extremely strong, old-lady scent forced me to rewash my hair and stop using it. Yuck!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  DevaCurl products are the BEST things I have ever used on my hair.  Finally, I can let my hair air dry without hating the results!  My curls last longer than ever, are bouncier than ever, feel soft, and smell great.  Unless my hair texture changes drastically, I&#x27;m never using another brand of shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but still struggle with how well the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; cuts the grease in my  hair. I have trouble rinsing it out, but overall the smell is really nice and combined with the defining gel my hair looks great. Downside, the pump arrived broken.</li>
            <li> The PUMP is just about impossible to get to pop up.  What were they thinking?  There are even third-party products sold here for people to use instead of these pumps!  I finally got it to pop up, no thanks to the very vague suggestions I&#x27;ve seen online.  To get the pump to pop up, you hold not to the base of the pump, but the MIDDLE SECTION.  Hold it very tight, with pliers if need be, and twist the top section counter clockwise.  Don&#x27;t waste your time spinning the top around endlessly.  It doesn&#x27;t take multiple rotations, it just requires the middle section to go clockwise and the top section to go counterclockwise.  Good luck and don&#x27;t hurt yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the pump, I love this product!  I have fine, relatively straight and very long hair, and I tried this to help soothe my very dry and irritated scalp.  This product works far better for me than any kind of foaming shampoo, no matter how natural or gentle they are supposed to be.  I use it as directed, but do sometimes comb out my hair gently after showering.  It does seem to encourage my hair to curl, but does not leave my hair frizzy.  I can brush my hair out as it dries and blow dry it for straight hair, or I can twist and scrunch my hair as it air-dries for waves.  I like that it is moisturizing, yet not heavy.  My hair shines and has body and looks better than with any other hair care product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a two other complaints:  First, I wish that this was a gluten-free formula as I have a wheat allergy and I have had topical reactions from previous products with wheat in them.  I have not had an issue so far with this, so I am risking it!  Second, I wish it was fragrance-free.  That said, it is a pleasant smell.  In spite of these nitpicks, I&#x27;m still giving it five stars.  I just wish there were many more hair care products formulated with a similar philosophy so those of us with ingredient sensitivities could have more choice.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for curly hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love these products!</li>
            <li> Have been using this combo for several years and swear by it!  Was running low on product and time and decided to try ordering online to save a trip to the store.  Quick delivery, product is the same as in stores but at a much better price.  Highly recommend this to those with curly or very wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product, hair stays really soft. Great for natural hair!</li>
            <li> I recommend for anybody with natural curly hair, Expensive but it seems to work well. Keeps hair soft, And manageable</li>
            <li> I have used Deva products for years. The conditioner is okay. The no-poo is blah. Granted, I bought this a while ago but shis no-poo doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well and I change up my shampoos religiously. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought these products. Expensive but so nice for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> DevaCurl is a very good product at a great price.  This product provides delicate conditioning on curly hair and is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I washed my hair the very first time, my hair looked and felt like it just got a cold gallon of water when it was lost in the desert. My hair was very dry and frizzy. It was impossible for me to ever leave my hair out and natural after all the years of flat ironing (shudders). This gave me such a confidence boost that I started recommending this along with ANgel to any one who had no love for their curly hair. These products has me looking at people with straight hair like &amp;#34;what the heck did I ever see in straightening???&amp;#34;. Now I get people looking at ME and wishing they had my hair. I WAS born with it and it&#x27;s definitely not maybelline.</li>
            <li> purchased for my daughter who has below shoulder length curls.....unfortunately this product seems to make the curls frizz</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better healthy soft n hydrated!!!</li>
            <li> DevaCurl products are the best.  If u r curly girl this the the product for u. Im only sorry that it took so many years for me to find out about the products and the special hair stylist that knows how to cut curly hair. Hands down the best. Katrina at CURLS ROCK, Boca Raton, Fl.</li>
            <li> I am a DevaCurl fanatic and you could imagine my disappointment when I received counterfeit product. Do yourself a favor, and buy directly from a salon or deva&#x27;s website, which only charges $1 for shipping.</li>
            <li> I love Deva Curl light gel. Best thing ever!  This set, not so much.  My hair seems drier and harder to get curl.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Beware! Purchased this on Amazon after finishing the salon bottles. It is different than what is sold in the salon. I&#x27;m sensitive to heavy fragrances which is why I liked the salon version. The Amazon bottles smell very soapy like Dove or another bar soap. It makes my eyes burn head itch. It has also left my hair brittle and frizzy- unlike the salon version. The color of the Amazon products are pure white whereas the salon bottle (conditioner, threw out shampoo) product has a light orange tint. I feel completely duped.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work well on my hair. I felt like my hair was so much drier and more fragile after switching to DevaCurl. It made my hair look curlier, for sure, but a drier and frizzier curl than it was before. My ends are also in worse shape after my switch. I&#x27;m swapping back to the Tigi Bed Head Resurrection shampoo/conditioner duo. They&#x27;re not specifically curly hair products, but they keep hair much more moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> If you have ever used real DevaCurl products, you will be able to tell the difference. Not only can I smell and see the difference in texture, my hair feels disgusting after thoroughly washing and rinsing. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a great price! Deva Curl is perfect for my curly, color-treated hair. I shampoo and condition every other day. Deva Curl is gentle and light enough that Day 2 hair is just as great as (if not better than) Day 1! I also use a little One Conditioner as a leave-in after regular conditioning, rinsing, and wringing. Then, I scrunch-dry my hair upside-down with a cotton t-shirt. The smell of both products is herbal and heavenly while in the shower, but subtle after. I love having the large bottles so I can refill my small bottles. The shipping of this set was even quicker than originally estimated. I am very happy with my purchase, and I&#x27;ll be back for more when my bottles run out. If you&#x27;re a curly-haired person like me who wants to avoid damaging sulfates, try Deva Curl. Your curls will thank you. And if you&#x27;re already a Deva Curl devotee, you can order here with confidence. What a great value!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but it des seem like it cleans the dirty out</li>
            <li> As I expected. I already use this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> great product. never used anything like it before! curls are looking better already. arrived very quickly. i would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Love this product. However, the pump on the product is usually broken and won&#x27;t pump the product out.  That is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about one and one half years and love it.  I will definitely keep using it</li>
            <li> These are awesome products!</li>
            <li> I have been using Deva Curl for a really long time now, and I&#x27;m happy I was able to purchase both 32oz bottles at the same time. If you haven&#x27;t already used these products and you&#x27;re a curly haired gal, I URGE you to do so! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I love the Deva because I color my hair twice a year and perm once a year and the Deva does not strip the color and makes the perm last longer!  No it does&#x27;t lather but it cleans very well!</li>
            <li> I love the Devacurl line and I usually buy from local salon. Shampoo in this package is great, conditioner seems watered down to me, compared to other bottles of the same conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li> great product. Curly haired old girls like me are so grateful for this product, along with their hair gel- helps my thinning hair look fuller and younger.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star I think this is a faulty product from this company because when I&#x27;ve used devacurl before I loved it this just made my hair frizzy</li>
            <li> You have to get used to washing your hair without lather, but it works just as well. Make sure you spread the shampoo evenly across your scalp and you won&#x27;t have any issues. My hair looks great, is clean, and I really like the way it smells: not fruity, just a neutral smell, reminds me of something you would smell at a health food store, though I can&#x27;t name it.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it works for my hair. The only negative is that the pump for the no-poo cleanser did not work...</li>
            <li> The products were delivered in perfect condition. They are also good and seem to be working fine with my hair. I need to keep using them for a while to really test how my hair reacts to them. But so far so good, the negative reviews are not accurate and there was no itching or chemical smell to the products. I contacted the seller after I had purchased the products and got a prompt response from them about my inquiry. However, I suggest you make more of an effort to be courteous and inviting in your reply to your customers. I got my answer, but the e-mail was not properly written and the answer was curt. Whoever replied did not bother to use salutation or end the e-mail. Other than that, I would definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have purchased DevaCurl One products separately from Amazon -- No Poo, Low Poo, One Conditioner, &amp; Set It Free, and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them. I have purchased a lot of high-end salon brands that are color-safe and nitrate and sulfate-free, which usually increases cost considerably. Not only is DevaCurl a huge bargain based on quality, but it&#x27;s optimized for curly &amp; wavy hair types, and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results. Healthy hair &amp; less/no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this particular purchase, I am thrilled to discover that both bottles have pump dispensers. Great purchase, super value with the combo pack (at times, this price is better than the Subscribe &amp; Save options), and prompt delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo/Cleanser: I have noticed some differences between the \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; that is part of this listing and the \\&quot;Low Poo\\&quot; that you can also buy from Amazon. The No Poo does not lather and has a floral scent, while the Low Poo lathers moderately and has a citrus scent. After using both, I am partial to the Low Poo. With the No Poo, it&#x27;s really difficult to know when you&#x27;ve applied enough to cleanse your hair and scalp. You feel a slightly cool tingly sensation after applying a decent amount, and in my case, I add a little water using my hands to help distribute the product through my hair. Also, it seems like the No Poo scent is a bit stronger than the Low Poo scent, and the floral is a little too much for me. In any case, I am grateful that I have been able to try both at competitive prices and compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: I am very pleased with the One Conditioner. I went on a hunt to find a great product for my postpartum hair, and after I read an interview with Laurie Berkner who talks about these products, I decided to give them a try. The One Conditioner is an exceptional value, performs as well as any high-end salon brand I&#x27;ve used, and keeps my hair balanced through the different New England seasons. It&#x27;s a winner, and I will be using it for a long time.time.</li>
            <li> I do not like the Conditioner very much, it leaves my hair straw feeling. I use the No Poo cleanser with a store brand conditioner now.</li>
            <li> Deva brings back my curls even when my curls lose they&#x27;re pattern due to extreme dryness. Best product on the market to nourish my thirsty curls.</li>
            <li> The product is fine but the pump on the shampoo doesn&#x27;t work...at all. That&#x27;s the second time that&#x27;s happened with this product. It&#x27;s ALOT of shampoo and a bit pricey to have a pump that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> works great on my course curly hair - even when I straighten it.</li>
            <li> I love it more than I expected to. It really softens my curls and doesn&#x27;t weigh them down. I still feel the need to use a regular shampoo maybe once a week, to really get a good lather so I can feel like I am washing all of my product buildup out...but that may be all in my head, so to speak. This makes my hair feel clean on its own.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, feeling a little concerned about some of the other reviews stating that it had been watered down. I found the exact opposite. It was incredibly thick and makes my hair feel great. The distributor, Beauty Pieces (BP), accidentally sent us two Conditioners instead of one of each. We contacted them and they apologized and told us they would send us the No Poo Shampoo immediately. It came just a couple of days later and they sent an envelope to return the extra conditioner along with postage. I brought the package to the Post Office and it was promptly returned the following day by a not-so-pleasant postal worker telling me that it was short $2.50 for postage. We contacted BP to let them know and they apologized for the inconvenience and told us to keep the Conditioner for our hassle. I not only recommend this product because I have found it to be wonderful and to smell great but also this company has wonderful customer service!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, defines curls and has eliminated any frizz from my curly/wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;The pump at the top of the bottle was broken, but the actual conditioner is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Was so glad it also had pump on the top of each for convenience in the shower. Love the smell and it works great for naturally frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Received in timely manner with no defects!</li>
            <li> I think this stuff smells horrible, my husband hates it too. And it does not make my curls bouncy and lovely, it makes them limp. I don&#x27;t know what the draw of this stuff is supposed to be, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Today I received my package the no Poo leaked I lost half of the bottle not happy yes I could send it back half empty but is it worth it</li>
            <li> I love deva girl, they have change my life from high maintenance to just the right amount of maintenance. I need to add extra conditioner to keep the frizzies down though, not daily. Light for sweet soft scrunchy curls.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT FOR CURLY HAIR and good price!</li>
            <li> Ever since I switched to devacurl my hair has never been in such great shape!  It&#x27;s wonderful for us &amp;#34;curly girls&amp;#34;...I just wish they had a salon here in Eastern Tennessee like I had in North Carolina!</li>
            <li> I use this on my 3 year old daughters hair. She is mixed with soft kinky curly hair. This really makes her curls come alive!!! It smells great and really gets out the tangles. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Buyers beware: Sellers are selling their stockpiles of much older version of this product on Amazon. I recently bought the No Poo Shampoo and One Conditioner 32oz combo. The shampoo seemed fine so I didn&#x27;t think anything of it until I eventually used the conditioner. It smeller drastically different from the One Conditioner I had bought at the salon. The smell was pretty awful. Since I had the empty bottle from the salon bought conditioner, I compared the ingredients list. They were noticeable different. The smell issue is pretty bad on its own but another thing to consider as well is that this older version of the product is likely not as good as the most current formulation. I also noticed a batch number above the barcode. The number above the salon bought bottle was #2102 while the one on the bottle I bought on Amazon was #1102. I like this product but the fact that there are much older forumations of it floating around on Amazon and sellers aren&#x27;t required to disclose this information makes purchasing it from Amazon problematic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Wonderful and the condiyioner leaves the hair feeling do soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a single mom. I don&#x27;t splurge on much... But I love DevaCurl! Unfortunately I was very disappointed by this shipment. It arrived quickly but had not been packaged properly and it had leaked out all over. So with my busy mom schedule I had to take time to clean up the mess it made. And lose our on the wasted  product. Then first time using the conditioner it had a stale smell and was more runny than it should have been. I&#x27;m not sure what happened to it but it&#x27;s very disappointing considering how expensive this product is. Now I will have to reorder the conditioner (from a different supplier). No way can I use what I received.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I have ever used. I have fine hair and color my hair. My hair is full and does not lose the color as fast as most other salon shampoos. I have tried most salon shampoos - this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I live overseas, and often times beauty products will not be available to ship to APO addresses, but all stars beauty did with no problem. My product arrived very promptly (within a week.) The only negative was that the shampoo had opened during shipping, and some of the contents had leaked out. I contacted the seller and they sent a replacement bottle at no charge immediately. I will definitely be buying all my products from now on from this seller, and will be recommending their site. Love the product as well!!!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other curl product. I am obsessed with DevaCurl. My curls have never looked better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use anything else but one condition and no-poo. My hair looks amazing every time I use it, and smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;subtract one star for  lack of reasonable packaging. Product arrived with 1/4 of the bottle spilled out on to everything else in my order. This was a 32 ounce bottle so that a lot of goop all over 1 box.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I was skeptical at first and have to admit that the shampoo is something you have to get used to since it doesn&#x27;t really lather.  It has made a huge difference in my hair though.  I have also found that I don&#x27;t have to shampoo my hair as often any more.  Without this product my hair would be so greasy the next day that I&#x27;d have to wash it every day.  Not the case anymore.  Now if I want I can go every other day (without using dry shampoo).  I am hooked and it is much cheaper on Amazon.  I was fearful that I would get some fake stuff but it was the real deal.  (I had a sample pack purchase from a salon to compare it to).  It has a light scent and makes my hair very soft.  I also use the curl gel and it works.  My hair is really curly (wavy).</li>
            <li> Love love love these products! My hair feels so much happier than it used to. Only issue is that the pump for my conditioner doesn&#x27;t work 😞</li>
            <li> The conditioner bottle cracked and spilled all over the box... Waste of expensive product</li>
            <li> Before I got a special curly haircut and started using DevaCurl products, my hair was big. I mean huge. Like Merida huge. It was extremely frizzy. And long, down to my waist. It was a lot of straight pieces and wavy on top and some corkscrew curls interspersed throughout. It was hard convincing my family that I actually had curly hair and wasn&#x27;t about to go live in the jungle.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have about 6 inches in shrinkage and my curls are soft and bouncy and defined. And sometimes I do want to revert (I had a special bond with my crazy hair, now everyone thinks that I style it), but I don&#x27;t. If you&#x27;re a curly girl, before you start using these products or continue to use these products, go get a dry haircut by someone who is experienced in cutting curly hair. [...] (a link to naturallycurly&#x27;s salon finder)&lt;br /&gt;According to my sister, I actually look like a human being now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DevaCurl, while a bit pricey, is totally worth it, and you really don&#x27;t use that much of the No-Poo, as you&#x27;re only supposed to cleanse your hair twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested, my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-3 pumps of No-Poo&lt;br /&gt;Rinse&lt;br /&gt;2 pumps of conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Comb&lt;br /&gt;Rinse&lt;br /&gt;Squeeze excess water out from the bottom (never towel dry)&lt;br /&gt;1 small pump of conditioner for leave-in purposes&lt;br /&gt;3-5 pumps of DevaCurl Frizz Free Foam&lt;br /&gt;Pineapple hair with scrunchie until dry. Make sure you scrunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you can just rinse between cleanse days, with just the conditioner by eliminating just the first step above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To refresh limp hair, get a water spritz bottle and thoroughly dampen hair. 1 pump of DevaCurl Frizz Free Foam. Then pineapple until dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun with the curls!</li>
            <li> I like the no-poo a lot. The conditioner is OK - other conditioners seem to work as well for much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love these products-I like the shampoo better but the conditioner is not bad I just like the Crack conditioner better…. do not like crack shampoo-</li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t contain detergent, which most shampoos do, and therefore, allows your hair to look and feel shinier and healthier!  After going to the Devachan Salon and learning how to use their products, I am getting awesome results.  I also use the Ultra Defining Gel which does a great job defining your curls without being sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested regimen:  While in the shower, after cleansing and conditioning with DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition (don&#x27;t squeeze out water after rinsing out conditioner), bend at the waist and apply a generous amount of Ultra Defining Gel to soaking wet hair by coating product gently over the bottom, top and each side of hair.  (You do not need to apply it throughout your hair but only as an outer shell.) Then grab the ends and begin squeezing upward, scrunching the hair and squeezing out the excess water.  You can then take a microfiber towel and continue to gently scrunch as you remove more moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand up straight and \\&quot;don&#x27;t touch\\&quot; your curls again until they are dry.  You can put some clips on small sections on top to allow the hair to dry with some height.  Then, after hair is dry, you can slide your fingers under the top layers of hair and hand scrub your scalp to loosen up the curls and then scrunch again the outer curls to break up the cast from the gel.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at the results!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, I bought this for the first time in December and recent got new ones. I love it! My curls hold nicely are soft and bouncy and I get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair you cannot live without DevaCurl. These products keep your curls bouncy and Frizz-Free. Most other items on the market leave curls feeling dry, heavy and full of product while DevaCurl moisturizes and hides split ends and frizz. Being a Curly Girl I couldn&#x27;t live with out.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you make an important decision!</li>
            <li> Great no-sulfate and silicone free products. My husband has thick, straight, course, porous hair and this is the only shampoo/conditioner we&#x27;ve ever found that makes his hair behave itself. &amp;#34;Conventional&amp;#34; shampoos make his hair look like straw and stand on end. We originally bought it for me, (I have baby fine, thick, wavy/curly, non-porous hair) but it&#x27;s too heavy for regular use. I use Acure Organics Moroccan Argan Oil + Argan Stem Cell Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
            <li> As of November I&#x27;ll have been using these products for a year...the difference I&#x27;ve noticed in the health of my hair is AWESOME, I will never go back to other products.  After I got past the first month of using this system (your hair might go through a transition period as it adjusts to this new formula you&#x27;re introducing which has none of the chemicals it&#x27;s used to if you&#x27;ve been using products with parabens and sulfates etc...) but definitely don&#x27;t stop using it! Your hair and scalp will adjust and your hair will get stronger, shinier, healthier! LOOOOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> Great products. I won&#x27;t continue to use them because I&#x27;ve found other products more suitable for me, but I definitely recommend this for anyone starting their curly girl method. The difference on my hair is amazing! I pair these up with the ultra-defining gel. As a 2B type, I was recommended the ArcAngel, but that product was not for me. The light defining gel worked just fine and it was very light, but I personally need more to get definition to say; which is why I switched gels. I may continue to use the ultra defining gel, because I love it so much! I leave most of the conditioner on post shower and scrunch in the gel as I go. On days 2 and 3 the hair tends to still look great if I use the pineapple technique for going to bed. If anything goes wrong, I recommend using the Mist-er Right or watered down conditioner to get your waves to wake up from their slumber.</li>
            <li> I got this product from Sephora. I am absolutely pleased with the No Poo and One condition products. These two products left my hair soft and moisturized my curls. I will definitely buy again and I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I have been using these hair products for many years and I love them. This set is a pretty good deal. It&#x27;s not pictured but the bottles come with pumps which was a pleasant surprise since I usually save a pump from an old bottle just in case.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles arrived leaking, but I like the Deva product line.</li>
            <li> The products came in a timely fashion, but one of the bottles came with a broken top. The top was supposed to be a pump top that you turn and the pump pops up, but when I turned the top, the top didn&#x27;t pop up. It&#x27;s inconvenient to use the bottle now as I have to open the top each time and product gets wasted.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and condition for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Gets my curls nice and clean!</li>
            <li> My order delivered the next day, shipping was fast, thank you. The products is good, its perfect for people who has curler or beach waves hair. But it does small a little like some other people said in their review. Over all, I think this is a good hair set.</li>
            <li> Every time I buy this product my hair loves it.  Won&#x27;t last long since I have really long hair but I can always tell the difference from one product to another.  I will be buying from this seller again.  This product was legit.</li>
            <li> Great price, quality products. I suggest this for anyone with naturally curly hair as well as the Curly Girl e book.</li>
            <li> Has totally changed my hair! My curls are frizz free and shape perfectly on their own with very little product.</li>
            <li> All their products are outstanding. I think they are particularly good for dry hair, but would work with any hair type. I like that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like a brillo pad after I wash with these products. The conditioner smells great.</li>
            <li> Curly Girl products and methods are simple and work for my curls. I only wish I had known about it years ago.</li>
            <li> The title clearly states one conditioner + no poo, however the package is 2 bottles of the same no poo shampoo. Disappointed, need to purchase conditioner separately.</li>
            <li> My hair feels completely different. My hair is softer and voluminous after using​ hair products.</li>
            <li> So happy I tried these......loving my hair/curls more than ever!</li>
            <li> I tried the DEVA system at a friend&#x27;s house over a year and a half ago and was CONVERTED. My hair is waist length and curly, but with a little bit of a wave as opposed to a corkscrew curl. I really hated the way this product smelled, and it took a VERY long time to get used to; however, I didn&#x27;t notice that this product was more pungent than any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my problem with my current product is the ITCH. I&#x27;m not sure whether this is a knockoff or if the formula has changed, but my scalp ITCHES! Blood under my fingernails from scratching itches, and I still have a large portion of the bottle left. I had originally wondered if I just needed to switch shampoos, but after reading some other customers reviews expressing similar problems, I may try purchasing the products from another seller or wesbite to see if they work better. I don&#x27;t want to go back to washing my hair with sulfates. It looks so good now!</li>
            <li> This is the best system for my very curly hair ever.  Gone are the tangles, the split ends, and the painful brushing - in comes the long hair and compliments!  I love my long curly hair now!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I started using this in August 2012, and we love it. It seems pricey but buying it this way is a better deal than shopping at brick and mortar store Ulta. For the One Condition, we don&#x27;t first put it in and rinse and then add more to leave in. We only use it as a leave in, per the instructions from the stylist who cut my daughter&#x27;s hair (10 inches for Locks of Love) taking her to a short, curly style!</li>
            <li> Best curly hair products on the market, I highly recommend these. The large bottles last a long time and are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  would definitely recommend it to anyone who has out of control frizzy hair. After one use of this product could see results immediately.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my hair feel silky smooth. I have keratin in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t strip it out. Nice with color-treated hair too.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten softer, shinier and silkier since I started using DevaCurl. It doesn&#x27;t turn into a frizz ball when I let it air dry, and if I decide to blow-dry my hair it no longer looks like cow-chewed straw strands. The plan was to alternate this with regular shampoo, switching between the two every week, but I find myself always reaching for DevaCurl. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying regular shampoo from here on, this product is IT for me!!!</li>
            <li> I like the Deva Curl products but have quit using them because I have purchased some that have a strong chemical smell.  I believe the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; smell fades with time and you are left with that chemical smell. I have returned to organic products that seem to work just as well on my hair.</li>
            <li> if you have curly hair...no suds shampoo will not strip it&lt;br /&gt;or dry it out...sometimes I wash my hair using only the conditioner</li>
            <li> Love DevaCurl products, they&#x27;re wonderful for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner tame curly hair. The product helps moisturizer my daughter&#x27;s hair and tame the curls and frizz.</li>
            <li> I love it!! Doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of it natural oils and it leaves my hair so curly and hydrated..</li>
            <li> I spent the first 40 years of my life with crazy, frizzy, curly hair. This stuff works great! I got my sister to try it too because we have the same hair and she loves it!  I will never use anything else. It&#x27;s so nice to have good hair. Finally.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price is great!</li>
            <li> My sister turned me on to DevaCurl products ~3 years ago and I have been using them ever since.  I did have to get used to not having the lather effect when washing my hair as well as not feeling that it was &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; but no worries. With DevaCurl products, my hair stays clean longer and the curls are more pronounced (which means the frizz has diminished significantly).  I buy the larger sized containers and tend to combine the products as it is more economical to do that.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner ever for those with naturally curly hair!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, wonderful provider.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a few moms of little girls with curly hair after I had asked what can I do to detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It was totally matted, no shine or body to it, no curls, just a total mess.  I received this product and first used it on myself.  I have straight hair, but it needs help too.  It worked great on me ... BUT, it worked miracles on my daughter.  Not only did her hair shine, NO knots, but I have never seen her curls look the way they did.  I did put a little conditioner in her hair as leave in as well.  I thought the smell was like Dove bar soap, which isn&#x27;t bad ... and the smell diminishes once hair is dry.  I cannot say enough about this shampoo and conditioner.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is very coarse, very dry, very knotty ... and this product is truly a miracle.</li>
            <li> best no-poo and conditioner on the market...makes my curls look great and less frizz..I would highly recommend to everyone with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Got it for my friends daughter who has really curly hair. .. They love it... No tangles!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product or feel that it helped with my natural curls. Not worth cost</li>
            <li> Unlike any shampoo I have ever used. I have issues with dry hair and this worked better than anything I&#x27;ve used before. I think I&#x27;m going to try the devacare the next time around.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> it came broken when i open the package and stunk up my house. I bought this for a friend and it also came late</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best shampoo and conditioner for my dry curly hair. The NoPoo is designed to clean dirt but not remove oil, so it keeps hair from drying out, meaning less frizz and more curl. At first, my hair got greasy using it, but it soon djusted and stopped making excess oil because I stopped stripping it of its natural oil. The conditioner is great too.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have curly hair. This is the only product that softens our curls without the frizz. Love the smell!</li>
            <li> it appears that women with curl have more bad hair days, however, I discovered the DivaCurl website and decided to take a chance on trying something different again. I know that I personally have tried every solution to try and make my hair straight. Today, I now embrace my natural curl and have found all Deva hair products to work very well if you go with your natural curl - never to use harsh products or curl/flat irons again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to others that want to show off their natural curls. However, read her book or visit a registered salon before you expect miracles...</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great, low lather, and smells faintly of rosemary.  The conditioner seems very runny and not particularly moisturizing for my curls.  It also has a weird citrus bathroom cleaner smell.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered the smallest size to try this. You will reek for days even after trying to wash it out with other product.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the DevaCurl line. I use their No-Poo, their conditioner, their Ultra Defining gel, and their styling pomade. The No-Poo and the conditioner have a nice floral smell (in my opinion), and they both have a nice creamy texture. I was using Redken before I switched to DevaCurl, and I was really disappointed with how loose my curls seemed to be. Once I switched to DevaCurl, my curls bounced up so amazingly well that even my stylist commented that my hair seemed to be getting curlier every time she saw me. I highly recommend the DevaCurl line to anybody - curly hair or straight. My mother has straight hair, but she switched to DevaCurl because it wasn&#x27;t as harsh on her hair as regular shampoo. She loves the fact that she can go several days now without her hair becoming super greasy. When I purchased this set, the bottles did come with a pump on each bottle (no regular caps), but I think it depends on which seller you buy it from.</li>
            <li> repeat offender. I swore I woulnd&#x27;t pay this much for shampoo but hey I love it so I did</li>
            <li> Best product for curls. No other products can compare. I&#x27;ve been using the system for over a year now and will never go back to sulfates, silicones, or parabens.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER FOR CURLY HAIR!!!! Especially, if you have fine curly hair. I have tried so many other products, expensive and not so expensive and I always return to DevaCurl. It is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to shampoo and conditioner for natural wavy hair. No more poodle head! The pumps are nice, but it would be good to get regular caps, too, so I can turn the bottles over as they run out.</li>
            <li> Good for your curls, terrible for your skin. If you use this product and you have normal/mixed skin make sure it does not fall on your face. It could make you breakout. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about 4 years now and love them.  My hair is in much better shape and my curls are better defined.  I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite conditioner. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I have curly hair and this is the best I have ever tried. I buy the 32 oz of no poo and one condition. Its really great, with these large bottles you dont have to buy it very often,  I probably go through 3 bottles of conditioner and 2 bottles of no poo a year. They also smell great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying my 3rd round of this 32 oz combo and I am total Devangelist!  My hair has been frizzy from puberty on to my mid-30s, when I discovered this product.  I had resigned myself to just having to be ok with super high maintenance hair that looked decent at best... at least I loved other aspects of my appearance! ... and now I just LOVE my hair!!!  Shampoo with sulphates strips your hair of oils, and your scalp then compensates by creating more oil... but with curly hair you end up with dry curls and an oily scalp.  My scalp and hair feel so balanced now and I wash my hair twice a week and it looks hydrated and not oily.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this when I noticed a colleague in my office who&#x27;s hair was way shinier and fuller all of the sudden and I assumed she got some special salon treatment so I asked her what it was and she said &amp;#34;no-poo!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;If you are switching from sulphate shampoo to no-poo I would recommend getting hair powder (dry shampoo) to tame the slight excess oiliness at first from your scalp taking a few weeks to get used to not having to produce so much oil to make up for the old oil-stripping shampoos.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a slightly minty smell that I like. It doesn&#x27;t foam and I&#x27;m surprised that I don&#x27;t miss the foam. I know it&#x27;s missing all those nasty chemicals that would damage my color-treated hair. It gets my hair clean and leaves it silky even without the conditioner. But I use the conditioner every time I shampoo and it makes my hair manageable and shiny. Great duo.</li>
            <li> Use if for my daughters hair.  Fantastic.  Just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.... but it&#x27;s worth every penny.  They sell this now at Target but only the small size which isn&#x27;t worth it because it only comes in a small size.</li>
            <li> These products are expensive, but well worth it.  My scalp feels fresher longer, my hair is healthier, and I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day.</li>
            <li> Product recieved on time although the pump to the conditioner was damaged in either packaging or delivery. I dont know. I contacted the seller through Amazon on the same day of receipt 12/24 and as of today still no response. So..1) Yes on product.  2)No on seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does what its supposed to do. It eleminates frizz while returning moisture to the hair making curls more defined, bouncy and no longer dry.  Both the shampoo and conditioner are creamy and  Easy to apply. It smells great. If you have extreme texture to your curls and need to return it moisture this is what you want.  D&amp;eacute;va Curl will define the strand. Great Product.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t think the poo and conditioner were necessary.  But they are for me  It really makes a difference in my hair.  I have used wen and sally&#x27;s one for a while.  This is better for my type hair.  My natural curly hair is graying and chemically colored.  Fine in texture, porous and I have a lot of hair.  If I look at rain it frizzes.</li>
            <li> Great products  leaves curly/wavy hair clean smelling and manageable. Quick delivery from this vendor.  Thank you😃</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well on my curly hair.  I&#x27;ve bought it several times from this distributor and the prices are always reasonable and it arrives well packaged and on time.</li>
            <li> So much better for my daughter&#x27;s long curly hair than other shampoos. Her hair is not as dry and easier to detangle.</li>
            <li> I have been a DevaCurl girl for years and have tried other products targeted for curly hair suggested by friends...but I always go back to DevaCurl (those friends are DevaCurl girls now too). Love the revamped difuser as well. As a user you have to find the correct protocol that works for you. I find that reapplying a bit of &amp;#34;water downed&amp;#34; conditioner works well as a leave-in conditioner in combination with the cream or light gel.</li>
            <li> I have lots of curly, thick, dry, corse hair and I was excited to try this product set. The shampoo (no-poo) really did seem to have a great effect on my hair, but the conditioner was terrible. It left my hair feeling almost worse than before getting in the shower. My hair also would come out in clumps when washing or conditioning (clogged tub drain, anyone?). Overall, a horrible experience and I would not recommend. :(</li>
            <li> First I bought the trial kit - wanted to try this product line. And I love it! No I bought big bottles. DevaCurl really helps my hair get light and curly. The smell is not so great when you wash your hair, but the curls afterwards  are just perfect. Would buy again, definitely.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it is a frizzy rat&#x27;s nest without this shampoo. I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is the second Devacurl product I&#x27;ve bought &amp; I can&#x27;t believe how awesome these products are! Where were they my whole life?! I&#x27;ve been struggling with my very curly hair forever but not anymore! These products really work! The best thing to do is google Lorraine Massey &amp; watch her utube videos on how to use her products. If you follow her instructions &amp; tips the products will work perfectly.  The no poo shampoo is kind of strange at first because it doesn&#x27;t make suds but your hair will definitely be clean. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair at all &amp; makes it super soft. I will definitely be buying these products again.</li>
            <li> Really helped my damaged hair....I do not see any change in helping curl but no frizz</li>
            <li> if you have curly hair this is all you should ever use</li>
            <li> I have 4a,b, and C hair. I really like what both of these do for my hair. The No-Poo gets my scalp clean and refreshed. And it leaves my hair clean without being dry. The conditioner is awesome. My hair loves it, my skin not so much. I&#x27;ve had to adjusted the way I use it so that it does not cause my skin to break out. But then again too much oil also causes me to break out. I also use their Styling cream. For all of their products, a lot really does go a long way. I cannot cut out my use of oil completely, my scalp still needs a little jojoba oil once a day, but for the most part, I don&#x27;t need any other extra heavy creams or balms so much. I only break out the SM curling smoothie when I am doing a wet/set type of style. They are awesome, but you will have to try to find out.</li>
            <li> I love the no-poo and one conditioner. I have been using both for a while now and love how my hair feels and smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my most recent re-fill, I was unable to get the pump to work on the conditioner. It seems like the conditioner got thicker or something. The pump itself works as I tried it in the shampoo bottle. The product still works the same, just less convenient to dispense it this way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have thin, highlighted, wavy curls and I&#x27;ve been battling frizz my entire life.  I live on the coast and it&#x27;s always very hot and very humid.  I also used to have a problem with my hair getting very oily - especially at my scalp.  I would have to cover my head in some type of dry shampoo if I ever wanted to skip washing my hair for a day.  DevaCurl No Poo and One Conditioner changed all of that!!  My hair is very very moisturized and is never ever oily.  I can easily wear 2nd and 3rd day curls without a problem.  After I use the No-Poo and One Condition I put a little bit of Heaven In Hair in and use it as a styling cream.  Then I use the B&#x27;Leave In and diffuse it with the blow dryer.  For my 2nd and 3rd day curls I mix some of the Heaven In Hair (just a little) with the B&#x27;Leave In and water in a spray bottle.  I spray my hair all over and diffuse again to set the curl.  Works great!  I haven&#x27;t tried the Set It Free product yet from DevaCurl, but that&#x27;s next on my list.  For now, I&#x27;m very very happy with my current regimen.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo (sulfate free) and conditioner.  So glad I have found a product made just for my curly hair.  It is sulfate free so it does not lather but still cleans my hair and scalp and smells good too.  The conditioner does not build up, is light and also smells nice.  After I use it (and can be used daily if you want) my hair feels great.  Also, this product really does fight curly hair frizz.  It is July, it rains every afternoon, and my hair behaves.  I don&#x27;t think I will fight my curls anymore....throw away that flat iron and just let it be itself.</li>
            <li> reliable, good shipping. this is a great product for curly hair, I&#x27;ve been using it for years and happy to be able to purchase using prime.</li>
            <li> The only product I will buy for my natural curls!</li>
            <li> Love this product line.  Am always surprised at how clean my hair feels and the great texture my curls have when using this. Unfortunately it does have a drying affect not in my hair but on my scalp so I don&#x27;t use in winter. Also wish they would offer a creamier conditioner and a different scent. Not fond of the lemon lime.</li>
            <li> This feels like I get a build up after a week or so. I occasionally have to use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of that feel.</li>
            <li> I have been using DevaCurl products for quite some time now and they are great.  I have a mix of 3b and 3c hair type and they give me the necessary amount of moisture without weighting my hair down.  I&#x27;m against a long routine so this are great. I wash, condition and use the light gel; and my hair stay frizz free for at least 3 days.</li>
            <li> Love this combo on my hair. My hair is as luminous, thick and curly as it can be! Thanks Deva!</li>
            <li> I have used the conditioner for over 4 years. I felt that this bottle had been watered down. The conditioner was thin and runny.  Not happy and will not buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> They smell great, cleanse my hair and fully hydrate it too!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, dry hair and get terrible dandruff with anything that foams. The no-poo cleans my scalp and doesn&#x27;t dry it. The only downside is the quantity I have to use because I have so much hair, but I put it just on the scalp and massage it, then put my head in running shower for a second or two and let the no-poo dilute a little bit and run down the reset of my hair. I use the conditioner and leave it in for a couple minutes and only wash about half of it out. Sometimes I use the conditioner as a styling cream as well.</li>
            <li> The best if you have curls!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on this stuff after using it for 2 months.  I notice a big difference in the texture and overall health of my hair.  These products do seem to make the curls even prettier.</li>
            <li> Must have for anyone battling curly hair. :)</li>
            <li> My wife received a 16 oz bottle in a gift pack as a Christmas gift. She loves how it tames her curls yet still leaves body!</li>
            <li> I love the deva curl but I&#x27;m not crazy about the shampoo. I feel like it doesn&#x27;t do a great job on leaving you with a clean hair but I have seen the difference with my curls,</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered these products.  My curly hair was driving me crazy until I found these.  Absolutely recommend and this size lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> These products are amazing for those that have curly hair!</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly, but it smelled kind of different than the smaller DevaCurl No-Poo and One Condition I had purchased earlier, and had a different consistency. After using it for a while, my hair isn&#x27;t quite as soft as it was with the earlier products I was using, but I guess that could be the seasonal change? But after reading other reviews commenting on the smell and wondering if it was different, makes me think it&#x27;s a different product. Knock-off?</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have curly hair and avoid harsh products. We both especially like the gentle No Poo.</li>
            <li> My favourite product EVER!</li>
            <li> Love this line of products. It&#x27;s a great idea to make a combo pack.</li>
            <li> I love that these come together and for a reasonable price.  I tried the low-poo shampoo and did not like it at all.  After using it and rinsing it out, it felt like there was a weird film over my hair.  Almost as if I smeared pure aloe goo on it.  But the no-poo is so awesome!  No filmy feeling an soft defined curls. Plus I love the scent of both the no-poo shampoo and the one condition separately but when you us them together, the scent is magical!  I love that this doesn&#x27;t smell like a sweet fruit basket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products for my curls and none of them have been as good as Deva products. Deva products give my curls softness and bounce. The conditioner makes my curls so much easier to style. The shampoo however doesn&#x27;t quiet clean my hair,after a day my hair feels itchy. I use it in combination with other shampoos. I still use it because the shampoo also makes my hair softer and helps out my curls.</li>
            <li> Many have noticed an improved change in my hair. Its much healthier and curlier and so easy to manage. Love this product. Took me a while to get used to the very little/no lather in shampoo, but hair comes out clean without feeling :&amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34;. New lifetime user!</li>
            <li> This package came late and had leaked in transit. The pumps on these large 32 oz containers do not work. Now I have no efficient way to dispense of the product.  Very disappointed with this purchase and will not purchase from this location again.</li>
            <li> The DevaCurl system is great! I had pretty much given up on my naturally curly hair ever looking good again. It was dry and limp, but DevaCurl works wonders. The DevaCurl process took some getting used to at first (as did the price!), but I honestly believe it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ve never been willing to spend much on beauty products of any kind, but this system really does work for me, and I will be sticking with it!</li>
            <li> I was visiting some friends overnight and used this in the shower. It was astoundingly good for my very long straight  thinning hair. It made it thick and lustrous and smooth. It just felt so good and looked so good. Shampoo and conditioner can do this? I thought it was all hype!  It&#x27;s advertised for thick and curly hair (hmmm?). It&#x27;s expensive and I have been strictly a cheapest shampoo in the aisle shopper for years, but I bought this stuff because it was remarkable for three days after washing.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair that would frizz out if we would brush it.  with the DevaCurl system, she NEVER brushes her hair when it&#x27;s dry.  The No Poo and Conditioner are all the products she uses.  After her shower, she combs her hair &amp; lets it air dry.  It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for 6 years.  I always come back because my hair and scalp are so much better using DevaCurl products.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how is makes my hair feel. I use it in the shower and when I get out as a leave in. It works really well and the curls stay hydrated and without frizz for the duration of the day,</li>
            <li> Products are as stated, unfortunately not sent as quickly as prime, but that was disclosed. So therefore this was expected.</li>
            <li> Lightweight so it makes my hair extra curly because it&#x27;s not weighed down. Also conditions so my hair isn&#x27;t tangly. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has been on the &amp;#34;perpetual search&amp;#34; for a hair product that is free from harmful chemicals and actually works!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Smells so good and my hair has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li> Seemed to be the real deal, and very gentle on hair. Deva conditioners don&#x27;t have a lot of slip imo, but love the smell and that they don&#x27;t leave my hair weighted down, even though I do use a little as a leave-in at the end. No poo is no lather, but seems to be just what my scalp wants.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair and love this cleanser and conditioner set.  It&#x27;s dry enough where I live, and sudsing shampoos just compound this problem.  The Dev products get my hair clean without stripping it and let the natural curl come out--the conditioner is not too heavy.  Works great as a tear-free cleanser/conditioner for my two girls, one who has curly hair and one who has wavy hair.</li>
            <li> i am in love with my curly hair. where was this product when I was in high school? Could have save me many a frizzy nickname! love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love</li>
            <li> While this didn&#x27;t 100% work for me, I still gave this 5 stars because it was my fault, not the product&#x27;s . I meant to order the low-poo since my hair is so oily and that&#x27;s what I had last time, but I bought this by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is wonderful for those with curly or wavy hair. My curls have thrived since I switched to this line! The only thing I really have to say about it is if you do have hair that is prone to being really oily, make sure you get the low-poo and not the no-poo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has curly hair, too, and he decided to use this when he ran out of his own products. He uses this now, as well, and he loves it too.</li>
            <li> I love devacurl and feel it has made my hair much healthier, but when I received the product, I realized most of the product had spilled from the cap into the plastic package it was wrapped in. I usually don&#x27;t complain when things like that happen because I understand that these things happen during delivery, but because of how expensive the product is I was rather disappointed. Perhaps instead of packaging the shampoo and conditioner with the pumps in place, they could use regular caps and just include the pumps, that could maybe help it from not spilling out. I will definitely buy this product again, just from a different seller.</li>
            <li> These hair care products have changed the way, I care for my hair.  My morning hair ritual is a fraction of the time it used to be.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair. Not tight, corkscrew curls or anything, just waves and some loose curls thrown in. It is INCREDIBLY EXTREMELY THICK, which makes it look awfully HUGE and puffy (as one of the other comments said, Merida huge), extremely frizzy, and very textured, so I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a product that can make my hair look less… of well, all of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DevaCurl worked miracles on my hair. My curls (and waves) look neater, more defined, shiny, and just good in general. My hair is ALOT less puffy, too. (I also use the AnGEL when my hair is air drying) It didn&#x27;t help all that much with the frizz, but it makes my hair very soft. For the frizz I do a tiny squirt of the John Frieda Frizz-Ease on my hair. I love the smells, too. The No-Poo smell is not my favorite, but I think One Condition smells like gumdrops and AnGEL smells like peaches. If you don&#x27;t like the smell at first, it will just take a while to get used to, but trust me, it&#x27;s SO WORTH IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, THIS IS IMPORTANT: YOU SHOULDN&#x27;T BUY IT ONLINE! I think most salons will have it, but if they don&#x27;t, ask your hair dresser. They sell it at target but in a smaller size. I have the big ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is interested, here is my hair care routine, too:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No-Poo&lt;br /&gt;scrunch and rub the No-Poo in your hair&lt;br /&gt;rinse&lt;br /&gt;One Condition&lt;br /&gt;scrunch and rub the One Condition in your hair&lt;br /&gt;rinse&lt;br /&gt;let your hair air dry for a little while. Then when the top is still wet but underneath is dry, squirt about the size of a nickel into your hand, rub your hands together, rub a little of your fingertips, then SCRUNCH! Scrunch it all in your hair. Don&#x27;t rub it in, just scrunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a tiny squirt of Frizz-Ease into your hands, rub them together, and run your hands through your hair. If you don&#x27;t your hair will get gross and greasy and weighted down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an amazing product! I will definitely be getting this from my hair dresser all the time!r dresser all the time!</li>
            <li> I bought the DevaCurl duo. Love the No poo, still iffy on the condish. It is too expensive to use a lot. I cowash with Tresseme Natural and use the One Conditioner as a LI. Will get back to you about with a better review soon....</li>
            <li> Been hooked on Deva for years now, nothing else compares and trust me when I tell you I have tried many, many products over the years.</li>
            <li> This combination will solve all your curly hair problems, forever!!!</li>
            <li> Love these products.  My hair is looking so healthy and shiny since I have started the curly girl method.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I used to straightened my hair everyday because I couldn&#x27;t control the frizz.  Now, I let it be curly and it is never frizzy.  I have used so many products in the past it&#x27;s ridiculous.  This is the best!!  Curly Girl: The Handbook by Michelle Bender, who recommends and/or created this product is an absolute must.  She has and knows how to work with curly hair.  My hair is thick and course with S curls.  AND...I found a stylist that knows how to cut curly hair...what a difference!  That was a another recommendation from the book.  I now love my curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is like that of a household cleaner in my opinion. I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in my hair&#x27;s moisture or frizz, so I&#x27;m still testing it out.</li>
            <li> Its not the real product. Its very very watered down!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST haircare product for curl hair; it&#x27;s changed my life.  The price is great compared to what you can find locally.</li>
            <li> great products, love the conditioner! Makes my kids hair feel like silk!</li>
            <li> I went from a better product to this stuff. Not what I expected.  Won&#x27;t repeat:( disappointed since the reviews were stellar before I made my purchase. I still had knots in my hair after using the ultra creamy conditioner version. Not cool!</li>
            <li> decent scent and seems to leave hair feeling hydrated. Only problem was cap wasn&#x27;t on very tight when it was shipped so some of the conditioner leaked and made a mess in the box.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the bottle exploded and my mother was disappointed on that</li>
            <li> The product was received in a timely manner, however the conditioner was spilt inside the package and the pump is now broken. I weeny to use the product today and love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. It does not feel weighed down. I will use for a about a week and come back and provide feedback. Again disappointed in the shipping and broken pump which is why I won&#x27;t give it a 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I really like these products, I had a bad color job done on my hair and I can feel a difference since I have started using these products.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a friend and a stylist. Unfortunately the cut the stylist gave me, a &amp;#34;DevaCut&amp;#34;, was awful BUT I love the product she used. It smells nice and I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates in it. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t get sudsy or lather AT ALL. which is great for me because sulfates in regular shampoos were destroying my scalp, especially in the winter. The conditioner is also great, you can put it in your hair during your shower and rinse it out just a little and leave some conditioner in (like a leave-in) and style as usual. This is supposed to hydrate your hair more than rinsing it all out - not sure if that actually happens but at least there&#x27;s no sticky residue after drying when I leave some in. This is intended for curly-wavy hair, but can be used on any type of hair since all it really does is add moisture.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
            <li> For curly hair, this is the only way to fly!  All other hair products are gone!</li>
            <li> Simple: this stuff works!  Absolutely love it! Use it religiously and your hair will love you back with beautiful curls!!!!</li>
            <li> Hair changed from only mildly wavy to seriously wavy/mildly curly in late 40&#x27;s.  This product has been a life changer!  My hair looks better than ever when I wear it curly.  Amazon&#x27;s price is very good!</li>
            <li> Great products.  I started using the DevaCurl products including the shampoo and conditioner, then had a hair appointment/consultation at a salon with a DevaCurl trained stylist and get much better results now with the instruction I received from the stylist than I had prior.  I&#x27;d strongly recommend seeing a DevaCurl trained stylist if possible in your area as the use of the products is very different than what I had been doing for my curly hair previously.  The DevaCurl book might be enough if you can&#x27;t see a stylist locally, but the way they recommend using the products is completely different than how I&#x27;d ever styled my hair before.  You shampoo (takes a while to get used to no lather), then apply much more conditioner than I ever had before, barely rinse the conditioner out with cold water (to keep the cuticle of the hair closed), and then apply the styling products with your hair still dripping wet before &amp;#34;scrunching&amp;#34; with a microfiber towel or t-shirt fabric.  Also new to this styling regimen, I don&#x27;t ever brush my hair anymore, and it somehow looks nice with smooth curls and isn&#x27;t full of dreadlocks.  Anyway - very happy with these products and other DevaCurl styling products I&#x27;ve tried and won&#x27;t be going back to my old routine anytime soon.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this product and she is writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE these hair cleaning products.  I highly recommend them to every &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately had to return this product. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s me, the chemical used in it or maybe I received a bad batch, but my scalp was SOOOO itchy from this. I washed my hair really well and I felt like I couldn&#x27;t wash out this shampoo or conditioner out. My hair became kind of matted and yet super poofy and I just didn&#x27;t know what to do. I have super curly brown hair with tight curls and a ton of frizz by the scalp so I was SO hoping to alleviate that, but I guess this wouldn&#x27;t be &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; for me. I&#x27;ll keep searching.</li>
            <li> Received it very quickly in perfect condition. Used it today and my hair looks great!Soft full curls!</li>
            <li> Great price--my local salon offers the 16 oz bottles for $21.  I love DevaCurl on my hair--finally tamed my mane.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy, coarse hair. I have tried other products and always come back to deva ( I stray and only gave 4 stars because I am not all that fond of the scent. Wish they made more choices) it is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and love this product. I was thrilled to find it on line and cheap enough to afford and easy to order.  The product is GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great size and great price. I have been using it for 9 months now and I also use it for my 4 year old. We have gone sulfate free. Curls look well hydrated and smells great. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> (hair stylist since 1999) We have A LOT of traffic through our house and nobody likes this product. I have curly hair that needs the extra boost for Beautiful curls.  This product weighs my hair down with the first use. After 2 days my hair is very greasy looking. I have tried it every way, including using it for weeks at a time; trying to get my hair use to it. Sadly with the same result each time. I would guess it is for people whom need to tame there curls. 2 star only because it not full of chemicals. P.S. Also did not clean my hair near the scalp well; not only would it leave it greasier there, It would stink.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for women or men with course hair.  It has really changed the texture of my daughters hair and is now more tamable, less frizzy and more hydrated than normal.</li>
            <li> Handles my curly hair excellently. I love it. I will tell my curly hair friends. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent deal!  I love the shampoo and conditioner, you only need a small amount so this should last months!  You can&#x27;t beat the price difference!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner..Smells good leaves my hair soft and clean. Very moisturizing for my dry curly hair. I went to the salon (DEVSHAN)best hair cut I ever had..I will also always use these products. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> What I hate is that I never received the conditioner</li>
            <li> i love this product. have been using it for a year. it brings out the curl in your hair and takes away the frizzy.</li>
            <li> love the products. delivered on time.</li>
            <li> All the Curly girl stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I am in love with DevaCurl. I originally bought a travel kit so I could try out the shampoo and conditioners. After one day of using them, I knew they were keepers. Definitely recommend. Side note - the shampoo is not soapy but it&#x27;s easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using deva curl for over a year now and i absolutely love their products! the no-poo and one condition smell awesome, made my curls nicer, and made my hair soft. Even when i bleached my hair it only took 2-3 weeks to get healthy again. Also on the up side for me is their products are vegan friendly ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with curly hair, and i&#x27;m sure people with straight hair could even use it!</li>
            <li> This is the best buy ladies! I always felt like I had &#x27;Witchy-Poo&#x27; hair since I was a adolescent. I hid it, straightened it, put it up, and hair-sprayed it. Nothing really worked for me. I was embarrassed with my curls because I didn&#x27;t know how to care for them properly. If you were like me, you probably bought the old run-of-the-mill products you can purchase anywhere. You also probably shampooed your hair every time you showered, with a lathering shampoo. You might have even towel dried your hair. That&#x27;s hoe I was taught to care for my curly hair. My mom had straight hair and couldn&#x27;t help me with my problem. I didn&#x27;t know I was using the wrong products and doing all the wrong things. This line of products have changed my life! I proudly show off my curls now, and I don&#x27;t hide them anymore. I learned so much about how to properly care for my hair and that there are different curl types! You can learn yours, too. :) These products are your starting point. They are creamy, and leave your hair feeling soft, not weighted down. Try these as soon as you can!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes all the difference for curly girls!</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great.  Use it just as directed.  Conditioner is great too.  It detangles really well.</li>
            <li> Everyone always compliments me on my hair...I am certain it is because of this shampoo.  I&#x27;ll never switch again.</li>
            <li> This product itches my scalp.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, product is exactly as described.  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE SPENT YOUR LIFE FIGHTING FRIZZ, AND WISHING YOU HAD STRAIGHT HAIR, THE BATTLE IS OVER!  I am writing this so at least one less curly haired person will no longer suffer!  After blowdrying, using straightening irons, not leaving the house without checking the&lt;br /&gt;relative humidity (as a teen I tied my hoodie tightly under my neck to avoid frizz at the bus top), all culminating in three Brazilian straightening treatments which made me almost bald from breakage, DEVA CURL HAS CHANGED MY LIFE.  No blow dryer (unless it&#x27;s theirs), no brushes, sprays, and countless dollars on products that do not work - I HAVE THE MOST GORGEOUS NO FRIZZ CURLS EVER!  I&#x27;m getting compliments right and left, and best of all, I am finally liberated, because these products truly, really bring out the best in your natural curl.  From the no-poo and conditioner to the gels, creams and sprays, you cannot go wrong.  I recommend watching YouTube videos on how to use these products properly - I promise by round 3 or 4 (I wash my hair every 3 days or so) you will be thrilled! Second and third day hair can be even better than first day hair.  While they aren&#x27;t cheap, I&#x27;d much rather spend the money and feel great than waste money on what doesn&#x27;t work.  Than you DevaCurl!</li>
            <li> The pump for one of the bottles was not attached when I opened the package leaving space for bacteria and small particles to get in. Ew.</li>
            <li> Love these products! Hard to get used to the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; shampoo because i am so used to the lather which this doesnt have but i love it. Also saved my hair colour !</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these products. I had been trying out different sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners since September 2011. I am happy to say these products are now my staple products for cleansing and conditioning my naturally curly hair (curl pattern 3b). Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- they contain healthy ingredients for my naturally curly hair (type 3b),&lt;br /&gt;- they smell very refreshing like rosemary or peppermint,&lt;br /&gt;- the conditioner has enough slip to easily finger-detangle my curly hair,&lt;br /&gt;- the conditioner can be used as a leave-in conditioner,&lt;br /&gt;- the conditioner can be used for co-washing,&lt;br /&gt;- they cleanse and condition my hair very well,&lt;br /&gt;- they are part of the CG (curly girl) method,&lt;br /&gt;- they leave my hair clean and well moisturized, and lastly,&lt;br /&gt;- they do exactly what they&#x27;re intended to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to being natural, you should definitely try these products as they cater to curly and natural hair types. They are worth the money! Of course, you are going to go through your conditioner faster than your cleanser. I would also recommend using a leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*For more information, visit my YouTube channel: Dpayne8 [...]</li>
            <li> Love the product, but it was shipped opened with the pumps already inserted, which caused the product to leak out everywhere during shipment</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff for my curly hair :) And this set is the best deal I&#x27;ve found. These big bottles last me close to 6 months.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the only product that will consistantly get all the tangles out of my child&#x27;s hair and leaves it soft</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this shampoo and the price here is great.</li>
            <li> Two big bottles that arrived in perfect condition in a timely manner.  I never tried it before.  I have only used the No-Poo and Conditioner once as I write this.  The aroma is pleasant but a little weird.  I liked using the No-Poo, it felt creamy and silky, and a bit tingly.  It seemed to clean my hair well, and left it detangled and smooth.  I followed up with the conditioner, and my hair is still air-drying right now.  Wish me luck, I am hoping to tame my frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and so does one of my kids. This product is AMAZING!! The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out your scalp and the conditioner can be used as a leave in product daily after you wash. In my kids hair, it stopped the dreadlocks from forming overnight. I recommend anyone with curly hair try this set to see the difference</li>
            <li> love the product. Amazon makes it easy.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Susan</li>
            <li> An awesome duo that I have been using for many years. They are gentle on hair, smell delightful, makes your hair nice, shiny, full of body, and clean without horrible chemicals.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the saving grace for my natural curly hair.  Plus it smells lovely!</li>
            <li> Love these Deva products</li>
            <li> I like the product very much. The NOPOO smells lovely and works easily and well. The conditioner does the job well. My only complaint is that the 32 ounce containers are too heavy to handle in the shower. One dropped out of my hands and the pump broke off when it hit the shower floor. I had to go to a beauty supply store and spend $6 on smaller plastic bottles. Then I had to use a funnel to transfer the liquids into the smaller bottles. After doing that, I discovered that the Nopoo and conditioner were too thick to come out of the new squeeze bottles I had bought. The thickness of the two products does require a pump which they came in. Now I have to unscrew th new bottles and squeeze the stuff out of the bottles. If I had to do it over again, I would buy these products but in a smaller size that would fit easily on my shower shelf and in my hands..</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and my curls are defined again!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it seems to be the only hair care products that don&#x27;t make my hair straight or wavy. I have naturally curly hair and I was looking for a product that would maintain those curls without me having to use gels or moose. This product did that and I absolutely love it! It also smells very good which is always a plus. The only downside that I find with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair very soft. I have VERY dry hair and these products don&#x27;t seem to maintain the moisture in my hair, although my hair is very curly. I easily fixed this by applying some Moroccan oil after showering, so this really isn&#x27;t that big of a problem. I definitely recommend this product for people who want naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else on my curly hair. I never write a review but I think this product deserves 10 stars!! Love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been buying different haircare combos for a while now. I have super thick curly hair. My hair doesn&#x27;t retain moisture very well and is coarse. This kind of washing process (cleansing/conditioning) was recommended for my hair type - and this product is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As described the cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather - doesn&#x27;t really matter. It leaves my impossibly curly hair in beautiful ringlets - softer - and shinier than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be my regular hair product.</li>
            <li> Still like my other non-name brand products from Walmart (Tresemme). These tend to leave my hair feeling heavy and oily.  Not for me. I have semi naturally curly hair and these products are too heavy and do not allow my hair to breathe.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for a set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since June of 2012 and this was great to have during the hot humid months.  It is pretty expensive, but a decent value, especially if you consider what your stylist would charge for similar products.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than the Wen products. They enhance curl and remove frizz without feeling as coated as Wen products make my hair feel. If I decide to go with straighter hair, I like the results as well. A big bonus I didn&#x27;t expect is they don&#x27;t cause breakouts like Wen can.</li>
            <li> I spent my entire life hating my hair. It was big. frizzy. untameable. I constantly had the &#x27;lampshade effect&#x27; (flat on top, blown out at the bottom, you fellow curly girls will know what I mean). I have long corkscrew curly hair and I was never satisfied with it. It turns out, that was because I didn&#x27;t know anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that changed when I read the Curly Girl book. I started to understand my hair, what makes it different from straight hair and what I&#x27;d been doing wrong all my life that made my hair such an unmanageable, unattractive mess. Once I read the book, and understood my hair (and all the ways that it&#x27;s different from straight hair) I started to love it. So when I found Deva Curl and saw that it&#x27;s made by the same people who wrote the Curly Girl book, I knew I had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to another product. Immediatly, the very first time, I felt a difference in the texture and softness of my hair. I love the citrusy-mint smell. I love the clean tingly feeliing and most of all, I love how shiny, healthy and bouncy my hair is. Read the book, buy this product. You&#x27;ll never go back to hating your hair again.</li>
            <li> i got 2 no cleanser shampoo. Instead of 1 shampoom and 1 conditioner</li>
            <li> Wife uses this stuff. Raves about it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product,  great for beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> LOVE it, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for 4 years and my curly hair is perfect!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, and I will purchase it again. The bottles will be lasting me about 4 months at the rate I see now</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Foul odor and poor cleansing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who has naturally curly hair. Its a must have if you have the kind of curls that fluff up and you want them to stay down rather than &amp;#34;poof out&amp;#34;. Definitely worth the extra $$ to have nice hair.</li>
            <li> The products arrived and I&#x27;ll use both, but the bottle of Deva Curl No Poo is actually a mis-labeled bottle of Deva Curl One Condition, so you&#x27;re actually getting two bottles of One condition. Having used Deva Curl products for years, I know that No Poo has a different smell, color, and consistency than One Condition. The factory where the products were labeled must have produced a substantial amount incorrectly as I&#x27;ve found the same issue at a few beauty supply stores that carry the products as well.</li>
            <li> This was NOT devacurl. The shampoo and conditioner smelled horrible, like rubbing alcohol and orange sherbert combined and was all goopy.  Will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> No complaints, just curly, healthy,  and happy hair!</li>
            <li> OMG! This stuff is the best I have ever used. For years I have fought and battled my very curly fine blonde hair. I have straightened with Keratin, Blown dry, tried to go natural and used every product from Wen to Dr. Miracle. finally my hair looks not so bad! Not dry, not frizzy or crunchy - just soft and curly.  This stuff doe some good detangling as well ( anyone else get those painful knots at base of your skull especially with a scarf or collar???) Between this and Shea Moisture detangler I no longer fell I trying to pull out all my hair. If you want to know if this is worth it? I would say TRY it!</li>
            <li> Love Deva Curl products! Been using their products for about two years, such an amazing improvement in my hair! Won&#x27;t use any other brand! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I am always on the hunt for a product that eliminates my frizz but does not make my hair crunchy and stiff.. well I believe I have found it!!! My hair stays soft, feels clean, my curls are controlled but not stiff! I love it! I would definitely recommend this to anyone with curls. My hair actually curls up more but they are shiny and soft. It is a must try! and  you must buy the towel.. it does eliminate frizz unlike a regular towel! I am extremely happy with this product!</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, these products are for you.  I have had trouble with my curls for many years.  Lorraine Massey&#x27;s products work awesome for your hair and the smell is amazing.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I know that there are a lot of bad reviews, but i love this product. First this product it&#x27;s amazing my hair loves it!! I have highlights and my hair would not hold the curl and it was always frizzy. This product gave life back to my hair!! And the smell is lovely, yes at the beginning it might be a little overwhelming but you get used to it quickly. To me it smells like clean laundry and  orange blossoms. I bought it from beauty in style and the product that i received was totally legit! Now you have to remember that its a no poo so it will not lather, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of product otherwise you can start getting oily hair and buildup. I also bought the low poo from deva curl and i plan to use it once a week to eliminate the buildup. And you can always get the trial packet to see if you like it</li>
            <li> My favorite hair products!</li>
            <li> Love it! Thank you Amazon for having this available for half the price as you would get them in the salon! Can&#x27;t beat this price and to get them prime shipping is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product has saved my curls!!!! You need to use it properly though or else you may end up using too much product. I have very long and very curly hair and most products that lather just dry my hair out and leave it frizzy,. This stuff is great. You only need a little bit of the shampoo at the roots to take care of any build up and its so rich that I use very little conditioner --just on the ends. You must rinse the product our thoroughly or you risk too much build up. If used right this product will actually heal your hair!!! I swear my hair has never been so soft and I have tried everything!!!!!  Also---I wash my hair daily due to sweating at the gym and this is gentle but very effective for keeping my hair clean and soft. I will never use any thing else to wash with, totally worth the cost!!!</li>
            <li> Only shampoo/conditioner that actually cleans and manages my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it every day</li>
            <li> Conditioner bottle pump was broken.&lt;br /&gt;The product should get 5 stars because I absolutely love it. But the shipping was awful. It was in a plastic bag with tape, no protection whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I began useing this product under the recommendation of my stylist. My first purchase was at her salon, but i began doubting I could afford such prices that were displayed at the establishment. So i searched Amazon, and found this deal.&lt;br /&gt;At my salon, one No-Poo and one One-Condition costs $41, both bottles are 12 oz. Here, same products in 32 oz bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you right now, i&#x27;d rather pay $16 more than $66! Plus, i finally have a product that won&#x27;t make a mess of my curly hair!</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d gotten used to having more bad hair days than good hair days. I&#x27;ve been using the BedHead line of shampoos/conditioners/styling products for curly hair for years. They did work OK. I mean, I definitely did have good hair days - I have photos with proof. A few, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But recently I was just about out of both my shampoo and conditioner at the same time, and considered maybe trying another solution. It&#x27;s so hard to change, especially when the products put such a dent in your wallet, right? After an evening of research, where among other things I found out there are labelled types of curly hair -- I&#x27;m a 2A-2B! -- I decided to give the DevaCurl products a shot. They have literally changed my outlook on my hair overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week for me to get used to using the No-Poo. Because it&#x27;s so different. I felt like I was putting a thick moisturizing lotion on my hair. Combined with the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather, AT ALL, I felt like there was no way it was doing any good. And it smelled strange. Not bad strange, though. But the No-Poo DID do good. As did the One Condition. And they still are. Now I shower, put in a little extra One Condition before getting out, then put in a touch of the DevaCurl Style Gel after GENTLY drying my hair with a towel. I look like a semi-drowned rat for awhile, but when my hair dries, it looks like those far-and-few-between good hair days I used to have. Oh, and the three products combined (No-Poo + One Condition + Style Gel) smell AH-MAZING. It&#x27;s a cacophony of fancy, fantastical scents. On days I don&#x27;t wash my hair, I usually just mist my curls with a little water, and occasionally add a little more Style Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously thought my hair looked OK before -- the flyaway/frizzy hair syndrome I&#x27;ve always had was so much a part of me I thought little of it. Now my hair looks good every day, with so little effort. It&#x27;s one less thing to worry about.  As you&#x27;ll see from other reviews here (and for other curly hair products) it&#x27;s quite apparent no product works the same on everyone. But if you&#x27;re looking for a possible solution to your curly locks, this might be your winner. It is for me.or other curly hair products) it&#x27;s quite apparent no product works the same on everyone. But if you&#x27;re looking for a possible solution to your curly locks, this might be your winner. It is for me.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair...this stuff works fantastic.  I was turned onto it by my cousin who is a hair stylist - she swore by it...she was right.  So much better for your hair, my hair is more manageable and I was told several times since using it by my cousin that my hair looks healthier.  Worth the $ in my opinion...lasts a long time too, you don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have semi curly to wavy hair. Definitely takes some work and product to make it look good. I found that this shampoo/conditioner enhances my curls and leaves my hair nice and soft. Works great when I straighten my hair too. You get used to the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and my hair still feels just as clean.</li>
            <li> my twins have curly hair and this works great. Keeps the curls in and tangles out!&lt;br /&gt;The large size works great for 2!</li>
            <li> I love the DevaCurl No Poo and One Condition for my hair! I struggled for years jumping from one shampoo brand to another until I was introduced to these products and now I&#x27;m absolutely addicted to them because they leave my curls looking well hydrated and shaped! Shampoo completely drys my curls and makes them look dead!</li>
            <li> Love these products! They bring out the best in my curls. At first I had to adjust the amount of the products I used to get the best results but my Deva stylist is a great resource for that too. They make my hair shiny and bouncy</li>
            <li> As a curly girl with a VERY thick head of curly hair I only get cuts from the DevaChan salon in NYC and only use Deva products to tame my mane. These are the absolute best.</li>
            <li> Authentic items. For those who use DevaCurl products you&#x27;re obviously familiar with the distinct smells of each product. Gr8T Deal. Lightning shipping. A++</li>
            <li> It took me a bit to get use to not having any foam when washing my hair, but it leaves my hair soft and very curly and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> My wife has used these items for several years and loves them.</li>
            <li> Good product at an amazing price. Almost half the price of what salons charge</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, curly hair and this is the best product I have found! It moisturizes my hair and makes it very manageable. The conditioner is also a great detangler. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great size for a great price. Delivered on time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> **UPDATE** I really wanted to love this product because I loved the way my hair felt after washing it and I LOVED the smell of all the products BUT!...I lost SO MUCH HAIR using this product.  If you read my review below where I state the loss of my hair, well it continued.  I stopped using the product made my own shampoo using Coconut Milk Cream and a few other oils and tiny bit of baking soda and used Apple Cider Vinegar as my conditioner and a few months later, my hair is slowly growing back and getting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed my girlfriend at work my hair one morning after washing it and she couldn&#x27;t believe how much hair I&#x27;d lost, she apologized over and over because she introduce it to me but I explained it was not her fault, there may be something in there that just does not agree with my system and makes my hair fall out by the clumps.  Anyway, by accident I came across their salon in my city and met a stylist that asked me to have them look at my hair and allow them to do my hair.  I appreciate the offer but, there is no way, I&#x27;m letting this product touch my hair that is slowly growing back.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my friend and it may not affect yours either but if you start to see a lot of your hair fall-out, stop using it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased the travel set and loved the smell and feel of my hair after shampooing and conditioning it.  Also, because you only wash your hair once or twice a week with this product, the travel set lasted me nearly a month and gave me an opportunity to try the No-Poo, Conditioner, Light Defining Gel and Set it Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Paraben, Silicone and Sulfate Free&lt;br /&gt;-Love the smell of the product line, fresh hair smell&lt;br /&gt;-Compliments on my hair&lt;br /&gt;-Specifically designed for curly to wavy hair (mine has both)&lt;br /&gt;- The way my hair feels after shampooing, not dry or stripped&lt;br /&gt;-The size of the 2 Liter Duo and that Pump they come with&lt;br /&gt;-The fact that my hair and scalp still smell good between washes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Glycerin, it doesn&#x27;t state that it is plant-based so I have to assume it is animal Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;-The Cost, pretty expensive&lt;br /&gt;-The amount of hair I lose when I wash it (wash it once to twice a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually had someone say that they could smell my hair when I walked into their office and it smelled really good (same person that turned me on to this product, they have curly hair too). Thanks D! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m still trying to get used to not washing my hair every other day; 5 days is the longest I&#x27;ve gone and could not believe my hair and scalp still smelled nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am now back to washing it every 3-4 days because any longer, the amount of hair I see loosing in the shower terrifies me but I believe it&#x27;s because I am not combing it the days I don&#x27;t wash it.  I just spray a little more water and the finishing setter that smells good and scrunch it more to set my curls again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the gel again and waiting for it to arrive.  I will continue using this until I come close to running out before I make my final decision about making this a permanent part of my routine. :)at it is plant-based so I have to assume it is animal Glycerin -The Cost, pretty expensive -The amount of hair I lose when I wash it (wash it once to twice a week)  I&#x27;ve actually had someone say that they could smell my hair when I walked into their office and it smelled really good (same person that turned me on to this product, they have curly hair too).

            <li> Great product, fast delievery</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather doesn&#x27;t bother me because my hair feels just as clean after washing it out. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair either. As for the smell of the shampoo.. not great but not terrible either. Kind of reminded me of the smell that hits you when you walk into a salon (slightly). The conditioner does have a nice scent. I have wavy hair and it does seem to help maintain the waves longer. With other shampoos my hair would lose it&#x27;s wave by the end of the day. I do still put a smoothing balm in my hair because it doesn&#x27;t take the frizz completely away. A reviewer said to use silicon free products. So, in conclusion- my hair feels healthier (and I&#x27;ve colored it twice this year), my waves are more defined and stay longer but I had to get used to the shampoo smell and there&#x27;s some frizz (only reasons it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars) I don&#x27;t see myself switching shampoos any time soon!&lt;br /&gt;** update: I&#x27;m switching to 5 stars because I am (strangely) no longer bothered by the smell of shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t bother me and I actually like it now. I&#x27;ve been using since November and I still love it. I now also use it in combination with deva curl light defining gel and love the combined effect.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> I have thick and waivy hair and this product works the best. I tried many other ones, both cheaper and the more expensive salon brands for curly hair and have always come back to Deva Curl and it keeps curls but gets rid of frizz. My hair is more managable when using DevaCurl.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I strongly recomend researching this product on Amazon for the best deal before buying it in the store. I save about 20-30% buying this product on Amazon versus in local store.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!! I have been using WEN and it is great stuff too. I wanted to try this brand because it is a bit cheaper and has great reviews.  I won&#x27;t be going back to WEN!! My hair is thin and the curls aren&#x27;t really tight, just soft. This stuff made my curls curlier, spiral and calm!! I don&#x27;t love the smell but I have had a few people comment on how good my hair smells. To me it smells a bit like chemicals, but not bad kinda like when you get a perm? This is the best my curls have been and i love it. I also use Deva Care Arc Angel Firm Gel and it is great together!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, course, long, wavy hair.  I have Carrie Bradshaw hair but frizzier, thicker, and... you get the idea.  I use the No Poo after my long run of the week (I run over 20 miles per week so I get some serious sweat in my hair) and it cleanses and is a pleasing smell.  It does not tangle during shampooing and only around a tablespoon to two tablespoons is needed to clean my hair on my one wash day of the week.  It rinses cleanly and gives hair that slippery feeling.  The conditioner feels a bit watery - compared to deep conditioners I have used in the past.  But with a wide tooth comb, I do not rip or break my hair and it easily slips through in the shower.  I wet my hair on non-wash days and only condition and my hair is clean, smells fresh, and healthy.  After trying every curly hair on the market, this is such a simple solution.  I do use the gel and nothing else with perfect results every time.  I could get away with a 12 oz bottle of no poo, and 32 oz of conditioner and gel since i use the no poo the least.  For the price, you cannot find a better system for wavy hair.</li>
            <li> i HAVE TRIED QUITE A FEW PRODUCTS FOR MY CURLY FRIZZY HAIR. THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST. I WATCHED THE DEVA CURL VIDEOS AND HAVE BEEN DRYING MY HAIR NATURALLY AND IT IS SHINY AND BOUNCY. LOVE IT. SMELLS GOOD TOO.</li>
            <li> love love love....couldn&#x27;t imagine a day without my curls</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair. DevaCurl is all I&#x27;ve been using for the last 3 months and my hair stays curly, soft and less frizzy than ever.</li>
            <li> So far not too bad, has a different texture to it than normal shampoo and conditioner and helps with frizz</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly and dry hair and loved this shampoo and the conditioner.  My old hair is a little less curly and a lot drier.  I tried this for a week and was amazed at the difference.  Finally, I found treatments that work!</li>
            <li> If you are a curly girl, try this product..it&#x27;s different and really nice...I only like the no-poo and conditioner, not the sprays, etc.</li>
            <li> Love this product as usual, it&#x27;s a great product for curls (especially if you suffer from dry hair like me). Also the shipping was prompt and in good condition, thanks!</li>
            <li> I do really like tris stuff ;) been using it hor almost a year now and I love it so much</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend of mine who has beautiful curly hair. HE has never used anything but the 2 in1 men hair products and after using this for a week he saw a huge difference. He loves how &amp;#34;cool, shiny and bouncy&amp;#34; his curls have gotten. Also got him the DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel to go with it. That definitely helps keep the curls all day.</li>
            <li> this stuff works really well, love the smell of the One conditioner, we actually pit it in a spray bottle mixed with water as a spray leave in, works great when you just want to revive your curls with out washing your hair..</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner and moisturizing conditioner for my fine, curly hair! It doesn&#x27;t build up, it smells refreshing without being over-perfumed and it leaves my hair glossy and my curls soft!</li>
            <li> This product has definitely de-poofed my hair, maybe too much.</li>
            <li> They arrived fast and were a great price.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for curly or wavy hair!!!!!! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered this product...great for curly &amp; frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to get used to the &#x27;no lather&#x27; shampoo, but it makes my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> Worst smelling shampoo and conditioner.  No poo smells like poo. It works but I can not get past the smell. Same with the conditioner. Set it free works great and smells great. I wish I had not bought both the travel kit and the home kit. I&#x27;m afraid to flush $100 down the toilet</li>
            <li> DevaCurl products are the best!  I have NEVER been able to find any other product like it and I have tried everything!  My hair is no longer frizzy and I have nice big bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair is soft, curly, never frizzy with these products. I do notice some dander-looking stuff by my scalp (may be the moisture lock spray in the line), and I do find that it looks dirty a bit faster than other shampoos. I normally wash twice a week, with dry shampoo on the last day. For those noticing a lot of build-up, there&#x27;s a reason that the whole line doesn&#x27;t contain silicones--don&#x27;t use sulfate-free shampoo like this and think it&#x27;ll remove products with a lot of silicone.</li>
            <li> Great products. My hair loves them</li>
            <li> Pumps where broken. Product is great but total pain to get to it. Huge bottles, hands wet no pumps not easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these products.  Absolutely changed my hair.  I went from blowing out my hair every day to allowing my natural curl and Deva product enhanced curls to rain free.  It has saved so much time. On the few occasions I founds myself in a hotel and had to use the local products, my hair went back to crazy.  The only thing is I use so much of the conditioner, I always run out of it first.  My hair just soaks it up. I love how it feels when I rinse. I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair naturally, which I&#x27;ve spent most of my life straightening because I hate it.  I&#x27;ve tried to go no-poo before and embrace the curls.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of no-poo, brands of no sulfates but that still lathered.  I&#x27;ve tried very hard to embrace my curls with no luck.  I&#x27;ve resisted buying Deva Curl because it&#x27;s just so darn expensive.  I finally broke down and ordered it and committed to really giving it the good old college try.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for a few weeks and I think I&#x27;ve finally found what I need to like my curls.  The frizziness is gone.  I also have kind of half curly, half wavy hair that always just looks like I slept on it.  These products have improved the condition of my hair to such an extent that it&#x27;s curling more, and actually looks like something someone might do to their hair on purpose.  Letting my curls be is *so much less work* than blowing it out and straightening, and I&#x27;m thrilled to finally have found something that will work for me.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE the Deva Curl No Poo shampoo and One Condition condition!  They&#x27;ve made such a difference in bringing my curls to life and helping tame the frizzy component of being a Curly Girl.  I also like that Amazon sells these in the 32 oz size so they last a long time and tend to save a little bit of money on a not-so-inexpensive product line.  I also get the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel to finish off my style after using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re leery of spending the money on a product you&#x27;ve never tried, do what I did and start with the travel pack - but I promise you&#x27;ll be hooked after the first wash.  Oh, and get the Curly Girl book while you&#x27;re at it to learn how to take care of your curls - especially using these products.  In the book they teach you things like how you should dry your hair with an old t-shirt rather than a terry cloth towel so the towel doesn&#x27;t absorb too much moisture from your hair.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is an advocate for WEN but wanted to work another product into her hair care routine. She is growing out her natural color and is trying to get her hair as healthy as possible. This product came recommended by a friend and my girlfriend loves it. It gives her hair a noticeable shimmer and I happen to like the scent so win/win. You also get a very large quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a little pricey by my standards but I am assured that this is a great value for the price. The girlfriend loves it and assures me she will buy it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Great product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I try to aoid lathering products because I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out or break out. Same goes for my hair and scalp. My hair always feels very clean and dries much smoother with these products that even sulphate free lathering formulas. It&#x27;s been about a year and a half and I am still hooked. I like the Deva Care just as much as Deva Curl- maybe more, as it seems more hydrating.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the shampoo in my hair and way it cleans.  The conditioner is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. I have been buying it thru Amazon for a few years now and I save about $20.00 getting it thru Amazon vs. a beauty retailer. Seems to be of the same quality as the retailer at a better price. I will keep buying it thru DevaCare. Great price and product.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works with my curly hair.  Keeps it from flying away and bushing out.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Everything came on time but the bottle was open &amp; some spilled out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been struggling for years to find a product kind to my \\&quot;s&#x27;wavy\\&quot; hair, which is loosely curly, wavy, and straight at the same time. Very sensitive to climate changes and product, I wanted something to enhance the natural textures of my hair. These products are it. I&#x27;ve gotten huge compliments on my hair since I started using deva curl. I&#x27;ll never use anything else again.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for this product to arrive.  It&#x27;s been almost two weeks and it&#x27;s still not here.  I&#x27;ve heard fabulous things about this product, and would love to say that it&#x27;s fantastic, but it&#x27;s been 13 days and I still do not have it.  While the product may be great, I suggest you find it locally if you want to try it right away.</li>
            <li> This might be the best hair-care product I&#x27;ve ever bought just because of price alone. Yeah, it&#x27;s around 60 bucks but I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 6 months and the bottle is only half empty. I can get a full year out of these. You could be paying approximately 5 bucks a month for shampoo and conditioner that works so much better than the other brands. You pay probably $10 a month for the regular stuff. This will save you so much money if you use these bottles sparingly (I wash my hair every other day).&lt;br /&gt;As far as how well these products work, I am always pleased. My scalp tends to get dry and flakey but my stylist told me to always rinse the conditioner off of my scalp and add some conditioner to the tips of my hair to keep the moisture where it&#x27;s needed. I feel like how I feel when I come out of the salon every time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is a must buy.</li>
            <li> I adore this shampoo and conditioner by devacurl. I have naturally curly hair, and this stuff is perfect. It makes my curls pop without styling, smooths my frizz, and keeps my hair crazy soft.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have already referred three of my friends. I plan on buying more. Great product must have!</li>
            <li> I now use the Deva shampoo, conditioner, light gel and set-it-free spray. My hair is fine and curly and these products work really well with no wet look or overly crunchy. The gel does make my hair a bit tangled underneath, but that is also because my hair is fine and light weight. My only complaint is that I wish the product labels were different colors. I wear glasses, so in the shower, the shampoo and conditioner bottle look exactly the same. All of the products have the same color green labels.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fabulous</li>
            <li> Diva Curl take note!!!!! I purchased at beauty supply store. I actually have fine, blonde and highlighted hair. My hair is considered to be straight with slight wave. But I have found that I can dry my hair with a Terri cloth towel while plopping and scrunching to create a nice full head of beachy waves, thus avoiding styling with curling iron. Using the Diva Curl no poo, condition one and gel I am able to get real curl that last day after day. This really thrills me. However sadly, the strong smell of these products Is a deal breaker for me. I mean the smell is really strong. At first I didn&#x27;t mind and figured the smell would go away after wearing it for a few days, but I&#x27;m now on day three and the smell is just as strong. Even my husband complained. I smell this all day long and it is on my pillow and I smell it all night. Furthermore, I may even be a bit allergic to the odor as it permeates my nose and I have begun sneezing a lot!  It is just too much! Another issue is that the ingredient label on my bottles say that these products contain soy protein. Soy is a known hormone blocker. For those of us on hormone therapy, we have to be careful about soy. I figured I would just see if it was a problem and it appears to be... Sad. So I can&#x27;t use this product until Diva Curl comes out with an unscented, soy free version. Diva Curl take note!!!  I would be so greatful and a thrilled user if you took the scent out and the soy out. We beachy girls tend like natural non smelly stuff. But the way this product makes my hair shine and curl and bounce is amazing and I&#x27;m so sad to have to give it up. Very sad.</li>
            <li> The products came as described and arrived quickly. I bought these to refill the smaller bottles I purchased when I first began using these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been use the DevaCurl system for over a year now and love the way my hair looks and feels. My hair is healthier, softer, and has great shine. I use these as part of the DevaCurl 3 step system.&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. Rinse with the NoPoo Cleanser. Step 2. Add conditioner, enough that hair feels very soft. Comb through with fingers and DO NOT wash away all of the conditioner. I usually leave about 50% of it. Step 3. While in shower and hair is soaking wet add desired amount of gel to palm. Run through hair with your fingers and scrunch up the hair to remove excess water.  Let hair air dry or use with diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wash with the cleanser every 3 days. On the other days I get my hair wet and add a small amount of conditioner. My hair dresser also suggested that I fill a spray bottle with water and the conditioner and use that on days when I don&#x27;t want to get my hair soaking wet.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair...and DevaCurl makes my hair look great..my curls bounce...I use Dive No poo(shampoo)...and Devacurl Conditioner.. Yes its costly but worth every penny</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have a lot of thin super curly hair and this is the only hair shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair super soft and healthy. I have tried sooooo many products with disappointments and almost gave up and told myself that that was the best my hair can get. Now my hair looks like the girls in the commercials, but with DevaCurl you ACTUALLY get your hair to look that good!</li>
            <li> My entire family loves this product. And the price is far better than purchasing it in a salon. In a salon each bottle is $40, we bought these two for $58 and didn&#x27;t have to pay sales tax or shipping since we have Prime. That&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> Love all diva curl products. Like this seller as these came with the pumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a curly hair girl and ever since I stumbled upon Deva salon and products, my hair has looked fabulous and it&#x27;s been easy to manage. I won&#x27;t put anything else in my hair but Deva. I love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, very hydrating, my hair looks healthy, shiny, and it&#x27;s very strong, never frizzy (I use Deva Angell hair gel in addition to the shampoo/conditioner.) I prefer the Angel line because I prefer the floral scent (the Arc Angel products have a citrus scent which doesn&#x27;t work for me). Thank you Deva !!</li>
            <li> I started using Deva products about 2 years ago.  I have very curly hair that easily becomes a frizzy rats nest.  I haven&#x27;t used a brush in almost 2 years.  And everyone compliments me on my hair.  Shiny, healthy and completely under control.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s a bit pricey but helps keep the friz from happening. My hair has grown an inch since I started using it. As well as it looks and feels so much healthier. If you have curly hair this is the stuff to buy. This and an old t-shirt instead of a towel and your hair will be happy.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and have tried a lot of different products. Nothing can bit Deva Curls so far. My curls looks so naturally perfect now.</li>
            <li> need to get the whole line ladies!! i have been using it for about a year now (Shampoo, conditioner, ultra gel, curl cream, set it free,  foam, Mister right, and soommmmee times  the set above! It is A MUST TO DO EXACTLY HOW INSTRUCTED! Lucky me my bestie is a certified Devacurl Stylist, and so she taught me how to do it, and literally u cant just get the lets say, Set it free, you have to at least get the Conditioner, gel/mirror curls/curl cream then LET IT DRY, AND DO NOT TOUCH IT, THEN USE THE STYLING PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> Would buy this again and again. Perfect on curly hair. Check YouTube for instructions on how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> Love there product line !!</li>
            <li> Girls is your hair is curly, these are the products to own. Just make sure you drip dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is a mixture of all curls. I&#x27;ve struggled to find a good moisturizing shampoo/conditioner. This has worked really well. Only problem I have is that I never know how clean my hair is when I use the no poo, since I&#x27;m used to the foam of regular shampoos. My hair is really shiny now and soft. This product has helped a ton with elasticity too!</li>
            <li> Live this stuff but I do not care for the other products in their line. I find the other products heavy and leave considerable residue on your hair</li>
            <li> Same stuff you get in your salon for a much more competitive price.  What more could I ask for?  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This just might be the best shampoo and conditioner you&#x27;ll ever use! The last six inches of my hair resembled Shredded Wheat until using this product. The shampoo cleans well while keeping my hair soft. The conditioner gives the right amount of moisture without weighing my hair down or making it feel waxy. I have wurly (wavy/curly) hair that&#x27;s colored and tends to be very dry, especially at the ends. This duo lends moisture while helping my color last much longer than usual. I noticed the difference after the very first use and the results are getting better with each wash. If your hair is extra-dry, I recommend washing, conditioning as usual, and then adding a small (dime-sized) amount to the ends of your towel-dried hair. Your hair will be soft and shiny beyond belief. Oh, and these bottles have pumps on them too, which is convenient. Get this stuff! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This product arrived super quick however it is not giving the same effect as the same product I bought in the salon! Smells different too! Unsure here but this product is not the finest quality!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, curly hair. I&#x27;ve tried everything! I started using this product last week and I love it!! I used to have to use at least three products ie leave in, mousse, serum, etc just to get a semi decent look with frizz control. No all I use is the No Poo cleanser, conditioner and gel. My curls are soft and frizz free. I also bought their towel and clips. Wonderful product, will definitely be buying again! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Love DevaCurl stuff...but please note that this is conditioning cleanser, not just cleanser shampoo.  It actually makes my curly hair (which is fine to begin with) a little too soft.  :)</li>
            <li> Smells great, my hair feels much healthier, I&#x27;m no longer experiencing hair loss and my hair looks thicker.  More effort needed, however, to improve packaging so the bottles arrive without damaged caps.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing.. seller not so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months. It has made my hair less frizzy and it is softer. However I have found that it has changed somewhat after prolonged use. My hairdresser has suggested going back to my old shampoo and conditioner for a while and then back to this to see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> My curly hair has been awakened with these products. I will be purchasing the gel, as soon as I run out of my cheap CVS stuff. The smell reminds me of after going to the salon, which I love also. Will not buy anything else for my curly hair from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for several months now, exactly as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is course and rather thick, with tighter curls towards the bottom of my head, and looser curls around the crown.  I also have lots of silver (I so have my hair colored), and that of course effects the texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months of use, I cannot say that I am impressed at all.  My hair does not feel softer and my hair doesn&#x27;t look any better.  Additionally, my scalp tends to get this build up of oil/residue that is yellowish, almost like cradle cap.  I&#x27;ve had to start using a sulfur free shampoo on it once every few weeks to get it thoroughly clean and to help with the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#x27;s the smell.  It really isn&#x27;t pleasant.  That of course can be remedied with some nice smelling hair styling products, but still, at this price, one would expect a product that doesn&#x27;t smell like it came straight from a chemistry lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t waste my money on this again.  I&#x27;m now going to try Milk for Hair, as I&#x27;ve heard many good things about it.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for the product - 0 Stars for the Seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product in general is a great product! I highly recommend it. However, the items purchased from this seller are questionable. The shampoo was fine. The conditioner appeared to be an opened item and was extremely watered down. It was so runny, I could hardly hold it in my hands. I&#x27;ve purchased this product from a salon and beauty supply store so I know what it should be like - not runny, but thick. Upon opening and dispensing for the first time, the product was already loaded and ready to go, unlike the newly packaged shampoo which took about 5 pumps before anything came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d look elsewhere to buy this item - just to be sure I get what I actually paid for.</li>
            <li> This product is a must in a daily regimen for curly hair.  It helps maintaining curls and is good for your hair.  I&#x27;m glad it comes in a large quantity.  DevaCurl products are of good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Deva Curl for almost 5 years now since finding a hair dresser that has the Deva-training and does Deva Curl cuts.  It&#x27;s an excellent product and really helps curly girls embrace and enjoy their fun hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping from this vendor was quick and received the packaged just as I was forcing the last dregs out of my empty Deva One Condition bottle.</li>
            <li> This product was given to me as a gift from a coworker. He said it did wonders for his daughter&#x27;s curly  hair, Let me tell you that this product took my 20 year dandruff away! It is amazing! I won&#x27;t use any other shampoo. I am on my third 32 oz bottles of both shampoo and conditioner. You should get the book too. Or watch the care  videos on you tube. A must have.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged, on time and exactly as described.  Thank You</li>
            <li> love this product and price was great, arrived on time as expected. Thank you seller DevaConcepts</li>
            <li> Great value thru amazon. Bye bye Ulta</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these products!! Perfect for thick, curly and unruly hair A+++</li>
            <li> I LOVE the DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner, but was highly disappointed when both the bottles arrived having spilled in the packaging. It was a huge mess, and I lost a good deal of the product itself. Previously, I have bought the 12oz bottles from my hair salon. Ordering the bigger bottles online is more cost-effective, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth the clean-up or spilled hair products.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. It makes my curls happy.</li>
            <li> Love the chemical free shampoo set.  Works great for natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> Since i&#x27;ve discovered Deva Curl&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner, I don&#x27;t know how I survived without them all these years!! I love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner ..... It has changed my life forever!!! It cuts down on the care time, and I&#x27;m all for that!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Deva Curl product, but when these were delivered the pump to one of them was broken and the other had leaked a lot of shampoo. This stuff is too expensive to have it leaking!</li>
            <li> works good, daughter said it works really well</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course curly hair .. and I am trying to learn to enjoy it .. and not straighten it all the time .. Some one told me about these Deva Curl Products and I am amazed at how well they work .. My hair is soft, full of moisture and the curls are so much prettier and more manageable .. I am very happy to have found both of these.. though I hear some people just use the conditioner very successfully .. Note: You do have to get used to shampooing your hair without any suds .. but now I love moving the cream through my hair .. and it cured my dry scalp as well . Yeah. Great product ..</li>
            <li> This is not the real product. My daughter turned me on to DevaCurl by gifting me a set she bought from her hairdresser. This product doesn&#x27;t smell or work the same. Will only purchase from salon from now on.</li>
            <li> Love devacurl... smell is kinda weird at first but I grew to enjoy it and the way it gets my hair nice nice nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely magic! I have really curly and frizzy hair that gets brittle if I use anything too harsh. Deva Curl is the only shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve found that makes my hair feel soft and actually reduces the frizz. And it also smells good :)</li>
            <li> I have a mixture of curly and wavy hair (3a and 2c for the nerds who know). I&#x27;ve been using DevaCurl NoPoo and One Condition for about three months, now, and it has increased the definition, spring and shine of my curls, converting a lot of what used to just be waves to curls. Drying method is super important though -- make sure you hang upside down and scrunch a lot of the water out, then dry with an old t-shirt to maximize your results. I finish with a mixture of B&amp;B Curl Conscious Curl Calming Creme and a little bit of DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel.</li>
            <li> There is nothing like DEVA products.  I always thought the shampoos were all alike.  DEVA has changed my mind.  This stuff is great!!! My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz any more and has lots of body.</li>
            <li> Has changed the way I handle my hair.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with these products and the results I get.  My hair is finally maanageable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I asked my hairstylist sister-in-law what products to use on curly hair after being severely disappointed by another brand. She sent me the trial pack and I was so happy, I bought the full-size versions of the No-Poo Cleanser and the One Conditioner right away. The other products in the trial package are great too, but they last much longer. I am mixed-race and have curly hair (type 3B). This stuff works WONDERFULLY on my hair. I do not use any extra shampoo outside of the No-Poo cleaner. It doesn&#x27;t lather, but it smells really good, it conditions, and I can see that it&#x27;s cleansing after I rinse. The cleanser and the conditioner both offer good slip for combing your hair out. I suggest using your fingers or a wide-tooth comb while conditioner is on your hair if you have curly hair. Do not comb when it&#x27;s dry! I apply the conditioner, and sometimes I rinse a little bit and sometimes I just leave it all in. My hair never feels heavy. It feels very light -- like there&#x27;s nothing in there at all -- and my curls form awesomely! I&#x27;ve constantly had people at work asking me what did I do to my hair or what products I put in my hair because there is a big change in how healthy and nice it looks. I recommend letting your hair air dry and not messing with it. DevaCurl also has a non-sticky curl defining gel and a humidity spray that I use as well. If you have curly hair -- try this! I&#x27;ve tried other products and have been suuuuper disappointed. DevaCurl has been such a breath of fresh air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, they have a very strong, fruity smell. Some people may not be into that. I like it!</li>
            <li> It smells great, makes my scalp feel wonderful, sorta gets rid of my dandruff with the mint in it and all. but all in all it didn&#x27;t really do what I had expected it to do to my hair. but that could be on account of my hair being totally impenetrable by absolutely any shampoo. so I gave it three because it still does pretty good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Great product, with a fantastic scent that really accentuates your curls without the excessive drying out feeling that we get from other products.</li>
            <li> Great product as always!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my hair at at all and smells like perm!!</li>
            <li> I love Deva Curl shampoo and conditioner.  I have tried several different products over the years for my naturally curly hair and this is by far the best.  I have been using this product for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is amazing! I even like the way it smells. It took some time to get used to the no foaming thing but all in all i really like this project and will be purchasing it again. I even use it on my 2 1/2 year old who has curly hair just like me. This conditioner makes it possible to comb her hair without us fighting.</li>
            <li> Amazing products! I love Deva Curl and the way it smells. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now and it works amazing on my thin curly hair. The conditioner is thick which is very helpful, and the shampoo is too. Delivery was perfect! Ordered it this morning and got it this afternoon, Amazon&#x27;s same-day shipping is a god send. And the price for this product is unbeatable! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The Deva products never dis appoint!!! My only issue is the shampoo pump head was cracked and I&#x27;ve had to rig a system up to use it.</li>
            <li> this is a great deal for $50 with free ship! I pay about $22 for a 12 oz bottle at the salon. These are $25 each with 20 extra ounces to boot.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like about this deal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Deva curl for a couple of years now and am very satisfied with the extra curl it gives me.</li>
            <li> Deva curl products have changed my life. Well, maybe not my Life, but my hair looks great all the time now. Thank you do much Divs Curl!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. Product was not authentic as it is advertised. If it it truly is from DevaCurl, then I think it is probably the botched runs of the product. This stuff stinks very badly. It does not have the same color, same fragrance, or same consistency of the DevaCurl you get at the salon. I was hero for a week or two when I got it for my wife for Christmas. Now I have to go pay full price at a salon because my wife won&#x27;t use it in her hair (which I am glad because I would have to live in the guest house in the back because I an;t take the smell). We tried to use it on the kids so it wasn&#x27;t completely wasted, but we promptly sent them outside to play in the mud so they could try and get the stink out of their hair. It started to dissipate after 3 or 4 days and washing with 2 other shampoos. I would recommend you pay the money an go to a salon or also invest in nose plugs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first super curly, pixie cut--sort of like Halle Berry or Toni Braxton  &#x3D;) since Dec.2014.  This product is easy to use, wonderful scent, best deal is on Amazon.  I payed more at the salon for the 8oz. bottles just to try it out; haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.  The hair gel is magical too!  Amazon had the best price for the32oz hair gel also.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I order this set, and I am really happy with it. I have really dry hair and wavy, and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it  on my hair to work. It definitely is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I used the Deva Curl Shampoo and Conditioner in conjunction with the Deva Curl light defining gel and I cannot believe my hair. I have been looking for a product that actually delivers results for curly hair and this is it! The first thing I noticed when I first used the shampoo and conditioner was that my hair felt much lighter. I think the old stuff I had been using (Nioxin, Redkin etc..) must have been weighing it down. The products are not overpowering, they smell fresh and light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to the Deva Curl website [...] to learn how to use the product correctly. I bought the book as well. I followed the directions to a T and everyone who knows me wants to know what I did to my hair. I am telling you this stuff is incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, get a Deva Curl haircut. Find a salon near you that specialize in the \\&quot;Deva Cut\\&quot;. It&#x27;s really easy. Just go on the Deva Curl website [...] look up a salon near you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair cut that way (added in the Deva Curl Set it Free moisture locking spray because I live in a high humidity climate) and it looks beautiful for the first time in my life! I feel so beautiful and I look like the girls with curly hair in magazines. No kidding. Every curl is perfect, not one hint of frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner combo! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now and I would never think of trying a different brand! My only complaint is for the seller- my NoPoo wasn&#x27;t full</li>
            <li> Received product and was sealed up tighter than fort knox. Very satisfied, I will edit this review after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Excellent condition for curly hair</li>
            <li> The product smelled nice and was smoothing during use in the shower, but after more than two weeks of use, my hair was becoming more and more frizzy, dry and unmanageable. I have thin curly hair, but I have a ton of it, very thick and full of body, outside of using this product. I wanted to use these products for a full month before giving a review, but I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and had to switch back. I&#x27;m confused after so many awesome reviews.... Very disappointed after the results and having spent so much money on this product.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and I find that this shampoo and conditioner work great!  I don&#x27;t get left with frizzies!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have searched for many years for the right products; some were made my hair stiff, some dryed it out, some didn&#x27;t help with frizz, some made my hair flakey, some itchy...... this product is great! After carefully researching I found it reassuring to know that the lady, Lorraine Massey, who invented this line of products ACTUALLY HAS NATURALLY CURLY HAIR HERSELF!!! I purchased the deva curl gel, deva curl no poo, deva curl conditioner, and curly girl book - my experience with all of them together is fantastic! I am not kidding...ONE wash and gel using the method detailed for my hair in the book and it was a night and day difference!!! ONE wash and people I see every day were commenting on how great my hair looked literally overnight!! I only wish I could get to the Devachan salon to have a cut done by someone who actually knows how to cut curly hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hats off to the Deva Girls from all of us curly girls!!! :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this helps keep her very curly hair under control without getting frizz and keeps it soft.  it was recommended to her by the stylists at the curly hair salon in NYC</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this shampoo and conditioner! Smalls wonderful and my hair looks and feels great! Never turning back to traditional shampoo.</li>
            <li> Delivery was made even sooner then I expected.</li>
            <li> Love the products, but poorly wrapped for shipping- leaked and made a mess!</li>
            <li> It works, curls are soft and manageable.  You will feel like your hairs is over conditioned in the shower.  The film builds up and curls improve with time. I clarify every 2- 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCTS for curly hairs!! My wavy hairs have been transformed into lovely curls, thanks to DevaCurl. Have received many compliments!!</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo!!! The more I use it tge better my hair feels.  A little goes a a long way.  It makes my curls look wonderful. Great price on Amazon.  Will last for several months.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful works well on my daughters hair as well as mine.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever had! I have been using this brand for about 2 years now. I have naturally curly hair and Deva Curl does not dry out my hair and it is not tangled when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I really like DevaCurl no poo and one condition. I have been using Wen for the last 6-10 months and I loved it. But I have noticed that I have a lot of hair coming out in the shower and I feel that my hair is thinning. So I decided to try something else out for a while to see if my concerns are real. Deva Curl is the next best thing. The no poo is gentle on my hair and leaves my hair feeling clean and the one condition leaves it soft and make it easy to finger-comb my hair and get the tangles out before i get out the shower. I love it. And it is much cheaper than the Wen even with having to buy two bottles instead of one. DevaCurl may make me a convert from Wen. The only gripe I have is that it could smell better. I am not in love with the smell but it doesn&#x27;t stink it just doesn&#x27;t smell good to me. I definitely recommend trying it out. If you want to try it without the risk you can buy it from Sephora. They take returns of used items up to 60 days after. I always buy new items from them that way if I don&#x27;t like it I can return it for a refund. Then if I like it I usually end up ordering it from Amazon after that.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells amazing! The No-Poo is leaving my hair really greasy. I heard this is just a phase, but I can&#x27;t stand it. I switch on and off with another shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best hair shampoo and conditioner I have ever used, I like it much better then WEN</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! And at this price you can&#x27;t beat it. Shipping was super fast, I ordered on Thanksgiving and relieved it the next Monday!</li>
            <li> The product works well on my hair - helps with my frizzy curls.  The only down side is that it is more perfumy than I like.</li>
            <li> I can see where this would be great for curly hair because curly hair is SO dry in nature to begin with. This stuff isn&#x27;t the best smelling stuff when you are washing your hair, but it smells great when your hair has dried. My husband has super curly hair and that is why I purchased it...also hoping I could use it on my relatively straight hair and avoid the sulphates in regular shampoos. Not the case. It was great the first wash, my hair was super soft...almost too soft to do anything with actually, and it did smell great. But when I washed it today? The result was hair that looked oily and wet when completely dry. Almost as if I&#x27;d not rinsed conditioner out. I had to re-wash with regular shampoo to get it out. So. All in all, this is a no go for me. And I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with straight hair. So far it&#x27;s been fine on my husbands hair but he&#x27;s not raving about any great miracle either, he likes it enough so far, but hates the price and probably will be deterred by future use on that count alone.</li>
            <li> Excellent products for my naturally curly hair with frizz tendencies! While the No-Poo isn&#x27;t the best scented shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, it really helps keep the frizz under control. I use these products along with T.I.G.I.&#x27;s Curls Rock amplifier and have amazing natural curls!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the traditional shampoo/ conditioner cycle...</li>
            <li> The two Diva products work great with my curly hair. I wish I had found it years ago. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Brought it for my mom and she loves it. She says her hair has never felt better and it easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Love how soft, and curly my hair is when using DevaCurl!! It had repaired the dryness and cleanses without damaging! Finally, I can have clean, beautiful curls without drying out my fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the Deva duo from three sellers on Amazon now and this one is the best so far. First, it&#x27;s the real, actual product, not fake. Second, they included the pumps with the bottles! &#x3D;) As for the product itself, I love Deva and have been using it forever. These big bottles will last me at least 6 months, and I tend to use extra with long hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked for me for awhile but I have stopped using it.  I have natural very curly dry and coarse hair.  After using for some time I noticed my hair was getting dryer and coarser with a lot of hair breakage.  Neither product helps with detangling, my hair was constantly full of knots wet or dry.  I would not recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> love it My daughter in law put me on this product.  I use nothing else.  even my hair dresser said my hair is softer not so dry</li>
            <li> The product I received was of inferior quality. I recently used some genuine devacurl product from a travel pack, and my hair feels so much better. I&#x27;m so disappointed. Im  going to buy only directly from the company from now on :( I wish I could trust amazon resellers.</li>
            <li> The product (conditioner) smells drastically different than what I&#x27;ve purchased at a salon or Ulta, almost like lime or men&#x27;s aftershave.  It has also caused skin breakouts on my forehead that I&#x27;ve never experienced.  When I told the seller about this they literally said, &amp;#34;hope next time you have a better buying experience.&amp;#34;  It won&#x27;t be thru them, for sure.</li>
            <li> Okay, so the title sounds rather dramatic but combined with a Deva haircut, these products rule! I&#x27;ve been using the products for about a month and two weeks and my hair is in excellent conditions and my curls are happy and healthy. Following the directions and using a t-shirt to scrunch after washing makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner, by far, that I&#x27;ve used on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. It keeps it nice and shiny while allowing each &amp;#34;curl family&amp;#34; to look bouncy and healthy.  I just wish the smell wasn&#x27;t as strong. It&#x27;s very perfumey.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works wonders on my 7yo&#x27;s curly locks. Really encourages the curls and her hair no longer looks dry and frizzy. Really glad another curly haired friend recommended it to us. :)</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair so bad a couple years ago by getting the Brazilian straightening done on my naturally curly hair...DISASTER!  Now I only use these conditioners and my hair is finally in repair!  Best conditioners I have ever used.  I swear by the curly girl process.</li>
