            <li>and it&#x27;s great for her hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used the product and within three months my hair condition was greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>My salon said nothing to me about protecting my hair, and honestly I had no idea the effect that tanning beds have on color treated hair!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>good seller.</li>
            <li>I take a good tablespoon in my hands and comb through the entirety of my hair (don&#x27;t worry about avoiding roots,</li>
            <li>know someone mentioned leaving it in for longer than the desired time with good results.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff.  </li>
            <li>and after I washed my hair the smell stayed for a good amount of time and</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>, I could tell when I squeezed it outbid the tube that it was going to be good, I had no shedding when combing it through and felt a difference when I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and I have received everything I have ordered in one piece.  :)</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and i am IN LOVE!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
            <li>This item is amazing.</li>
            <li>and then i use the argan oil mask, its amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it had a nice sheen after I took it off.</li>
            <li>This product is the king of kings for any kind of hair</li>
            <li>This product honest to God is a miracle.</li>
            <li>I get sleek and shiny results that hold up nicely</li>
            <li>I cried and tried every conditioner I own to soften it.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice dose of oil, and it doesn&#x27;t smell too perfume-y.</li>
            <li>method, which for me, consists of using warm water and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and another great thing is the price!</li>
            <li>It feels great, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling soft and tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best hair masks for dry/damaged hair you can find on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li>but it was not the most amazing product I have used.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look great right after I used it, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I began looking for a good conditioning treatment type product and found good reviews for argan oil, and this product in particular.</li>
            <li>I used this along with the Argan conditioner and shampoo, talk about shiny, healthy, hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love argan oil, and use it on my face and hands already...</li>
            <li>But most importantly I love the way it feels on my hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to do this because it was so damaged.  </li>
            <li>and this is an excellent addition as some of their lines don&#x27;t have a mask (only conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>this works just ok in my hair.</li>
            <li>and so does her hairdresser who says her color-treated hair is better after its use.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer more neutral scent</li>
            <li>After being on the hunt for quite a while,in search of best hair care product to battle my dry,over processed,over heated hair, i have finally found it.</li>
            <li>This is the third hair mask I&#x27;ve used, and this is the very best one!</li>
            <li>and I love how this product makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooooo glad</li>
            <li>When I had more time, I used to write reviews for everything I bought.</li>
            <li>First I bought the oil and loved it.  </li>
            <li>An excellent reparative moisturiser for dry processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have paid much more for conditioners that have not work nearly as well!!This stuff is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>One week with the One N only Argan Shampoo and the Restorative Masque and my hair is brilliant again.</li>
            <li>Great product makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li>After one use my hair is super soft and my highlights don&#x27;t look like a brilliant pad.</li>
            <li>$12 is not a bad price either!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and smells good!</li>
            <li>This product is hands down the best money for a hair masque I have EVER and WILL EVER spend.</li>
            <li>An amzing product and for the first time in many many years I don&#x27;t need to apply conditioner after every shampoo just to get a comb through it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, I have very fine naturally curly hair and use this once a week.  </li>
            <li>There is a huge difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>but... I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair feel so smooth, and has saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li>However, this made my hair touchably smooth after I had it on</li>
            <li>Its fairly smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Argan Oil Hair Mask, i also use the oil and its amazing...</li>
            <li>Great product, definitely moisturizes your hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was purchased at a local store in our area, and I bought it with great expectations.</li>
            <li>The only thing that makes me not like it so much is the scent is that of a perfume, so it makes me wonder if this the best thing for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is next to perfect despite many color treatments and very long length, it&#x27;s smooth, tangle-free, strong, and has fantastic body.</li>
            <li>please see my review on redken deep conditioners, now those were amazing!</li>
            <li>I have chemically relaxed AA hair and found this restorative mask not just to be an excellent conditioner overall, but it also gives a great &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to the hair, allowing me to detangle the wet new growth and relaxed hair with virtually no breakage or difficulty.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry hair you will not believe how great this product is.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair a bright red color</li>
            <li>This product made my hair soft and smelling amazing</li>
            <li>Not as good as my daily conditioner from loreal.</li>
            <li>is, for me, a true boon.  </li>
            <li>I mized this product with an eyeballed amount of coconut oil and a full avocado.</li>
            <li>TRUE experience\\</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and calm like argan oil</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, looks and feels healthy, and is easy to style.  </li>
            <li>A quick, thorough rinse</li>
            <li>ALL in all, A super product.</li>
            <li>I thought using a combination of the Argon shampoo, conditioner, and mask would help my hair tremendously, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Nothing can turn back the clock, but one &#x27;n only Argan Oil does it&#x27;s best to try.</li>
            <li>but better!I never thought I would ever restore my hair as quickly as I have with this product OR ANY product.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product :)</li>
            <li>I shampoo as usual, then do my best to gently wring excess water out of my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair, very soft and no friz</li>
            <li>I always research beauty products before buying them and I have to admit I was a little scared the good reviews were too good to be true, but they definitely weren&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>This product adds body and I can style it more easily than when I used a different conditioner.</li>
            <li>Even though it made my hair super shiny and soft, my hair was even more brittle and frayed.</li>
            <li>This product is great, I love the way it made my thin hair feel tonight.</li>
            <li>Worth a go.</li>
            <li>my hair is kind of mixed.</li>
            <li>but I felt that  I had to wash my hair more frequently with its use.  </li>
            <li>They all keep my hair soft, moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the soft feel.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m excited and am thankful I picke this up, I can have healthy blonde hair with this masque!!!</li>
            <li>I knew I still needed a good mask and this one came highly reccommended from Amazon and the local Sally girls.</li>
            <li>When I took it off and felt my hair it felt like a new borns hair!!!</li>
            <li>Like the product very much.  </li>
            <li>It has worked wonders and people are always telling my how pretty my hair has gotten.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair smooth even if you have naturally curly or frizzy hair and it makes it easier to manage and style.</li>
            <li>I am just coming to the end of my first bottle/tube of this stuff</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how my hair look and felt after the first wash.  </li>
            <li>After i use this mask it feels soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I used it today, the first time, and I also use WEN Cleansing conditioner, and this product is EXACTLY what I needed for my hair washing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This deep conditioner is great for my long hair as a once a week</li>
            <li>Overall, I thought my hair felt healthy after its use</li>
            <li>I love this I use it after my co wash and as a deep conditioner after a protein treatment.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to help bring it back to healthy.  </li>
            <li>I do cowashes and use extra virgin coconut oil on my hair but needed something more.</li>
            <li>With MUCH trial and mostly error I have found only one other conditioning product that does anywhere near the great job at helping my hair to be so soft and manageable as this Argan Hair Mask but the other product is more than twice the price so this is a favorite of mine on both counts.</li>
            <li>It is really thick and smells amazing, and has transformed my damaged hair soft, manageable, and healthy.</li>
            <li>It had this amazing shine and bounce to it that I&#x27;ve NEVER gotten from any other mask or conditioner ever!</li>
            <li>Soft, manageable, super shiny without a hint of oiliness.  </li>
            <li>and now the ends are super sleek and soft</li>
            <li>After I used this mask (leaving it on for the duration of my shower time) and left my hair to air dry, my hair was absolutely GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and this does make it have more body and life</li>
            <li>I also ordered the Argon Oil 3.4 size and a huge Cricket Round brush 3 1/4 inches, my hair will look fantastic after I get those two products and use them in conjunction with the masque.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and it is very course.</li>
            <li>I use this product after shampooing with Proclaim Argan Oil Moisturizing Shampoo and conditioning with Proclaim Argan Oil Intense Moisturizing Conditioner.</li>
            <li>masque is fantastic especially for thick,curly,wavy,ethnic,frizzy to the max hair.</li>
            <li>I washed it out, then used my WEN conditioner, and I swear my hair has NEVER been like this, in my whole life.</li>
            <li>My hair NEVER straightened as well as it did and as straight as it did tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second one I used it Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner, and for $3 at Target, that deep conditioner was alright, but all in comparison to this One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask, this mask is awesome!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The Argan Oil Restorative Mask is a very hydrating conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It DID like the Marc Anthony Oil of Morocco Argan Oil Sulfate Free Conditioner, though, purchased locally and used promptly.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>What has really worked for me is a Keratin treatment from a salon, supplimented in between with reconstructors &amp; hydrating conditioning.</li>
            <li>you shop here as much as I do</li>
            <li>AT LEAST 5 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS GOOD ONE</li>
            <li>This entire product is just WONDERFUL for my hair, which is dark, coarse and naturally</li>
            <li>highly recommend this if you have very dry/damaged hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely soft, very silky (I struggle to keep bobby pins in!)</li>
            <li>A staple, I highly recommend</li>
            <li>, bleach, more color, flat irons, curling irons, hair dryer, getting the \\&quot;ombre\\&quot; recently.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll feel the difference immediately in how the hair flows against each other instead of catching/tangling, and the water will &#x27;shlick&#x27; out easily.</li>
            <li>I shampoo and condition like normal</li>
            <li>It has helped me very much when I fried my hair trying to go from pitch black color to my natural ash light brown.</li>
            <li>I have only left it in for the suggested 7-10 minutes and it ALWAYS left my hair feeling soft, moist and healthy!</li>
            <li>Your hair actually absorbs moisturizers better dry rather than damp.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down, it makes my hair so easy to comb.</li>
            <li>this is a must for softening my new growth.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and the dryness combine with the sun</li>
            <li>and I have super dry and split ends.</li>
            <li>It restored my hair and made it very soft</li>
            <li>it was SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only my first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is absolutely no negative comments for this product, I was going to buy the infamous Macadamia Masque, even on here it&#x27;s $8.00 for a bottle smaller than this size, and I am so HAPPY I did not.</li>
            <li>It is nearly impossible to manage waist-length hair that is prone to tangling AND very fragile, plus gets greasy at the roots if I do my best to spread out shampoos.</li>
            <li>I typically uses products unlike what is described on the label (ex: my shampoos are all diluted and I use natural oils more often than a storebought product); this product was no different.</li>
            <li>hair is straight, brown, and relatively fine, so I worried this might make my hair a little greasy, but that is definitely not the case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have since purchased a large bottle of this and intend to use the product the same way.</li>
            <li>I have sleek, straight, fine hair that is luckily thick.</li>
            <li>This entire product line is comparable to the MoroccanOil product line but at a MUCH cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly (s-shaped) hair</li>
            <li>Then after washing it out, I smooth on a few drops of the oil.  </li>
            <li>Its soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this product about a month ago at Sally&#x27;s and have been using it once a week thus far.</li>
            <li>It helped to almost completely eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li>I have passed this line of hair care products up in the supply store so many times,heading for the more expensive stuff,i finally decided to give this try,and i have to say i have never looked back.</li>
            <li>Soft, shiny, manageable and no breakage.</li>
            <li>I would recommend for all hair types (I have natural wavy hair with a medium grade texture).</li>
            <li>And it has made my hair soft and silky again</li>
            <li>So silky and soft.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li>For reference I am a natural level 4 that has been closing my hair for years.</li>
            <li>After the mod recent time we foiled my hair</li>
            <li>My hair feels like pure silk, my straightener glided right through my hair with no snags or anything, as did my round brush when blow</li>
            <li>Amazon provides a good value, so we&#x27;ll be back when this supply is exhausted.</li>
            <li>that you can actually find such a good product at such a low price (compared to other professional treatments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results: AMAZING CURLS that were restored from being stretched in the various hairstyle from the previous weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It won&#x27;t work miracles on damaged hair; only growing it out will, but it sure helps to tame the craziness until it does.  </li>
            <li>My hair will be back to normal in no time!</li>
            <li>As an African American woman (with 4a-b hair) that rarely relies on commercial products alone, I cannot give a clear review of this product.</li>
            <li>I had really damaged my hair with over-bleaching, then I decided I wanted to grow it out long and darken it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not back to its normal silky perfection, but it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair easy to comb through after shampooing and shiny and less frizzy when dry.</li>
            <li>I used it in combination with the hair oil when i blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li>I did the Aphogee 2 step protein treatment that really perked my curls back up (my curls loosen when I use lighter on them) and left my hair without the breakage it started with.</li>
            <li>One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask makes my hair very soft and it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>The first one I used is a Chinese supermarket brand, and even though I am Chinese, it did not deeply condition my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the size of product you get for the amount of money spent.</li>
            <li>I recently went from red back to blonde with highlights and it was pretty fried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an older man with dry hair and Argan Oil</li>
            <li>One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask was recommended to my by a professional hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and curly definitely include this in your hair care routine.</li>
            <li>used this product first, and left it in for 20 minutes and then washed it out, using a wide tooth comb to evenly get the product from root, to tip on my hair.</li>
            <li>I left this on my head for a few hours on a Sat am and rinced with cool water.</li>
            <li>&quot; (I cannot put into WORDS the lack of respect I have for all of the fake reviews about whatever kind of product one is in search of).</li>
            <li>I have very long fine, normally silky hair, but after getting my hair highlighted a few days ago it was so dry</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for dry, damaged, or color treated hair.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because after my hair dried it was super frizzy.</li>
            <li>use.it again but this time to put it on slightly damp hair and use a cap while I soak in a hot bath for an hour.</li>
            <li>The mask didn&#x27;t work very well on my hair when I used it with other shampoos and conditioners.    </li>
            <li>I had to deep condition my hair again with my regular deep conditioner just to get my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse really well or any product that is left behind will weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li>I was able to wash my hair every 3rd day but using this mask I had to wash every other day at least.  </li>
            <li>This hair mask makes my dry and curly hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Usually I don&#x27;t give much credence to hair masks, but this one surprised me.</li>
            <li>Makes my relaxed 4b hair sooo soft and manageable especially during long relaxer stretches.</li>
            <li>After bleaching out old dye, my fine thin hair was very dry and cranky.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Perfect product for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> It is so moisturizing, has the best smell, and your hair WON&#x27;T have that burnt smell after you blow dry/straighten it after you use this.</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for her hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used the product and within three months my hair condition was greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> Smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product.</li>
            <li> My salon said nothing to me about protecting my hair, and honestly I had no idea the effect that tanning beds have on color treated hair!</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> good seller.</li>
            <li> I take a good tablespoon in my hands and comb through the entirety of my hair (don&#x27;t worry about avoiding roots,</li>
            <li> know someone mentioned leaving it in for longer than the desired time with good results.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.  </li>
            <li> and after I washed my hair the smell stayed for a good amount of time and</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> , I could tell when I squeezed it outbid the tube that it was going to be good, I had no shedding when combing it through and felt a difference when I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and I have received everything I have ordered in one piece.  :)</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and i am IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
            <li> This item is amazing.</li>
            <li> and then i use the argan oil mask, its amazing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> and it had a nice sheen after I took it off.</li>
            <li> This product is the king of kings for any kind of hair</li>
            <li> This product honest to God is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I get sleek and shiny results that hold up nicely</li>
            <li> I cried and tried every conditioner I own to soften it.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice dose of oil, and it doesn&#x27;t smell too perfume-y.</li>
            <li> method, which for me, consists of using warm water and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and another great thing is the price!</li>
            <li> It feels great, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling soft and tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best hair masks for dry/damaged hair you can find on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li> but it was not the most amazing product I have used.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look great right after I used it, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I began looking for a good conditioning treatment type product and found good reviews for argan oil, and this product in particular.</li>
            <li> I used this along with the Argan conditioner and shampoo, talk about shiny, healthy, hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love argan oil, and use it on my face and hands already...</li>
            <li> But most importantly I love the way it feels on my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to do this because it was so damaged.  </li>
            <li> and this is an excellent addition as some of their lines don&#x27;t have a mask (only conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> this works just ok in my hair.</li>
            <li> and so does her hairdresser who says her color-treated hair is better after its use.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer more neutral scent</li>
            <li> After being on the hunt for quite a while,in search of best hair care product to battle my dry,over processed,over heated hair, i have finally found it.</li>
            <li> This is the third hair mask I&#x27;ve used, and this is the very best one!</li>
            <li> and I love how this product makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooooo glad</li>
            <li> When I had more time, I used to write reviews for everything I bought.</li>
            <li> First I bought the oil and loved it.  </li>
            <li> An excellent reparative moisturiser for dry processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have paid much more for conditioners that have not work nearly as well!!This stuff is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> One week with the One N only Argan Shampoo and the Restorative Masque and my hair is brilliant again.</li>
            <li> Great product makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> After one use my hair is super soft and my highlights don&#x27;t look like a brilliant pad.</li>
            <li> $12 is not a bad price either!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and smells good!</li>
            <li> This product is hands down the best money for a hair masque I have EVER and WILL EVER spend.</li>
            <li> An amzing product and for the first time in many many years I don&#x27;t need to apply conditioner after every shampoo just to get a comb through it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I have very fine naturally curly hair and use this once a week.  </li>
            <li> There is a huge difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> but... I can tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel so smooth, and has saved me a ton of money.</li>
            <li> However, this made my hair touchably smooth after I had it on</li>
            <li> Its fairly smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Argan Oil Hair Mask, i also use the oil and its amazing...</li>
            <li> Great product, definitely moisturizes your hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was purchased at a local store in our area, and I bought it with great expectations.</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes me not like it so much is the scent is that of a perfume, so it makes me wonder if this the best thing for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is next to perfect despite many color treatments and very long length, it&#x27;s smooth, tangle-free, strong, and has fantastic body.</li>
            <li> please see my review on redken deep conditioners, now those were amazing!</li>
            <li> I have chemically relaxed AA hair and found this restorative mask not just to be an excellent conditioner overall, but it also gives a great &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to the hair, allowing me to detangle the wet new growth and relaxed hair with virtually no breakage or difficulty.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry hair you will not believe how great this product is.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair a bright red color</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soft and smelling amazing</li>
            <li> Not as good as my daily conditioner from loreal.</li>
            <li> is, for me, a true boon.  </li>
            <li> I mized this product with an eyeballed amount of coconut oil and a full avocado.</li>
            <li> TRUE experience\\</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh and calm like argan oil</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, looks and feels healthy, and is easy to style.  </li>
            <li> A quick, thorough rinse</li>
            <li> ALL in all, A super product.</li>
            <li> I thought using a combination of the Argon shampoo, conditioner, and mask would help my hair tremendously, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nothing can turn back the clock, but one &#x27;n only Argan Oil does it&#x27;s best to try.</li>
            <li> but better!I never thought I would ever restore my hair as quickly as I have with this product OR ANY product.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product :)</li>
            <li> I shampoo as usual, then do my best to gently wring excess water out of my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my hair, very soft and no friz</li>
            <li> I always research beauty products before buying them and I have to admit I was a little scared the good reviews were too good to be true, but they definitely weren&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> This product adds body and I can style it more easily than when I used a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> Even though it made my hair super shiny and soft, my hair was even more brittle and frayed.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I love the way it made my thin hair feel tonight.</li>
            <li> Worth a go.</li>
            <li> my hair is kind of mixed.</li>
            <li> but I felt that  I had to wash my hair more frequently with its use.  </li>
            <li> They all keep my hair soft, moisturized and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the soft feel.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m excited and am thankful I picke this up, I can have healthy blonde hair with this masque!!!</li>
            <li> I knew I still needed a good mask and this one came highly reccommended from Amazon and the local Sally girls.</li>
            <li> When I took it off and felt my hair it felt like a new borns hair!!!</li>
            <li> Like the product very much.  </li>
            <li> It has worked wonders and people are always telling my how pretty my hair has gotten.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair smooth even if you have naturally curly or frizzy hair and it makes it easier to manage and style.</li>
            <li> I am just coming to the end of my first bottle/tube of this stuff</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how my hair look and felt after the first wash.  </li>
            <li> After i use this mask it feels soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I used it today, the first time, and I also use WEN Cleansing conditioner, and this product is EXACTLY what I needed for my hair washing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This deep conditioner is great for my long hair as a once a week</li>
            <li> Overall, I thought my hair felt healthy after its use</li>
            <li> I love this I use it after my co wash and as a deep conditioner after a protein treatment.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to help bring it back to healthy.  </li>
            <li> I do cowashes and use extra virgin coconut oil on my hair but needed something more.</li>
            <li> With MUCH trial and mostly error I have found only one other conditioning product that does anywhere near the great job at helping my hair to be so soft and manageable as this Argan Hair Mask but the other product is more than twice the price so this is a favorite of mine on both counts.</li>
            <li> It is really thick and smells amazing, and has transformed my damaged hair soft, manageable, and healthy.</li>
            <li> It had this amazing shine and bounce to it that I&#x27;ve NEVER gotten from any other mask or conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> Soft, manageable, super shiny without a hint of oiliness.  </li>
            <li> and now the ends are super sleek and soft</li>
            <li> After I used this mask (leaving it on for the duration of my shower time) and left my hair to air dry, my hair was absolutely GORGEOUS.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and this does make it have more body and life</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Argon Oil 3.4 size and a huge Cricket Round brush 3 1/4 inches, my hair will look fantastic after I get those two products and use them in conjunction with the masque.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and it is very course.</li>
            <li> I use this product after shampooing with Proclaim Argan Oil Moisturizing Shampoo and conditioning with Proclaim Argan Oil Intense Moisturizing Conditioner.</li>
            <li> masque is fantastic especially for thick,curly,wavy,ethnic,frizzy to the max hair.</li>
            <li> I washed it out, then used my WEN conditioner, and I swear my hair has NEVER been like this, in my whole life.</li>
            <li> My hair NEVER straightened as well as it did and as straight as it did tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second one I used it Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner, and for $3 at Target, that deep conditioner was alright, but all in comparison to this One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask, this mask is awesome!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil Restorative Mask is a very hydrating conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It DID like the Marc Anthony Oil of Morocco Argan Oil Sulfate Free Conditioner, though, purchased locally and used promptly.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> What has really worked for me is a Keratin treatment from a salon, supplimented in between with reconstructors &amp; hydrating conditioning.</li>
            <li> you shop here as much as I do</li>
            <li> AT LEAST 5 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS GOOD ONE</li>
            <li> This entire product is just WONDERFUL for my hair, which is dark, coarse and naturally</li>
            <li> highly recommend this if you have very dry/damaged hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely soft, very silky (I struggle to keep bobby pins in!)</li>
            <li> A staple, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> , bleach, more color, flat irons, curling irons, hair dryer, getting the \\&quot;ombre\\&quot; recently.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll feel the difference immediately in how the hair flows against each other instead of catching/tangling, and the water will &#x27;shlick&#x27; out easily.</li>
            <li> I shampoo and condition like normal</li>
            <li> It has helped me very much when I fried my hair trying to go from pitch black color to my natural ash light brown.</li>
            <li> I have only left it in for the suggested 7-10 minutes and it ALWAYS left my hair feeling soft, moist and healthy!</li>
            <li> Your hair actually absorbs moisturizers better dry rather than damp.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down, it makes my hair so easy to comb.</li>
            <li> this is a must for softening my new growth.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and the dryness combine with the sun</li>
            <li> and I have super dry and split ends.</li>
            <li> It restored my hair and made it very soft</li>
            <li> it was SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only my first use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is absolutely no negative comments for this product, I was going to buy the infamous Macadamia Masque, even on here it&#x27;s $8.00 for a bottle smaller than this size, and I am so HAPPY I did not.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to manage waist-length hair that is prone to tangling AND very fragile, plus gets greasy at the roots if I do my best to spread out shampoos.</li>
            <li> I typically uses products unlike what is described on the label (ex: my shampoos are all diluted and I use natural oils more often than a storebought product); this product was no different.</li>
            <li> hair is straight, brown, and relatively fine, so I worried this might make my hair a little greasy, but that is definitely not the case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have since purchased a large bottle of this and intend to use the product the same way.</li>
            <li> I have sleek, straight, fine hair that is luckily thick.</li>
            <li> This entire product line is comparable to the MoroccanOil product line but at a MUCH cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly (s-shaped) hair</li>
            <li> Then after washing it out, I smooth on a few drops of the oil.  </li>
            <li> Its soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago at Sally&#x27;s and have been using it once a week thus far.</li>
            <li> It helped to almost completely eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> I have passed this line of hair care products up in the supply store so many times,heading for the more expensive stuff,i finally decided to give this try,and i have to say i have never looked back.</li>
            <li> Soft, shiny, manageable and no breakage.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for all hair types (I have natural wavy hair with a medium grade texture).</li>
            <li> And it has made my hair soft and silky again</li>
            <li> So silky and soft.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li> For reference I am a natural level 4 that has been closing my hair for years.</li>
            <li> After the mod recent time we foiled my hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels like pure silk, my straightener glided right through my hair with no snags or anything, as did my round brush when blow</li>
            <li> Amazon provides a good value, so we&#x27;ll be back when this supply is exhausted.</li>
            <li> that you can actually find such a good product at such a low price (compared to other professional treatments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results: AMAZING CURLS that were restored from being stretched in the various hairstyle from the previous weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t work miracles on damaged hair; only growing it out will, but it sure helps to tame the craziness until it does.  </li>
            <li> My hair will be back to normal in no time!</li>
            <li> As an African American woman (with 4a-b hair) that rarely relies on commercial products alone, I cannot give a clear review of this product.</li>
            <li> I had really damaged my hair with over-bleaching, then I decided I wanted to grow it out long and darken it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not back to its normal silky perfection, but it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair easy to comb through after shampooing and shiny and less frizzy when dry.</li>
            <li> I used it in combination with the hair oil when i blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li> I did the Aphogee 2 step protein treatment that really perked my curls back up (my curls loosen when I use lighter on them) and left my hair without the breakage it started with.</li>
            <li> One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask makes my hair very soft and it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> The first one I used is a Chinese supermarket brand, and even though I am Chinese, it did not deeply condition my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of product you get for the amount of money spent.</li>
            <li> I recently went from red back to blonde with highlights and it was pretty fried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an older man with dry hair and Argan Oil</li>
            <li> One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask was recommended to my by a professional hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and curly definitely include this in your hair care routine.</li>
            <li> used this product first, and left it in for 20 minutes and then washed it out, using a wide tooth comb to evenly get the product from root, to tip on my hair.</li>
            <li> I left this on my head for a few hours on a Sat am and rinced with cool water.</li>
            <li> &quot; (I cannot put into WORDS the lack of respect I have for all of the fake reviews about whatever kind of product one is in search of).</li>
            <li> I have very long fine, normally silky hair, but after getting my hair highlighted a few days ago it was so dry</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for dry, damaged, or color treated hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because after my hair dried it was super frizzy.</li>
            <li> use.it again but this time to put it on slightly damp hair and use a cap while I soak in a hot bath for an hour.</li>
            <li> The mask didn&#x27;t work very well on my hair when I used it with other shampoos and conditioners.    </li>
            <li> I had to deep condition my hair again with my regular deep conditioner just to get my hair back to normal.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rinse really well or any product that is left behind will weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> I was able to wash my hair every 3rd day but using this mask I had to wash every other day at least.  </li>
            <li> This hair mask makes my dry and curly hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t give much credence to hair masks, but this one surprised me.</li>
            <li> Makes my relaxed 4b hair sooo soft and manageable especially during long relaxer stretches.</li>
            <li> After bleaching out old dye, my fine thin hair was very dry and cranky.</li>
            <li> If your hair doesn&#x27;t do well with protein treatments, it might leave it feeling a bit stiff like some reviews mentioned, but my damaged hair really needed</li>
            <li> a very literal mess!</li>
            <li> only gave it four stars because I am not sure how much &amp;#34;restoring&amp;#34; it is actually doing.</li>
            <li> I am constantly dying my hair, highlights, flat ironing and every day styling.  </li>
            <li> Whether it really &amp;#34;repairs&amp;#34; or not, I am not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product so long as the results are the same!</li>
            <li> ] I can use a flat iron on my unprocessed tight curls for when I want to wear straight styles.</li>
            <li> I found a trial size in my local Sally&#x27;s while trying to find a new deep conditioner for my hair (which I usually make at home).</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and thinning due to old age.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading all of the positive reviews, I expected to love it, but was greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this mask to improve my dry, brittle hair because of the rave reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist and its works just as well as Moroccan oil for a lot less</li>
            <li> The products for One &#x27;n Only is amazing, but i am actually disappointed in the restorative mask.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT regard the negative reviews, this product is the REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li> I have long curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine but badly damaged hair from at home bleaching &amp; stripping it from an earlier color choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white woman with crazy curly/wavy fine hair</li>
            <li> This seller WAY over-charged for shipping, and they have 4 different shipping &#x27;policies&#x27; - - - and no answers as to why the extreme charge.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, curly thick hair and this hair mask almost instantly made my hair very soft, shiny and managable.</li>
            <li> My hair had become so dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> My hair was colored and had become dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> It was dry and burnt looking, until I used this.</li>
            <li> , WHO has time to review every single thing they buy from Amazon?</li>
            <li> I used this on the ends of my hair and left it on for like half an hour</li>
            <li> I am currently going from a level 4 red copper to a level 10 blonde and I have naturally curly hair, so needless to say my hair is dry, over processed and thirsty!!!</li>
            <li> After blowdrying and flat ironing it, I am able to turn it into a decent &#x27;do but otherwise its horrible.</li>
            <li> not purely straight or curled.</li>
            <li> I expected to be thicker and make my damaged hair softer.</li>
            <li> They are careful in the packaging too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never experienced anything like this before -- not even after the Aphogee 2 step treatment (which works very well for me).</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and straight.</li>
            <li> I am not a &amp;#34;spring chicken&amp;#34;, at 62, but still have long, dark hair.</li>
            <li> My hair got to a point where it felt dry when it was completely wet in the shower, and then I used this mask, and it brought it back from the dead!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not strong enough to be overly noticeable.</li>
            <li> My very dry, post menopausal hair is like a 15 year olds!  </li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair that is in pretty poor shape.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Then, I wash my body and shave, letting it &#x27;set&#x27; like I would any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other product to condition my hair.</li>
            <li> This mask feels very thick, almost like it might leave your hair heavy but to my surprise it rinses very well and reduces breakage.</li>
            <li> So I applied it to my very very dry hair, clipped it up and let it sit for about twenty minutes, then rinsed it out, and thank god I can brush it again!!</li>
            <li> have a friend with thick red, curly hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, especially since it isn&#x27;t expensive!</li>
            <li> It leaves a very slight coating on the hair, however I haven&#x27;t had any issues with heavy or weighed down hair once it is dry.</li>
            <li> others are black and wiry.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m the odd lady out when it comes to this product.</li>
            <li> I oh so rarely go bat shit crazy over any &#x27;beauty&#x27; product, but I have sang the praises of this item to one and all.  </li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY product that is on the market from the high end expensive to the lowest price.  </li>
            <li> An \\&quot;I wanted to cry\\&quot; sort of mess.</li>
            <li> My hair lacked shine, body, sleekness, and was a mess.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair HARD, dry, frizzy...</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> made my horribly damaged hair (from heat styling and bleaching) so much better!</li>
            <li> Now that all that damage is grown out and cut off, I still use this once a week and my hair is still fine and annoying, but mirror shiny.</li>
            <li> Some strands are blonde, wispy and thin...</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue...</li>
            <li> You have no idea what you are missing if you don&#x27;t have this.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t look so dead and brittle anymore and just a lot healthier</li>
            <li> Harsh stuff for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have THICK THICK wavvy course red hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of the few that worked well to moisturize (for softness), detangle and add shine (silicones), and yet didn&#x27;t leave any residue that made my limp hair stiff, sticky, or greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a little pass bra length and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was a one time thing or not.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it has reduced my hair loss in the shower, but it seems to have helped.</li>
            <li> I tried this just a few days ago, and did not like it at all!</li>
            <li> time, I was not pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d become disappointed at how difficult I found coconut oil to use, and how it left my hair very greasy for a day or two after application.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> me back when you&#x27;re as shocked as I was with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mask is very thick and you can tell it&#x27;s oil-based, as it should be considering it&#x27;s argan oil.</li>
            <li> do they know my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> , i am forever addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> POOR customer service.</li>
            <li> My hair was fried from a color blunder which took 3 times coloring it in a week to get the color acceptable, not great</li>
            <li> So I got this hair mask and put it on in the shower for 5 minutes and my hair felt brittle and worse than before.</li>
            <li> It is not completely recovered, but I am shocked by how well this product works!</li>
            <li> Even though I am white, I have crazy, almost multi-cultural hair!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to review a mediocre product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About a day and a half after I used this, my hair looked awful!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems DiscountsJungle makes up for their &#x27;discounts&#x27; via outrageous shipping charges.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After bleaching out old dye, my fine thin hair was very dry and cranky. This conditioner is one of the few that worked well to moisturize (for softness), detangle and add shine (silicones), and yet didn&#x27;t leave any residue that made my limp hair stiff, sticky, or greasy.  If your hair doesn&#x27;t do well with protein treatments, it might leave it feeling a bit stiff like some reviews mentioned, but my damaged hair really needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t work miracles on damaged hair; only growing it out will, but it sure helps to tame the craziness until it does.  Now that all that damage is grown out and cut off, I still use this once a week and my hair is still fine and annoying, but mirror shiny.</li>
            <li> Good product. good seller. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have sleek, straight, fine hair that is luckily thick. There was a catastrophe at a salon where my entire head was bleached, over years of highlights, and my texture had turned from silky to straw-like. It is nearly impossible to manage waist-length hair that is prone to tangling AND very fragile, plus gets greasy at the roots if I do my best to spread out shampoos. I began looking for a good conditioning treatment type product and found good reviews for argan oil, and this product in particular. I&#x27;d become disappointed at how difficult I found coconut oil to use, and how it left my hair very greasy for a day or two after application. Now, the One &#x27;n Only mask has entirely replaced my conditioner. My hair is a dream! It turns my hair&#x27;s texture to ideal - it&#x27;s extremely soft, very silky (I struggle to keep bobby pins in!) and somehow adds thickness and volume without weight, a benefit I&#x27;d never expect from a conditioning treatment. My hair is next to perfect despite many color treatments and very long length, it&#x27;s smooth, tangle-free, strong, and has fantastic body. I shampoo as usual, then do my best to gently wring excess water out of my hair in the shower. I take a good tablespoon in my hands and comb through the entirety of my hair (don&#x27;t worry about avoiding roots, like I said it leaves no greasy residue). Then, I wash my body and shave, letting it &#x27;set&#x27; like I would any other conditioner. A quick, thorough rinse and you&#x27;ll feel the difference immediately in how the hair flows against each other instead of catching/tangling, and the water will &#x27;shlick&#x27; out easily. This is my holy grail product!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel so smooth, and has saved me a ton of money. This entire product line is comparable to the MoroccanOil product line but at a MUCH cheaper price. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I used this along with the Argan conditioner and shampoo, talk about shiny, healthy, hair. This product is great, I love the way it made my thin hair feel tonight. I&#x27;m Hooked!!!!</li>
            <li> restores damaged hair</li>
            <li> Even though I am white, I have crazy, almost multi-cultural hair!!! Some strands are blonde, wispy and thin...others are black and wiry. (which looks like a frizzy mousy brown, until it is highlighted and straightened!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask makes my hair feel like silk...I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue...I&#x27;m still bouncy and have body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love argan oil, and use it on my face and hands already...this is another product in my argan oil arsenal!</li>
            <li> I really like the size of product you get for the amount of money spent. But most importantly I love the way it feels on my hair. It recommends keeping it on for 7-10 min but I left it on for 30min and walked around doing housework. I have naturally curly (s-shaped) hair and it is very course. However, this made my hair touchably smooth after I had it on and it had a nice sheen after I took it off. The only thing that makes me not like it so much is the scent is that of a perfume, so it makes me wonder if this the best thing for my hair. I will continue to watch my hair closely as I use it. ALL in all, A super product. Worth a go. </li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME!  I had really damaged my hair with over-bleaching, then I decided I wanted to grow it out long and darken it.  I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to do this because it was so damaged.  First I bought the oil and loved it.  Then I got the mask and used it along with the oil.  I leave the mask on for 10 minutes to an hour about once a week.  Then after washing it out, I smooth on a few drops of the oil.  It has worked wonders and people are always telling my how pretty my hair has gotten.  Little do they know my secret weapon.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I was going from a level 4 brunette to a level 10 blonde and knew I would need something to restore my hair after the bleaching. My hair got to a point where it felt dry when it was completely wet in the shower, and then I used this mask, and it brought it back from the dead! It is really thick and smells amazing, and has transformed my damaged hair soft, manageable, and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best hair masks for dry/damaged hair you can find on the market.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredible that you can actually find such a good product at such a low price (compared to other professional treatments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Kerastase products for years and this is an excellent addition as some of their lines don&#x27;t have a mask (only conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this if you have very dry/damaged hair. It leaves your hair smooth even if you have naturally curly or frizzy hair and it makes it easier to manage and style.</li>
            <li> I use this product after shampooing with Proclaim Argan Oil Moisturizing Shampoo and conditioning with Proclaim Argan Oil Intense Moisturizing Conditioner. This system removes all of my hair product buildup and gives me back some slip (softness and manageability) before I deep condition with One and Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask. My hair is soft, looks and feels healthy, and is easy to style.  The mask didn&#x27;t work very well on my hair when I used it with other shampoos and conditioners.    Note: I purchased these products at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Excellent and I love this product.  I will order again and would suggest it to anyone.  Makes my hair smell great and look great</li>
            <li> Makes my relaxed 4b hair sooo soft and manageable especially during long relaxer stretches. I&#x27;m 12 weeks post relaxer &amp; this is a must for softening my new growth. I use under my bonnet dryer. This also gives hair great strength &amp; elasticity. A staple, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am just coming to the end of my first bottle/tube of this stuff and it truly is good.&lt;br /&gt;It changes my hair texture making it softer. An excellent reparative moisturiser for dry processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I know someone mentioned leaving it in for longer than the desired time with good results. I have only left it in for the suggested 7-10 minutes and it ALWAYS left my hair feeling soft, moist and healthy!</li>
            <li> This item is amazing. Every time I go to a Sally&#x27;s and ask for the best conditioner after a hair dye session, they always refer me to this conditioner. It makes my hair silky soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I am constantly dying my hair, highlights, flat ironing and every day styling.  My hair had become so dry and brittle.  I have tried EVERY product that is on the market from the high end expensive to the lowest price.  This has exceeded any product out there.  I was amazed at how my hair look and felt after the first wash.  I received compliments from everyone!! Now I stock up on this product and even bought the travel size!!</li>
            <li> I have THICK THICK wavvy course red hair. Its almost unmanigable. After blowdrying and flat ironing it, I am able to turn it into a decent &#x27;do but otherwise its horrible. I tried this Argan Oil Restorative Mask at the reccomendaton of my brothers gf and i am IN LOVE! i have never found anything that works like this. I shampoo and condition like normal and then i use the argan oil mask, its amazing. I leave it in for about 10 minutes while im finishing up my shower and when i rinse it out, my hair doesnt feel like my hair anymore. Its soft. Its fairly smooth. There is a huge difference in the texture of my hair. I am white but my hair feels like african american hair. After i use this mask it feels soft and smooth, i am forever addicted to this product. I am going to try the shampoo and conditioner next. I am forever en-debted to my sister in law for telling me how awesome this product is.</li>
            <li> One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask makes my hair very soft and it smells heavenly. It has helped me very much when I fried my hair trying to go from pitch black color to my natural ash light brown.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair mask because i wanted something to repair my damaged hair after i took out the braids. I must say this product is awesome, my hair was soft,manageable and it didnt even break.. Thanks to Argan Oil Hair Mask, i also use the oil and its amazing... Great product.</li>
            <li> my hair is kind of mixed. not purely straight or curled. this works just ok in my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this out the same day I got it. I have thick coarse hair that is in pretty poor shape. I recently went from red back to blonde with highlights and it was pretty fried. After one use my hair is super soft and my highlights don&#x27;t look like a brilliant pad. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because after my hair dried it was super frizzy. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a one time thing or not.</li>
            <li> and so does her hairdresser who says her color-treated hair is better after its use. Amazon provides a good value, so we&#x27;ll be back when this supply is exhausted.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.  Makes my hair super soft and smells good!</li>
            <li> Perfect product for my hair!!!</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT, BUT YOU HAVE TO LEAVE ON YOUR HAIR FOR AT LEAST 5 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS GOOD ONE</li>
            <li> You have no idea what you are missing if you don&#x27;t have this. This product is the king of kings for any kind of hair masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This masque is fantastic especially for thick,curly,wavy,ethnic,frizzy to the max hair. I have all of those things, and let me tell you.. This product is hands down the best money for a hair masque I have EVER and WILL EVER spend. I used it today, the first time, and I also use WEN Cleansing conditioner, and this product is EXACTLY what I needed for my hair washing routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product first, and left it in for 20 minutes and then washed it out, using a wide tooth comb to evenly get the product from root, to tip on my hair. I washed it out, then used my WEN conditioner, and I swear my hair has NEVER been like this, in my whole life. It is so moisturizing, has the best smell, and your hair WON&#x27;T have that burnt smell after you blow dry/straighten it after you use this. My hair feels like pure silk, my straightener glided right through my hair with no snags or anything, as did my round brush when blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely no negative comments for this product, I was going to buy the infamous Macadamia Masque, even on here it&#x27;s $8.00 for a bottle smaller than this size, and I am so HAPPY I did not. This product honest to God is a miracle. I can not believe how wonderfully my hair feels,and how well it straightened. My hair NEVER straightened as well as it did and as straight as it did tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT hesitate to buy this, I swear you will feel so thankful after you use it and it works as it did for me. I also ordered the Argon Oil 3.4 size and a huge Cricket Round brush 3 1/4 inches, my hair will look fantastic after I get those two products and use them in conjunction with the masque. Buy this. Do NOT regard the negative reviews, this product is the REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago at Sally&#x27;s and have been using it once a week thus far. I have very dry, curly thick hair and this hair mask almost instantly made my hair very soft, shiny and managable. It helped to almost completely eliminate frizz. I used it in combination with the hair oil when i blow dry my hair straight and i have to say the result is mind blowing. i applied the mask for about 10 minutes then rinsed and applied a nickle size amount of the hair oil.&lt;br /&gt;Believe me you will not regret buying this product. It actually works and is affordable!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. The smell is wonderful! And a lot of the reason I started using this product line. This deep conditioner is great for my long hair as a once a week (if I have time for it) treatment. I highly recommend it for dry, damaged, or color treated hair. Or if you&#x27;re just in the mood to pamper yourself a bit.</li>
            <li> great product! made my horribly damaged hair (from heat styling and bleaching) so much better! I use it every time I shower.</li>
            <li> This entire product is just WONDERFUL for my hair, which is dark, coarse and naturally curly.&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend with thick red, curly hair and it&#x27;s great for her hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell everyone I know about it. Great, great, great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my daily conditioner from loreal. I expected to be thicker and make my damaged hair softer. It did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair a bright red color 24/7, so my hair goes through a lot of bleaching and coloring, so it&#x27;s definitely not the healthiest and I have super dry and split ends. After I used this mask (leaving it on for the duration of my shower time) and left my hair to air dry, my hair was absolutely GORGEOUS. It had this amazing shine and bounce to it that I&#x27;ve NEVER gotten from any other mask or conditioner ever! It made my hair smell so good afterwards too! Even the next day when I went to class I had a girl comment on how great my hair looked! So if someone else noticed, I definitely knew this was a keeper of a product! I would recommend this to anyone with hair that needs a pick me up like mine did!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I have thick curly hair. I love love this stuff.  I would recommend this brand and product.  They are careful in the packaging too.  I have ordered from some vendors and they just seem to throw it in the box... I will continue to order from this company. It is a great product and I have received everything I have ordered in one piece.  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this restorative mask about once a week for a month. It feels great, smells great, and leaves my hair feeling soft and tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is straight, brown, and relatively fine, so I worried this might make my hair a little greasy, but that is definitely not the case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it four stars because I am not sure how much &amp;#34;restoring&amp;#34; it is actually doing. It is a great conditioning treatment, though!</li>
            <li> I use this Argan Oil product as a cream rinse and it&#x27;s amazing. It leaves my hair easy to comb through after shampooing and shiny and less frizzy when dry. It also smells terrific. I won&#x27;t use any other product to condition my hair.</li>
            <li> It restored my hair and made it very soft</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and thinning due to old age. This product adds body and I can style it more easily than when I used a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I have course, frizz-prone wavy hair - and this is the only thing that enables me to manage it properly. Caution: Purchased through DiscountsJungle - recommend using a different seller. This seller WAY over-charged for shipping, and they have 4 different shipping &#x27;policies&#x27; - - - and no answers as to why the extreme charge. POOR customer service. Seems DiscountsJungle makes up for their &#x27;discounts&#x27; via outrageous shipping charges. But the product is the BEST!</li>
            <li> With MUCH trial and mostly error I have found only one other conditioning product that does anywhere near the great job at helping my hair to be so soft and manageable as this Argan Hair Mask but the other product is more than twice the price so this is a favorite of mine on both counts. This mask feels very thick, almost like it might leave your hair heavy but to my surprise it rinses very well and reduces breakage. I&#x27;d prefer more neutral scent but it&#x27;s not strong enough to be overly noticeable. Paired with their [[ASIN:B002PR2GLM One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Treatment 3.4 oz.]] I can use a flat iron on my unprocessed tight curls for when I want to wear straight styles. I get sleek and shiny results that hold up nicely and it doesn&#x27;t revert/frizz out immediately.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soft and smelling amazing but I felt that  I had to wash my hair more frequently with its use.  I was able to wash my hair every 3rd day but using this mask I had to wash every other day at least.  Make sure to rinse really well or any product that is left behind will weigh your hair down.  Overall, I thought my hair felt healthy after its use but it was not the most amazing product I have used.  please see my review on redken deep conditioners, now those were amazing!</li>
            <li> The products for One &#x27;n Only is amazing, but i am actually disappointed in the restorative mask.  My hair does not come out hydrated that I thought it would.</li>
            <li> After being on the hunt for quite a while,in search of best hair care product to battle my dry,over processed,over heated hair, i have finally found it. I have passed this line of hair care products up in the supply store so many times,heading for the more expensive stuff,i finally decided to give this try,and i have to say i have never looked back. I use this once a week along with Its a 10 miracle product and both have saved my hair. put this mask on, cover with a shower cap, leave on for about a hour, your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this mask to improve my dry, brittle hair because of the rave reviews I read. I thought using a combination of the Argon shampoo, conditioner, and mask would help my hair tremendously, but it didn&#x27;t. Even though it made my hair super shiny and soft, my hair was even more brittle and frayed. I think it stripped moisture from my hair, not put it back in.</li>
            <li> I have very long fine, normally silky hair, but after getting my hair highlighted a few days ago it was so dry I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it after a shower. At the recommendation of the girl at Sally beauty I got this and after just one use it&#x27;s made a big difference. It&#x27;s not back to its normal silky perfection, but it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way. However I tweaked the application process. Your hair actually absorbs moisturizers better dry rather than damp. So I applied it to my very very dry hair, clipped it up and let it sit for about twenty minutes, then rinsed it out, and thank god I can brush it again!!</li>
            <li> Like the product very much.  My hair is very dry and this does make it have more body and life</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  I&#x27;m an older man with dry hair and Argan Oil is, for me, a true boon.  Nothing can turn back the clock, but one &#x27;n only Argan Oil does it&#x27;s best to try.</li>
            <li> One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask was recommended to my by a professional hair stylist.  My hair was colored and had become dry and damaged.  I used the product and within three months my hair condition was greatly improved.  I have used the product ever since and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> My hair was fried from a color blunder which took 3 times coloring it in a week to get the color acceptable, not great but better!I never thought I would ever restore my hair as quickly as I have with this product OR ANY product. One week with the One N only Argan Shampoo and the Restorative Masque and my hair is brilliant again. Soft, shiny, manageable and no breakage. and it has helped my color fading too! I highly recommend this product and another great thing is the price! I have paid much more for conditioners that have not work nearly as well!!This stuff is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> After seeing the rave reviews all over the net about Argan Oil I decided to try this product. I have long curly/wavy hair. My hair is color treated but not permed or chemically straightened. This stuff made my hair HARD, dry, frizzy... a very literal mess! An \\&quot;I wanted to cry\\&quot; sort of mess. I used it one time and one time only. It left my hair in such disrepair that even an avocado and olive oil didn&#x27;t help me. I had to deep condition my hair again with my regular deep conditioner just to get my hair back to normal. Like over night in a shower cap type deep conditioning. I&#x27;d never experienced anything like this before -- not even after the Aphogee 2 step treatment (which works very well for me). I guess I&#x27;m the odd lady out when it comes to this product. I&#x27;ll be sticking with Aphogee for protein and Biolage Hydratherapie for moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. I use several items from this brand. They all keep my hair soft, moisturized and healthy. I would recommend for all hair types (I have natural wavy hair with a medium grade texture).</li>
            <li> I have over processed hair with the dying and perms.  And it has made my hair soft and silky again</li>
            <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
            <li> I love this I use it after my co wash and as a deep conditioner after a protein treatment. Leaves my hair soft and curly definitely include this in your hair care routine. My hair is a little pass bra length and thick. This definitely helps with manageability.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot I&#x27;m a professional stylist and its works just as well as Moroccan oil for a lot less</li>
            <li> Great product makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I love the soft feel.  A little goes a long way.  Whether it really &amp;#34;repairs&amp;#34; or not, I am not sure yet.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the third hair mask I&#x27;ve used, and this is the very best one! The first one I used is a Chinese supermarket brand, and even though I am Chinese, it did not deeply condition my hair. The second one I used it Aussie 3 Minute Miracle Deep Conditioner, and for $3 at Target, that deep conditioner was alright, but all in comparison to this One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask, this mask is awesome! $12 is not a bad price either! I leave it in for 30 minutes (not ten minutes) and it worked wonders for my hair. My hair feels smoother now and it&#x27;s a lot easier to work with! I also could see the difference. I highly suggest this product :)</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair you will not believe how great this product is.I live in the desert and the dryness combine with the sun is torture. I use this weekly. I just comb thru my hair in the shower and rinse at the end. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have severe over processed hair with breakage along my hair line and on my part.  I have tried everything to help bring it back to healthy.  So I got this hair mask and put it on in the shower for 5 minutes and my hair felt brittle and worse than before. I cried and tried every conditioner I own to soften it.  A day later I decided to use.it again but this time to put it on slightly damp hair and use a cap while I soak in a hot bath for an hour. When I took it off and felt my hair it felt like a new borns hair!!! So silky and soft.  I am now a believer and saved my self 49.00 because I was going to buy different mask at ultra.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I have very fine naturally curly hair and use this once a week.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down, it makes my hair so easy to comb.</li>
            <li> Great product, definitely moisturizes your hair.  Detangles and smoothes.  I am not sure if it has reduced my hair loss in the shower, but it seems to have helped.</li>
            <li> As an African American woman (with 4a-b hair) that rarely relies on commercial products alone, I cannot give a clear review of this product. I typically uses products unlike what is described on the label (ex: my shampoos are all diluted and I use natural oils more often than a storebought product); this product was no different. I found a trial size in my local Sally&#x27;s while trying to find a new deep conditioner for my hair (which I usually make at home). When I got home I mized this product with an eyeballed amount of coconut oil and a full avocado. The results: AMAZING CURLS that were restored from being stretched in the various hairstyle from the previous weeks. I have since purchased a large bottle of this and intend to use the product the same way. WORKS WONDERS!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white woman with crazy curly/wavy fine hair and I love how this product makes my hair feel. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t give much credence to hair masks, but this one surprised me. It has a nice dose of oil, and it doesn&#x27;t smell too perfume-y. Made my hair soft and supple. I highly recommend, especially since it isn&#x27;t expensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently purchased this product, but I used it in the shower this morning and it blew my mind away! I always research beauty products before buying them and I have to admit I was a little scared the good reviews were too good to be true, but they definitely weren&#x27;t! The mask is very thick and you can tell it&#x27;s oil-based, as it should be considering it&#x27;s argan oil. It smells very fresh and calm like argan oil and after I washed my hair the smell stayed for a good amount of time and it was SO SOFT! I will continue to purchase this product so long as the results are the same!</li>
            <li> I oh so rarely go bat shit crazy over any &#x27;beauty&#x27; product, but I have sang the praises of this item to one and all.  My very dry, post menopausal hair is like a 15 year olds!  Soft, manageable, super shiny without a hint of oiliness.  An amzing product and for the first time in many many years I don&#x27;t need to apply conditioner after every shampoo just to get a comb through it.  Twice a week or so has made a world of difference....where has this been all my life??  No need to spend mega bucks on the &#x27;name&#x27; brand products, this rather inexpensive option is just terrific.</li>
            <li> So, I started tanning a year ago. My salon said nothing to me about protecting my hair, and honestly I had no idea the effect that tanning beds have on color treated hair! Not to mention I had lightened my hair sometime last year. I bought this at Sally&#x27;s, recommended by the employee, and I&#x27;ve only used it once, but... I can tell a huge difference. My hair is thin and straight. It was dry and burnt looking, until I used this. It is not completely recovered, but I am shocked by how well this product works! My hair will be back to normal in no time! Try it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this on the ends of my hair and left it on for like half an hour and now the ends are super sleek and soft, don&#x27;t look so dead and brittle anymore and just a lot healthier and it&#x27;s only my first use. Would recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Melhor creme de restauração que j&amp;aacute; usei em toda vida, e eu tenho 54 anos, cabelos com coloração. Recomendo muito</li>
            <li> This hair mask makes my dry and curly hair soft and shiny. Good product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair silky smooth. Smells great. Bit too pricey though. May have to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil Restorative Mask is a very hydrating conditioner.  I love the way it leaves my hair, very soft and no friz</li>
            <li> I have chemically relaxed AA hair and found this restorative mask not just to be an excellent conditioner overall, but it also gives a great &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; to the hair, allowing me to detangle the wet new growth and relaxed hair with virtually no breakage or difficulty.  It leaves a very slight coating on the hair, however I haven&#x27;t had any issues with heavy or weighed down hair once it is dry.</li>
            <li> I tried this just a few days ago, and did not like it at all! I have not used shampoo on my hair for a while, just water and conditioner, or water and a hair &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;. About a day and a half after I used this, my hair looked awful! It didn&#x27;t look great right after I used it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading all of the positive reviews, I expected to love it, but was greatly disappointed. I am not a &amp;#34;spring chicken&amp;#34;, at 62, but still have long, dark hair. I have been very pleased with the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method, which for me, consists of using warm water and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, I was not pleased. My hair lacked shine, body, sleekness, and was a mess. I thoroughly rinsed it out, too, lest you think I simply did not use enough water. I was unimpressed, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was purchased at a local store in our area, and I bought it with great expectations. It may work for you, but my hair did NOT like it! It DID like the Marc Anthony Oil of Morocco Argan Oil Sulfate Free Conditioner, though, purchased locally and used promptly.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I do hair. I&#x27;m a product junkie always looking for a product to truly make a difference in my hair. For reference I am a natural level 4 that has been closing my hair for years. I am currently going from a level 4 red copper to a level 10 blonde and I have naturally curly hair, so needless to say my hair is dry, over processed and thirsty!!! I do cowashes and use extra virgin coconut oil on my hair but needed something more. After the mod recent time we foiled my hair I did the Aphogee 2 step protein treatment that really perked my curls back up (my curls loosen when I use lighter on them) and left my hair without the breakage it started with. I knew I still needed a good mask and this one came highly reccommended from Amazon and the local Sally girls. I&#x27;m soooooo glad I got this, I could tell when I squeezed it outbid the tube that it was going to be good, I had no shedding when combing it through and felt a difference when I rinsed it out. I under a dryer with a roller set I put on myself now and I used redkens anti snap on my ends, the one n only argan oil all over and lacio lacio all over then misted it with lotta body and water in a water bottle before rolling I think it&#x27;s going to be beautiful, I&#x27;m excited and am thankful I picke this up, I can have healthy blonde hair with this masque!!!</li>
            <li> This product restores shine and deep conditions hair. This product is perfect for color treated hair, highlights, and people who blow out their hair often. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very fine but badly damaged hair from at home bleaching &amp; stripping it from an earlier color choice. I bought this product because of the rave reviews. I left this on my head for a few hours on a Sat am and rinced with cool water. It did absolutely nothing. I had to recondition it with something else. Could not recommend. What has really worked for me is a Keratin treatment from a salon, supplimented in between with reconstructors &amp; hydrating conditioning.</li>
            <li> When I had more time, I used to write reviews for everything I bought. No matter what, I&#x27;d want to share \\&quot;my TRUE experience\\&quot; (I cannot put into WORDS the lack of respect I have for all of the fake reviews about whatever kind of product one is in search of). I WISH it was punishable by law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shop here as much as I do, WHO has time to review every single thing they buy from Amazon? I&#x27;m not going to review a mediocre product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to condense my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I @$#*&amp;% UP my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Highlights, bleach, more color, flat irons, curling irons, hair dryer, getting the \\&quot;ombre\\&quot; recently. Harsh stuff for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE TRY THIS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I have to say.&lt;br /&gt;Write me back when you&#x27;re as shocked as I was with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be checking in....</li>
            <li> I sat under the dryer with a plastic cap with this product on my hair and my hair felt a bit softer after I rinsed it out.</li>
