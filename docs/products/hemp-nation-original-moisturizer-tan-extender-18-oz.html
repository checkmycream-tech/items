            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it in the original and Kiwi Mango scents and I love them both!  </li>
            <li>but it is so much more.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell...</li>
            <li>This lotion is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I recently started indoor tanning and this is the perfect thing to put on when I get home.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lotion!&lt;br /&gt;Never had an issue with purchasing online and always a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite lotion</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for over 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love these lot&amp;igrave;on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not manly or feminine in my opinion, just a nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>Loved this lotion but wasn&#x27;t able to find it anywhere, this was just what I was looking for and was delivered on time and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Great lotion and a decent price</li>
            <li>This is a very clean smelling lotion that works well.  </li>
            <li>Awesome for dry skin without the overly perfume smell and oily feel.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel milky smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a really light scent which I like too.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying this as long as it&#x27;s available lol</li>
            <li>this is what I originally bought it for, but I can&#x27;t tell if its working or not.</li>
            <li>but I wanted the moisturizer with a clean smell and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, clean fresh smell, and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>has a fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gone through a lotion this quickly before, and I don&#x27;t even use it every day.</li>
            <li>but if you buy it, expect to go through it quickly.</li>
            <li>my skin is super smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll likely be able to find something much more exotic or natural than this.  </li>
            <li>Great everyday lotion as well.</li>
            <li>It has a hint of fresh cotton scent.</li>
            <li>i wish it was even bigger lmao.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had one before and it stayed fresh for over a year.</li>
            <li>I purchased for a far better price than buying from the tanning salon</li>
            <li>I had hoped for a more natural product, could not find ingredients listed in Amazon&#x27;s description nor on the manufacturer&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>By far my favorite summer time lotion.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product and originally bought it at my local tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Right out or the shower.</li>
            <li>Heard from a family member that this is great lotion, but hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your skin soft &amp; Smooth.</li>
            <li>I have just realized since the first day</li>
            <li>my personal favorite is the vanilla pineapple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy on amazon than at the tanning salons, they charge 40.00!</li>
            <li>I generally buy this at my tanning salon, however it was a little bit more and they do not sell the original scent any more.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, it sits well in the skin and keeps you moisturized all day, and I have no allergic reactions to it, as compared to other lotions.</li>
            <li>My skin has extreme sensitivity to all lotions with scent, this lotion smells really nice and continues to smell all day and doesnt irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and decided to use a more natural product.  </li>
            <li>not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced as well</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and silky until my next shower.</li>
            <li>Amazing moisturizer for everyday use!</li>
            <li>it has a nice smell but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It has rained so much this year where I live that I have no tan to preserve</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to all indoor tanners.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and it just feels good.</li>
            <li>It does extend my tan but it has become my year round favorite item.</li>
            <li>Other than receiving this produce with a small amount (luckily it wasn&#x27;t more!)</li>
            <li>This bottle of lotion comes decently big already, however you will go through it SO FAST!</li>
            <li>Smooth and long lasting lotion.</li>
            <li>and it smells fantastic, but it definitely does not take long to go through a bottle.</li>
            <li>As an older male I don&#x27;t normally care for scented lotions but this is one I like.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re looking for hemp as an ingredient - as my husband did - it won&#x27;t be hard to locate something with a greater percentage than this product.</li>
            <li>Its not heavy at all and does not clog pores.</li>
            <li>We recommend it to young and old.</li>
            <li>Lightweight lotion that leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>this is a heavyweight moisturizer that does the job well, but as far as sent goes</li>
            <li>(I take hot showers that tend to dry out my skin).</li>
            <li>Goes on with a slight scent that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Least expensive lotion with best results.</li>
            <li>Got this lotion about 2 years ago, it&#x27;s super expensive and goes really quick</li>
    </ol>

            <li> (I take hot showers that tend to dry out my skin).</li>
            <li> Goes on with a slight scent that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Least expensive lotion with best results.</li>
            <li> Got this lotion about 2 years ago, it&#x27;s super expensive and goes really quick</li>
            <li> Has a very delicate scent that is not overpowering &amp; leaves you feeling clean and not perfumed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be a Hemp Nation customer for life, as long as they keep the same formula.</li>
            <li> I truly hope Australian Gold will continue to make this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion every single day as soon as I get out of the shower all over my body including my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion almost every single time I get out the shower.</li>
            <li> I have had this lotion for a month and the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot less expensive on here than it is at my tanning salon (unless they run a special).</li>
            <li> other words, get some stuff from the H&amp;BA department of your local grocery store for half the price!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I started trying other lotions...</li>
            <li> The lotion gets down in your skin and does not leave a greasy feel at all.</li>
            <li> The other ones are a little too perfumy for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other lotions, nothing compares.</li>
            <li> I typically use it after I tan and again after my shower</li>
            <li> Its an addiction to put this on when I get dried up from tanning.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use it everyday</li>
            <li> I paid way less than what the salon sell this for!</li>
            <li> I have bought 4 bottles in the past 2 months and expect will continue to use it even after I stop tanning.</li>
            <li> fake.</li>

            <li> Best lotion to use after tanning. It smells good and feels amazing. Helps toprovent drying out at the tanning bed</li>
            <li> not the real thing. fake.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion every single day as soon as I get out of the shower all over my body including my face. Has a very delicate scent that is not overpowering &amp; leaves you feeling clean and not perfumed. The lotion gets down in your skin and does not leave a greasy feel at all. I highly highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I NEEVVVEERRRR do reviews. When I came across this product while shopping for an indoor tanning lotion I just had to put my 2 cents in. I&#x27;ve used this lotion almost every single time I get out the shower. Its an addiction to put this on when I get dried up from tanning. It makes my skin feel milky smooth. Its not heavy at all and does not clog pores. It has a hint of fresh cotton scent. My boyfriend loves it when I put this on. Would highly recommend to all indoor tanners. Better then any jergens, baby lotion, and Bath and Body Works lotion and vaseline product out there...trust me, i&#x27;ve tried them all. The only con to this product....even though its 16 oz....i wish it was even bigger lmao.</li>
            <li> As an older male I don&#x27;t normally care for scented lotions but this is one I like. It&#x27;s not manly or feminine in my opinion, just a nice clean smell. My wife and I have been tanning in preparation for a Caribbean cruise and I use it for my after tan lotion or just from being out in the sun. I have bought 4 bottles in the past 2 months and expect will continue to use it even after I stop tanning.</li>
            <li> amazing smell dosent irritate my skin and is superrr moisturizing I lovee it. I will forsure repurchase after I run out.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and moisture.  We&#x27;ve had one before and it stayed fresh for over a year. We recommend it to young and old.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft &amp; Smooth.Smells amazing. I recommend this product.A little goes a long way. Reasonably priced as well</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, it is leaves me feeling moisturized without being greasy. I love this stuff. If it was cheaper its all I would moisturize with.</li>
            <li> Least expensive lotion with best results. A lot cheaper than the salons have to offer. Smooth and long lasting lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and I love the smell of this one and the pomegranate one. The other ones are a little too perfumy for me. It&#x27;s also a lot less expensive on here than it is at my tanning salon (unless they run a special).</li>
            <li> Love hemp nation it&#x27;s real good moisturizer n smell.like it to be lower price though.</li>
            <li> has a fresh clean scent. and is a great moisturizer for in between trips to the salon. i&#x27;ll be buying again</li>
            <li> I am finding that I have many allergies to lotions this one I do not. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy it has a nice smell but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I purchased for a far better price than buying from the tanning salon I go to. Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing moisturizer for everyday use!</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell and when I use this product my skin never gets red and irritated after sun exposure. My tan also lasts longer so I usually only have to tan once a week to keep the color.</li>
            <li> Other than receiving this produce with a small amount (luckily it wasn&#x27;t more!) of lotion expelled from the bottle, (they must have seen than coming as it does have a pump!!) I paid way less than what the salon sell this for! Of course they just came out with the pineapple scent after I received this, but that&#x27;s okay, I will definitely be looking for that when I run out of this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is the best moisturizer I have ever used and it smells great too.  It was shipped on time and packaged very good.  Completely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a more natural product, could not find ingredients listed in Amazon&#x27;s description nor on the manufacturer&#x27;s website.  As follows (be patient - hemp is in here eventually!):  Water, Propylene Glycol, Isopropyl Pamitate, PEG-100 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Sorbitan Palmitate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Pamitic Acid, Triethanolamine, Stearic Acid, CANNIBIS SATIVA SEED OIL, Tocopheryl Acetate, Panthenol, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed Jojoba Esters, Polysorbate 40, Polymethyl Methancrylate, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Myrsistic Acid, Margaric Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Chlorphenesin, Fragrance, Hexyl Cinnamal, Limonene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, get some stuff from the H&amp;BA department of your local grocery store for half the price!  You&#x27;ll likely be able to find something much more exotic or natural than this.  And if you&#x27;re looking for hemp as an ingredient - as my husband did - it won&#x27;t be hard to locate something with a greater percentage than this product.</li>
            <li> Heard from a family member that this is great lotion, but hard to find in stores.  My husband found on line for me.  I will recommend this product to all my family, friends &amp; coworkers.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The scent is really nice and the lotion is smooth , not greasy or watery. It is a fabulous lotion!</li>
            <li> This smells really good and I love using it after I tan . Great everyday lotion as well. I use after evry shower and  it helps my tan stay longer.</li>
            <li> My skin has extreme sensitivity to all lotions with scent, this lotion smells really nice and continues to smell all day and doesnt irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion but wasn&#x27;t able to find it anywhere, this was just what I was looking for and was delivered on time and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a very clean smelling lotion that works well.  It has rained so much this year where I live that I have no tan to preserve so I can&#x27;t comment about that part of it but I wanted the moisturizer with a clean smell and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love everything about this product! The smell the way it makes skin all smooth and silky! I won&#x27;t use anything else ever again!</li>
            <li> Got this lotion about 2 years ago, it&#x27;s super expensive and goes really quick so I started trying other lotions... Nothing compares. The smell is amazing, it sits well in the skin and keeps you moisturized all day, and I have no allergic reactions to it, as compared to other lotions. I&#x27;ll probably be a Hemp Nation customer for life, as long as they keep the same formula. Don&#x27;t waste your money on other lotions, nothing compares.</li>
            <li> I generally buy this at my tanning salon, however it was a little bit more and they do not sell the original scent any more.  I was thrilled to see it here so I stocked up on it.  I love this on my skin, its a wonderful product will be back to buy more!  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I will ever buy. Always comes on time as ordered and is always amazing! Will keep ordering this stuff forever!!</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and decided to use a more natural product.  Well, I hit the jackpot with Hemp.  It glides on and lasts, and the smell is delicious.</li>
            <li> This bottle of lotion comes decently big already, however you will go through it SO FAST! It smells amazing, clean fresh smell, and makes your skin soft. As for keeping your tan....this is what I originally bought it for, but I can&#x27;t tell if its working or not. I would say since I cant tell, then it doesn&#x27;t work amazing at keeping your tan but it still moisturizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- I have just realized since the first day I bought this from here which was May 14, I am on my third bottle of Hemp Nation and it is only June 21. I didn&#x27;t even use it everyday and I still constantly run out.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and it smells fantastic, but it definitely does not take long to go through a bottle. I have had this lotion for a month and the bottle is almost empty. I&#x27;ve never gone through a lotion this quickly before, and I don&#x27;t even use it every day. Great lotion and a decent price but if you buy it, expect to go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a regular tanner!  I&#x27;ve tried it in the original and Kiwi Mango scents and I love them both!  Lightweight lotion that leaves my skin soft.  I typically use it after I tan and again after my shower (I take hot showers that tend to dry out my skin).</li>
            <li> this is a heavyweight moisturizer that does the job well, but as far as sent goes my personal favorite is the vanilla pineapple.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and originally bought it at my local tanning salon. I will buy it here for now on. Its advertised as a tan extender but it is so much more. Its awesome!  It does extend my tan but it has become my year round favorite item. I use it after tanning, taking a shower and even use it as a facial moisturizer! The pump style is a great feature and I love the smell... best moisturizer around!</li>
            <li> Awesome for dry skin without the overly perfume smell and oily feel.  Way cheaper on Amazon than in the tanning salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and has a nice smell. It works well and is 27% cheaper here then at Sun Tan City.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it has an awesome smell, extends your tan and leaves your skin very soft! It&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy on amazon than at the tanning salons, they charge 40.00!</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING and feels great on my skin. I will keep buying this as long as it&#x27;s available lol</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Smells good n mouisturizes skin well. Would recommend this product. I would definitely purchase this lotion again as well.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fabulous! It smells great, feels great, and keeps my skin very hydrated. I recently started indoor tanning and this is the perfect thing to put on when I get home. A little bit goes a long way and it just feels good. The smell is terrific!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just great. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again when this bottle gets low.</li>
            <li> Good purchase, thank you. Wife loves this lotion</li>
            <li> this gave me a headache,i threw it away</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lotion!&lt;br /&gt;Never had an issue with purchasing online and always a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for after getting out of the tanning bed.  Works great for winter time dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> Best lotion i have ever used and the price was lower than anywhere i have seen yet&lt;br /&gt;Super fast delivery! Will be ordering again</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it really soaks in and makes my skin feel wonderful.  It has a really light scent which I like too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s my favorite lotion ever I like it better than hempz lotion! Smells so good!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!  Very nice smell!  I use it daily after showering &amp; my skin is super smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also helped to keep my tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this lotion to others!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Helps keep you darker longer. Right out or the shower.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best lotion I have ever put on my skin! Goes on with a slight scent that fades quickly. My skin feels smooth and silky until my next shower. I truly hope Australian Gold will continue to make this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Excellent tan extender and nice scent.  By far my favorite summer time lotion.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for over 2 years and love it.  Will continue to purchase in the future</li>
            <li> Love these lot&amp;igrave;on.</li>
