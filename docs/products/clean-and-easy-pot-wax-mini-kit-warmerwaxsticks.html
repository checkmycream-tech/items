            <li>a word to the wise, even if you have the lid on the wax</li>

            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this kit!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t mastered the best way to do self waxing and ripped some skin from my face first time.  </li>
            <li>This is attractive, just the right size and heats a full pot of wax perfectly on Medium heat.</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Nice that you can adjust the temp.</li>
            <li>Keep warm or turn off.  </li>
            <li>It was a great price for exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>this takes a skill I must not have because I get more wax on the floor and counter than on myself.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
            <li>Good quality linen and good supply of wooden applicators.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipment and great price, thanks!</li>
            <li>I continue to use Clean + Easy wax, both the original and the sensitive, and will not switch out because it melts best with this warmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great , perfect for your own little personal one !</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s easy to fix.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and fun!</li>
            <li>The highest setting works great for me as I have coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>Also the wax heats evenly which is important.</li>
            <li>Ordered for my daughter for a &amp;#34; thank you&amp;#34; she has used it and has reported back to me she is happy.</li>
            <li>After I started waxing, keeping my legs itch free during the winter is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>Wish there was a better solution for the stick rest, but overall I believe these are a good product.</li>
            <li>The wax is really good, but I am not sure it&#x27;s good for home use.</li>
            <li>I suggest heating the wax at a higher temp than what the directions suggest, the higher the temp the easier the wax spreads on the skin, just make sure you do not burn yourself.</li>
            <li>I loved this one asked a long time used all the time..</li>
            <li>Its small size is great and heats a full can of wax in about 30 mins.</li>
            <li>We ended up going with the GIGI wax warmer and that seems to be working better so far.</li>
            <li>This item is still worth buying even with the stickiness,</li>
            <li>It comes with all the tools you need to start working on your spa clients right way.</li>
            <li>This warmer is much easier to keep clean than gigi warmers.</li>
            <li>Long cord is also nice.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Overall lovely product.</li>
            <li>you can switch out waxes with no problems it heats up pretty hot to medium.</li>
            <li>High quality and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The easy pot doesn&#x27;t work after the second time</li>
            <li>This was a nice wax pot kit for the first few months.</li>
            <li>it only takes off the really fine hair.</li>
            <li>Waxing hair off my body and my friend&#x27;s body can become addicting! hahaha</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than going to a salon for waxing.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that the top (mirror finish) gets pretty warm, I&#x27;m always watching little ones to make sure they dont touch it as it may be really hot to a small child.</li>
            <li>This is my first waxing myself so it may just be that I am not doing it properly.</li>
            <li>The wax does come off easily with a little baby oil</li>
            <li>I already have one but needed  a new one, out used my old one.</li>
            <li>Professional results.  </li>
            <li>And, when I say I was itching after shaving, I literally have red scars on my lower leg from the intense scratching.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my legs feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Also my fingers get very sticky when pressing the strips down onto the skin with the hot wax on because the wax seeps through the strip.</li>
            <li>So here i go looking for a new -- a different brand also!</li>
            <li>It took me about an hour to get the box unstuck from the closet shelf, pulled out of the box, while literally destroying the box, using vegetable oil to wipe everything down, counter, side and top of the warmer, etc.  </li>
            <li>I use this every other week and its very convenient and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I use this every other week and its very convenient and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it just a few times and it stopped working, the light comes on but it would not get heated which sucks because now i have to go buy a next one.</li>
            <li> I use it for minor hair removal only.</li>
            <li> The wax will slowly but surely ooze out into everything like a hard tree resin.  </li>
            <li> I have had to start waxing as shaving during the dry winter months</li>
            <li> - buy craft popsicle sticks if using for facial hair - you can get about 1,000 sticks for a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Wax takes some time to heat up but that should be expected.</li>
            <li> so the amount of wax will probably last me a few years.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other users, it  is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and ordered this small pot to keep at my wet station.</li>
            <li> Baby oil works for me to remove the wax from skin, but I&#x27;m not sure how to remove it from other things.</li>
            <li> I got my little kit, plugged it in, and ran with it!</li>
            <li> Worst product...Waste of money and waste of time using this equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Wax doesn&#x27;t get clean properly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the hard wax to use instead of the wax provided as I don&#x27;t like the results from using wax &amp; strips combo.</li>
            <li> and it appears hard</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed I would pay the extra money and go with this one.</li>
            <li> when it is cold, do not sit it down in the warmer, put it in the box, and sit it in a closet on its side.</li>
            <li> A waste of warmer!!!!!</li>
            <li> and so it gets annoying to have to hold it up when scooping some wax out.</li>

            <li> I love this set. I bought the hard wax to use instead of the wax provided as I don&#x27;t like the results from using wax &amp; strips combo. I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;Tip - buy craft popsicle sticks if using for facial hair - you can get about 1,000 sticks for a few dollars. (bought at Michael&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t been back to the esthetician since...</li>
            <li> It was a great buy at a great price! I would purchase this item again! It has everything you need to wax!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It saves me tons of money. Shipping was fast! Would recommend it to anyone looking for a DIY wax pot.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this kit! High quality and worth every penny. I do prefer a different muslin strip but that&#x27;s easy to fix.</li>
            <li> it only takes off the really fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this before and after 10 years of lot&#x27;s of use, I needed to replace it. It was a great price for exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Amazinggggggggggggggggggg. Bought this for my mom and she&#x27;s inlove with it. Constructed great. Nice and sturdy. Overall lovely product. I would suggest if you are looking for a waxing kit at a great price,THIS IS IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this wax warmer for over 3 years now. Warmer still works perfectly. The highest setting works great for me as I have coarse hair. I continue to use Clean + Easy wax, both the original and the sensitive, and will not switch out because it melts best with this warmer.</li>
            <li> It works great. I use it to wax underarms and bikini area. I suggest heating the wax at a higher temp than what the directions suggest, the higher the temp the easier the wax spreads on the skin, just make sure you do not burn yourself. The only con to this product is that it does not come with wax remover for anything. Baby oil works for me to remove the wax from skin, but I&#x27;m not sure how to remove it from other things.</li>
            <li> this takes a skill I must not have because I get more wax on the floor and counter than on myself.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this. Used it just a few times and it stopped working, the light comes on but it would not get heated which sucks because now i have to go buy a next one. I agree with other users, it  is a bit messy. So here i go looking for a new -- a different brand also!</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home use! I like the temperature settings and it comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> Professional results.  Saving me a ton of money.  I can confidently use this myself and save all those expensive trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and ordered this small pot to keep at my wet station. Its small size is great and heats a full can of wax in about 30 mins.

            <li> It does not take any hair off.</li>
            <li> After attempting to wax those pesky hairs, this warmer doesn&#x27;t remove ANY hairs. A waste of warmer!!!!! I still have to go and pay to get waxed!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Annmarie F.&lt;br /&gt;Daytona Bch, FL.</li>
            <li> The easy pot doesn&#x27;t work after the second time I turn it on again. I have to use my stove to heat up the wax. I think using a stove is faster.</li>
            <li> It comes with all the tools you need to start working on your spa clients right way. It&#x27;s easy to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t mastered the best way to do self waxing and ripped some skin from my face first time.  I believe this product will do a great job once I get the hang of it.  Wax takes some time to heat up but that should be expected. Nice that you can adjust the temp. and have a on / off switch.  Long cord is also nice.  Great money savings when you are used to paying for weekly hair removal.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This was a nice wax pot kit for the first few months. Then it just stopped heating up and we had to return it. We ended up going with the GIGI wax warmer and that seems to be working better so far.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my sister for her birthday.  She&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and great price, thanks!</li>

You won&#x27;t be disappointed I would pay the extra money and go with this one. Also the wax heats evenly which is important.</li>
            <li> This wax kit is a great buy! I use this every other week and its very convenient and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the lid on my heater does not stay up. It keeps falling and so it gets annoying to have to hold it up when scooping some wax out. Also my fingers get very sticky when pressing the strips down onto the skin with the hot wax on because the wax seeps through the strip. Then I use those fingers to lift the lid up on the heater and before I know it, everything is sticky everywhere! The wax does come off easily with a little baby oil so its not that much of a big deal. This is my first waxing myself so it may just be that I am not doing it properly. This item is still worth buying even with the stickiness,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great , perfect for your own little personal one !</li>
            <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I had the honor to deal with you&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the goods&lt;br /&gt;Like what I expected&lt;br /&gt;And accept greetings</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. She is a Cosmotologist and she uses it all the time! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my daughter for a &amp;#34; thank you&amp;#34; she has used it and has reported back to me she is happy.</li>
            <li> The wax is really good, but I am not sure it&#x27;s good for home use. It takes a lot of time and does not work for leggs at all. I use it for minor hair removal only.</li>
            <li> Worst product...Waste of money and waste of time using this equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Wax doesn&#x27;t get clean properly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll not recommend this product..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used yet but, arrived on time and in good shape. It was boxed well and shipped in good order and arrived on time. I haven&#x27;t used it yet though.</li>
            <li> This is attractive, just the right size and heats a full pot of wax perfectly on Medium heat. I have recommended to a friend even. I have had to start waxing as shaving during the dry winter months causes my legs to itch beyond the remedy of any lotion or ointment. After I started waxing, keeping my legs itch free during the winter is a breeze.  And, when I say I was itching after shaving, I literally have red scars on my lower leg from the intense scratching.  This product leaves my legs feeling soft and hydrated. I am very very happy with this product. .....a word to the wise, even if you have the lid on the wax and it appears hard when it is cold, do not sit it down in the warmer, put it in the box, and sit it in a closet on its side. The wax will slowly but surely ooze out into everything like a hard tree resin.  It took me about an hour to get the box unstuck from the closet shelf, pulled out of the box, while literally destroying the box, using vegetable oil to wipe everything down, counter, side and top of the warmer, etc.  Just don&#x27;t do it.  Those wax containers stay UPRIGHT at all times.  You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Very convenient.  Variable temp on wax good.  Keep warm or turn off.  Included accessories good too with ample supply of wax.  I bought this for personal home use so the amount of wax will probably last me a few years.  Good quality linen and good supply of wooden applicators.  Good quality.  No complaints.  Arrived promptly.</li>
