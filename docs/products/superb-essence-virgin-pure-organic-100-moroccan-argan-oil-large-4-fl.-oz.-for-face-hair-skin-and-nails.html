            <li>so excited that I found an organic brand to</li>
            <li>oil is rich in antioxidants</li>
            <li>The presence of unsaturated fatty acids and Squalene on the Argan oil makes it&#x27;s very effective in fighting free radicals that causes skin aging.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil can cure many skin disorders</li>
            <li>-This is a great solution for dry skin.</li>

            <li>I also really like the bottle dropper as it&#x27;s super easy to drop whatever size quantity of oil you want or need in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>With the dropper you can get one or more drops to put in problem areas or squirt for larger areas.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil just feels soft and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to run across this product that can at the least if not 100% remove, but fade away from my body better than how it looks now.</li>

            <li>I really like this product for the price, quantity and quality.</li>
            <li>I do not like greasy or really smelly type oils</li>
            <li>, it helps to hold the style, you don&#x27;t need much with this brand.</li>
            <li>dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure.</li>
            <li>How do I really know what is in the bottle?</li>

            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle but it won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li>and I live in So Cal, if you&#x27;ve ever been through hot Santana conditions you know how dry the air gets.</li>
            <li>It helps freshen, soften and hydrate dry skin more than any other cosmetic products and creams.</li>

            <li>There are several things I really like about this argan oil.</li>
            <li>I started using it  on my hands and was pleasantly surprised and how soft they were at the end of the evening.</li>
            <li>My hands feel really soft now and not like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you suffer from dry skin and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Yesterday we were having an extreme Santana, windy, hot and no humidity in the air...</li>

            <li> This Moroccan Argan Oil is great for my hair! I use a few drops after washing it and it helps with the dryness from coloring it so often. I would highly recommend this oil to anyone who has dry hair or skin!</li>
            <li> Just got this today.  Tried it on my dry elbows and feet.  It absorbs nicely and I could see an immediate effect.  Am going to use it on my nails as this time of year, they dry and break so easily.  A little bit goes a long way with this product.  Great price!</li>
            <li> For a person that has some scars from my military days. I&#x27;m pleased to run across this product that can at the least if not 100% remove, but fade away from my body better than how it looks now. By it being organic places it on another level on how I view its usage.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my dry skin and psoriasis. This product is fantastic. It works great and I will be using it all the time.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a value!!! This argan oil is 100% pure and I do mean pure. I was surprised when I opened the package...very well protected from breaking during shipment AND larger than anticipated. The thickness of the argan oil deceived me...it is so silky smooth and pleasant smelling and the relief on my scalp from my ezcema was a nice surprise...so fast. I&#x27;ll be a lifetime customer of this seller and this 100% pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moroccan argan oil in my hair since the day I received it. I have long curly hair and was looking for a high quality product that was natural that I could use in my hair to make it softer, silkier and tame the frizzyness. There are several things I really like about this argan oil. The size of the bottle is perfect because most argan oils I&#x27;ve tried and seen are very small. I also really like the bottle dropper as it&#x27;s super easy to drop whatever size quantity of oil you want or need in the palm of your hand. The consistency is not greasy and it rubs really nicely in your hand. After using this product for several days in a row, my hair feels a lot softer and isn&#x27;t as frizzy. I really like this product for the price, quantity and quality.</li>
            <li> Really liked this.My hair loved it.I have exceptionally dry hair, and this helprd keep moist.Loved the dropper that came with it,helped me to not waste it.</li>
            <li> I received this product on Saturday and today is Monday. I&#x27;ve used it for three days. I love the feel of this on my skin. I love how my skin looks and feels after using this oil particularly on my face. During the winter months my skin is so dry that it just drinks in this oil. Some oils leave a greasy residue on the skin. Argan Oil just feels soft and is absorbed quickly. This is my first bottle but it won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to order this for quite some time and finally decided it was time !!  Boy am I glad I did.  Have only had my bottle for such short time, but already showing incredible results.  Using on my face, hands and feet, and my hair.  All have shown amazing changes in a such short time.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after using for 30 days.  An absolute MUST have for everyone !!!</li>
            <li> Arrived at the perfect time! I have super dry skin and I live in So Cal, if you&#x27;ve ever been through hot Santana conditions you know how dry the air gets. Yesterday we were having an extreme Santana, windy, hot and no humidity in the air...my skin was driving me crazy and my regular body lotions just weren&#x27;t doing the job. Then UPS delivers this Argon oil (I&#x27;ve never tried it before, bought it on a recommendation of a friend), I quickly opened up the box and applied the oil to my super dry skin. Awwww, what a relief, it works! I highly recommend this product if you suffer from dry skin and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had heard that Moroccan Oil was good for your skin so I thought I would try this.  I do not like greasy or really smelly type oils but this is neither.  The glass bottle is larger than I expected for the price.  With the dropper you can get one or more drops to put in problem areas or squirt for larger areas.  I&#x27;ve been using mine under my eyes where the laughing lines are not a laughing matter any more.  I also have dry elbows and hands.  This oil is quickly absorbed and you are left with a velvety feeling and not greasy.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has problem dry areas.</li>
            <li> The product does have an odor that I do not care for.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. I massage my neck and face with it and it improves the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> High Quality Moroccan Argan Oil, by far this has got to be the best stuff for giving body and strength to my hair. It makes my hair so manageable and shiny, it helps to hold the style, you don&#x27;t need much with this brand.</li>
            <li> Why is there NO emblem shown on the bottle indicating the argan oil is verified as &amp;#34;ORGANIC&amp;#34;?  &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; is mentioned on the bottle but NO OFFICIAL mark  Shirley A Little</li>
            <li> I love how this product moisturizes my hair and skin. It truly hydrates!</li>
            <li> I received my Argan Oil last week and started using it on my hands.  They are in water a lot and dry out so terribly bad with cracking and all. I started using it  on my hands and was pleasantly surprised and how soft they were at the end of the evening. It&#x27;s easy to use and leave no oily residue.  My hands feel really soft now and not like sandpaper.  I am going to try it on my hair next, as these winters and dry air do a number on it. I would definately recommend this product.</li>
