            <li>love this soap, so gentle on the body, no flaky after problems, used it for many years</li>
            <li>It is not the original scent.</li>
            <li>The scent, as admitted to me by the manufacturer, has changed from the original.  </li>
            <li>Soft means a nice, luxurious lather that you don&#x27;t have to fitght with your bar soap to get.</li>

            <li>I like it because it is bar soap, but it&#x27;s soft just like the hotel soap you use and wonder why you can&#x27;t get it for your home.</li>

            <li>She says she can remember her mother using this when she was a young child.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>

            <li> The FDA has put bar &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; manufacturers on notice that they must prove the effectiveness of the &amp;#34;anti-bacterial soaps,&amp;#34; which likely make false claims about their product&#x27;s effectiveness and safety.

It will not dry or irritate your skin like detergent bacterial soaps such as Irish Spring, Dial or others of that category. Cashmere Bouquet is mild, effective, and pleasantly fragrant. It will leave your skin soft and sweet. That&#x27;s why our grandma&#x27;s all had it in their houses! Sadly, according to Colgate-Palmolive, it is under LIMITED PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. Big Lots Stores no longer carry it. You&#x27;ll never find it in a drug store. Walgreens sells it online only. And of course, YOU CAN STILL GET IT ON AMAZON! Stock up! My suspicion is that Colgate-Palmolive will slowly and quietly discontinue this product with no announcement. Once it is gone, it will be sorely missed, just like our grandmas...</li>
            <li> I have no idea why this isn&#x27;t the Number One soap sold today. Every year it&#x27;s available in fewer retail outlets. I like it because it is bar soap, but it&#x27;s soft just like the hotel soap you use and wonder why you can&#x27;t get it for your home. Soft means a nice, luxurious lather that you don&#x27;t have to fitght with your bar soap to get. Yes, it means the bar will be used up faster but it&#x27;s not an expensive soap so that&#x27;s not a valid issue with me. If you&#x27;ve never tried it, I recommend just trying it once.</li>
            <li> It is not the original scent. I have several bars of the original and the difference in scent is noticeable. Smells like there is something missing. Maybe the company changed or omitted ingredients.</li>
            <li> love this soap, so gentle on the body, no flaky after problems, used it for many years</li>
            <li> Unable to find this product In big box or grocery stores, i turned to amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent body bath product at a great price. If you have sensitive skin issues, this is the go to bath product.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this soap and not found in stores...</li>
            <li> I love this. It reminds me of my grandma. She says she can remember her mother using this when she was a young child.&lt;br /&gt;Good product with a mild floral scent.</li>
            <li> I always loved the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, used as a kid and found some in an Amish store, When I ran out Amazon came thru agin</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It&#x27;s soft and gentle to use on my face and in bath.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores so I&#x27;m glad I can find it on Amazon whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> Got just what I wanted!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best soap ever! So glad we found it online.&lt;br /&gt;We are clean and happy people.</li>
            <li> My MOTHER bathed us in this soap when we were kids.  I find I am not allergic to it as I am the fragrances of most soaps.  Good, Mild bath soap.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my old folks they were satisfied. Best price i could find even better than ebay.</li>
            <li> This soap says &amp;#34;classic fragrance.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s not.  Packaging is decieving.  The scent, as admitted to me by the manufacturer, has changed from the original.  I found it to be much too strong.  Not subtle as the original.  Seller however, Drugstore LA, was extremely honest and understanding, and refunded my money.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering English Lavender but instead ordered this instead.  I hate the smell of it and I guess&lt;br /&gt;I will have to donate it.  Next time I will be more careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RB</li>
            <li> It is not the original scent !!!! A disappointment !!!!!</li>
