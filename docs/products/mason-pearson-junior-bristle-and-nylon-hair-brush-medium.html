    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It also does the best job of distributing hair oils all the way to the end of your hair shaft.  </li>
            <li>hair is of medium thickens, wavy and shoulder length--this brush is perfect for them.</li>
            <li>It is the best brush for mom to feel polished.  </li>
            <li>Best Regards, Kevin Soufer, Sales Manager        </li>
            <li>This brush is wonderful for distributing oil along the strands.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the perfect model for her.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful brush.  </li>
            <li>We have tried all of the &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; brushes, detanglers( which leaves her hair oily looking) and me ripping through her hair and have found this brush to be the best thing out there.</li>
            <li>Best invesent for my hair!😘</li>
            <li>This is a great brush that will glide over and through your hair, no matter how tangled or snarly it is!  </li>

            <li>OUTSTANDING PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I have a \\&quot;knockoff\\&quot;&#x27;nylon and bristle brush that I have been quite satisfied with - until today!  </li>
            <li>I tried this brush on my daughter&#x27;s hair and love it!  </li>
            <li>I love my Mason Pearson and you will too!</li>
            <li>Super good!</li>
            <li>This brush makes great sleek and smooth pony tails.</li>
            <li>It looks spectacular on my beauty table.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the best tool to gently remove cradle cap, it did not hurt, it worked in combination with a week of MD prescribed head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Every woman should own a mason pearson.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser friend has even commented on how shiny and good condition my hair is in, and she too has now bought the brush  for her self because of my transformation ( and she also loves it)&lt;br /&gt;The biggest and most noticeable difference</li>
            <li>also purchased the detangler comb from Mason Pearson and its a nice companion product for in the shower.</li>
            <li>I still own that brush and 5 or so replacements.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could have gotten the Handy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of scratchy too.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li>It was fast delivery and awesome purchase!</li>
            <li>It also keeps your hair nice, without breaking it off.</li>
            <li>Bought her her own</li>
            <li>and she is thrilled.</li>
            <li>It is a nice brush, but it is way overpriced.  </li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m sure this brush is a great one for many people.</li>
            <li>This is when i contacted Mason Pearson again and with the information they provided, i checked out the brush, kindly provided to me from the Amazon seller in question.</li>
            <li>She loves it, and now never mind doing her own hair.  </li>
            <li>brush comes with a cleaning brush, which is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for handling and my hair comes out straight smooth and shinning.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush!</li>
            <li>love this brush</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone, with appropriate hair-type.</li>
            <li>im a hairdresser and have had my personal brush for over 15years and is still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>its mostly uniform now</li>
            <li>look \\&quot; because that was simply the best it could be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping the brush and to tell you the truth my hair looks ok</li>
            <li>This was one of the best birthday presents I ever asked for and it totally has exceeded my expectations about the difference a hair brush can make.  </li>
            <li>Is there a better brush?</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>GREAT BRUSH &amp; FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
            <li>Love this!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>Mason Pearson brush for many years.  </li>
            <li>The brush is lovely to look at</li>
            <li>This seller is trying to get the most money out of its customers.</li>
            <li>so it looks/feels more like a paddle brush.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if all sellers on Amazon are selling authentic brushes</li>
            <li>wish I had not because that darn brush was never even able to penetrate my hair and reach scalp.</li>
            <li>Love this brush...</li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist and have used many brushes during my carrer.</li>
            <li>Great high quality brush.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny And heAlthy looking!</li>
            <li>It is the best brish for long toddler hair for untangling.</li>
            <li>The two levels of the brush (longer plastic and shorter &#x27;hair-like&#x27;) do the trick and smooth the hair - definitely the best brush I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;ve tried over 10!  </li>
            <li>The nylon bristles reach through to the scalp while the boar bristles smooth the top layer of hair.</li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t love cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice brush, my hair feels good afterward, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special to me, in fact it look cheap or to my hair, but you have to try to make yourself better, but there are better ways to  put shine in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of any other changes that I&#x27;ve made that would result in the wonderfully silky feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>this is one of the products that can easily pass that test.</li>
            <li>I appreciate good craftsmanship and quality, but the price for this item is too high.  </li>
            <li>, it is a cost, if you have the money, splurge, if not, you will be fine without it...</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s not quite), but anyone I&#x27;ve let borrow it (for a quick brushing) has been just as in love as I</li>
            <li>It takes tangles out quickly!</li>
            <li>My friend (who has some of the most beautiful shiny long hair I&#x27;ve ever seen) said she&#x27;s basically had the brush since she was a girl and had no idea that it was anything special, it&#x27;s just all she ever used.</li>
            <li>My hair is so solft to touch with lots of shine and a huge improvement in my knotted curls underneath.</li>
            <li>It glides through your hair, leaving it tangle free.</li>
            <li>I was given this brush as a present 40 years ago and it is still in great shape.</li>
            <li>Anyone spending 150-200$ on a brush deserves to know they own an authentic product and at the same time be able to take advantage of the discounts provided by sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Now I am spending this brush cost + cheap brush cost...</li>
            <li>&quot; do your research to take sure you are receiving the real thing from a reputable Amazon dealer before you</li>
            <li>For some reason, this brush produces a lot of static when I brush dry hair (not the case with Fekkai&#x27;s brush)...it does work beautifully after taking a shower, but is 100 bucks worth it?</li>
            <li>I own a Phillips light touch brush that is decent quality and quite inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Strong brush that is the best for thick hair.</li>
            <li>(original review is below)</li>
            <li>I noticed that the one of the top reviewers says that the brush is a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; the brush that I purchased is NOT a fake</li>
            <li>she let me use the brush all weekend and must have thought I was a freak for how excited I was at the opportunity to try it.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not that original brush is still functional but has lost some of its performance.  </li>
            <li>I originally read about this brush in a fashion magazine.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment!</li>
            <li>This brush felt so good on my scalp and went so smoothly through the hair; I was amazed at how different it feels than any drugstore brush ever has!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price, is easy to keep clean, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Maybe not but it&#x27;s a tried and true brand.</li>
            <li>This brush is my absolute favorite, this is a well deserved, favorable review.</li>
            <li>when your trying something new and are really LOOKING for those good results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Iwould say that for those who are on a tight budget but want/need to care for their hair better, the MM brush is a good alternative at $39.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a nice purchase for someone that has a head full of unmanageable hair and really doesn&#x27;t need much else.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon and my hair stylist said I was lucky to get it.</li>
            <li>My new favorite is brush is the ibiza in the G series.**&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE my new Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li>From the first stroke through my hair, I was so  in awe!  </li>
            <li>Helps hair dry faster and leaves it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Which sometimes means less bristles per tuft but usable, or more bristles per tuft but not so effective when brushing as a Mason Pearson hairbrush should be.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair and am losing my pregnancy hair.  </li>
            <li>we may only have available to us the best bristle that is slightly finer (but</li>
            <li>we may only have available to us the best bristle that is slightly finer (but</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t prove this, but I believe that continued use of the brush sets up healthy oil distribution and allows for all of the hair to be evenly (and naturally conditioned)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a splurge, but worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price .</li>
            <li>I have many brushes, and none of them are anywhere near the price of this brush.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the box I smelled a chemical smell; a smell distinctly absent from the Mason Pearson brush.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>at first glance the plastic on the handle seems almost black, but when you hold it up against light, it glows a wonderful deep ruby</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Although my small one will be great to throw in my bag, this one did not irritate my scalp at all.</li>
            <li>but they last forever and are kind to your hair and scalp, real quality, something worth what you pay for it</li>
            <li>If I should ever loose this brush I wouldnt hesitate to buy it again, it is really that good.</li>
            <li>And I have to say that the Spornette brushes really hurt my scalp while the Mason Pearson feels absolutely heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and thanks Mason Pearson !!😍</li>
            <li>The Mason Pearson came with detailed care instructions and a smaller brush to clean the hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that the true benefits the brush had to offer took a little time but after a year are undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My first thought was it is too expenses.  </li>
            <li>I have a similar brush that I purchased from a reputable dealer and then   I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>I reviewed this brush when I first bought it over a year ago and would like to give my update after continued use for one year as I get questions about this periodically from buyers here on amazon.  </li>
            <li>My hair has not been this soft and silky smooth since I was a kid.</li>
            <li>I would love to have a smaller one for my purse.</li>
            <li>I HAD READ SEVERAL REVIEWS AND WATCHED MANY VIDEOS REGARDING THE MASON PEARSON BRUSHES, ALL OF WHICH WERE FAVORABLE.</li>
            <li>First time I tried this brush I was in awe.  </li>
            <li>Can a brush really make hair feel silky?!  </li>
            <li>However, the FIRST time I pulled this brush through my hair, I felt a difference.  </li>
            <li>The MM brush lost a bristle the first time I used it and has lost a couple of bristles since.  </li>
            <li>Another drastic check, and this is really not necessary, is to take out the top of the pad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for any normal human being (if you have a pixie cut or hair down to the floor</li>
            <li>(maybe good for super thick hair)  </li>
            <li>Even on very tangled hair - I have no pain just brushing right</li>
            <li>I love the brush, I no longer have to use a flat iron if I do not want to.....</li>
            <li>Nothing like the other Mason Pearson brush I own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The extra boar hairs really did glide through my hair with greater ease and kept it shinier.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s jot worth the high price.</li>
            <li>Ok, I guess I used it for too long.</li>
            <li>while the top half of my hair has a tendency to get super oily in just a day.</li>
            <li>My hair also used to have a tendency to get oily on top in a day or two while the bottom stayed dry and that is no  longer the case.</li>
            <li>Because of the changing nature of the raw materials we use (possibly an evolving nature) &amp; often due to the country of origin, we have to be prepared to use the best bristle available at the time to do the work required of it.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish there was more advertisement  about these kind of products that work instead of all those silly hair styling</li>
            <li>wood is very luxurious with a shiny finish, the handle is very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also works well for gently brushing out the surface layer after teasing hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored and highlighted and after brushing with the copy cat - my hair just looks frosted or all the same light color.</li>
            <li>but really don&#x27;t get the hype.</li>
            <li>Just started wearing my wavy hair in a straight style and this brush makes the difference.</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t make my hair straight either.</li>
            <li>I received the brush much quicker than the promised delivery date.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your reply and to end the confusion in my head.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li>though it - no need to gently separate knots in sections.</li>
            <li>Bristles are combo of nylon &amp; boar which control hair very well...</li>
            <li>I am a male with a full head of fine hair which I keep relatively short.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>What is more I accidentally got this brush wet (dropped into a bathtub!</li>
            <li>I contacted Mason Pearson and asked if they were familiar with this type of reaction, and for a possible return of the brush.      </li>
            <li>I was excited when I read all of the reviews, and when I got it, the package is very european, I was excited to open the package.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely an extravagant amount of money to spend on a brush, but I know this brush will last my lifetime and recommend it to anyone willing and able to splurge for beauty.</li>
            <li>with this brush my scalp gets a proper message and helps keep my scalp clean.</li>
            <li>, Junior size is just fine for my long hair.</li>
            <li>(I went and read which brushes to use for which types of hair, I have a pretty sensitive scalp).</li>
            <li>This will be passed down to her someday.. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Been using one I got for my birthday over 40 years ago and decided it was time for a new one!  </li>
            <li>but my little Pocket will serve me just fine!  </li>
            <li>I often brush my hair before I sleep as well, but brushing after the shower is the main thing ( I would never have thought to do this myself) but my friend who owned the brush that inspired me (review below) said that thats all she ever did</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews of this brush over the years, thought about buying one on several ocasions, but in the end, like many reviewers, I just couldn&#x27;t justify the cost for something as simple as a hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particularly disapointed as their response is contradictory to Mason Pearson&#x27;s image as a long-standing quality product.</li>
            <li>I was very excited and gave my hair a thorough brushing, only to have my scalp itch for a solid 30 minutes afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve outlined a general guide below-(this was for my large pure boar bristle hairbrush, model B1)-&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>All I really do is use the brush to smooth out my hair after I towel drying from the shower every other day.</li>
            <li>On the other hand- after using the MP - my highlights are all right there and really shiney !!</li>
            <li>Seriously you... that girl that doesn&#x27;t spend money willy-nilly and isn&#x27;t sure if this brush is worth it?</li>
            <li>Also I find the material used to make the brush to be rather cheap feeling and looking, nothing like I expected when I paid $100 for a brush.  </li>
            <li>but i believe this general guide can help customers interested in owning a Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li>love the combination of two bristle types: the long ones are nylon and the short ones are boar.</li>
            <li>We are sorry but not being able to see your hair type and/or scalp makes an answer to your question very defficult if not impossible.  </li>
            <li>Yes it is expensive but it does not pull or break hair and is one of the best values for the money I have ever spent in my life.  </li>
            <li>No amount of trimming, conditioner or product has ever worked to balance or soften it, and the only way I could get uniformly smooth hair was to use a flat iron and even then it lacked sheen.  </li>
            <li>The Junior is better and not, as the name would indicate, smaller than the other MP brushes.</li>
            <li>It was time to replace the one I bought years ago - not sure how many years.</li>
            <li>It actually seemed to make an immediate difference in the texture of my hair (smoother) and it that was also the first day</li>
            <li>The reviews were positive on Amazon, so I splurged and bought the brush as I&#x27;ve never really found a brush that was compatible with my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I probably haven&#x27;t given it enough time to make a definite decision, so, I will make an effort to use it more frequently and revise my comments later.</li>
            <li>I also compared it with an older brush i had, which was bought directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the quality of both the brushes was absolutely the same.</li>
            <li>we can use more per tuft, (as was possibly the case with your previous hairbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>we can use more per tuft, (as was possibly the case with your previous hairbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My MP brush is soft and gentle and goes through my thick hair easily.  </li>
            <li>The size is called \\&quot;medium\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s plenty large enough for all but the longest locks.</li>
            <li>In ~a year and a half the brush has not sustained any significant damage.</li>
            <li>but I want to clearly state that this review is for the Mason Pearson Brush itself, and not for the \\&quot;seller of the brush\\</li>
            <li>The smell of singed hair would be clear or a plastic chemical odour would be the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li>The natural bristles distribute scalp oils throughout the hair-shaft allowing for optimal conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My friends jokingly call it my hundred dollar hairbrush, which isn&#x27;t far from the truth.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS SILKY AND SOFT TO THE TOUCH.  </li>
            <li>AS THE BRUSH DOES DISTRIBUTE THE NATURAL OILS OF THE HAIR EVENLY.</li>
            <li>Or maybe my scalp is exremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural curly.</li>
            <li>After brushing, there are far fewer hairs in my brush than I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and I have had my oldest one for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li>The handle does not fit comfortably into my hand either.  </li>
            <li>The MM brush feels much the same on the scalp as the Mason Pearson (divine).  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li>(strait on top with knotted curls on the underside) excessively bleached, very thin,fragile, dull and exceeding dry on the ends (think fuzzy static)</li>
            <li>Then I thought about how long I have had my current hair brush and thought if you divide the cost of years it could be worth it.  </li>
            <li>The difference is immediate and profound.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra large MM brush (they only have two sizes available - extra large and small) is about 1/2\\&quot; wider than the Mason Pearson Junior</li>
            <li>The same packaging, the same good quality hard plastic,the same rubber pad etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used by my NYC high end hair dresser, I had to get one because my hair never looked the same at home.  </li>
            <li>I just bought a new one from an outside retailer.</li>
            <li>I use it to blow dry my girls hair too and it makes their hair really shine</li>
            <li>There are no more issues with tears, tangles, &amp; messy hair because she loves to brush it now with this amazing brush.  </li>
            <li>brush does not have the same feel as the two old ones.  </li>
            <li>They were right, and I wasted a lot of money to find that out.</li>
            <li>As a thrifty adult, I have purchased similar brushes, thinking they would be the same - they are not.</li>
            <li>I had earlier ordered a cheap brush($20) from amazon...because I was skeptical to spend so much money on a brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I no longer have the trouble with the frizziness that I have had in the past and my hair loos and feels better than it has in 20 years.</li>
            <li>My once dry bleachy hair is now continuous shiny and soft blonde.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It also does the best job of distributing hair oils all the way to the end of your hair shaft.  </li>
            <li> hair is of medium thickens, wavy and shoulder length--this brush is perfect for them.</li>
            <li> It is the best brush for mom to feel polished.  </li>
            <li> Best Regards, Kevin Soufer, Sales Manager        </li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful for distributing oil along the strands.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the perfect model for her.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful brush.  </li>
            <li> We have tried all of the &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; brushes, detanglers( which leaves her hair oily looking) and me ripping through her hair and have found this brush to be the best thing out there.</li>

            <li> OUTSTANDING PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;knockoff\\&quot;&#x27;nylon and bristle brush that I have been quite satisfied with - until today!  </li>
            <li> I tried this brush on my daughter&#x27;s hair and love it!  </li>
            <li> I love my Mason Pearson and you will too!</li>
            <li> Super good!</li>
            <li> This brush makes great sleek and smooth pony tails.</li>
            <li> It looks spectacular on my beauty table.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the best tool to gently remove cradle cap, it did not hurt, it worked in combination with a week of MD prescribed head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Every woman should own a mason pearson.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser friend has even commented on how shiny and good condition my hair is in, and she too has now bought the brush  for her self because of my transformation ( and she also loves it)&lt;br /&gt;The biggest and most noticeable difference</li>
            <li> also purchased the detangler comb from Mason Pearson and its a nice companion product for in the shower.</li>
            <li> I still own that brush and 5 or so replacements.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could have gotten the Handy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of scratchy too.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li> It was fast delivery and awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> It also keeps your hair nice, without breaking it off.</li>
            <li> Bought her her own</li>
            <li> and she is thrilled.</li>
            <li> It is a nice brush, but it is way overpriced.  </li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m sure this brush is a great one for many people.</li>
            <li> This is when i contacted Mason Pearson again and with the information they provided, i checked out the brush, kindly provided to me from the Amazon seller in question.</li>
            <li> She loves it, and now never mind doing her own hair.  </li>
            <li> brush comes with a cleaning brush, which is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for handling and my hair comes out straight smooth and shinning.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush!</li>
            <li> love this brush</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone, with appropriate hair-type.</li>
            <li> im a hairdresser and have had my personal brush for over 15years and is still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> its mostly uniform now</li>
            <li> look \\&quot; because that was simply the best it could be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping the brush and to tell you the truth my hair looks ok</li>
            <li> This was one of the best birthday presents I ever asked for and it totally has exceeded my expectations about the difference a hair brush can make.  </li>
            <li> Is there a better brush?</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> GREAT BRUSH &amp; FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
            <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Mason Pearson brush for many years.  </li>
            <li> The brush is lovely to look at</li>
            <li> This seller is trying to get the most money out of its customers.</li>
            <li> so it looks/feels more like a paddle brush.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if all sellers on Amazon are selling authentic brushes</li>
            <li> wish I had not because that darn brush was never even able to penetrate my hair and reach scalp.</li>
            <li> Love this brush...</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and have used many brushes during my carrer.</li>
            <li> Great high quality brush.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny And heAlthy looking!</li>
            <li> It is the best brish for long toddler hair for untangling.</li>
            <li> The two levels of the brush (longer plastic and shorter &#x27;hair-like&#x27;) do the trick and smooth the hair - definitely the best brush I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;ve tried over 10!  </li>
            <li> The nylon bristles reach through to the scalp while the boar bristles smooth the top layer of hair.</li>
            <li> That said, I don&#x27;t love cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice brush, my hair feels good afterward, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special to me, in fact it look cheap or to my hair, but you have to try to make yourself better, but there are better ways to  put shine in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any other changes that I&#x27;ve made that would result in the wonderfully silky feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> this is one of the products that can easily pass that test.</li>
            <li> I appreciate good craftsmanship and quality, but the price for this item is too high.  </li>
            <li> , it is a cost, if you have the money, splurge, if not, you will be fine without it...</li>
            <li> I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s not quite), but anyone I&#x27;ve let borrow it (for a quick brushing) has been just as in love as I</li>
            <li> It takes tangles out quickly!</li>
            <li> My friend (who has some of the most beautiful shiny long hair I&#x27;ve ever seen) said she&#x27;s basically had the brush since she was a girl and had no idea that it was anything special, it&#x27;s just all she ever used.</li>
            <li> My hair is so solft to touch with lots of shine and a huge improvement in my knotted curls underneath.</li>
            <li> It glides through your hair, leaving it tangle free.</li>
            <li> I was given this brush as a present 40 years ago and it is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> Anyone spending 150-200$ on a brush deserves to know they own an authentic product and at the same time be able to take advantage of the discounts provided by sellers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Now I am spending this brush cost + cheap brush cost...</li>
            <li> &quot; do your research to take sure you are receiving the real thing from a reputable Amazon dealer before you</li>
            <li> For some reason, this brush produces a lot of static when I brush dry hair (not the case with Fekkai&#x27;s brush)...it does work beautifully after taking a shower, but is 100 bucks worth it?</li>
            <li> I own a Phillips light touch brush that is decent quality and quite inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Strong brush that is the best for thick hair.</li>
            <li> (original review is below)</li>
            <li> I noticed that the one of the top reviewers says that the brush is a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; the brush that I purchased is NOT a fake</li>
            <li> she let me use the brush all weekend and must have thought I was a freak for how excited I was at the opportunity to try it.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not that original brush is still functional but has lost some of its performance.  </li>
            <li> I originally read about this brush in a fashion magazine.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment!</li>
            <li> This brush felt so good on my scalp and went so smoothly through the hair; I was amazed at how different it feels than any drugstore brush ever has!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price, is easy to keep clean, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Maybe not but it&#x27;s a tried and true brand.</li>
            <li> This brush is my absolute favorite, this is a well deserved, favorable review.</li>
            <li> when your trying something new and are really LOOKING for those good results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Iwould say that for those who are on a tight budget but want/need to care for their hair better, the MM brush is a good alternative at $39.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a nice purchase for someone that has a head full of unmanageable hair and really doesn&#x27;t need much else.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon and my hair stylist said I was lucky to get it.</li>
            <li> My new favorite is brush is the ibiza in the G series.**&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my new Mason Pearson.</li>
            <li> From the first stroke through my hair, I was so  in awe!  </li>
            <li> Helps hair dry faster and leaves it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Which sometimes means less bristles per tuft but usable, or more bristles per tuft but not so effective when brushing as a Mason Pearson hairbrush should be.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair and am losing my pregnancy hair.  </li>
            <li> we may only have available to us the best bristle that is slightly finer (but</li>
            <li> we may only have available to us the best bristle that is slightly finer (but</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t prove this, but I believe that continued use of the brush sets up healthy oil distribution and allows for all of the hair to be evenly (and naturally conditioned)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a splurge, but worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price .</li>
            <li> I have many brushes, and none of them are anywhere near the price of this brush.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the box I smelled a chemical smell; a smell distinctly absent from the Mason Pearson brush.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> at first glance the plastic on the handle seems almost black, but when you hold it up against light, it glows a wonderful deep ruby</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> Although my small one will be great to throw in my bag, this one did not irritate my scalp at all.</li>
            <li> but they last forever and are kind to your hair and scalp, real quality, something worth what you pay for it</li>
            <li> If I should ever loose this brush I wouldnt hesitate to buy it again, it is really that good.</li>
            <li> And I have to say that the Spornette brushes really hurt my scalp while the Mason Pearson feels absolutely heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and thanks Mason Pearson !!😍</li>
            <li> The Mason Pearson came with detailed care instructions and a smaller brush to clean the hairbrush.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that the true benefits the brush had to offer took a little time but after a year are undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My first thought was it is too expenses.  </li>
            <li> I have a similar brush that I purchased from a reputable dealer and then   I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this brush when I first bought it over a year ago and would like to give my update after continued use for one year as I get questions about this periodically from buyers here on amazon.  </li>
            <li> My hair has not been this soft and silky smooth since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> I would love to have a smaller one for my purse.</li>
            <li> I HAD READ SEVERAL REVIEWS AND WATCHED MANY VIDEOS REGARDING THE MASON PEARSON BRUSHES, ALL OF WHICH WERE FAVORABLE.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this brush I was in awe.  </li>
            <li> Can a brush really make hair feel silky?!  </li>
            <li> However, the FIRST time I pulled this brush through my hair, I felt a difference.  </li>
            <li> The MM brush lost a bristle the first time I used it and has lost a couple of bristles since.  </li>
            <li> Another drastic check, and this is really not necessary, is to take out the top of the pad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size for any normal human being (if you have a pixie cut or hair down to the floor</li>
            <li> (maybe good for super thick hair)  </li>
            <li> Even on very tangled hair - I have no pain just brushing right</li>
            <li> I love the brush, I no longer have to use a flat iron if I do not want to.....</li>
            <li> Nothing like the other Mason Pearson brush I own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The extra boar hairs really did glide through my hair with greater ease and kept it shinier.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s jot worth the high price.</li>
            <li> Ok, I guess I used it for too long.</li>
            <li> while the top half of my hair has a tendency to get super oily in just a day.</li>
            <li> My hair also used to have a tendency to get oily on top in a day or two while the bottom stayed dry and that is no  longer the case.</li>
            <li> Because of the changing nature of the raw materials we use (possibly an evolving nature) &amp; often due to the country of origin, we have to be prepared to use the best bristle available at the time to do the work required of it.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish there was more advertisement  about these kind of products that work instead of all those silly hair styling</li>
            <li> wood is very luxurious with a shiny finish, the handle is very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also works well for gently brushing out the surface layer after teasing hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and highlighted and after brushing with the copy cat - my hair just looks frosted or all the same light color.</li>
            <li> but really don&#x27;t get the hype.</li>
            <li> Just started wearing my wavy hair in a straight style and this brush makes the difference.</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t make my hair straight either.</li>
            <li> I received the brush much quicker than the promised delivery date.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for your reply and to end the confusion in my head.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> though it - no need to gently separate knots in sections.</li>
            <li> Bristles are combo of nylon &amp; boar which control hair very well...</li>
            <li> I am a male with a full head of fine hair which I keep relatively short.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> What is more I accidentally got this brush wet (dropped into a bathtub!</li>
            <li> I contacted Mason Pearson and asked if they were familiar with this type of reaction, and for a possible return of the brush.      </li>
            <li> I was excited when I read all of the reviews, and when I got it, the package is very european, I was excited to open the package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely an extravagant amount of money to spend on a brush, but I know this brush will last my lifetime and recommend it to anyone willing and able to splurge for beauty.</li>
            <li> with this brush my scalp gets a proper message and helps keep my scalp clean.</li>
            <li> , Junior size is just fine for my long hair.</li>
            <li> (I went and read which brushes to use for which types of hair, I have a pretty sensitive scalp).</li>
            <li> This will be passed down to her someday.. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Been using one I got for my birthday over 40 years ago and decided it was time for a new one!  </li>
            <li> but my little Pocket will serve me just fine!  </li>
            <li> I often brush my hair before I sleep as well, but brushing after the shower is the main thing ( I would never have thought to do this myself) but my friend who owned the brush that inspired me (review below) said that thats all she ever did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews of this brush over the years, thought about buying one on several ocasions, but in the end, like many reviewers, I just couldn&#x27;t justify the cost for something as simple as a hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particularly disapointed as their response is contradictory to Mason Pearson&#x27;s image as a long-standing quality product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited and gave my hair a thorough brushing, only to have my scalp itch for a solid 30 minutes afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve outlined a general guide below-(this was for my large pure boar bristle hairbrush, model B1)-&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> All I really do is use the brush to smooth out my hair after I towel drying from the shower every other day.</li>
            <li> On the other hand- after using the MP - my highlights are all right there and really shiney !!</li>
            <li> Seriously you... that girl that doesn&#x27;t spend money willy-nilly and isn&#x27;t sure if this brush is worth it?</li>
            <li> Also I find the material used to make the brush to be rather cheap feeling and looking, nothing like I expected when I paid $100 for a brush.  </li>
            <li> but i believe this general guide can help customers interested in owning a Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li> love the combination of two bristle types: the long ones are nylon and the short ones are boar.</li>
            <li> We are sorry but not being able to see your hair type and/or scalp makes an answer to your question very defficult if not impossible.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive but it does not pull or break hair and is one of the best values for the money I have ever spent in my life.  </li>
            <li> No amount of trimming, conditioner or product has ever worked to balance or soften it, and the only way I could get uniformly smooth hair was to use a flat iron and even then it lacked sheen.  </li>
            <li> The Junior is better and not, as the name would indicate, smaller than the other MP brushes.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace the one I bought years ago - not sure how many years.</li>
            <li> It actually seemed to make an immediate difference in the texture of my hair (smoother) and it that was also the first day</li>
            <li> The reviews were positive on Amazon, so I splurged and bought the brush as I&#x27;ve never really found a brush that was compatible with my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I probably haven&#x27;t given it enough time to make a definite decision, so, I will make an effort to use it more frequently and revise my comments later.</li>
            <li> I also compared it with an older brush i had, which was bought directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the quality of both the brushes was absolutely the same.</li>
            <li> we can use more per tuft, (as was possibly the case with your previous hairbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> we can use more per tuft, (as was possibly the case with your previous hairbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My MP brush is soft and gentle and goes through my thick hair easily.  </li>
            <li> The size is called \\&quot;medium\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s plenty large enough for all but the longest locks.</li>
            <li> In ~a year and a half the brush has not sustained any significant damage.</li>
            <li> but I want to clearly state that this review is for the Mason Pearson Brush itself, and not for the \\&quot;seller of the brush\\</li>
            <li> The smell of singed hair would be clear or a plastic chemical odour would be the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li> The natural bristles distribute scalp oils throughout the hair-shaft allowing for optimal conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friends jokingly call it my hundred dollar hairbrush, which isn&#x27;t far from the truth.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS SILKY AND SOFT TO THE TOUCH.  </li>
            <li> AS THE BRUSH DOES DISTRIBUTE THE NATURAL OILS OF THE HAIR EVENLY.</li>
            <li> Or maybe my scalp is exremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural curly.</li>
            <li> After brushing, there are far fewer hairs in my brush than I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and I have had my oldest one for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The handle does not fit comfortably into my hand either.  </li>
            <li> The MM brush feels much the same on the scalp as the Mason Pearson (divine).  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li> (strait on top with knotted curls on the underside) excessively bleached, very thin,fragile, dull and exceeding dry on the ends (think fuzzy static)</li>
            <li> Then I thought about how long I have had my current hair brush and thought if you divide the cost of years it could be worth it.  </li>
            <li> The difference is immediate and profound.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra large MM brush (they only have two sizes available - extra large and small) is about 1/2\\&quot; wider than the Mason Pearson Junior</li>
            <li> The same packaging, the same good quality hard plastic,the same rubber pad etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used by my NYC high end hair dresser, I had to get one because my hair never looked the same at home.  </li>
            <li> I just bought a new one from an outside retailer.</li>
            <li> I use it to blow dry my girls hair too and it makes their hair really shine</li>
            <li> There are no more issues with tears, tangles, &amp; messy hair because she loves to brush it now with this amazing brush.  </li>
            <li> brush does not have the same feel as the two old ones.  </li>
            <li> They were right, and I wasted a lot of money to find that out.</li>
            <li> As a thrifty adult, I have purchased similar brushes, thinking they would be the same - they are not.</li>
            <li> I had earlier ordered a cheap brush($20) from amazon...because I was skeptical to spend so much money on a brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I no longer have the trouble with the frizziness that I have had in the past and my hair loos and feels better than it has in 20 years.</li>
            <li> My once dry bleachy hair is now continuous shiny and soft blonde.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for a few months and I really do not think it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> (I bought the junior with mixed boar and nylon bristles) and have been using my new brush at home for a few nights.</li>
            <li> My first MP Junior was purchased in the late 1970&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> May be beneficial to long hair, but I have short hair that gets cut every 6 weeks</li>
            <li> my flat iron Mason brush has replaced you</li>
            <li> I received my MP Pocket today - after a very long time trying to justify such a purchase.</li>
            <li> when I burshed my hair about 20 mins at the first time, my scalp got really itchy and red which almost drove me crazy.</li>
            <li> but my hairdresser uses hers all day long..</li>
            <li> It glides through my long hair and meets all my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I think it will not work as well on thick and very curly</li>
            <li> ) When you squeeze down on the brush you should hear it whistle or wheeze as the air flows out of the cushion and the cushion should bounce back at the same speed.&lt;br /&gt;6)</li>
            <li> Why does there seem to be less boar bristles present on the mixed brushes you are selling?  </li>
            <li> know that there are other brushes made in this same style that are out there</li>
            <li> So buy it, brush/blow dry and save your self some time...</li>
            <li> Hoping it was a fluke, I tried again the next few days with the same result.  </li>
            <li> but I know that I would never live without this brush after what its done for my hair.</li>
            <li> I had hoped Mason Pearson would stand behind their product, particularly if this is such a \\&quot;rare\\&quot; reaction to their brush.  </li>
            <li> she brushes her hair out at night before bed and and also runs the brush through her wet hair after the shower and lets it dry</li>
            <li> They did not refund all my money to me but only half because they claimed I had used the brush</li>
            <li> Although it is expensive, I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It is much harder, too</li>
            <li> This brush delivers what it promises, although expensive, was worth it.</li>
            <li> I usually just let it air dry while I sleep because any amount of movement (or god forbid a hair dryer) and i was back to looking like medusa again.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s because the Bass had little balls on the end of the nylon bristles which (I never knew until recently) were pulling and breaking my hair and this one does not.  </li>
            <li> : Here is the reply to my letter, from the Mason Pearson company direct in England,  they are using less boar bristle!!!  </li>
            <li> everything and not one of them even touched the dry, brittle mess that was my hair.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and they recommended this brush due to the quantity of hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not!</li>
            <li> I can bet my life that this brush is different from the past two I owned</li>
            <li> Rather than compromise the quality of our hairbrushes we have chosen at this time to use the stiffer bristle but less of them per tuft to get the results that are expected from a Mason Pearson hairbrush.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit nicer than the average brush</li>
            <li> The brush is not like before and not worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HAVE THICK COARSE HAIR AND AFTER USING THE BRUSH</li>
            <li> However, I have to say that for years I&#x27;ve been using a combination boar bristle/nylon brush from Bass and</li>
            <li> AS YOU MUST RUN THE BRUSH FROM THE SCALP DOWN TO THE ENDS.</li>
            <li> Its not real!!</li>
            <li> so there is less drying and damage.</li>
            <li> and I cant say if they would give you the results for less money (maybe they do?)</li>
            <li> This brush seems to have less boar bristles then my brushes I bought in the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Junior size is less bulky &amp; easier to use than full-sized brush...</li>
            <li> My wife has long thick hair and will use my brush in a jam</li>
            <li> I was a little bit caution on using it with blow dryer</li>
            <li> I wish the handle was little longer though...</li>
            <li> the way, I also purchased the MM small brush and that is probably less than half the size of the MP Junior.  </li>
            <li> bush has literally transformed my hair in a few days...</li>
            <li> Ive purchased round brushes, boar bristle, nylon..</li>
            <li> My hairdresser believes I have some reaction to the boar bristles in the brush, which is odd as I have never been allergic to anything!      </li>
            <li> A drastic check is to pull out a small piece of the black bristle and set fire to it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this and a couple of similar complaints by other customers resulted in the seller being taken off the Amazon Marketplace.</li>
            <li> Maybe they are too stiff.</li>
            <li> , less expensive brush with boar bristles would work the same.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected and thank goodness because it was so expensive !</li>
            <li> hair has also grown an inch or two longer than it has in the past</li>
            <li> Drying it after the shower has been no problem like it has been in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure...</li>
            <li> So I purchased this one for my bf, and the small all boar for myself</li>
            <li> I do like this brush, but I am not sure what all they hype is about.  </li>
            <li> The Mason Pearson has yet to lose a bristle in the past 3 months</li>
            <li> Like I said in Mason pearson comb review, I was obsessed with Mason Pearson brush for a long time because a lot of people rave about it.</li>
            <li> These are hard to get.</li>
            <li> I had actually become someone who was \\&quot;deathly afraid of brushes\\&quot; and hardly used them because of how fuzzy they made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite put my finger on why I&#x27;m not thrilled about this brush.</li>
            <li> Ella has thick, médium length hair and there are never snarls with the Mason-Pearson.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair, this is not the brush to use.</li>
            <li> So any claims made by the seller for use on thick hair, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d gone with a less expensive brush.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I&#x27;ve used on my hair that isn&#x27;t painful and can brush through without snagging.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the brush can&#x27;t be used while blow-drying because the heat will damage the brush&#x27;s rubber base.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I apologize that you are not happy with the Mason Pearson brush.</li>
            <li> Basically for the last 15 years i have HATED my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware of fake Mason Brush.</li>
            <li> This one is clearly a fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we are unable to accept returns on any products that have already been used.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the Mason Pearson brush just way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I decided to return the brush, unopened, letting Amazon know that i was worried it was a fake.</li>
            <li> One may wonder why Mason Pearson would suggest that these brushes are possibly fake?</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> What crap!</li>

            <li> I have used this brush for a few months and I really do not think it is worth the money.  It is a hair brush!  Nothing special to me, in fact it look cheap or to my hair, but you have to try to make yourself better, but there are better ways to  put shine in your hair.  May be beneficial to long hair, but I have short hair that gets cut every 6 weeks and I do not worry about split ends.</li>
            <li> Makes all the difference in the world.  Cheaper imitations don&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> No brush massages your scalp like the Mason Pearson.  It also does the best job of distributing hair oils all the way to the end of your hair shaft.  I love it.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser raved about the Mason Pearson brush. My first thought was it is too expenses.  Then I thought about how long I have had my current hair brush and thought if you divide the cost of years it could be worth it.  I love the brush, I no longer have to use a flat iron if I do not want to..... Perfect size for handling and my hair comes out straight smooth and shinning.  I was a little bit caution on using it with blow dryer but my hairdresser uses hers all day long.. So buy it, brush/blow dry and save your self some time...Fairwell my flat iron Mason brush has replaced you</li>
            <li> Great high quality brush. On an expensive side but if you want to splurge on a brush that the one you should buy.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because it gives some static to my hair but it&#x27;s nothing versus the benefits I&#x27;m getting from using this brush</li>
            <li> I buy the Mason Pearson about over month.  the color at the handle start fall off.  I don&#x27;t know how Amazon protect they customer from knock off product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush! Helps hair dry faster and leaves it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks very gorgeous and I always get a lot of complements on my hairbrush. It looks spectacular on my beauty table.&lt;br /&gt;The wood is very luxurious with a shiny finish, the handle is very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the combination of two bristle types: the long ones are nylon and the short ones are boar. The duo makes for a brush that not only combs the hair well, but it also cleans and shines it. The natural bristles distribute scalp oils throughout the hair-shaft allowing for optimal conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is of medium thickens, wavy and shoulder length--this brush is perfect for them. I think it will not work as well on thick and very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a cleaning brush, which is very easy to use. However, sometimes I also use Olivia Garden Brush Cleaner on it from time to time. This does not seem to hurt anything. In ~a year and a half the brush has not sustained any significant damage. What is more I accidentally got this brush wet (dropped into a bathtub! twice!) two times---the finis did not get damaged at all!&lt;br /&gt;True quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush and I would recommend it to anyone, with appropriate hair-type.</li>
            <li> this is the best tool to gently remove cradle cap, it did not hurt, it worked in combination with a week of MD prescribed head and shoulders. It is the best brish for long toddler hair for untangling. It is the best brush for mom to feel polished.  It is the best brush and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Its not real!! Beware of fake Mason Brush. It&#x27;s a knock off.   I have a similar brush that I purchased from a reputable dealer and then   I purchased this one. This one is clearly a fake. Nothing like the other Mason Pearson brush I own.</li>
            <li> I have always had Isinis brushes but wanted to try Mason Pearson.  I will never go back.  My MP brush is soft and gentle and goes through my thick hair easily.  I love love love this brush!!!!</li>
            <li> im a hairdresser and have had my personal brush for over 15years and is still in perfect condition. Every woman should own a mason pearson. The brush last forever....</li>
            <li> I reviewed this brush when I first bought it over a year ago and would like to give my update after continued use for one year as I get questions about this periodically from buyers here on amazon.  (original review is below) I noticed that the one of the top reviewers says that the brush is a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; the brush that I purchased is NOT a fake but I want to clearly state that this review is for the Mason Pearson Brush itself, and not for the \\&quot;seller of the brush\\&quot; do your research to take sure you are receiving the real thing from a reputable Amazon dealer before you purchase.&lt;br /&gt;So... here&#x27;s my verdict after a year of use. My once dry bleachy hair is now continuous shiny and soft blonde. I no longer have the trouble with the frizziness that I have had in the past and my hair loos and feels better than it has in 20 years. My hair dresser friend has even commented on how shiny and good condition my hair is in, and she too has now bought the brush  for her self because of my transformation ( and she also loves it)&lt;br /&gt;The biggest and most noticeable difference however is that I NO LONGER HAVE SPLIT ENDS on my hair. I firmly believe that the brush alone is responsible for this as Ive added nothing additionally to my hair routine. I can&#x27;t prove this, but I believe that continued use of the brush sets up healthy oil distribution and allows for all of the hair to be evenly (and naturally conditioned) so there is less drying and damage. All I really do is use the brush to smooth out my hair after I towel drying from the shower every other day. thats it. I often brush my hair before I sleep as well, but brushing after the shower is the main thing ( I would never have thought to do this myself) but my friend who owned the brush that inspired me (review below) said that thats all she ever did and she has gorgeous shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has also grown an inch or two longer than it has in the past and I definitely attribute that to my not having to chop off split ends.  My hair also used to have a tendency to get oily on top in a day or two while the bottom stayed dry and that is no  longer the case. its mostly uniform now and I can go several days between shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that while I noticed immediate results with this brush (I often do, and I think others do too) when your trying something new and are really LOOKING for those good results. I can honestly say that the true benefits the brush had to offer took a little time but after a year are undeniable.&lt;br /&gt;I know that there are other brushes made in this same style that are out there and I cant say if they would give you the results for less money (maybe they do?) but I know that I would never live without this brush after what its done for my hair. I hope that helps you guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**ORIGINAL REVIEW** I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews of this brush over the years, thought about buying one on several ocasions, but in the end, like many reviewers, I just couldn&#x27;t justify the cost for something as simple as a hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;Then last week I went to stay at a friend&#x27;s mountain house for the weekend and saw the MP brush on her bathrom counter. My friend (who has some of the most beautiful shiny long hair I&#x27;ve ever seen) said she&#x27;s basically had the brush since she was a girl and had no idea that it was anything special, it&#x27;s just all she ever used. she let me use the brush all weekend and must have thought I was a freak for how excited I was at the opportunity to try it. I figured if nothing else i&#x27;ll get it out of my system and give up my fantasies of buying the \\&quot;Bentley of brushes\\&quot;. Boy was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bush has literally transformed my hair in a few days...&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go into the dynamics of how the brush works but it might be helpful to know what changes I&#x27;ve seen since using it. For the last 15 years I&#x27;ve had what I would consider \\&quot;problem hair\\&quot;. my hair is longer than shoulder length (strait on top with knotted curls on the underside) excessively bleached, very thin,fragile, dull and exceeding dry on the ends (think fuzzy static) while the top half of my hair has a tendency to get super oily in just a day. No amount of trimming, conditioner or product has ever worked to balance or soften it, and the only way I could get uniformly smooth hair was to use a flat iron and even then it lacked sheen.  I usually just let it air dry while I sleep because any amount of movement (or god forbid a hair dryer) and i was back to looking like medusa again. I had actually become someone who was \\&quot;deathly afraid of brushes\\&quot; and hardly used them because of how fuzzy they made my hair look and feel. Ive purchased round brushes, boar bristle, nylon..everything and not one of them even touched the dry, brittle mess that was my hair. For years I&#x27;ve just had to embrace the \\&quot;bed head look \\&quot; because that was simply the best it could be. Basically for the last 15 years i have HATED my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Mason Pearson brush. Upon returning home I placed an order imediately (I bought the junior with mixed boar and nylon bristles) and have been using my new brush at home for a few nights. The difference is immediate and profound. My hair is so solft to touch with lots of shine and a huge improvement in my knotted curls underneath. they have litteraly vanished!  My hair has not been this soft and silky smooth since I was a kid. Drying it after the shower has been no problem like it has been in the past. I just added a tiny bit of leave-in conditioner to the ends and voila! beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I took my friends advice- she brushes her hair out at night before bed and and also runs the brush through her wet hair after the shower and lets it dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m telling you this brush has been a miracle for my hair and I can&#x27;t ever imagine living without it now. If I should ever loose this brush I wouldnt hesitate to buy it again, it is really that good. Do yourself a favor and  buy this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the detangler comb from Mason Pearson and its a nice companion product for in the shower.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this hairbrush for me as a Christmas gift.  I was very excited and gave my hair a thorough brushing, only to have my scalp itch for a solid 30 minutes afterwards.  Hoping it was a fluke, I tried again the next few days with the same result.  My hairdresser believes I have some reaction to the boar bristles in the brush, which is odd as I have never been allergic to anything!      I contacted Mason Pearson and asked if they were familiar with this type of reaction, and for a possible return of the brush.      This was their response, \\&quot;Your inquiry to Mason Pearson was forwarded to us as we are their Exclusive Distributor for the USA.   We are sorry but not being able to see your hair type and/or scalp makes an answer to your question very defficult if not impossible.  We suggest you take the brush back to where your husband purchased it and perhaps they might have a answer.\\&quot;    I also contacted the seller, requesting a return and received this response,    \\&quot;I apologize that you are not happy with the Mason Pearson brush. We have not heard of any such issues before. Unfortunately we are unable to accept returns on any products that have already been used. This is stated in our Return Policy on Amazon.com.\\&quot;  Best Regards, Kevin Soufer, Sales Manager        I understand the policy; however, we are out $100 with a brush I can&#x27;t use!  I had hoped Mason Pearson would stand behind their product, particularly if this is such a \\&quot;rare\\&quot; reaction to their brush.  I&#x27;m particularly disapointed as their response is contradictory to Mason Pearson&#x27;s image as a long-standing quality product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday and she loves it. It&#x27;s much bigger than I expected and thank goodness because it was so expensive ! I think it is a nice purchase for someone that has a head full of unmanageable hair and really doesn&#x27;t need much else.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I read all of the reviews, and when I got it, the package is very european, I was excited to open the package. For some reason, this brush produces a lot of static when I brush dry hair (not the case with Fekkai&#x27;s brush)...it does work beautifully after taking a shower, but is 100 bucks worth it? I&#x27;m not sure...I&#x27;m keeping the brush and to tell you the truth my hair looks ok but I don&#x27;t think a brush is an investment, it is a cost, if you have the money, splurge, if not, you will be fine without it...</li>
            <li> Seriously you... that girl that doesn&#x27;t spend money willy-nilly and isn&#x27;t sure if this brush is worth it? I was just like you, I splurged, I have never regretted that I did.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for any normal human being (if you have a pixie cut or hair down to the floor maybe it&#x27;s not quite), but anyone I&#x27;ve let borrow it (for a quick brushing) has been just as in love as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, just press buy.</li>
            <li> I asked for this hairbrush for my birthday and my husband got it for me.  From the first stroke through my hair, I was so  in awe!  I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair and am losing my pregnancy hair.  This brush felt so good on my scalp and went so smoothly through the hair; I was amazed at how different it feels than any drugstore brush ever has!  I also got the detangling comb for using after I wash my hair and it, too, feels great.  This was one of the best birthday presents I ever asked for and it totally has exceeded my expectations about the difference a hair brush can make.  It&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s reputation!</li>
            <li> As a stylist it&#x27;s a must. Does it have to be Mason Pearson? Maybe not but it&#x27;s a tried and true brand.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this one for my bf, and the small all boar for myself (I went and read which brushes to use for which types of hair, I have a pretty sensitive scalp). Although my small one will be great to throw in my bag, this one did not irritate my scalp at all. My hair felt so good after using it for two days! I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. So glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> My friends jokingly call it my hundred dollar hairbrush, which isn&#x27;t far from the truth. In my lower-middle class circle of friends, I have been mocked and stared at incredulously. I bought it in a moment of self indulgence about 8 years ago, but have never regretted it. I have used it almost every day since then. This brush is wonderful for distributing oil along the strands. It makes my hair so shiny! The nylon bristles reach through to the scalp while the boar bristles smooth the top layer of hair. I definitely recommend the combo of nylon and boar bristles for thicker hair. This brush makes great sleek and smooth pony tails. It also works well for gently brushing out the surface layer after teasing hair. The size is called \\&quot;medium\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s plenty large enough for all but the longest locks. I would love to have a smaller one for my purse. It&#x27;s definitely an extravagant amount of money to spend on a brush, but I know this brush will last my lifetime and recommend it to anyone willing and able to splurge for beauty.</li>
            <li> My first MP Junior was purchased in the late 1970&#x27;s.  I still own that brush and 5 or so replacements.  Believe it or not that original brush is still functional but has lost some of its performance.  I am a male with a full head of fine hair which I keep relatively short.&lt;br /&gt;This brush has the same quality as the one I purchased 35 plus years ago.  My wife has long thick hair and will use my brush in a jam but it&#x27;s not the perfect model for her.  OUTSTANDING PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I received my MP Pocket today - after a very long time trying to justify such a purchase. I wish I could have gotten the Handy but my little Pocket will serve me just fine!  I have a \\&quot;knockoff\\&quot;&#x27;nylon and bristle brush that I have been quite satisfied with - until today!  Let me tell you the honest truth - there is no comparison!  My hair is colored and highlighted and after brushing with the copy cat - my hair just looks frosted or all the same light color. On the other hand- after using the MP - my highlights are all right there and really shiney !! Wish I had this brush years ago!!!!  Thanks Amazon and thanks Mason Pearson !!😍&lt;br /&gt;Susie.</li>
            <li> I do like this brush, but I am not sure what all they hype is about.  It is a nice brush, my hair feels good afterward, but it really wasn&#x27;t worth the money.  That said, I don&#x27;t love cheap brushes.  Before this brush I bought a Fredrick Fekkai brush that fell apart, so I returned it.  I own a Phillips light touch brush that is decent quality and quite inexpensive.  Nothing wrong with the Mason Pearson brush just way too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I&#x27;ve used on my hair that isn&#x27;t painful and can brush through without snagging. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it. I contacted the company and they recommended this brush due to the quantity of hair.</li>
            <li> Is there a better brush? Absolutely not! Worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I HAD READ SEVERAL REVIEWS AND WATCHED MANY VIDEOS REGARDING THE MASON PEARSON BRUSHES, ALL OF WHICH WERE FAVORABLE. HOWEVER, I STILL HAD SOME RESERVATIONS BUT DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND PLACE MY ORDER.  I AM SO GLAD I DID.  I HAVE THICK COARSE HAIR AND AFTER USING THE BRUSH MY HAIR IS SILKY AND SOFT TO THE TOUCH.  IT DOES TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO AS YOU MUST RUN THE BRUSH FROM THE SCALP DOWN TO THE ENDS. I HAVE FOUND THAT I DO NOT NEED TO USE ANY CONDITIONER ON MY HAIR AS THE BRUSH DOES DISTRIBUTE THE NATURAL OILS OF THE HAIR EVENLY. I HAVE ORDERED THE MASON PEARSON COMB AS WELL &amp; AM LOOKING FORWARD TO RECEIVING IT.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit nicer than the average brush but really don&#x27;t get the hype. It&#x27;s kind of scratchy too. Wish I&#x27;d gone with a less expensive brush.</li>
            <li> I received my Mason Pearson hairbrush that my hairdresser recommended.  Wonderful brush.  It glides through my long hair and meets all my expectations.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Super good! It glides through your hair, leaving it tangle free. It doesn&#x27;t even hurt</li>
            <li> Excelent quality.Excelent  delivery service!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT BRUSH &amp; FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> Just started wearing my wavy hair in a straight style and this brush makes the difference. Gives lift and straightens and lets the hair shine. I ordered it from Amazon and my hair stylist said I was lucky to get it. These are hard to get. Love it.</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my daughter and she loves it. There are no more issues with tears, tangles, &amp; messy hair because she loves to brush it now with this amazing brush.  We have tried all of the &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; brushes, detanglers( which leaves her hair oily looking) and me ripping through her hair and have found this brush to be the best thing out there. Although it is expensive, I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Like I said in Mason pearson comb review, I was obsessed with Mason Pearson brush for a long time because a lot of people rave about it. Finally, I ordered this one.     when I burshed my hair about 20 mins at the first time, my scalp got really itchy and red which almost drove me crazy. Ok, I guess I used it for too long. Or maybe my scalp is exremely sensitive. I don&#x27;t know. My hair is natural curly. After I used this brush, my curls were all gone. But it didn&#x27;t make my hair straight either. I didn&#x27;t see my hair is shiny because of this brush. Anyway, it&#x27;s not miracle for me. Maybe someone can tell me how to use it correctly, so it can make my hair shiny. For the price, I do want to use it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get better than this. I have a travel brush in my purse purchased 30 years ago and it is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny And heAlthy looking! Best invesent for my hair!😘</li>
            <li> Use these per the professionals great for grooming dog</li>
            <li> This is a miracle brush for my non brushable hair. I wish the handle was little longer though...</li>
            <li> I appreciate good craftsmanship and quality, but the price for this item is too high.  The Junior is better and not, as the name would indicate, smaller than the other MP brushes.</li>
            <li> I originally read about this brush in a fashion magazine. The reviews were positive on Amazon, so I splurged and bought the brush as I&#x27;ve never really found a brush that was compatible with my long, fine hair. This brush is amazing! After brushing, there are far fewer hairs in my brush than I&#x27;ve ever seen. I know this is because the brush isn&#x27;t breaking my hair strands. The combination of two types of bristles provides shine and reduces flyaways. The only negative is that the brush can&#x27;t be used while blow-drying because the heat will damage the brush&#x27;s rubber base. It&#x27;s a splurge, but worth the investment. I highly recommend this seller. I received the brush much quicker than the promised delivery date.</li>
            <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is sooo silky.  Also have 100% boar hair brush as well...but this one is best!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering buying pocket size too.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I read the great reviews. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my hair. Save your money. This brush did not transform my hair. I wanted to like this and it&#x27;s a nice brush but it&#x27;s jot worth the high price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite put my finger on why I&#x27;m not thrilled about this brush. Maybe the bristles are too short. Maybe they are too stiff. I probably haven&#x27;t given it enough time to make a definite decision, so, I will make an effort to use it more frequently and revise my comments later.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace the one I bought years ago - not sure how many years.</li>
            <li> grew up with them, never found anything like them, this was a replacement one for my Mother who had her last one for 40 yrs - yes they&#x27;re pricey but they last forever and are kind to your hair and scalp, real quality, something worth what you pay for it</li>
            <li> I love this brush and I have had my oldest one for at least 10 years.  This was a gift for my daughter.  Once you use a Mason Pearson brush, you definitely see a difference and see what all the fuss is about (and the price).</li>
            <li> It was fast delivery and awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> My wife bought purchased a hair  rush it arrived as represented and in good order, thank you</li>
            <li> My third one. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush that will glide over and through your hair, no matter how tangled or snarly it is!  It takes tangles out quickly! It also keeps your hair nice, without breaking it off.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than stated and wish I would have ordered years ago.  It feels so good to brush out my hair.</li>
            <li> Tried several brushes and products to detangle my granddaughters hair.  Nothing worked.  First time I tried this brush I was in awe.  I would have paid a $1000.00 for this brush....it is that good.</li>
            <li> I have sent this letter to the Mason Pearson company and awaiting a reply, here is the letter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;ve have owned a junior boar and nylon Mason Pearson brush for many years.  I started back in 1992 I believe.  I need a question answered please.  I had two prior brushes lost, stolen back in the day.  Loved them!  I just bought a new one from an outside retailer. (amazon)  I can bet my life that this brush is different from the past two I owned, I know I always bought the same brush as in size and style.  This brush seems to have less boar bristles then my brushes I bought in the 90&#x27;s.  Please confirm if and when the design changed.  Why does there seem to be less boar bristles present on the mixed brushes you are selling?  Thank you so much for your reply and to end the confusion in my head.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does not have the same feel as the two old ones.  (maybe good for super thick hair)  It is much harder, too hard.&lt;br /&gt;The extra boar hairs really did glide through my hair with greater ease and kept it shinier.  The brush is not like before and not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  **My new favorite is brush is the ibiza in the G series.**&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: Here is the reply to my letter, from the Mason Pearson company direct in England,  they are using less boar bristle!!!  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your enquiry. Because of the changing nature of the raw materials we use (possibly an evolving nature) &amp; often due to the country of origin, we have to be prepared to use the best bristle available at the time to do the work required of it. Which sometimes means less bristles per tuft but usable, or more bristles per tuft but not so effective when brushing as a Mason Pearson hairbrush should be. Rather than compromise the quality of our hairbrushes we have chosen at this time to use the stiffer bristle but less of them per tuft to get the results that are expected from a Mason Pearson hairbrush. However, it may be at some time in the future we may only have available to us the best bristle that is slightly finer (but not too soft)where we can use more per tuft, (as was possibly the case with your previous hairbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br /&gt;Mason Pearson Bros. Ltd.&lt;br /&gt;Here is their email if you don&#x27;t believe me email them yourself about the change.  &amp;#60;info@masonpearson.com&amp;#62;may be at some time in the future we may only have available to us the best bristle that is slightly finer (but not too soft)where we can use more per tuft, (as was possibly the case with your previous hairbrushes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes,&lt;br /&gt;Mason Pearson Bros. Ltd.&lt;br /&gt;Here is their email if you don&#x27;t believe me email them yourself about the change.  &amp;#60;info@masonpearson.com&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Received one as a gift about 15 years ago and did not actually begin to use it until this year when I decided to grow my hair. Our granddaughter (age 7) asked to try it and we both agree that it is superb. Ella has thick, médium length hair and there are never snarls with the Mason-Pearson. Bought her her own and she is thrilled. It is well worth the price .</li>
            <li> The best brush for smoothing and styling</li>
            <li> Can a brush really make hair feel silky?!  It seems to.....I can&#x27;t think of any other changes that I&#x27;ve made that would result in the wonderfully silky feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a nice brush, but it is way overpriced.  I have many brushes, and none of them are anywhere near the price of this brush.  Also I find the material used to make the brush to be rather cheap feeling and looking, nothing like I expected when I paid $100 for a brush.  The handle does not fit comfortably into my hand either.  I had been told it would do miracles for my show dogs&#x27;coats.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Others had told me it is just a brush like all the others.  They were right, and I wasted a lot of money to find that out.</li>
            <li> I was given this brush as a present 40 years ago and it is still in great shape. It&#x27;s quality is second to none.</li>
            <li> The brush is lovely to look at but if you have thick hair, this is not the brush to use. So any claims made by the seller for use on thick hair, buyer beware. I ordered this brush and returned it within two days of having it, well within the return policy of R&amp;S Factors. They did not refund all my money to me but only half because they claimed I had used the brush and it was &amp;#34;unsaleable&amp;#34; upon receipt. Why would I use a brush for two days and then return it? This seller is trying to get the most money out of its customers. They even sent me pictures of a brush to show use. Yes, R&amp;S Factors, I used your brush for one day and ruined it and then wanted my money back. What crap! Again, I&#x27;m sure this brush is a great one for many people. Future buyers beware of this seller!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for all these years. The brush arrived within one week from England. I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Feels great on your scalp.  Just right.</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for years but balked at the cost.  However, the FIRST time I pulled this brush through my hair, I felt a difference.  It actually seemed to make an immediate difference in the texture of my hair (smoother) and it that was also the first day I noticed a decrease in my hair fall out!  I only gave it a 4 because I do wonder if another, less expensive brush with boar bristles would work the same.  However, I have to say that for years I&#x27;ve been using a combination boar bristle/nylon brush from Bass and the Mason Pearson is HEADS AND TAILS above that one!  Perhaps that&#x27;s because the Bass had little balls on the end of the nylon bristles which (I never knew until recently) were pulling and breaking my hair and this one does not.  I&#x27;ve also recently purchased 2 Spornette brushes: one with a combination of nylon and boar bristles and one with just nylon bristles.  And I have to say that the Spornette brushes really hurt my scalp while the Mason Pearson feels absolutely heavenly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still very happy with my purchase of the Mason Pearson brush.  However, I wanted to add that I have since purchased two Morrocco Method (MM) boar bristle/nylon brushes and wanted to compare them for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra large MM brush (they only have two sizes available - extra large and small) is about 1/2\\&quot; wider than the Mason Pearson Junior so it looks/feels more like a paddle brush.  As soon as I opened the box I smelled a chemical smell; a smell distinctly absent from the Mason Pearson brush.  The MM brush comes with no care instructions or any accessories.  The Mason Pearson came with detailed care instructions and a smaller brush to clean the hairbrush.  The MM brush feels much the same on the scalp as the Mason Pearson (divine).  The MM brush lost a bristle the first time I used it and has lost a couple of bristles since.  The Mason Pearson has yet to lose a bristle in the past 3 months I&#x27;ve owned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iwould say that for those who are on a tight budget but want/need to care for their hair better, the MM brush is a good alternative at $39.  I&#x27;m happy I have both and won&#x27;t mind replacing the MM brush if I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I also purchased the MM small brush and that is probably less than half the size of the MP Junior.  It also had the chemical smell.  It is the perfect size for my purse (or for a child).</li>
            <li> Always the reliably best brush ever.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> There have been a lot of doubts over the authenticity of Mason Pearson brushes sold on Amazon. I&#x27;d recently bought a brush on Amazon and decided to contact Mason Pearson for a price comparison which is when they told me that there were plenty of forgeries on the market. I decided to return the brush, unopened, letting Amazon know that i was worried it was a fake. Unfortunately this and a couple of similar complaints by other customers resulted in the seller being taken off the Amazon Marketplace. This is when i contacted Mason Pearson again and with the information they provided, i checked out the brush, kindly provided to me from the Amazon seller in question. I also compared it with an older brush i had, which was bought directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the quality of both the brushes was absolutely the same. The same packaging, the same good quality hard plastic,the same rubber pad etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve outlined a general guide below-(this was for my large pure boar bristle hairbrush, model B1)-&lt;br /&gt;1) The name on the handle should be in goldblocking and sunken into the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;2) The name on the handle should say:&lt;br /&gt;The&lt;br /&gt;Mason Pearson&lt;br /&gt;London England&lt;br /&gt;Pure Bristle (varies with brush type)&lt;br /&gt;3) There should be a hole at the end of the brush only, the side opposite to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;4) There should be 16 rows (or 8 rings) of tufts (varies with brush size)&lt;br /&gt;5) When you squeeze down on the brush you should hear it whistle or wheeze as the air flows out of the cushion and the cushion should bounce back at the same speed.&lt;br /&gt;6) This is for the ruby brushes only- at first glance the plastic on the handle seems almost black, but when you hold it up against light, it glows a wonderful deep ruby red.&lt;br /&gt;7) A drastic check is to pull out a small piece of the black bristle and set fire to it. The smell of singed hair would be clear or a plastic chemical odour would be the alternative.&lt;br /&gt;8) Another drastic check, and this is really not necessary, is to take out the top of the pad and you will find a stamp on the plastic head inside.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if all sellers on Amazon are selling authentic brushes but i believe this general guide can help customers interested in owning a Mason Pearson brush. One may wonder why Mason Pearson would suggest that these brushes are possibly fake? Well, for one, they have no way of knowing if these brushes have been obtained from their authorized seller in the US. And secondly, these brushes are being sold at a discounted price on Amazon, something that i believe the manufacturer does not approve of. Anyone spending 150-200$ on a brush deserves to know they own an authentic product and at the same time be able to take advantage of the discounts provided by sellers on Amazon. With Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy, we have nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li> Strong brush that is the best for thick hair. It&#x27;s worth the price, is easy to keep clean, and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Glides through tangles without loads of breakage. I use it to blow dry my girls hair too and it makes their hair really shine</li>
            <li> Used by my NYC high end hair dresser, I had to get one because my hair never looked the same at home.  The two levels of the brush (longer plastic and shorter &#x27;hair-like&#x27;) do the trick and smooth the hair - definitely the best brush I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;ve tried over 10!  Even on very tangled hair - I have no pain just brushing right though it - no need to gently separate knots in sections.</li>
            <li> Growing up we always used Mason Pearson. As a thrifty adult, I have purchased similar brushes, thinking they would be the same - they are not. I absolutely LOVE my new Mason Pearson. Worth the investment!</li>
            <li> When they say proof is in the pudding...this is one of the products that can easily pass that test. You try it and you know the difference. I had earlier ordered a cheap brush($20) from amazon...because I was skeptical to spend so much money on a brush.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had not because that darn brush was never even able to penetrate my hair and reach scalp. Now I am spending this brush cost + cheap brush cost...oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with this brush my scalp gets a proper message and helps keep my scalp clean. I wish there was more advertisement  about these kind of products that work instead of all those silly hair styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Junior size is just fine for my long hair.</li>
            <li> I thought about returning this brush because I just chopped off all of my hair.  I tried this brush on my daughter&#x27;s hair and love it!  I&#x27;ve decided to keep it just for her.  She loves it, and now never mind doing her own hair.  This will be passed down to her someday.. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Excellent hair brush.  Been using one I got for my birthday over 40 years ago and decided it was time for a new one!  Yes it is expensive but it does not pull or break hair and is one of the best values for the money I have ever spent in my life.  It also helps keep the oil distributed through hair.  I love my Mason Pearson and you will too!</li>
            <li> This brush delivers what it promises, although expensive, was worth it.</li>
            <li> Great service &amp; quality!</li>
            <li> Love this brush... Junior size is less bulky &amp; easier to use than full-sized brush... Bristles are combo of nylon &amp; boar which control hair very well... Price was also excellent</li>
            <li> This brush is my absolute favorite, this is a well deserved, favorable review. I am a hairstylist and have used many brushes during my carrer.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
