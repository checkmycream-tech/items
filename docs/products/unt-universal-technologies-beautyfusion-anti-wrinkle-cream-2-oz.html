            <li>(you might have seen my fundraiser at the top of my blog page that a friend set up for me if you&#x27;re one of my blog readers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE this cream.  </li>
            <li>I do not sun bath at all and haven&#x27;t for many years</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the cream.  </li>
            <li>I used many creams</li>
            <li>During winter months I apply it at night too just to keep it more moist.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This cream has tons of skin healthy ingredients, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Peptides.  </li>
            <li>I love this formula because it helps keep my skin hydrated too.</li>
            <li>The cream glides on to the skin so easy.  </li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for my face and sometimes for my neck to help with the lines and crepe look of my skin. .</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin with a month&#x27;s use is extremely smooth and plump.</li>
            <li>I like the thickness of this cream, and it goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries up quickly as you massage it onto your skin.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m pretty sure I have seen them all come and go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich cream that absorbs well, though since it&#x27;s summer</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my BeautyFusion Anit-Wrinkle Cream in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I am not a 21 year old TV model telling you how this helps my skin look &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34;, I am a 65 year old great grandma who only wants to be the best 65 I can be.</li>
            <li>This is amazing fragrance free cream for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Results are visible right away!</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that is important in collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>

            <li>This is the 3rd product that I&#x27;ve used from BeautyFusion and once again I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy</li>
            <li>Because vitamin C can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, I try to use sunblock if I spend more time outside.</li>
            <li>What I noticed first was that it didn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>Which is fantastic for sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>so my face looks vibrant and fresh.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect results this fast</li>
            <li>It is very silky, and does not leave my skin feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend to those that are in need of a new facial cream because this one surely will not disappoint you.</li>
            <li>I started getting fine lines on the sides of my nose a few months ago and using this cream has significantly helped diminish them.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to be proven wrong tho!</li>
            <li>The texture of the product is creamy but not a thick cream where your face feels heavy having it on, this cream is a light and seeps into your skin quickly and moisturizes it well.</li>
            <li>Anything sold in Walmart will work better and cost much less.  </li>
            <li>will highly recommend this</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the  product I normally use</li>
            <li>I love when I use this cream that it sinks deep into my skin and doesn’t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>It’s very moisturizing and makes my skin unbelievably soft, but at the same time it does not leave any residue or clog pores.</li>
            <li>It’s texture is a soft, silkiness, which leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>The cream is white, and creamy to the touch, and the fragrance is absolutely delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, the package is what draws the eye and a classy label would boost their business tenfold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and never used gloves while cleaning or washing dishes, so my hands looked like they were 90 years old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for the past few weeks, and am very satisfied with my results, thus far.</li>
            <li>It feels toner and some of my serious smile lines look less prominent.</li>
            <li>Having used this now for a few months, I can honestly say, it works, I DO look younger because even the small numbers of fine wrinkles and the deeper expression lines I did have look MUCH less obvious!</li>
            <li>cream is easy to apply, only a small amount necessary, skin feels soft and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With this cream they look really good, not dry and wrinkled at all, and I no longer have a chicken skinned, wrinkled neck.</li>
            <li>I live in an dry climate-area.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anyone who knows anything about skin will tell you that the three major indredients in this cream are crucial to help aging skin on the face.  </li>
            <li>better than some expensive major brands.</li>
            <li>excessive exposure to sun and pollutants may lower Vitamin C content, so it&#x27;s vital to use a product with high concentrations of Vitamin C.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may sting a little at first, but by the second time you use it, you already know it&#x27;s working so the sting is minor and</li>

            <li> I have been using it for a little over a week and can already tell that the wrinkles are softening on my face.</li>
            <li> Dead skin cells, are not our friends in maintaining a youthful skin appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over a few months it has improved the skin on my face, neck, and hands.</li>
            <li> It also exfoliates dead skin</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> That’s what makes your face dull, and causes wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Seemed greasy and hard to absorb.</li>
            <li> one complaint is that I wish they&#x27;d update their labeling.</li>
            <li> Too thick, does nothing for me</li>
            <li> and I think they are losing business with outdated labeling.</li>
            <li> WORTHLESS !!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very nice anti-wrinkle cream.  It’s moisturizing, refreshing, and smells great!  I love the way my skin feels when using this cream. It’s texture is a soft, silkiness, which leaves no residue. The cream is white, and creamy to the touch, and the fragrance is absolutely delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being an Esthetician, you can imagine the countless anti-wrinkle creams, I’ve tried. What makes this one different is it also includes Peptides. If you’re unfamiliar with *Peptides, basically, they stimulate the collagen in your skin. This aids in regeneration. Simply means, it aids in cell turn-over (dead cells).  That’s what makes your face dull, and causes wrinkles.  Dead skin cells, are not our friends in maintaining a youthful skin appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for the past few weeks, and am very satisfied with my results, thus far. However, to truly get maximum results, you must maintain the regimen. This isn’t like acne cream, where you apply when a pimple pops-up, this type of cream is a way of life if you want to maintain healthier and younger-looking skin.  Basically, if you’re of the mind-set that you can diet Monday thru Friday, and take weekends-off to reward yourself, who are you kidding?  Yourself!  Same as this type of skin care. This is not a quick fix, nor an over-night miracle. The benefits will keep you on target, because your results will impress you, and your friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. Yours may differ from mine.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results of this cream. I use it primarily for my face and sometimes for my neck to help with the lines and crepe look of my skin. . It&#x27;s easy to apply and dries up quickly as you massage it onto your skin. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love when I use this cream that it sinks deep into my skin and doesn’t leave any residue. I use it every morning and my face feels great all day. Because vitamin C can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, I try to use sunblock if I spend more time outside.</li>
            <li> I am blessed to be able to use about any product I would like for my skin. And I&#x27;m pretty sure I have seen them all come and go. This stuff WORKS! I am not a 21 year old TV model telling you how this helps my skin look &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34;, I am a 65 year old great grandma who only wants to be the best 65 I can be. Having used this now for a few months, I can honestly say, it works, I DO look younger because even the small numbers of fine wrinkles and the deeper expression lines I did have look MUCH less obvious! It may sting a little at first, but by the second time you use it, you already know it&#x27;s working so the sting is minor and you kind of want that feeling because you  know what it means, BETTER SMOOTHER SKIN!</li>
            <li> Very good cream. I love how soft my skin feels and I have noticed some results with fewer wrinkles.</li>
            <li> better than some expensive major brands. Very soothing and gentle.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my face, hoping it works for my wrinkles...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this cream.  Seemed greasy and hard to absorb.</li>
            <li> Works very well&lt;br /&gt;I just started this cream a week ago....and I already am noticing a difference in the texture of my fifty-plus face. It feels toner and some of my serious smile lines look less prominent. This is one of the nicest face creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd product that I&#x27;ve used from BeautyFusion and once again I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. So many skincare products rely on one ingredient to do all of the work, and this is a powerhouse combination to address just about every anti aging skincare concern under the sun. It&#x27;s a rich cream that absorbs well, though since it&#x27;s summer and my skin can get oily, I use it as a night cream. When I wake up in the morning my face is baby soft and my foundation goes on much more smoothly. The texture of my skin with a month&#x27;s use is extremely smooth and plump. Not bad for someone who&#x27;s physical health is on the border of serious hospitalization! (you might have seen my fundraiser at the top of my blog page that a friend set up for me if you&#x27;re one of my blog readers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that I wish they&#x27;d update their labeling. They make fabtastic products and I think they are losing business with outdated labeling. Everybody has to start somewhere, but I think that investing in a good designer would bring the appearance up to the quality of the product inside. Let&#x27;s face it, the package is what draws the eye and a classy label would boost their business tenfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I was not required to write a positive review &amp; the opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Great cream. Brightens up my skin and hydrates so well. I really like that it that it doesn&#x27;t have any smell(</li>
            <li> This facial cream wasn&#x27;t moist enough for my dry skin. I live in an dry climate-area.&lt;br /&gt;I will give it to my friend who&#x27;s skin is oily.&lt;br /&gt;She will give it a try.</li>
            <li> LOVE this cream.  It is inexpensive and it works great.  Anyone who knows anything about skin will tell you that the three major indredients in this cream are crucial to help aging skin on the face.  I&#x27;m 52 and always get told I look about 40.  Love that!</li>
            <li> I do not sun bath at all and haven&#x27;t for many years but I do have some damage from when I did before without using sun block. I love using this face cream; it has so many good ingredients. It’s very moisturizing and makes my skin unbelievably soft, but at the same time it does not leave any residue or clog pores.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and does not make me break out.</li>
            <li> Nothing noticeable yet</li>
            <li> The texture of the product is creamy but not a thick cream where your face feels heavy having it on, this cream is a light and seeps into your skin quickly and moisturizes it well. Overall I believe this is a really good anti-wrinkle product and is very good moisturizer and I would highly recommend to those that are in need of a new facial cream because this one surely will not disappoint you.</li>
            <li> WORTHLESS !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JOHN SIMMONS</li>
            <li> I love this product. Over a few months it has improved the skin on my face, neck, and hands. I am 66 years old and never used gloves while cleaning or washing dishes, so my hands looked like they were 90 years old. With this cream they look really good, not dry and wrinkled at all, and I no longer have a chicken skinned, wrinkled neck.</li>
            <li> I like the thickness of this cream, and it goes on so smoothly.  I have been using it for a little over a week and can already tell that the wrinkles are softening on my face.</li>
            <li> Love the cream.  Feels impressive.  This is amazing fragrance free cream for my sensitive skin.  Worth the buy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank  You,</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I used many creams but I think I have found the perfect one! Results are visible right away! Skin looks smoother, fresh and soft!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the  product I normally use and it has a putrid/sour smell to it.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C cream is very effective.&lt;br /&gt; Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that is important in collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;Our excessive exposure to sun and pollutants may lower Vitamin C content, so it&#x27;s vital to use a product with high concentrations of Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is easy to apply, only a small amount necessary, skin feels soft and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank  You,</li>
            <li> After 40 I started noticing wrinkles, hyper pigmentation  and other factors that come with age. I decided to add anti wrinkle cream for my wrinkles and discolored skin. It helps me maintain my youth by toning and firming my skin. It also exfoliates dead skin so my face looks vibrant and fresh. People are constantly complimenting me on how well I am aging!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks...not results yet !  I didn&#x27;t expect results this fast so I&#x27;m so so with the cream.  Nancy</li>
            <li> Great anti wrinkle creme that works great and feel great!!  Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Anything sold in Walmart will work better and cost much less.  Wish I could send it back!!!</li>
            <li> After washing my face with a facial scrub to get rid of the dry flaky skin I apply this cream and my face stays moisturized the entire day. It&#x27;s not greasy/oiling, it softens my skin. During winter months I apply it at night too just to keep it more moist. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my BeautyFusion Anit-Wrinkle Cream in the mail.  I had to try it out immediately.  What I noticed first was that it didn&#x27;t have a smell. Which is fantastic for sensitive skin like mine.  The cream glides on to the skin so easy.  It is very silky, and does not leave my skin feeling greasy at all. This cream has tons of skin healthy ingredients, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, and Peptides.  This cream is also made in the USA, which always helps with my purchasing decision.  I bought this product at a discounted price for my honest review.  I can&#x27;t get enough of this cream!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid and Peptides in one jar - sounds like anti aging heaven to me! I have been a big fan of these ingredients for quite some time now because they have truly worked dramatically for my perpetually dry and mid thirties skin. I started getting fine lines on the sides of my nose a few months ago and using this cream has significantly helped diminish them. I love this formula because it helps keep my skin hydrated too. Some of the high end creams I purchased in the past from the major cosmetic outlets in my area did nothing for me - so I had no expectations when I got this cream in the mail. I am very happy to be proven wrong tho! This cream works like a champ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Too thick, does nothing for me</li>
