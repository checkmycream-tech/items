    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Awesome makeup.</li>
            <li>goes on smmothly, has great sheen, improved my skin dramatically....</li>
            <li>color was a great match.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look great</li>
            <li>LOVE!!</li>
            <li>This product is great if you want good coverage.</li>
            <li>and I could not find a good match.</li>
            <li>and I have to use blotting sheets but good coverage</li>
            <li>You may need to buy a couple to find the perfect shade but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>for the makeup, it evened out my skin and looked amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage</li>
            <li>but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals has made a perfect look for most women&#x27;s faces.  </li>
            <li>Extremely light weight, yet top notch coverage!</li>
            <li>Love this with the sponge brush to apply it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used bareMinerals for maybe fifteen years or more</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s shaken and you take the top off there is makeup ALL over</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>You still need that on top</li>
            <li>but it does cover imperfections better using it with the powder.</li>
            <li>It makes my face look very smooth and goes on so easy.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work because I loved baremineral products.  </li>
            <li>At first, I liked the coverage and lightness in application.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smooth out easily.</li>
            <li>Bare Minerals Foundation is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Even coverage and so light that you never know it is there.</li>
            <li>It feels so smooth</li>
            <li>There are many shades to choose from, and you don&#x27;t have to match exactly.  </li>
            <li>so worth the investment!</li>
            <li>It is light (you hardly know you have it on), yet is has perfect cover.  </li>
            <li>They are either too drying, too greasy, or fall right into my fine</li>
            <li>I guess it really depends on your body chemistry and one wouldn&#x27;t know for sure without trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad coverage</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to most foundations, my skin will break out like a teenager.  </li>
            <li>This is water based and with a few drops on your make up brush you will have a great finish.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many foundations and some of them were close to what I wanted, but Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>but I have discovered if you put it on at night with the powder (which is actually supposed to be helpful to your skin with Bare Minerals) or put it on several hours before (Make sure you use lots of cream on your face first either way) you wake up with a great coverage and no lines.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this new foundation.</li>
            <li>First of all, it says to shake the bottle before applying</li>
            <li>I signed up at Bare Essenticals.com and got a 20% off coupon and free ship where I bought the brush.</li>
            <li>Maybe works better on other skin types.</li>
            <li>I have found my new foundation.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and covers small blemishes.</li>
            <li>Bare Skin Pure Brightening Serum is the one.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>My face is soft and I forget it&#x27;s on until I wash my face and see it on the wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>Very watery and has an orange tint with minimal coverage</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older I needed something else that did not make my skin look so dry.</li>
            <li>I suggest you go to Sephora or Bare Essenticals to find your color match and order it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It washes off easily and leaves no residue behind.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It washes off easily and leaves no residue behind.  </li>
            <li> I am &#x27;mature&#x27; and have had problems with other liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the bare minerals loose powder foundation.</li>
            <li> It causes a dry look because it gets into lines</li>
            <li> and it creates such a mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look as tired and my skin looks dewy and young.</li>
            <li> It did not feel like my face was weighed down with makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it the formulation or what, but I&#x27;ve since seen other posts about an odd/rancid smell after applying it.</li>
            <li> Does not feel heavy and does not come off on my hands.  </li>
            <li> but for some reason it feels to liquidy witch makes it hard to apply because you see streaks everywhere.</li>
            <li> Second, as others have said, this stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> Shortly after it was applied, I started to smell a dirty mop water smell.</li>
            <li> It looks thick on face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any woman who is tired of false advertisement, this foundation delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li> I just cannot deal with the funky smell. :-(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

            <li> Love this with the sponge brush to apply it. It goes on very smooth and covers small blemishes. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals Foundation is amazing!  It is light (you hardly know you have it on), yet is has perfect cover.  There are many shades to choose from, and you don&#x27;t have to match exactly.  It washes off easily and leaves no residue behind.  I have tried many foundations and some of them were close to what I wanted, but Bare Minerals Bare Skin Pure Brightening Serum is the one.  My skin is very sensitive to most foundations, my skin will break out like a teenager.  This is water based and with a few drops on your make up brush you will have a great finish.  Bare Minerals has made a perfect look for most women&#x27;s faces.  I would recommend this to any woman who is tired of false advertisement, this foundation delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li> It makes my face look very smooth and goes on so easy.</li>
            <li> Be cautious of how runny this product is compared to the store bought one and if you don&#x27;t mind that then definitely buy</li>
            <li> Not a fan! I&#x27;ve used bareMinerals for maybe fifteen years or more so I was excited to try this new foundation. It&#x27;s probably the messiest liquid foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried. First of all, it says to shake the bottle before applying but once it&#x27;s shaken and you take the top off there is makeup ALL over and it creates such a mess. Second, as others have said, this stuff stinks. Not bad coverage but it doesn&#x27;t smooth out easily. I won&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Very watery and has an orange tint with minimal coverage</li>
            <li> Nice coverage but for some reason it feels to liquidy witch makes it hard to apply because you see streaks everywhere.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! I have used BareMineral products before but this is the best so far. Even coverage and so light that you never know it is there.</li>
            <li> WOW!  goes on smmothly, has great sheen, improved my skin dramatically....so worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I used to buy the bare minerals loose powder foundation. As I have gotten older I needed something else that did not make my skin look so dry. This did the trick. I don&#x27;t look as tired and my skin looks dewy and young. I have found my new foundation.</li>
            <li> I am &#x27;mature&#x27; and have had problems with other liquid foundation. They are either too drying, too greasy, or fall right into my fine lines,&lt;br /&gt;The color was a great match.  Colors shown were a bit lighter than the actual color.  I went by the color name as well as the shown color.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth it is like you are not wearing any makeup. love it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I really wanted it to work because I loved baremineral products.  I had not ordered their mineral products in a while and when I saw this, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have combination skin. This did not blend into my skin well and I could not find a good match. My skin looked drier and you could see the makeup sitting on my skin. I even went to Sephora and could not find a match. I ended up having to return it. Maybe works better on other skin types.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you want good coverage. You may need to buy a couple to find the perfect shade but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.  Does not feel heavy and does not come off on my hands.  My face is soft and I forget it&#x27;s on until I wash my face and see it on the wash cloth.  I will buy again.  I suggest you go to Sephora or Bare Essenticals to find your color match and order it from Amazon.  I signed up at Bare Essenticals.com and got a 20% off coupon and free ship where I bought the brush. Without help from Amazon or coupons it can be abit pricey.</li>
            <li> LOVE!! Extremely light weight, yet top notch coverage!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take the place of the powder. You still need that on top but it does cover imperfections better using it with the powder. It causes a dry look because it gets into lines but I have discovered if you put it on at night with the powder (which is actually supposed to be helpful to your skin with Bare Minerals) or put it on several hours before (Make sure you use lots of cream on your face first either way) you wake up with a great coverage and no lines.</li>
            <li> Awesome makeup. Great coverage and very natural looking.</li>
            <li> At first, I liked the coverage and lightness in application. It did not feel like my face was weighed down with makeup. Shortly after it was applied, I started to smell a dirty mop water smell. I immediately removed the foundation and the smell went away. I reapplied it and the smell came back. I will be returning the product. I&#x27;m not sure if it the formulation or what, but I&#x27;ve since seen other posts about an odd/rancid smell after applying it. I guess it really depends on your body chemistry and one wouldn&#x27;t know for sure without trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the makeup, it evened out my skin and looked amazing. I just cannot deal with the funky smell. :-(</li>
            <li> This product defines pores and makes them look bigger. It looks thick on face.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look great but I have oily skin and this makes me oily and I have to use blotting sheets but good coverage</li>
    </ol>
