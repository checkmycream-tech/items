            <li>Love, Love, Love and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great price terrific product, not heavy in hair and gives it a wonderful natural shine also.  </li>
            <li>Also I got a great deal on the price, considering that the same stuff sold on stores is $50.</li>
            <li>Helps make my hair shine!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great fast service!!!</li>
            <li>But this particular product is AMAZING worth buying!</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just revised my original review as follows.</li>
            <li>My long extensions look fabulous with this light formula and my own fine hair is improved in quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who is willing to go an extra mile to keep their hair looking great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even take a full pump for me</li>
            <li>I use the Kerastase conditioner and love it, but when I received this it was very watery and smelled like alcohol.</li>
            <li>It workshop well with unruly hair.it creates a nice natural shine as well.</li>
            <li>This product makes me hair so soft and easy to manage, I love it.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kerastase is worth EVERY penny.</li>
            <li>A Kerastase salon introduced me to this shampoo and although this is a pricy product it is every penny worth.</li>
            <li>but it worth.  </li>
            <li>Although the bottle seems authentic (considering it&#x27;s glass and identical to my old one), I am fairly convinced that the product is not real.</li>
            <li>It has a strong rubbing alcohol smell (which is strange to me) and the texture is more watery than the bottles I&#x27;ve purchased from Kerastase.</li>
            <li>This item shipped pretty quick to my home.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I have dry hair, really helps with the ends!!!</li>
            <li>It relieves spit ends of frizz, it puts the shine of health in your hair and  most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great, makes my hair really soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t build up on my hair like some other products do.</li>
            <li>It was the first time i have bought it.</li>
            <li>While this conditioner doesn&#x27;t work as well on my hair in the hot, humid summer</li>
            <li>and this makes my hair manageable, soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Let me tell ya, I have tried dozens of different brands of hair serums, and this is the only one that smells really good and works in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am almost certain this stuff was made by a genius.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>There are days when it feels like my conditioner is doing absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>The days I use it I feel like a shampoo comercial ready and waiting.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This final touch makes hair shine and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and absolutely straight, so it would fall flat.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the one hair product I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>Smells good and is kinda watery which is good because its not too thick and definitely doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighed down or greasy!</li>
            <li>cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>This leaves your hair conditioned, particularly after blow drying.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(one pump is more than enough for my long hair)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too watered down and has a strong alcohol sent.</li>
            <li>And Now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I use this product in my fine hair and it works wonders to keep frizz down.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>This product is counterfeit or modified- does not arrive in original packaging and smells different from the Kerastase Cristalliste Lumiere Liquide bottle I bought at a salon last year.  </li>
            <li>(I recommend Potion 9), it is the BEST for my hair in cold, dry winter months.</li>
            <li>Let me just say I buy a LOT of high end hair products, particularly Kerastase items, and this one is markedly different than the rest.  </li>
            <li>so I can imagine that this product will last me much longer than the shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>and I use this product, so that my hair does feel soft and silky</li>
            <li>I find that I really enjoy the distinctive smell, which is somewhat masculine but fades completely within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I wanted to add smooth and shine to my long hair and it accomplishes this without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>I would have sent it back, but I happened to have kept my old bottle</li>
            <li>professionally colored blonde and</li>
            <li>Sorry just being honest.</li>
            <li>I normally air dry my hair</li>
            <li>JUST PREPARING A NEW ORDER BECAUSE THIS WILL NO LIVE LONGER</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used a tiny bit on dry hair on particularly humid days.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in my hair within the first few days of using it.</li>
            <li>I like many of the Kerastase products, but this particular one seems to leave a dull finish on my hair and makes it feel dry with little shine.</li>
            <li>this item is pure magic-making it shine without weighing it down!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or it can be a little oily.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very fine and very thin straight as a board hair that is about 3 inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a lot of shine without making it go flat.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, curly, long hair</li>
            <li> When this arrived I still had a few drops in my old bottle and the difference is VERY obvious-</li>
            <li> My hair had little frizz and looked like I had a professional blowout when I was done.</li>
            <li> I use the Lumiere liquid and have soft, silky, shiny hair for a few days afterward.  </li>
            <li> so I need to wash my hair every other day - sometimes even daily.</li>
            <li> I wish I trusted the other reviews that said the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and the ends tend to get dry</li>
            <li> I you this when my hair is wet to comb it out, when my hair is dy just before I curl or straighten it, and after I&#x27;m done styling to add a bit of polish.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not pretty.</li>
            <li> For the price of this, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> A few drops to wet hair makes blowdrying a breeze.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t feel like it weights the hair down</li>
            <li> Doesnt weigh hair down at all.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> and I apply a small amount of this Lumiere when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I Put just a Little on hair tips.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of any little frizzies after blow drying your hair and it does so weightlessly.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but a little goes a long way, e.g., a dime-sized drop smoothes my long hair.</li>
            <li> After a few days of feeling brittle and frizzy</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted-not greasy or too heavy.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about the quality of the product on my hair..</li>
            <li> Something was added to thin out and stretch the product, do not buy.  </li>
            <li> but it made the ends worse.</li>
            <li> Its just what I wanted except for the broken pump that it came with.</li>
            <li> To me if the label is fake then the product is too.</li>
            <li> It is definitely expensive, but &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> but from the smell and feel of the serum, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not for me- my hair frizzed terribly-</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I always buy Kerastase! But this particular product is AMAZING worth buying!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have dry hair, really helps with the ends!!! Helps make my hair shine!!!&lt;br /&gt;Great fast service!!! Cheaper on Amazon:)</li>
            <li> This is wonderful f you have dry or frizzy hair. It tames all the frizz and makes you hair look sleek and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product is counterfeit or modified- does not arrive in original packaging and smells different from the Kerastase Cristalliste Lumiere Liquide bottle I bought at a salon last year.  When this arrived I still had a few drops in my old bottle and the difference is VERY obvious- different feel, smell and does not work as well in my hair.  Something was added to thin out and stretch the product, do not buy.  Will be contacting amazon about this seller.</li>
            <li> I ordered this online because the price is so much better than in a salon. Great product for over treated hair. I have straight hair and still have body using this product line.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product at a store and was hooked. A few drops to wet hair makes blowdrying a breeze. My hair had little frizz and looked like I had a professional blowout when I was done. I&#x27;ve even used a tiny bit on dry hair on particularly humid days. This product makes me hair so soft and easy to manage, I love it. You really don&#x27;t need much (one pump is more than enough for my long hair) so I can imagine that this product will last me much longer than the shampoo/conditioner will</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it works in regards to making your hair feel silky but I don&#x27;t think it works in terms of frizziness. I normally air dry my hair and I use this product, so that my hair does feel soft and silky but it does not help the frizzies. For the price of this, it&#x27;s not worth it. Paul Mitchell - skinny serum works well for the silky feeling and the frizziness. So if you need something to help, I would suggest using the Paul Mitchess - skinny serum.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and when i have split ends it&#x27;s not pretty. My daughter&#x27;s friend is a hairdresser who gave my daughter a bottle of this good stuff. I used it and my daughter never got the bottle back. It relieves spit ends of frizz, it puts the shine of health in your hair and  most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my straight, fine hair. Love it!!!! well worth the price.</li>
            <li> FOR MY WIFE . SHE IS KIND OF CRAZY ABOUT KERASTASE PRODUCTS. JUST PREPARING A NEW ORDER BECAUSE THIS WILL NO LIVE LONGER</li>
            <li> I am almost certain this stuff was made by a genius.  I have very fine and very thin straight as a board hair that is about 3 inches past my shoulders. There are days when it feels like my conditioner is doing absolutely nothing for me.  After a few days of feeling brittle and frizzy I use the Lumiere liquid and have soft, silky, shiny hair for a few days afterward.  It doesn&#x27;t even take a full pump for me and I just work it from the ends and then run my comb through my hair to distribute it a bit more.  This product doesn&#x27;t feel like it weights the hair down what so ever.  The days I use it I feel like a shampoo comercial ready and waiting.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product has always worked well for my hair.  It was originally recommended by my hair stylist. I wanted to add smooth and shine to my long hair and it accomplishes this without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and the ends tend to get dry and when I saw this I decided to try it. I use the Kerastase conditioner and love it, but when I received this it was very watery and smelled like alcohol. I did try it once but it made the ends worse. Does not work. I do buy the conditioner from a store in the Untied States. Maybe that is the difference. Would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Great price terrific product, not heavy in hair and gives it a wonderful natural shine also.  If bought at a salon you would pay over $40</li>
            <li> I bought this at my salon and it is perfect for my hair extensions. I have a couple other Kerastase elixer formulas, but this is the best for me.  My long extensions look fabulous with this light formula and my own fine hair is improved in quality. I will continue to use this I. My hair care regimen even when I don&#x27;t wear extensions.&lt;br /&gt;Kerastase is worth EVERY penny.</li>
            <li> the label is not the correct size it is irregular and put on because it is crooked. It is a thicker feel to the product and when I got the product it was leaking from the top. To me if the label is fake then the product is too. Sorry just being honest.</li>
            <li> I like many of the Kerastase products, but this particular one seems to leave a dull finish on my hair and makes it feel dry with little shine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful finish for dry or unruly hair. Adds moisture and sheen.</li>
            <li> Great, lightweight. Doesnt weigh hair down at all. Makes hair shiny &amp; healthier. Improves hair the more it is used</li>
            <li> I have oily scalp so I need to wash my hair every other day - sometimes even daily. A Kerastase salon introduced me to this shampoo and although this is a pricy product it is every penny worth. I have been using it for the past 4 months and still havent run out of my first bottle. My hair is fine and absolutely straight, so it would fall flat. This shampoo has totally solved my problem. I recommend it for anyone who is willing to go an extra mile to keep their hair looking great.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It workshop well with unruly hair.it creates a nice natural shine as well. Well priced</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my hair really soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t build up on my hair like some other products do.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase to replenish the bottle I used up at home. Love it! Not only does it liven the texture and color of my color treated hair, it made it smell BEAUTIFUL! No need to spritz perfume when I have this product in my hair.</li>
            <li> It was the first time i have bought it. And Now I can&#x27;t live without it. I Put just a Little on hair tips. And my hair get perfect!</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy! This product has definitely been tampered with! I wish I trusted the other reviews that said the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too watered down and has a strong alcohol sent.</li>
            <li> This item shipped pretty quick to my home. Its just what I wanted except for the broken pump that it came with. The pump on the bottle that I received wouldn&#x27;t pump the liquid out of the bottle. I would have sent it back, but I happened to have kept my old bottle so I just switched out the tops. Also I got a great deal on the price, considering that the same stuff sold on stores is $50. However, if I didn&#x27;t have that extra pump, I would have lowered the stars. The best part was how quickly the item shipped and the cost.</li>
            <li> I you this when my hair is wet to comb it out, when my hair is dy just before I curl or straighten it, and after I&#x27;m done styling to add a bit of polish. I love it.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted-not greasy or too heavy.  Let me just say I buy a LOT of high end hair products, particularly Kerastase items, and this one is markedly different than the rest.  I have mid 40&#x27;s hair-starting to gray/getting coarse, professionally colored blonde and this item is pure magic-making it shine without weighing it down!  Love, Love, Love and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I use this product in my fine hair and it works wonders to keep frizz down. My boyfriend also remarks on how GREAT it smells. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle seems authentic (considering it&#x27;s glass and identical to my old one), I am fairly convinced that the product is not real. It has a strong rubbing alcohol smell (which is strange to me) and the texture is more watery than the bottles I&#x27;ve purchased from Kerastase. I&#x27;ve only used it once so I&#x27;m not sure about the quality of the product on my hair.. but from the smell and feel of the serum, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Let me tell ya, I have tried dozens of different brands of hair serums, and this is the only one that smells really good and works in my hair. It is definitely expensive, but &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Pretty good serum! Makes hair shiny and smooth! Smells good and is kinda watery which is good because its not too thick and definitely doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighed down or greasy! I use on damp hair before styling and its wonderful stuff!</li>
            <li> Best shining drops ever!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the thing that it doesn&#x27;t greasy my hair, I use it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> This is the fifth time I have bought this product! cannot live without it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I could tell a difference in my hair within the first few days of using it. I will definitey be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Not for me- my hair frizzed terribly- I love kerastase shampoos and conditoners- I bought this without doing the research. I used it twice- will not touch it again....$25</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just revised my original review as follows. While this conditioner doesn&#x27;t work as well on my hair in the hot, humid summer (I recommend Potion 9), it is the BEST for my hair in cold, dry winter months. I find that I really enjoy the distinctive smell, which is somewhat masculine but fades completely within a few minutes. This product is expensive, but a little goes a long way, e.g., a dime-sized drop smoothes my long hair.</li>
            <li> My mother loved it.  Score 10 out of 10. Expensive but it worth.  In fact, there is a cost benefit with this product. Satisfaction and feeling well  is priceless....</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> As always, Kerastase products can&#x27;t be beat. This leaves your hair conditioned, particularly after blow drying. It gets rid of any little frizzies after blow drying your hair and it does so weightlessly. Does not leave a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look/residue.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair shiny without weighing it down. I have very fine curly hair and I apply a small amount of this Lumiere when my hair is dry. It gives my hair a lot of shine without making it go flat. I am so glad I found the Cris Tal Liste Lumiere on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have coarse, curly, long hair and this makes my hair manageable, soft and frizz free. It also smells amazing!</li>
            <li> sI would prefer the product came in its packageing . The packaging was not there and the seal was removed . This can enable anyone to mix the product to make it go futher . I feel as if there is a difference in the quality of the product as it does not smell the same or have the same texture . it will be the last time I order it online . The difference in price from the store is 40 dollers . Because the packaging , quality of product, and removal of the seal I beleive the product is tampered with .</li>
            <li> Absolutely the one hair product I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> This final touch makes hair shine and smooth.  Don&#x27;t use too much or it can be a little oily.  Love this product!</li>
