            <li>The product is great at cleaning the skin and getting away excess oil</li>
            <li>Was hesitant to get this, Now I feel happy,</li>
            <li>someone knows of a  great way to help control the sebum production without antibiotics and prescription drugs please let me know.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li>Good product-</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product works better then the rest of the acne line.  </li>
            <li>The Refining sulfur mask is my favorite part.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic mask!</li>
            <li>I did see my skin gets better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but they dont seem to carry it any more.</li>
            <li>but there are cheaper products out there that work as well, maybe better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it more than once or maybe twice a week.</li>
            <li>I have always had oily skin and didn&#x27;t expect it to take that away, but it even made that somewhat better.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this again for sure.</li>
            <li>I work in a dermatology clinic and one of the doctors recommended this product to me, for my occasional pimples, and its awesome!</li>
            <li>: USE a good moisturizer and/or face lotion that is oil-free after using this mask and I find that it is better to use the face cream, right after the mask, at bedtime........</li>
            <li>Olay - clean up your act!</li>
            <li>but it is STRONG, and even after 10 minutes on my face, it was just too strong for me to use as an all over treatment.  </li>
            <li>If used just as directed this product works fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also important to note that this mask won&#x27;t prevent it,</li>
            <li>/&gt;7) IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for under the skin zits or cysts.</li>
            <li>As long as I continue to use it twice a week my skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away!</li>
            <li>I am in my 40&#x27;s, and still have super oily skin.  </li>
            <li>At first it caused a major breakout and then once it got everything underneath the surface my skin started really looking great.  </li>
            <li>Once or twice per week works okay on my skin, which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It works great to dry up the acne which is the whole purpose of the product.</li>
            <li>It has fantastic results and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin returns to an oily condition pretty quickly after use.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a month consistently and it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>this would probably not be good for the average person to do), and it has both cleared my acne and reduced the appearance of my pores.  </li>
            <li>It works very well on acne, and clears things up quickly.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much i purchased a regular size.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is okay.</li>
            <li>I used this on more difficult/larger pimples, and if they didn&#x27;t go away over night, they would go away after the second use.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it smells a little funny, but it works like magic!</li>
            <li>Still has breakouts (especially hormone-related) but otherwise MUCH clearer complexion and MUCH more gentle with no redness and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly on making the (my) face less oily.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>This stuff really works you can see results in 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Proactive...</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.</li>
            <li>It arrived much quicker than its estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped.  </li>
            <li>I found it here and had to order it as many other stores stopped stocking it.</li>
            <li>it did make my skin feel extra clean, but I don&#x27;t know if it helped it at all.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what made me decide to try a sulfur mask, but I have had amazing results with it.  </li>
            <li>It does make my face less oily and it helps my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with acne since I was in junior high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for pimple treatment.  </li>
            <li>Love that I do not have to use it everyday for results.</li>
            <li>and I have zero new ones.</li>
            <li>The large pores on my nose seem to be smaller.</li>
            <li>I have used this product along with Oley Pro-x clear set.</li>
            <li>and my face has been clear ever since I started.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t actually clear blemishes.</li>
            <li>I bought this product along with the Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol kit.</li>
            <li>After trying every in store acne wash and even Proactiv, I found Olay&#x27;s Professional Pro-X line.  </li>
            <li>If you  have any breakouts give this a go and in a couple days you&#x27;ll be completely renewed.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I was surprised at the size of the bottle, for the cost of the product.  </li>
            <li>The scar like spots are fading from the old ones and my skin is soft and there is no drying or peeling.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell but it is really not that bad and the results are more than worth it.</li>
            <li>I suffer from pretty bad acne, and have tried many over the counter, AND prescription items, but have not had much luck.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT smell as strong as other sulfur masks from other</li>
            <li>I leave it on over night, apply a thin layer over most of the face but avoid the eye area.</li>
            <li>i recommend this product to people that have break-outs alot due to oily skin, it works fast and does the job.</li>
            <li>I am officially trashing a half full tube of this because every single time I&#x27;ve applied it, the gunk has somehow made it into both eyes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have battled adult acne with most every product and treatment you can imagine, from inexpensive to VERY expensive.  </li>
            <li> It CAN be left on the face for at least two hours, which I have done without having much dryness.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin tight, pores clear and reduces blemishes.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out the skin as much as other acne medicines.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> After a few applications my face was totally clear.</li>
            <li> However, pay attention to the instructions: if you use it too often, it can dry your skin out and irritate it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over use it or your skin will completely dry out.</li>
            <li> I apply at night, it takes about 30 minutes to dry, then I wash it off in the morning.</li>
            <li> Upon using it for the first time, I was pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin smoother, a bit firmer, less oily, clear of white heads and black heads AND acnes....... but it MUST be used every other day or so and it takes a few days to see the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a gel cleanser, but needed something a little extra.</li>
            <li> I am now 37 and it can be hard to find things that work well on my skin and keep it clear without it breaking out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t over dry my skin like other products.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old woman who started getting huge under the skin pimples that have left horrible scars/ red spots all over my face.</li>
            <li> And this small bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> In the morning the pores are smaller and it has visibly shrunk and dried the pimples.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy it again due to the smell, price and effectiveness for that price.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t there some way to formulate this without methylparaben and other harmful ingredients?</li>
            <li> (again, my skin is extremely oily-</li>
            <li> It CAN be used every other day/night for the two hour</li>
            <li> and I stopped the other medicine.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways and this product is sold for less on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I put this on the spot and left it for a few hours and when I washed it off, it was probably half its original size and significantly less painful.</li>
            <li> I found using it once or twice a week was sufficient to keep much of my acne at bay, and continue to use this product whenever I have a particularly difficult outbreak.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every other day and all of my pimples are dried up</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot less oily too.  </li>
            <li> Pores are less visible.</li>
            <li> I just started using this a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice this feeling when using the product, and also, after trying a few times, I don&#x27;t find my acne to be lessened any.  </li>
            <li> Just dries my skin out pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I have been so self conscientious about this for the past few months.</li>
            <li> other products (i.e. proActive) were too harsh on her skin/drying it out/irritating it and making things worse.  </li>
            <li> I have acne on my face and neck and it tends to get worse around the period time.</li>
            <li> Since I got off the pill the acne has gotten worse.</li>
            <li> However, if you stop using it for a week acne gets worse.</li>
            <li> I even went to the dermatologist and received an Rx medication that did nothing except make my skin peel which made me feel like I looked even worse.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a single skin benefit and now I wouldn&#x27;t even consider using this crap again if someone promised me I&#x27;d come out looking like Amber Heard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced mustard gas or mace, but I imagine it&#x27;s similar to the gruesome pain inflicted by this stuff when you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I had one brewing on my jaw that was hard and painful.</li>
            <li> It has been driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> In addition the product stinks!</li>
            <li> And it smells awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product along with the Olay Professional Pro-X Clear Acne Protocol kit. I&#x27;ve used it twice a week for about a month with mixed results. The product is great at cleaning the skin and getting away excess oil but I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin returns to an oily condition pretty quickly after use. In addition the product stinks! I realize that a sulfur mask will smell like sulfur but others that I have used lose the smell after the mask is washed off. The smell from this mask lasts about a day after it&#x27;s used. Overall this product is okay. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again due to the smell, price and effectiveness for that price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I cannot find it in stores. This stuff really works you can see results in 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product works better then the rest of the acne line.  I used this on more difficult/larger pimples, and if they didn&#x27;t go away over night, they would go away after the second use.  I found using it once or twice a week was sufficient to keep much of my acne at bay, and continue to use this product whenever I have a particularly difficult outbreak.</li>
            <li> After trying every in store acne wash and even Proactiv, I found Olay&#x27;s Professional Pro-X line.  What a difference!  The Refining sulfur mask is my favorite part.  My product arrived on time, works great, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I just started using this a few months ago. It works very well on acne, and clears things up quickly. However, pay attention to the instructions: if you use it too often, it can dry your skin out and irritate it. Once or twice per week works okay on my skin, which is very sensitive. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mask! Leaves your skin tight, pores clear and reduces blemishes.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t there some way to formulate this without methylparaben and other harmful ingredients? Why do we need to increase our risk of breast cancer and put something on our face that prematurely ages skin (methylparaben) just to fight acne? Not worth it. Olay - clean up your act!</li>
            <li> I have used this product along with Oley Pro-x clear set. I did see my skin gets better. It is milder than the proactive one I have used before.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this about once a month and I love it! Yes, it smells a little funny, but it works like magic! Don&#x27;t over use it or your skin will completely dry out. If you  have any breakouts give this a go and in a couple days you&#x27;ll be completely renewed.</li>

Haven&#x27;t noticed a single skin benefit and now I wouldn&#x27;t even consider using this crap again if someone promised me I&#x27;d come out looking like Amber Heard.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this mask. We use to get it from ***mart but they dont seem to carry it any more. I found it here and had to order it as many other stores stopped stocking it.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to get this, Now I feel happy, this gives splendid results... Thanks Proactive...</li>
            <li> This does the job but there are cheaper products out there that work as well, maybe better. Drys out the skin as well.</li>
            <li> I recieved a sample in the mail about 2 months ago to just try it. And the sample lasted for almost a month. I only use it on my break-outs to minimize the irritation it can cause. It works great to dry up the acne which is the whole purpose of the product. I liked it so much i purchased a regular size. i recommend this product to people that have break-outs alot due to oily skin, it works fast and does the job. Please follow the directions as indicated and it will work as stated.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask. It does have a strong smell but it is really not that bad and the results are more than worth it. It can be drying so I don&#x27;t use it more than once or maybe twice a week. It does make my face less oily and it helps my skin look better. It arrived much quicker than its estimated arrival date. I will buy this product again and would re-purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with acne since I was in junior high school. I am now 37 and it can be hard to find things that work well on my skin and keep it clear without it breaking out. I use a gel cleanser, but needed something a little extra. I like Olay products so decided to try the sulphur mask. I noticed a difference right away! After a few applications my face was totally clear. I have always had oily skin and didn&#x27;t expect it to take that away, but it even made that somewhat better. I use a gel cleanser for that, though. I use it 2-3 times a week and my face has been clear ever since I started.</li>
            <li> If used just as directed this product works fantastic.  At first it caused a major breakout and then once it got everything underneath the surface my skin started really looking great.  As long as I continue to use it twice a week my skin looks and feels great.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s, and still have super oily skin.  I have battled adult acne with most every product and treatment you can imagine, from inexpensive to VERY expensive.  I am not sure what made me decide to try a sulfur mask, but I have had amazing results with it.  I know you are supposed to use it twice a week, but I have been using it daily (again, my skin is extremely oily- this would probably not be good for the average person to do), and it has both cleared my acne and reduced the appearance of my pores.  My skin is a lot less oily too.  I am thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work. Just dries my skin out pretty bad. It doesn&#x27;t actually clear blemishes. And it smells awful.</li>
            <li> I have acne on my face and neck and it tends to get worse around the period time. Since I got off the pill the acne has gotten worse. This mask is the best over the counter product I have found. I leave it on over night, apply a thin layer over most of the face but avoid the eye area. In the morning the pores are smaller and it has visibly shrunk and dried the pimples. However, if you stop using it for a week acne gets worse. I have been using it for a month consistently and it has helped tremendously. It&#x27;s also important to note that this mask won&#x27;t prevent it, but rather it just treats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone knows of a  great way to help control the sebum production without antibiotics and prescription drugs please let me know.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I start to break out. It dries my pimples up within a week. And this small bottle last a long time. I use it as a spot treatment n leave it on when I sleep.</li>
            <li> I suffer from pretty bad acne, and have tried many over the counter, AND prescription items, but have not had much luck.  Someone recently told me to try this product, and I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores, so, ordered it through Amazon.  When it arrived, I was surprised at the size of the bottle, for the cost of the product.  Upon using it for the first time, I was pretty disappointed.  Maybe its because when I use a facial mask, I &#x27;like&#x27; the feeling when my skin tingles a bit.  I didn&#x27;t notice this feeling when using the product, and also, after trying a few times, I don&#x27;t find my acne to be lessened any.  I would not recommend/I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 18-year-old daughter who has been struggling with acne...other products (i.e. proActive) were too harsh on her skin/drying it out/irritating it and making things worse.  This product has really helped.  Still has breakouts (especially hormone-related) but otherwise MUCH clearer complexion and MUCH more gentle with no redness and no irritation.  Give it a try.  This is a great price!</li>
            <li> LOVE. Cleared up my skin within a week. I will purchase this again for sure. It didn&#x27;t over dry my skin like other products. Balanced out perfectly.</li>
            <li> 1) It does NOT smell as strong as other sulfur masks from other brands.&lt;br /&gt;2) It works amazingly on making the (my) face less oily.&lt;br /&gt;3) Does not dry out the skin as much as other acne medicines.&lt;br /&gt;4) It CAN be left on the face for at least two hours, which I have done without having much dryness.&lt;br /&gt;5) It CAN be used every other day/night for the two hour period.&lt;br /&gt;6) Made my skin smoother, a bit firmer, less oily, clear of white heads and black heads AND acnes....... but it MUST be used every other day or so and it takes a few days to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;7) IMPORTANT: USE a good moisturizer and/or face lotion that is oil-free after using this mask and I find that it is better to use the face cream, right after the mask, at bedtime........ a cream that is hydrating is the best.</li>
            <li> I work in a dermatology clinic and one of the doctors recommended this product to me, for my occasional pimples, and its awesome! I initially used it all over my face but it is STRONG, and even after 10 minutes on my face, it was just too strong for me to use as an all over treatment.  So I use this product on a pimple here and there and it speeds up the healing.  I apply at night, it takes about 30 minutes to dry, then I wash it off in the morning. I highly recommend for pimple treatment.  A little goes a long ways and this product is sold for less on Amazon than in the stores.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for under the skin zits or cysts. I had one brewing on my jaw that was hard and painful. I put this on the spot and left it for a few hours and when I washed it off, it was probably half its original size and significantly less painful. It does smell like sulfur, but not unbearably. It has fantastic results and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old woman who started getting huge under the skin pimples that have left horrible scars/ red spots all over my face. It has been driving me crazy. I have been so self conscientious about this for the past few months. I even went to the dermatologist and received an Rx medication that did nothing except make my skin peel which made me feel like I looked even worse. I started use of this product two weeks ago and I stopped the other medicine. I have been using it every other day and all of my pimples are dried up and I have zero new ones. The scar like spots are fading from the old ones and my skin is soft and there is no drying or peeling. The large pores on my nose seem to be smaller. I am so very happy I tried this product. It works! Barbi</li>
            <li> Good product- it did make my skin feel extra clean, but I don&#x27;t know if it helped it at all.  I also didn&#x27;t use this product religiously, so maybe that skewed the results.</li>
            <li> Visible difference after each use. Love that I do not have to use it everyday for results. Pores are less visible.</li>
