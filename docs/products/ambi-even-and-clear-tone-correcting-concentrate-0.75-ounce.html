            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, the texture is smooth like a lotion slash serum but a bit greasy...</li>
            <li>It sure as heck didn&#x27;t on me!y face in conjunction with this product)</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, the texture is smooth like a lotion slash serum but a bit greasy...</li>
            <li>I have been using this for more than 3 months already and my sun spot is still there.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>Apply in the day time and be sure to use a moisturizer with spf15, to ensure that the spots don&#x27;t darken more.</li>
            <li>I love using this item on my face.</li>
            <li>This product is so amazing and the smell is so pleasant, I will buy again to make my scars disappear completely.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly as described!</li>
            <li>For light discoloration from acne and dark(ish) spots, I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B0073ANH14</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and goes on pretty easy, there&#x27;s no weird smell or anything, I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>Smell good thou but only that.</li>
            <li>I liked the Ambi Even &amp; Clear skin correcting concentrate because it works fast.</li>
            <li>im pleased with it thus far.</li>
            <li>Compared to Eminence, Ambi is priced just right for me.</li>
            <li>So--when I read that this new product didn&#x27;t have Hydroquinone, plus Ambi&#x27;s trusted name AND uses similar ingredients as my L&#x27;oreal Serum, I thought, too good to be true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product smells nice and absorbs quickly but after using for over a month, I don&#x27;t see any differenece in my skin tone or the dark spots.  </li>
            <li>for her age spots, but most of those products use Hydroquinone, a possible carcinogen.</li>
            <li>know a lot of people swear by other Ambi products, including my own mother who uses [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>(or that it just doesn&#x27;t play nicely with the other products I put on my face in conjunction with this product)</li>
            <li>Ambi even and clear tone works wonders not only does it clear your skins you are left with a beautiful glow</li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>This works and it works fast and well...</li>
            <li>and I can really see a change in the tone of my skin, my mother notices it as well.</li>
            <li>but since it does what it&#x27;s supposed to I can&#x27;t really complain about that.</li>
            <li>Have only used it a few days so far so good!</li>
            <li>I love Ambi products, they work for me like none other</li>
            <li>Even though the FDA has approved a level of 2% Hydroquinone as &#x27;safe&#x27; (anything higher, such as 4% that&#x27;s allowed in EU countries, is banned by the FDA), I&#x27;d rather avoid products with that ingredient, especially since it&#x27;s going on my face.</li>
            <li>Now, at first, I thought it was just my skin acting up with the seasons or that I&#x27;d been out more and using sunscreen, in the pool and such, so I used it once a day at night, instead of morning and night.</li>
            <li>For me,it was effective in treating minor scars on my knee (from falling)back when I was younger.</li>
            <li>I noticed results within two weeks and was able to use less coverage make up.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a mild product that will even you out.</li>
            <li>Ambi Fade Cream, Normal Skin,</li>
            <li>B000GO41X2 Ambi Fade Cream, Normal Skin, 2 oz.]]</li>
            <li>Once my skin cleared up again, and I resumed use of the product on my normal routine, the breakouts continued.</li>
            <li>Now I have found my new connection.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better everyday, yayy!</li>
            <li>I spent $50.00 on a small 2 oz container of Eminence bright skin Masque and it is not doing a thing for me.</li>
            <li>B000NN7FT8 Ambi Skincare Even &amp; Clear Foaming Cleanser, 6-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li>I have adults acne and this product helps clear my blemishes while I use proactive to keep my acne under control...</li>
            <li>So far not seeing any results</li>
            <li>i have seen one spot almost completely gone</li>
            <li>my skin is also sensitive and did not cause any allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all of the stuff that Proactive offers and those products did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t fading the dark spots as quickly as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>So far I have yet to see any significant results; it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how fast it lightened my dark spots up.</li>
            <li>Eminence might work for someone else and if you get discouraged by another persons misfortune of a product not working for them you might be missing out on the right product for yourself.</li>
            <li>Not only has it done nothing after nearly using an entire tube, it made me break out wherever I put it.</li>
            <li>The tone correcter actually irritates my sinuses a little bit, but I don&#x27;t even care because it really works for me.</li>

            <li> Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector, 1 Fluid Ounce]], which has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products to remove the dark marks from my face.</li>
            <li> After using for several weeks, my spots (not that dark either) are still there.</li>

            <li> Ambi&#x27;s fade cream causes me to have breakouts and other products I have used</li>
            <li> a large crazy glue - especially for $10 dollars</li>
            <li> I used it every day on my face , under arm dark spot.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they work, very well.</li>
            <li> But to all of you suffering from dark marks on your face, don&#x27;t give up find what works for you.</li>
            <li> I was tired of feeling insecure about being so light with dark acne scars on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This product helped the dark circles under my eyes and a few dark spots I had.</li>
            <li> but three others just slightly faded but still visible.</li>
            <li> only got one complaint, it&#x27;s a really small tube -like</li>
            <li> My skin rarely reacts badly to products, if at all.</li>
            <li> it is not too harsh on the skin and helps with acne prone skin as well.</li>
            <li> a lot of dark spots are fading although I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s coming from the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have seen visible results and it never feels greasy, heavy, or make me breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried a few of the products that are offered at places like Wal-Mart and Target.</li>
            <li> Obsviously the same complaint as others... is very small the tube.</li>
            <li> When I received this product the tube was so small</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic improvements in the dark spots on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using proactiv a few months ago and tried using their dark spot corrector which is useless, thank you Ambi!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s game</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s game</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and it is wonderful. I had an issue with sudden break outs when I had a allergic reaction to some hand soap. When I touched my face after washing and drying my hands I would have a break out. This cream had faded all of the scars from the break outs in a month of using it once a day. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t fading the dark spots as quickly as I hoped it would. But I do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few days so far so good!</li>
            <li> Ambi even and clear tone works wonders not only does it clear your skins you are left with a beautiful glow</li>
            <li> yes I love it. I used it every day on my face , under arm dark spot. even for stretch marks</li>
            <li> It really does work.  Give it a try, I&#x27;m glad I did!  Aveeno cleanser + brightening daily moisturizer in combination has almost cleared my age spots in just 2 weeks.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I liked the Ambi Even &amp; Clear skin correcting concentrate because it works fast. I saw immediate results after just one week of usage. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> When I received this product the tube was so small I thought it wouldn&#x27;t last long but it last about a month or so. I was so surprised at how fast it lightened my dark spots up. I was tired of feeling insecure about being so light with dark acne scars on my cheeks. This product is so amazing and the smell is so pleasant, I will buy again to make my scars disappear completely. I didn&#x27;t like how my product didn&#x27;t have an expiration date on it that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> So far not seeing any results but wilk give miee time!</li>
            <li> I started using proactiv a few months ago and tried using their dark spot corrector which is useless, thank you Ambi! This works and it works fast and well...My skin is looking better everyday, yayy!</li>
            <li> This product helped the dark circles under my eyes and a few dark spots I had. My complextion looks so much better.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  it is not too harsh on the skin and helps with acne prone skin as well.</li>
            <li> I love Ambi products, they work for me like none other and I&#x27;d been looking for this specific one for quite some time, I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a week now twice a day along with [[ASIN:B000NN7FT8 Ambi Skincare Even &amp; Clear Foaming Cleanser, 6-Ounce Bottle]] and I can really see a change in the tone of my skin, my mother notices it as well. It&#x27;s a bit lighter and a lot of dark spots are fading although I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s coming from the [[ASIN:B000GO41X2 Ambi Fade Cream, Normal Skin, 2 oz.]]either way it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s light and goes on pretty easy, there&#x27;s no weird smell or anything, I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it ends up with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 instead of 5?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only got one complaint, it&#x27;s a really small tube -like a large crazy glue - especially for $10 dollars but since it does what it&#x27;s supposed to I can&#x27;t really complain about that. I do wish it was bigger but other than that I can say it&#x27;s been a really good investment.</li>
            <li> i have been using it now for well over a month. every day. i have seen one spot almost completely gone but three others just slightly faded but still visible. i will continue to use. i do feel it works but if you are looking for a something that is instantly going to work i dont believe this is the cream. the consistency of the cream is good and it does not have any strong smell. my skin is also sensitive and did not cause any allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I love this! It is a product I have been using this product for years. It actually does what it says. Wal-mart recently discontinued sales. Now I have found my new connection.</li>
            <li> For light discoloration from acne and dark(ish) spots, I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B0073ANH14 Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector, 1 Fluid Ounce]], which has worked for me.

Besides the unpleasant smell and short shelf life if not kept in a very cool, dry place, it&#x27;s always made me leery. Even though the FDA has approved a level of 2% Hydroquinone as &#x27;safe&#x27; (anything higher, such as 4% that&#x27;s allowed in EU countries, is banned by the FDA), I&#x27;d rather avoid products with that ingredient, especially since it&#x27;s going on my face.

I&#x27;ve seen the results...So--when I read that this new product didn&#x27;t have Hydroquinone, plus Ambi&#x27;s trusted name AND uses similar ingredients as my L&#x27;oreal Serum, I thought, too good to be true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, it is. I am left utterly unimpressed with the results. Or lack there of. Not only has it done nothing after nearly using an entire tube, it made me break out wherever I put it. My skin rarely reacts badly to products, if at all. The product either works, or doesn&#x27;t--no skin irritations or other problems. Now, at first, I thought it was just my skin acting up with the seasons or that I&#x27;d been out more and using sunscreen, in the pool and such, so I used it once a day at night, instead of morning and night. Once my skin cleared up again, and I resumed use of the product on my normal routine, the breakouts continued. Once again, I thought it was something else (or that it just doesn&#x27;t play nicely with the other products I put on my face in conjunction with this product) so I stopped using it all together and my skin cleared up. Coincidence? Fool me once, fool me twice, fool me thrice and it&#x27;s game over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is super small and goes a long way as long as you&#x27;re not slathering it on your entire face. At your local WalMart, it&#x27;s only a couple bucks, so it wasn&#x27;t a complete waste of money. The smell is nice, the texture is smooth like a lotion slash serum but a bit greasy...hence, breakouts wherever I was putting it on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t help I have oily skin to begin with and I didn&#x27;t see a version for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway. In the end, it&#x27;ll work for some, and not for others. It sure as heck didn&#x27;t on me!y face in conjunction with this product) so I stopped using it all together and my skin cleared up. Coincidence?

            <li> Item arrived quickly as described! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and absorbs quickly but after using for over a month, I don&#x27;t see any differenece in my skin tone or the dark spots.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> hate it wast of money</li>
            <li> Been using for over 12 months with no signs of improvement. Makes your skin yellow.</li>
            <li> I like the texture, and I noticed the changes in 1 week. Obsviously the same complaint as others... is very small the tube.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product works. I have been using this for more than 3 months already and my sun spot is still there.If it works, I&#x27;d need a magnifying glass to see it. I&#x27;ve used it regularly from the beginning but when I don&#x27;t see big improvements, my use have fluctuated.Sometimes I think that one of my sunspot has decreased but it could be my mind just wanting to justify this purchase.I&#x27;d tell people to try Sebo de Macho from the Philippines. For me,it was effective in treating minor scars on my knee (from falling)back when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Everything is not made for everybody, but this product works for me. I have tried countless products to remove the dark marks from my face. Ambi&#x27;s fade cream causes me to have breakouts and other products I have used have made the marks even darker. The tone correcter actually irritates my sinuses a little bit, but I don&#x27;t even care because it really works for me. I spent $50.00 on a small 2 oz container of Eminence bright skin Masque and it is not doing a thing for me. Compared to Eminence, Ambi is priced just right for me. But to all of you suffering from dark marks on your face, don&#x27;t give up find what works for you. Eminence might work for someone else and if you get discouraged by another persons misfortune of a product not working for them you might be missing out on the right product for yourself.</li>
            <li> I love this product...I have adults acne and this product helps clear my blemishes while I use proactive to keep my acne under control...im pleased with it thus far.</li>
            <li> So far I have yet to see any significant results; it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Ambi Skin Care Cleansing Bar.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic improvements in the dark spots on my skin.  Have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. After using for several weeks, my spots (not that dark either) are still there. I am shopping around for something else to buy.</li>
            <li> Its been 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen improvement. Give it time and use it religiously. Apply at night and don&#x27;t apply another moisturizer over it. Apply in the day time and be sure to use a moisturizer with spf15, to ensure that the spots don&#x27;t darken more.</li>
            <li> I love using this item on my face. I have seen visible results and it never feels greasy, heavy, or make me breakout. I would definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a mild product that will even you out.</li>
            <li> I noticed results within two weeks and was able to use less coverage make up. The product does not containing sunscreen so you will need to use another product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for close to five months now and it is the best fading cream I&#x27;ve used thus far! I&#x27;ve tried all of the stuff that Proactive offers and those products did nothing for me. I&#x27;ve also tried a few of the products that are offered at places like Wal-Mart and Target. Nothing has worked as well as Ambi&#x27;s product. I give this my highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it. Smell good thou but only that.</li>
