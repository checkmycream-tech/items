            <li>It is Amazing!</li>
            <li>Rivitalash is amazing !</li>
            <li>After using it for 6 weeks the results were remarkable.</li>
            <li>I have used Revitalash for many years &amp; have found it to be the best product for your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I feel so much more attractive!!!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled with my lashes now, and would recommend Revitalash to anyone!  </li>
            <li>PERFECT BROWS is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>All in all the product is good.  </li>
            <li>I have used Revitalash for years and like everyone else has said you have to be patient, it takes a good 3 to 4 weeks before you start to see anything...</li>
            <li>Good but for price?</li>
            <li>Sooooo good.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it good for others</li>
            <li>They are more beautiful than when I was in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s not the result I was looking for when I bought the product, but I&#x27;m glad I was able to find a use that makes me almost as happy!</li>
            <li>but I was really impressed at how quickly I noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and was very satisfied with results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for a month now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with product and shipper</li>
            <li>Love this product, been using it for 2 years with great results......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product works great for others</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m in love and will always use the product!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>better than mascara!</li>
            <li>You will never regret of buying this, in fact this is one of my most successful purchases.</li>
            <li>For sure my lashes are now stronger, longer and fuller!</li>
            <li>Works its magic!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Makes the goodly wife super happy..</li>
            <li>A touch of mascara and you have amazing lashes.  </li>
            <li>Amazing products.</li>
            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>Its just an amazing product</li>
            <li>Amazing....</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made my light brown lashes any darker, but fuller and longer is great.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>(although it would have been nice)</li>
            <li>But am I loving the results.</li>
            <li>Also, Revitalash acts as a nice grooming product.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased this I honestly didn’t expect to be amazed, but I am.</li>
            <li>But they do look spectacular.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes and eyebrows are growing nicely after using this product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, it really works!!!</li>
            <li>I HAD to return to my original product!!</li>
            <li>Excellent seller, highly recommended +</li>
            <li>Very easy application and didn&#x27;t have any issues with it changing pigment on eyelids or eye color.</li>
            <li>So I purchased Revitalash in early January, used on both my top and bottom lashes, and after about one month, my eyelashes looked really good ... about as good as they did with the IMax serum, so I was happy.</li>
            <li>The ones here on Amazon are a good price with free shipping....</li>
            <li>This stuff is by far the best!!</li>
            <li>This product was even more effective before bimoprost was removed because Allergan claimed patent infringement, but even without it, my lashes are noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li>but I tuley have seen some pretty great results.</li>
            <li>Both had great reviews, and although Latisse seems to have a stronger formula--the perk of not needing a prescription led me to try Revitalash first.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work - when I received the product, the container was very light and wondered if there was any product inside.</li>
            <li>I will buy this again when my original tube runs out because I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Then after another month, in early March, they looked really full and nice, so I was VERY happy.</li>
            <li>Best product for lash lengthening out there, amazing results and the bottle lasts for a very long time .</li>
            <li>This has made a huge difference in my lashes!  </li>
            <li>Yes ma&#x27;am, I sure am.</li>
            <li>Best thing ever I have very short eyelashes</li>
            <li>(i apply at night after my face is washed), and don&#x27;t apply it more than once a day-</li>
            <li>I LOVE product and have recommended it many times.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it has made my lashes longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s taken me a day, and many of the enhancers that don&#x27;t have prostoglandins also do not work.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Longer, and more of &#x27;em!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>#34;you look more refreshed, what&#x27;s new?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah.  </li>
            <li>Most reviews said they saw results in 3 months.</li>
            <li>but I still want to get more growth - as in thickness.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and the Revitabrow.</li>
            <li>I had originally gotten a sample from a friend and fell in love!</li>
            <li>It more lengthens the lashes (perhaps by accelerating growth?)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I use every night and absolutely love my results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did my research and ordered it.</li>
            <li>but all it does is highlight the lashes so you can see them better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will never stop using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with them</li>
            <li>I love this product, I don&#x27;t have to use mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it more stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;OR</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it works. :)</li>
            <li>Love it.....</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I began to notice a difference within 2 weeks and after a month is was even more noticeable.</li>
            <li>but I love the result.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than Latisse as it is easier to apply.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to search for the next best &amp;#34;fake lashes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>Better than latisse.  </li>
            <li>One tube lasted me more than two years.</li>
            <li>my all-time favorite beauty trick.....have been using for many years.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered more and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use Revitalash for sure.</li>
            <li>Even though this product is better than the nourishe (sp?)</li>
            <li>and they were ok.</li>
            <li>It definitely works and does make your lashes longer and thicker, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>We are all looking for better products.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The screw top broke and</li>
            <li>For me, this product surely works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my lashes longer and more plentiful</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over 2 years and love it...</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Makes lash-challenged lids look more normal and attractive.</li>
            <li>Perhaps issue is that I&#x27;m older and the effect isn&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li>It took about 6 weeks of nightly use for me to start seeing results, but I am very happy with how long my lashes are getting and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>just long, beautiful lashes!!!</li>
            <li>Super worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Love this product and it came quickly!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This product is safe for people with light eyes.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;love, love, love&amp;#34; the Revitalash Advanced Eyelash Conditioner..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also looked this up on the EWG website, and believe it or not, it is a 2, which makes me even more comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it while on vacation in Hawaii, at a spa, and the sales gal was so convincing that I couldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying my brows look perfect and lush, but I don&#x27;t have to use as much eye brow filler and the filler</li>
            <li>I have my eyelashes back and happy :)</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>but I spent hundreds on those extensions which ruined my own lashes (which weren&#x27;t that great to begin with).</li>
            <li>Easy to apply applicator allows the formula to go on easy.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what an amazing result!</li>
            <li>All of the women in the doctors office had such beautiful lashes.  </li>
            <li>Lasts for awhile, helps with the fine hair growth and it&#x27;s a must have in my routine.  </li>
            <li>so purchased Revitalash and have been a loyal fan ever since!  </li>
            <li>I can barely express my love and gratitude for this product!!</li>
            <li>Saw a huge change in the length of my lashes in a matter of 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>both fantastic  75yrs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sparse spots filled in and my lashes are longer and stronger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and It is great!</li>
            <li>I just blink lightly until it dries.</li>
            <li>It really helps with form a nice coating on lashes.</li>
            <li>I apply it lightly once day before bed.</li>
            <li>Fantastic...</li>
            <li>I started to see bald spots being filled in within 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Been using Revitalash Advanced for years now, on my brows, and it&#x27;s all &amp;#34;that and more&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Used a different product and had great result</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Anyway, so far so good.</li>
            <li>look how much they&#x27;ve grown!!!)</li>
            <li>I very rarely take the time to write a review but after using revitalash for over a year I felt compelled to write one.</li>
            <li>(well....maybe for a very special occasion) as they really look over the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is super easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I then just used it a couple of nights a week to maintain them and as others have mentioned, I love being able to get away with minimal eye makeup most days!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now buying my second bottle of Revitalash because, despite my skepticism, it has worked amazingly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other lash conditioners and Revitalash is consistently the best performer.  </li>
            <li>Love it, it really works, after going through chemo and losing my eyelashes, they are long and beautiful now.  </li>
            <li>Have used this successfully for several years.</li>
            <li>I have used the lash conditioning product many times and it never fails me.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>When I used the original Revitalash</li>
            <li>Love revitalash same ingredients and just as effective as the prescription brand.</li>
            <li>I love being able to leave the house with a really natural appearance.</li>
            <li>I am currently looking for more effective products but Eyebrows Growth Accelerator Balm</li>
            <li>This is the third eyelash serum I&#x27;ve tried, and so far it is the best.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing and completely replaces faux lashes, in terms of fullness and length.</li>
            <li>Also.... amazingly ... they have a natural curl to them now.</li>
            <li>Must keep using it, though, to keep the lashes looking full and longer.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Revitalsh because a fellow youtuber I follow uses the same product and good lord</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the full results in another 4 months.</li>
            <li>I can confidently say that they are my real lashes.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product now for a full year.</li>
            <li>The reason I am not giving it the full 5 stars is because it did not make my eyelashes thicker</li>
            <li>Like many creams and lotions that really do nothing.</li>
            <li>The effective is clear to see.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>I start on my right eye first and seem to give it more effort and have noticed that my eyelashes on my right are longer!  </li>
            <li>and now since I&#x27;m so happy with the length I will apply the product every other night.</li>
            <li>I have a mild case of Alopecia Areata, which causes a section of my eyelashes to fall out when I am stressed.</li>
            <li>When I stopped the results faded fairly quickly, maybe 5-7 days or so.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Some of the longest eyelashes need to trimmed because they have continued growing quickly, but the rest have slowed.</li>
            <li>I have seen tremendous results in 2 months.</li>
            <li>I had short lashes and now they are long and beautiful!</li>
            <li>They are much longer!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely works!!</li>
            <li>When it starts working it only gets better!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>I researched quite a few lash serums and Revitalash had great reviews.</li>
            <li>(without success) I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month along with taking biotin (a supplement for hair growth)</li>
            <li>It might be worth looking into Galaxy Eyelash Serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 4 weeks now and have noticed considerable growth and darkening of my eyelashes (which is great because they were a darker blonde before</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had these kind of lashes for last 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Its worth the $.</li>
            <li>is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Then the challenge would be to find a mascara that wasn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; lest it flatten out the freshly curled lashes.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>but worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth any price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>I still think its worth it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if worth the money?</li>
            <li>Originally bought at a spa but found it much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price and it works as long as you remember to use it regularly :)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work right away.</li>
            <li>I have been asked many times if they are fake or I am complemented on how beautiful they are.</li>
            <li>I tracked down the Advanced formula and it amazing</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used this in the past with great results.</li>
            <li>after they are nice and full you can apply every other day.  </li>
            <li>Was a little nervous to order this due to cost but figured if it had so many reviews of would be great and worth it!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m naturally blonde, my hair and lashes are very fine.</li>
            <li>Ship really fast which meant I can have great lashes a little quicker</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, as I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li>I quickly checked on Ebay and found it much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing product, and I am now obsessed with it for good.</li>
            <li>When I put mascara on, my lashes are so long and full, I really love this product</li>
            <li>I read quite a few excellent reviews on this product and hoped for similar results.</li>
            <li>, if you can find such products, do another thorough search to find out what kind of reviews that particular product has.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t get you result any quicker and will most likely just bother your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First one lasted 2-1/2 years.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine what it does for healthy lashes.</li>
            <li>When I first purchased Revitalash it was $150.00 a tube....</li>
            <li>For the first 2 days I used this, my eyes were SO IRRITATED.</li>
            <li>I did also notice that the area around the creases of my eyes were darkened for about the first week of using it, but nobody else noticed or said anything.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Instructions say to apply moisturizer first, then wait 5 minutes to apply the product.  </li>
            <li>My first tube has lasted me 3 months</li>
            <li>Really Works!</li>
            <li>My eyes are still the bright green I was born with.  </li>
            <li>but I woke up and honestly thought I had pink eye.</li>
            <li>product darkened the pigmentation of my eyelids at first, but now seems to have lightened up some.&lt;br</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I am very please!</li>
            <li>I do feel the eyelashes touching my upper eyelid.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>My lashes have for sure not gotten shorter and I am starting to see some growth.</li>
            <li>All kidding aside, most of my lashes seem to double in length.</li>
            <li>enough so, that I have been asked more than once, &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li>I was a fake eyelash user and now - I have my own!!!  </li>
            <li>So glad revitalash is back!!</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair-skinned.</li>
            <li>so the effect was rather pretty.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Waited a month before trying again to see if it&#x27;d be better, but same thing.  </li>
            <li>Definitely ordering it again, works way better than the cheaper versions.</li>
            <li>My new trick is to just curl them and set them with clear mascara for a nice, relaxed, natural look.</li>
            <li>Eyebrows Growth Accelerator Balm PERFECT BROWS actually does promotes the growth of new hairs but it takes a few months to begin working</li>
            <li>I spent my teens, 20&#x27;s, and 30&#x27;s using an eyelash curler that I would warm up with my hair dryer in order to &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; my straight, stubby lashes.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for over 3 years and my lashes have consistently been evenly full with a natural looking upward curve.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit watery and you do not need to put much on the brush to get results, plus it will last longer this way. :)</li>
            <li>Competitor  also comes with 60 little applicators, two per day, what does that tell you, lasts only a moth, Revitalash is good for four months!</li>
            <li>I love how long eyelashes have grown.</li>
            <li>I have used Revitalise before and it really does make your lashes grow longer, but you just haveto be consistent with aapplying it each night.  </li>
            <li>But after using this product and waiting for my full lash cycle to complete with this product, my lashes became longer, darker and thicker.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the original stuff by far...but still helps my poor ole lashes.</li>
            <li>My lashes are lush and full again.</li>
            <li>There is a mild eye irritation (stinging) if you get it directly in the eye</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Latisse before but it was too strong for me and made my eyes red, swollen and itchy.</li>
            <li>I tried Smart Lash and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 46 year old Irish descent person, whose eyelashes were getting skimpy, this stuff is well worth the money to have gorgeous long, thicker eyelashes</li>
            <li>I can go without mascara on lazy days when I don&#x27;t wear much or any makeup (very handy when at the beach or swimming) and my eyes looked defined and natural.  </li>
            <li>This product worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Everyone comments on my lashes asking if they are real or not.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li>I really notice that my bottom lashes have grown.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who wants seemingly longer lashes.</li>
            <li>After using it for almost 2 years, I still get asked if these are my real lashes.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this product because it really works.</li>
            <li>Not going to lie, after about two months I was ready to give up because I didn&#x27;t see any progress.</li>
            <li>Like really i had no lashes or brows</li>
            <li>I bought this at Aesthetic Solutions in Boulder, and it really does work.</li>
            <li>They were really puny before.</li>
            <li>It really works if you remember to use it.  </li>
            <li>but if used consistently it really works.</li>
            <li>I guess how it really works your lashes do not fall out as they would, and they just keep on growing....</li>
            <li>It really works and my lashes look longer and thicker ..</li>
            <li>It took about 3 months to see the results, but my lashes got much longer.  </li>
            <li>I really was at my wits</li>
            <li>I appreciated a change in about two weeks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the mascara that came with</li>
            <li>Not doing much for my eyelashes..</li>
            <li>With continued use, lashes will get longer and not break off/fall out nearly as much as without</li>
            <li>I think it is really making my lashes thicker, fuller, and longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, but I&#x27;m told you really notice it after two months of use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really really works.  </li>
            <li>looks much more natural because there are actually hairs where I am filling in.</li>
            <li>I put up with it for about a week or two and decided that it just wasn&#x27;t worth the discomfort, even if I did get really full, long lashes.  </li>
            <li>Within the first six weeks of using it, I saw an abundance of new growth.</li>
            <li>Nothing looks better than long lush lashed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but works for me must better than other brands.</li>
            <li>This is the original and the only formula that has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>and I have never had such full, strong and long lashes in my life</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have had more success in the past month, than in the past year in regrowing my brows.</li>
            <li>So, I have been trying to regrow them on my own for the past year.</li>
            <li>May not fill in bare patches but still worth it.</li>
            <li>you do need a steady hand.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff cause my eye lashes are so short and after using this for only 10 days I can defiantly see the difference.</li>
            <li>but then one day a few weeks into daily (evening) application, I took a good look at my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Word of advice: be patient, use every night, and be realistic with your expectations.</li>
            <li>My eyes were gooey and SUPER red.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was this particular batch or store that it came from?</li>
            <li>Better than the initial formula, doesn&#x27;t turn my eyelids red anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have thick long beautiful lashes from using this.</li>
            <li>When applying a good mascara i really get the false eye lash look.</li>
            <li>Price might seem high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I was very happily surprised that is product WORKS!!  </li>
            <li>product, it still does not live up to the original product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product albeit expensive.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I feel in this case it is warranted.</li>
            <li>and it turns out that is relatively normal?</li>
            <li>Okay, so it&#x27;ll take a few weeks before you see results, and I thought I never would...</li>
            <li>Once my extensions came off, my lashes were at its normal length.  </li>
            <li>AND the applicator brushes absorbed and wasted more product than necessary.  </li>
            <li>when using it were long and full.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are so long and full with Revitalash.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive, safe way to grow long lashes, this is it.</li>
            <li>waste money and believe in the magic stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to have my long lashes back!</li>
            <li>and you basically put it on like a liquid eyeliner right above your lash line.</li>
            <li>Will try using it in the morning, and very lightly, on my right eye only.  </li>
            <li>😍😍 (left pic is January, right is April.</li>
            <li>If my opinion changes to reflect a more positive or negative rating, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li>Super long</li>
            <li>I still have to put on mascara to reveal the full impact, but a single coat of any mascara will do at this point</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is a new formula or not, but I have been using this product for years</li>
            <li>Within the first 8-12 weeks, I was back to normal.</li>
            <li>Got it in the mail earlier than expected :)</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my eye lashes, mostly people ask if they are real or false</li>
            <li>This new formula caused red burning irritation after first use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing I so much noticed with bare lashes, but once I put mascara on--there was a world of difference from before.</li>
            <li>Wow, these products work!</li>
            <li>This is my second tube, i got the first one on January</li>
            <li>Not sure if this was expired or even authentic??</li>
            <li>Love this product and usually a tube lasts about six months when using it once a day.</li>
            <li>Applicator is like a fine-tipped art brush for precise placement without waste, will even dab some onto thin spots in my brows with good results, product lasts a loooong time.  </li>
            <li>Only peculiarity I see is that the lashes of my left eye are slightly longer and curl upward more than the right.  </li>
            <li>I had eyelash extensions that ruined my lashes using this product I was able to get them back to normal in less than a month</li>
            <li>FYI, we are now in Feb of 2015 and I purchased the product last November of 2014, I&#x27;ve used the Revitalsh for the first month every single night right before I go to bed</li>
            <li>It sometimes gets in my eyes and causes a little redness and irritation, but other than that I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this so much I&#x27;m buying the eyebrow product too, so that I can hopefully cut back on having to fill in my brows everyday!</li>
            <li>I ve been using revitalash for 4 weeks and am noticing big difference.i put a picture, its a big deal for me as i had super stubbly lashes.</li>
            <li>A little over three months later my lashes are longer, thicker and more of them.</li>
            <li>I have used Revitalash before with great results; for whatever reason, this one is disappointing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear liquid</li>
            <li>My eyelashes were clearly longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>There is a number to call, and I intend to do that this week, because the ingredients are not listed on the website; however, it does say &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it my body was sensitive to the product</li>
            <li>My lashes are getting much thicker however the length has stayed the same!</li>
            <li>Even my kids (boys) says wow.  </li>
            <li>and now those have almost all filled in after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Have only used this for about 2.5 weeks, so can&#x27;t really attest to it&#x27;s effectiveness yet.</li>
            <li>you put too much onto your upper lashes, it can run into your eyes and cause irritation.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I developed sebaceous hyperplasia in three spots around my eyes from the Careprost, which I had to have removed using ThermoLo treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Started using this last conditioner in May and my eyelashes have really grown.</li>
            <li>but it is still early.  </li>
            <li>I had eyelash extensions that destroyed my natural lash.</li>
            <li>My lashes are now growing back and look much healthier.</li>
            <li>Too early to know if revitalash works.</li>
            <li>It works as long as you use it consistently</li>
            <li>i have light green eyes and have never had an issue with the color of my iris changing as has been noted on some websites.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that really works on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised ..</li>
            <li>However, the red eyes are a real problem if you are not a person who wears makeup every day.</li>
            <li>They just naturally curl.</li>
            <li>Prior to this, I had lash extensions, which I loved, but it became too much upkeep and expensive.  </li>
            <li>My eyes felt somewhat itchy, kind of like being tired, and I wanted to rub them.</li>
            <li>As an esthetician, have tried several other brands, but only use, &amp; recommend Revitalash Advanced!</li>
            <li>There has apparently been a change to this formula because I&#x27;m experiencing some eye irritation that is probably from a new ingredient.  </li>
            <li>while my results did not show as quickly as with lilash, after a couple months of daily use my lashes are  much longer and slightly thicker looking.</li>
            <li>The applicator is also HIGHLY preferable over those bulky Latisse brushes, and this tube will last MUCH longer than a tiny bottle of Latisse or Careprost.  </li>
            <li>did notice that my lashes thinned-out again after the switch from Careprost to Revitalash, but after 3 months of consistent use, my lashes are very long, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>am just writing this review so that potential buyers will be totally aware of this possible side effect.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable how long and full your lashes are!!</li>
            <li>Not only does it lengthen your existing lashes, it causes new lashes to grow which increases the lush look of your lashes.  </li>
            <li>I was quite skeptical but after reading the positive reviews decided to give it a shot and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>My eyes were itchy, red, and super watery and no amount of eye drops could cause long lasting relief.  </li>
            <li>Too many hours spent in the desert sun caused them to break and become extremely brittle and short.</li>
            <li>In no time, my lashes were back to being short and stubby an very unexciting.  </li>
            <li>, I have had a bit of discoloration on my eyelids but nothing major.</li>
            <li>I had given up even using mascara because they looked short and blunt and one easy sweep of mascara makes my lashes long long long!  </li>
            <li>So, as some other reviewers mentioned, this began to make my eyelids red, right at the lash line where I apply this.</li>
            <li>My lashes are so much darker and fuller, and so long that they actually brush up against my eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li>Apparently these are all scams.</li>
            <li>and i love the story behind this product.</li>
            <li>They are still thin and fall out before they are able to grow any length.</li>
            <li>As others have said it takes a few weeks to see results but give it time, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of days I noticed that my pale, sparse lashes were slightly longer and more visible without makeup.</li>
            <li>I noticed that because I had not used Revitalash in many months my lashes were once again short and thin.</li>
            <li>I truly was shocked at how long and beautiful my lashes grew.</li>
            <li>wait until it dries first because little hairs will grow around your  eye too...</li>
            <li>I have now been using this product for 6 months (daily at first and now about once a week or even less) and my lashes still look longer and fuller than ever.</li>
            <li>My eyelash have grown double long as before, maybe just because I have short eyelash, but it works, what can I say, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Within four weeks have seen increase in thickness and length in lashes - have also been using on brows and have some bare spots filling in, as well as overall brow thickness.</li>
            <li>If you want long lush lashes...</li>
            <li>my eyelashes started to heavily fall out after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving finally having longer lashes without any irritation or other negative side effects!     </li>
            <li>Giving it four stars now simply because it did cause a little itching and irritation the first time I used it, but no problems  since then.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but after about 3 months I put on mascara one day, and holy cow were my lashes LONG!</li>
            <li>Absolutely makes my lashes thicker and longer without a prescription and at almost half the cost of Latisse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Revitalash consistently for about three months and my lashes look amazingly long and dark.</li>
            <li>When I first started using, I had already been using a different product, but a friend told me this one had made her eyelashes grow real long and the other  one wasn&#x27;t doing that.</li>
            <li>Less than 2 months later, they&#x27;re much longer.</li>
            <li>My first time using it, I didn&#x27;t let it dry, it burned my eyes slightly</li>
            <li>I had noticed them getting much lighter and thinner, with tiny little patches missing hair, but they are so full and dark, I have actually cut back to using it only every 3 days.  </li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> It is Amazing!</li>
            <li> Rivitalash is amazing !</li>
            <li> After using it for 6 weeks the results were remarkable.</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash for many years &amp; have found it to be the best product for your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I feel so much more attractive!!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with my lashes now, and would recommend Revitalash to anyone!  </li>
            <li> PERFECT BROWS is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> All in all the product is good.  </li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash for years and like everyone else has said you have to be patient, it takes a good 3 to 4 weeks before you start to see anything...</li>
            <li> Good but for price?</li>
            <li> Sooooo good.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it good for others</li>
            <li> They are more beautiful than when I was in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not the result I was looking for when I bought the product, but I&#x27;m glad I was able to find a use that makes me almost as happy!</li>
            <li> but I was really impressed at how quickly I noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and was very satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for a month now and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with product and shipper</li>
            <li> Love this product, been using it for 2 years with great results......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product works great for others</li>
            <li> Perfect product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried the prescription stuff and this product works better!</li>
            <li> but I really do love this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love and will always use the product!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> better than mascara!</li>
            <li> You will never regret of buying this, in fact this is one of my most successful purchases.</li>
            <li> For sure my lashes are now stronger, longer and fuller!</li>
            <li> Works its magic!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Checked once to make sure I had taken off my mascara!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Makes the goodly wife super happy..</li>
            <li> A touch of mascara and you have amazing lashes.  </li>
            <li> Amazing products.</li>
            <li> Amazing product</li>
            <li> Its just an amazing product</li>
            <li> Amazing....</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made my light brown lashes any darker, but fuller and longer is great.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> (although it would have been nice)</li>
            <li> But am I loving the results.</li>
            <li> Also, Revitalash acts as a nice grooming product.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased this I honestly didn’t expect to be amazed, but I am.</li>
            <li> But they do look spectacular.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes and eyebrows are growing nicely after using this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, it really works!!!</li>
            <li> I HAD to return to my original product!!</li>
            <li> Excellent seller, highly recommended +</li>
            <li> Very easy application and didn&#x27;t have any issues with it changing pigment on eyelids or eye color.</li>
            <li> So I purchased Revitalash in early January, used on both my top and bottom lashes, and after about one month, my eyelashes looked really good ... about as good as they did with the IMax serum, so I was happy.</li>
            <li> The ones here on Amazon are a good price with free shipping....</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> This product was even more effective before bimoprost was removed because Allergan claimed patent infringement, but even without it, my lashes are noticeably longer.  </li>
            <li> but I tuley have seen some pretty great results.</li>
            <li> Both had great reviews, and although Latisse seems to have a stronger formula--the perk of not needing a prescription led me to try Revitalash first.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work - when I received the product, the container was very light and wondered if there was any product inside.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again when my original tube runs out because I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Then after another month, in early March, they looked really full and nice, so I was VERY happy.</li>
            <li> Best product for lash lengthening out there, amazing results and the bottle lasts for a very long time .</li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in my lashes!  </li>
            <li> Yes ma&#x27;am, I sure am.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever I have very short eyelashes</li>
            <li> (i apply at night after my face is washed), and don&#x27;t apply it more than once a day-</li>
            <li> I LOVE product and have recommended it many times.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it has made my lashes longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s taken me a day, and many of the enhancers that don&#x27;t have prostoglandins also do not work.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Longer, and more of &#x27;em!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> #34;you look more refreshed, what&#x27;s new?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah.  </li>
            <li> Most reviews said they saw results in 3 months.</li>
            <li> but I still want to get more growth - as in thickness.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and the Revitabrow.</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten a sample from a friend and fell in love!</li>
            <li> It more lengthens the lashes (perhaps by accelerating growth?)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I use every night and absolutely love my results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did my research and ordered it.</li>
            <li> but all it does is highlight the lashes so you can see them better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will never stop using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love with them</li>
            <li> I love this product, I don&#x27;t have to use mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it more stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;OR</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it works. :)</li>
            <li> Love it.....</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I began to notice a difference within 2 weeks and after a month is was even more noticeable.</li>
            <li> but I love the result.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than Latisse as it is easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to search for the next best &amp;#34;fake lashes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> Better than latisse.  </li>
            <li> One tube lasted me more than two years.</li>
            <li> my all-time favorite beauty trick.....have been using for many years.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered more and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use Revitalash for sure.</li>
            <li> Even though this product is better than the nourishe (sp?)</li>
            <li> and they were ok.</li>
            <li> It definitely works and does make your lashes longer and thicker, which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> We are all looking for better products.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> The screw top broke and</li>
            <li> For me, this product surely works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my lashes longer and more plentiful</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 2 years and love it...</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Makes lash-challenged lids look more normal and attractive.</li>
            <li> Perhaps issue is that I&#x27;m older and the effect isn&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li> It took about 6 weeks of nightly use for me to start seeing results, but I am very happy with how long my lashes are getting and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> just long, beautiful lashes!!!</li>
            <li> Super worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product and it came quickly!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product is safe for people with light eyes.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;love, love, love&amp;#34; the Revitalash Advanced Eyelash Conditioner..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also looked this up on the EWG website, and believe it or not, it is a 2, which makes me even more comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it while on vacation in Hawaii, at a spa, and the sales gal was so convincing that I couldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying my brows look perfect and lush, but I don&#x27;t have to use as much eye brow filler and the filler</li>
            <li> I have my eyelashes back and happy :)</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> but I spent hundreds on those extensions which ruined my own lashes (which weren&#x27;t that great to begin with).</li>
            <li> Easy to apply applicator allows the formula to go on easy.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what an amazing result!</li>
            <li> All of the women in the doctors office had such beautiful lashes.  </li>
            <li> Lasts for awhile, helps with the fine hair growth and it&#x27;s a must have in my routine.  </li>
            <li> so purchased Revitalash and have been a loyal fan ever since!  </li>
            <li> I can barely express my love and gratitude for this product!!</li>
            <li> Saw a huge change in the length of my lashes in a matter of 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> both fantastic  75yrs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sparse spots filled in and my lashes are longer and stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and It is great!</li>
            <li> I just blink lightly until it dries.</li>
            <li> It really helps with form a nice coating on lashes.</li>
            <li> I apply it lightly once day before bed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic...</li>
            <li> I started to see bald spots being filled in within 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Been using Revitalash Advanced for years now, on my brows, and it&#x27;s all &amp;#34;that and more&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Used a different product and had great result</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Anyway, so far so good.</li>
            <li> look how much they&#x27;ve grown!!!)</li>
            <li> I very rarely take the time to write a review but after using revitalash for over a year I felt compelled to write one.</li>
            <li> (well....maybe for a very special occasion) as they really look over the top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is super easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I then just used it a couple of nights a week to maintain them and as others have mentioned, I love being able to get away with minimal eye makeup most days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now buying my second bottle of Revitalash because, despite my skepticism, it has worked amazingly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lash conditioners and Revitalash is consistently the best performer.  </li>
            <li> Love it, it really works, after going through chemo and losing my eyelashes, they are long and beautiful now.  </li>
            <li> Have used this successfully for several years.</li>
            <li> I have used the lash conditioning product many times and it never fails me.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> When I used the original Revitalash</li>
            <li> Love revitalash same ingredients and just as effective as the prescription brand.</li>
            <li> I love being able to leave the house with a really natural appearance.</li>
            <li> I am currently looking for more effective products but Eyebrows Growth Accelerator Balm</li>
            <li> This is the third eyelash serum I&#x27;ve tried, and so far it is the best.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing and completely replaces faux lashes, in terms of fullness and length.</li>
            <li> Also.... amazingly ... they have a natural curl to them now.</li>
            <li> Must keep using it, though, to keep the lashes looking full and longer.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Revitalsh because a fellow youtuber I follow uses the same product and good lord</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the full results in another 4 months.</li>
            <li> I can confidently say that they are my real lashes.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for a full year.</li>
            <li> The reason I am not giving it the full 5 stars is because it did not make my eyelashes thicker</li>
            <li> Like many creams and lotions that really do nothing.</li>
            <li> The effective is clear to see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> I start on my right eye first and seem to give it more effort and have noticed that my eyelashes on my right are longer!  </li>
            <li> and now since I&#x27;m so happy with the length I will apply the product every other night.</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of Alopecia Areata, which causes a section of my eyelashes to fall out when I am stressed.</li>
            <li> When I stopped the results faded fairly quickly, maybe 5-7 days or so.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Some of the longest eyelashes need to trimmed because they have continued growing quickly, but the rest have slowed.</li>
            <li> I have seen tremendous results in 2 months.</li>
            <li> I had short lashes and now they are long and beautiful!</li>
            <li> They are much longer!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely works!!</li>
            <li> When it starts working it only gets better!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> I researched quite a few lash serums and Revitalash had great reviews.</li>
            <li> (without success) I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month along with taking biotin (a supplement for hair growth)</li>
            <li> It might be worth looking into Galaxy Eyelash Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 4 weeks now and have noticed considerable growth and darkening of my eyelashes (which is great because they were a darker blonde before</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had these kind of lashes for last 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Its worth the $.</li>
            <li> is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Then the challenge would be to find a mascara that wasn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; lest it flatten out the freshly curled lashes.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> but worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth any price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I still think its worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if worth the money?</li>
            <li> Originally bought at a spa but found it much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price and it works as long as you remember to use it regularly :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work right away.</li>
            <li> I have been asked many times if they are fake or I am complemented on how beautiful they are.</li>
            <li> I tracked down the Advanced formula and it amazing</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used this in the past with great results.</li>
            <li> after they are nice and full you can apply every other day.  </li>
            <li> Was a little nervous to order this due to cost but figured if it had so many reviews of would be great and worth it!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m naturally blonde, my hair and lashes are very fine.</li>
            <li> Ship really fast which meant I can have great lashes a little quicker</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, as I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li> I quickly checked on Ebay and found it much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It is an amazing product, and I am now obsessed with it for good.</li>
            <li> When I put mascara on, my lashes are so long and full, I really love this product</li>
            <li> I read quite a few excellent reviews on this product and hoped for similar results.</li>
            <li> , if you can find such products, do another thorough search to find out what kind of reviews that particular product has.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t get you result any quicker and will most likely just bother your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First one lasted 2-1/2 years.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine what it does for healthy lashes.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased Revitalash it was $150.00 a tube....</li>
            <li> For the first 2 days I used this, my eyes were SO IRRITATED.</li>
            <li> I did also notice that the area around the creases of my eyes were darkened for about the first week of using it, but nobody else noticed or said anything.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> Instructions say to apply moisturizer first, then wait 5 minutes to apply the product.  </li>
            <li> My first tube has lasted me 3 months</li>
            <li> Really Works!</li>
            <li> My eyes are still the bright green I was born with.  </li>
            <li> but I woke up and honestly thought I had pink eye.</li>
            <li> product darkened the pigmentation of my eyelids at first, but now seems to have lightened up some.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I am very please!</li>
            <li> I do feel the eyelashes touching my upper eyelid.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> My lashes have for sure not gotten shorter and I am starting to see some growth.</li>
            <li> All kidding aside, most of my lashes seem to double in length.</li>
            <li> enough so, that I have been asked more than once, &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li> I was a fake eyelash user and now - I have my own!!!  </li>
            <li> So glad revitalash is back!!</li>
            <li> I am pretty fair-skinned.</li>
            <li> so the effect was rather pretty.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Waited a month before trying again to see if it&#x27;d be better, but same thing.  </li>
            <li> Definitely ordering it again, works way better than the cheaper versions.</li>
            <li> My new trick is to just curl them and set them with clear mascara for a nice, relaxed, natural look.</li>
            <li> Eyebrows Growth Accelerator Balm PERFECT BROWS actually does promotes the growth of new hairs but it takes a few months to begin working</li>
            <li> I spent my teens, 20&#x27;s, and 30&#x27;s using an eyelash curler that I would warm up with my hair dryer in order to &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; my straight, stubby lashes.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for over 3 years and my lashes have consistently been evenly full with a natural looking upward curve.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit watery and you do not need to put much on the brush to get results, plus it will last longer this way. :)</li>
            <li> Competitor  also comes with 60 little applicators, two per day, what does that tell you, lasts only a moth, Revitalash is good for four months!</li>
            <li> I love how long eyelashes have grown.</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalise before and it really does make your lashes grow longer, but you just haveto be consistent with aapplying it each night.  </li>
            <li> But after using this product and waiting for my full lash cycle to complete with this product, my lashes became longer, darker and thicker.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the original stuff by far...but still helps my poor ole lashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are lush and full again.</li>
            <li> There is a mild eye irritation (stinging) if you get it directly in the eye</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Latisse before but it was too strong for me and made my eyes red, swollen and itchy.</li>
            <li> I tried Smart Lash and nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 46 year old Irish descent person, whose eyelashes were getting skimpy, this stuff is well worth the money to have gorgeous long, thicker eyelashes</li>
            <li> I can go without mascara on lazy days when I don&#x27;t wear much or any makeup (very handy when at the beach or swimming) and my eyes looked defined and natural.  </li>
            <li> This product worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Everyone comments on my lashes asking if they are real or not.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li> I really notice that my bottom lashes have grown.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who wants seemingly longer lashes.</li>
            <li> After using it for almost 2 years, I still get asked if these are my real lashes.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this product because it really works.</li>
            <li> Not going to lie, after about two months I was ready to give up because I didn&#x27;t see any progress.</li>
            <li> Like really i had no lashes or brows</li>
            <li> I bought this at Aesthetic Solutions in Boulder, and it really does work.</li>
            <li> They were really puny before.</li>
            <li> It really works if you remember to use it.  </li>
            <li> but if used consistently it really works.</li>
            <li> I guess how it really works your lashes do not fall out as they would, and they just keep on growing....</li>
            <li> It really works and my lashes look longer and thicker ..</li>
            <li> It took about 3 months to see the results, but my lashes got much longer.  </li>
            <li> I really was at my wits</li>
            <li> I appreciated a change in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the mascara that came with</li>
            <li> Not doing much for my eyelashes..</li>
            <li> With continued use, lashes will get longer and not break off/fall out nearly as much as without</li>
            <li> I think it is really making my lashes thicker, fuller, and longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, but I&#x27;m told you really notice it after two months of use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really really works.  </li>
            <li> looks much more natural because there are actually hairs where I am filling in.</li>
            <li> I put up with it for about a week or two and decided that it just wasn&#x27;t worth the discomfort, even if I did get really full, long lashes.  </li>
            <li> Within the first six weeks of using it, I saw an abundance of new growth.</li>
            <li> Nothing looks better than long lush lashed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but works for me must better than other brands.</li>
            <li> This is the original and the only formula that has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> and I have never had such full, strong and long lashes in my life</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have had more success in the past month, than in the past year in regrowing my brows.</li>
            <li> So, I have been trying to regrow them on my own for the past year.</li>
            <li> May not fill in bare patches but still worth it.</li>
            <li> you do need a steady hand.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff cause my eye lashes are so short and after using this for only 10 days I can defiantly see the difference.</li>
            <li> but then one day a few weeks into daily (evening) application, I took a good look at my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Word of advice: be patient, use every night, and be realistic with your expectations.</li>
            <li> My eyes were gooey and SUPER red.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was this particular batch or store that it came from?</li>
            <li> Better than the initial formula, doesn&#x27;t turn my eyelids red anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have thick long beautiful lashes from using this.</li>
            <li> When applying a good mascara i really get the false eye lash look.</li>
            <li> Price might seem high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I was very happily surprised that is product WORKS!!  </li>
            <li> product, it still does not live up to the original product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product albeit expensive.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I feel in this case it is warranted.</li>
            <li> and it turns out that is relatively normal?</li>
            <li> Okay, so it&#x27;ll take a few weeks before you see results, and I thought I never would...</li>
            <li> Once my extensions came off, my lashes were at its normal length.  </li>
            <li> AND the applicator brushes absorbed and wasted more product than necessary.  </li>
            <li> when using it were long and full.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are so long and full with Revitalash.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive, safe way to grow long lashes, this is it.</li>
            <li> waste money and believe in the magic stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to have my long lashes back!</li>
            <li> and you basically put it on like a liquid eyeliner right above your lash line.</li>
            <li> Will try using it in the morning, and very lightly, on my right eye only.  </li>
            <li> 😍😍 (left pic is January, right is April.</li>
            <li> If my opinion changes to reflect a more positive or negative rating, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> Super long</li>
            <li> I still have to put on mascara to reveal the full impact, but a single coat of any mascara will do at this point</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a new formula or not, but I have been using this product for years</li>
            <li> Within the first 8-12 weeks, I was back to normal.</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail earlier than expected :)</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my eye lashes, mostly people ask if they are real or false</li>
            <li> This new formula caused red burning irritation after first use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing I so much noticed with bare lashes, but once I put mascara on--there was a world of difference from before.</li>
            <li> Wow, these products work!</li>
            <li> This is my second tube, i got the first one on January</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was expired or even authentic??</li>
            <li> Love this product and usually a tube lasts about six months when using it once a day.</li>
            <li> Applicator is like a fine-tipped art brush for precise placement without waste, will even dab some onto thin spots in my brows with good results, product lasts a loooong time.  </li>
            <li> Only peculiarity I see is that the lashes of my left eye are slightly longer and curl upward more than the right.  </li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions that ruined my lashes using this product I was able to get them back to normal in less than a month</li>
            <li> FYI, we are now in Feb of 2015 and I purchased the product last November of 2014, I&#x27;ve used the Revitalsh for the first month every single night right before I go to bed</li>
            <li> It sometimes gets in my eyes and causes a little redness and irritation, but other than that I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this so much I&#x27;m buying the eyebrow product too, so that I can hopefully cut back on having to fill in my brows everyday!</li>
            <li> I ve been using revitalash for 4 weeks and am noticing big difference.i put a picture, its a big deal for me as i had super stubbly lashes.</li>
            <li> A little over three months later my lashes are longer, thicker and more of them.</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash before with great results; for whatever reason, this one is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear liquid</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were clearly longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> There is a number to call, and I intend to do that this week, because the ingredients are not listed on the website; however, it does say &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it my body was sensitive to the product</li>
            <li> My lashes are getting much thicker however the length has stayed the same!</li>
            <li> Even my kids (boys) says wow.  </li>
            <li> and now those have almost all filled in after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Have only used this for about 2.5 weeks, so can&#x27;t really attest to it&#x27;s effectiveness yet.</li>
            <li> you put too much onto your upper lashes, it can run into your eyes and cause irritation.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I developed sebaceous hyperplasia in three spots around my eyes from the Careprost, which I had to have removed using ThermoLo treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Started using this last conditioner in May and my eyelashes have really grown.</li>
            <li> but it is still early.  </li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions that destroyed my natural lash.</li>
            <li> My lashes are now growing back and look much healthier.</li>
            <li> Too early to know if revitalash works.</li>
            <li> It works as long as you use it consistently</li>
            <li> i have light green eyes and have never had an issue with the color of my iris changing as has been noted on some websites.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised ..</li>
            <li> However, the red eyes are a real problem if you are not a person who wears makeup every day.</li>
            <li> They just naturally curl.</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I had lash extensions, which I loved, but it became too much upkeep and expensive.  </li>
            <li> My eyes felt somewhat itchy, kind of like being tired, and I wanted to rub them.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician, have tried several other brands, but only use, &amp; recommend Revitalash Advanced!</li>
            <li> There has apparently been a change to this formula because I&#x27;m experiencing some eye irritation that is probably from a new ingredient.  </li>
            <li> while my results did not show as quickly as with lilash, after a couple months of daily use my lashes are  much longer and slightly thicker looking.</li>
            <li> The applicator is also HIGHLY preferable over those bulky Latisse brushes, and this tube will last MUCH longer than a tiny bottle of Latisse or Careprost.  </li>
            <li> did notice that my lashes thinned-out again after the switch from Careprost to Revitalash, but after 3 months of consistent use, my lashes are very long, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> am just writing this review so that potential buyers will be totally aware of this possible side effect.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable how long and full your lashes are!!</li>
            <li> Not only does it lengthen your existing lashes, it causes new lashes to grow which increases the lush look of your lashes.  </li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical but after reading the positive reviews decided to give it a shot and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My eyes were itchy, red, and super watery and no amount of eye drops could cause long lasting relief.  </li>
            <li> Too many hours spent in the desert sun caused them to break and become extremely brittle and short.</li>
            <li> In no time, my lashes were back to being short and stubby an very unexciting.  </li>
            <li> , I have had a bit of discoloration on my eyelids but nothing major.</li>
            <li> I had given up even using mascara because they looked short and blunt and one easy sweep of mascara makes my lashes long long long!  </li>
            <li> So, as some other reviewers mentioned, this began to make my eyelids red, right at the lash line where I apply this.</li>
            <li> My lashes are so much darker and fuller, and so long that they actually brush up against my eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li> Apparently these are all scams.</li>
            <li> and i love the story behind this product.</li>
            <li> They are still thin and fall out before they are able to grow any length.</li>
            <li> As others have said it takes a few weeks to see results but give it time, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days I noticed that my pale, sparse lashes were slightly longer and more visible without makeup.</li>
            <li> I noticed that because I had not used Revitalash in many months my lashes were once again short and thin.</li>
            <li> I truly was shocked at how long and beautiful my lashes grew.</li>
            <li> wait until it dries first because little hairs will grow around your  eye too...</li>
            <li> I have now been using this product for 6 months (daily at first and now about once a week or even less) and my lashes still look longer and fuller than ever.</li>
            <li> My eyelash have grown double long as before, maybe just because I have short eyelash, but it works, what can I say, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Within four weeks have seen increase in thickness and length in lashes - have also been using on brows and have some bare spots filling in, as well as overall brow thickness.</li>
            <li> If you want long lush lashes...</li>
            <li> my eyelashes started to heavily fall out after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving finally having longer lashes without any irritation or other negative side effects!     </li>
            <li> Giving it four stars now simply because it did cause a little itching and irritation the first time I used it, but no problems  since then.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but after about 3 months I put on mascara one day, and holy cow were my lashes LONG!</li>
            <li> Absolutely makes my lashes thicker and longer without a prescription and at almost half the cost of Latisse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Revitalash consistently for about three months and my lashes look amazingly long and dark.</li>
            <li> When I first started using, I had already been using a different product, but a friend told me this one had made her eyelashes grow real long and the other  one wasn&#x27;t doing that.</li>
            <li> Less than 2 months later, they&#x27;re much longer.</li>
            <li> My first time using it, I didn&#x27;t let it dry, it burned my eyes slightly</li>
            <li> I had noticed them getting much lighter and thinner, with tiny little patches missing hair, but they are so full and dark, I have actually cut back to using it only every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> you wearing false lashes?&amp;#34; Needless to say, I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it long enough to find that applying it once or twice a week is enough for maintenance, and I can apply it daily for a couple of weeks for a boost.  </li>
            <li> The itchiness had dissipated and I developed the dark liner that some reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> but by the third month they were SO long</li>
            <li> i just curl my incredibly long lashes and it actually looks as if I had on mascara.</li>
            <li> it!!&lt;br /&gt;It last for a long time.</li>
            <li> and now they are black naturally).  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results especially since I was hugely disappointed with brands like mavala and M2, both of which cause a lot of irritation and no advertise results.</li>
            <li> but when I&#x27;d open it it was dry inside.</li>
            <li> Had used the product a few years back and had decent result but stopped due to pregnancy and nursing.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products that claim to do the same thing (such as City Lash), but Revitalash truly does work.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid this would be like many products that you have to use forever before you see results</li>
            <li> I had lost a considerable amount of lashes in the past several years,</li>
            <li> but now I have really long lashes  100% satisfaction</li>
            <li> I just reordered it and will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> every now and then 2 or 3 lashes will get way too long.  </li>
            <li> Long lashes, I&#x27;ll take you.</li>
            <li> I now have long and curling eyelashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling like I now have to use revitalash once a week or so because they are getting sooooo long</li>
            <li> I am a long term contact lense wearer and have not gotten any adverse side effects by using this.</li>
            <li> My lashes are NOT thicker, they are just really long.</li>
            <li> My lashes have grown long and thicker since using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 6 years, and still get compliments on how long my eyelashes are, compared to what they used to be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had this long</li>
            <li> Within a month of using, my eyelashes are freakishly long.  </li>
            <li> Thechange in length was not overtly noticeable, but since I spent a lot of time looking in the mirror staring from different angles, I could see the difference.  </li>
            <li> now I can even skip days and the long lashes remain.  </li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to apply without touching your lid</li>
            <li> I have long lashes!</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are so long!</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long!</li>
            <li> My lashes get so long I have to trim them - so yes it works!</li>
            <li> I cleanse, apply the product, wait about 5 minutes for it to dry, then apply my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> This is not a product that will give you instant overnight lashes, and if you&#x27;re only using it for a few weeks and not seeing a difference, don&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li> I only tried a different brand because of the expense, but don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.  </li>
            <li> You MUST use every single night after cleansing your face&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every single day faithfully before bed as part of my nighttime regimen.</li>
            <li> Every single time this runs out I will order it again...</li>
            <li> But I am a victim of the 90&#x27;s and over plucking my brows.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid condition that caused me to basically loose all of my eyelashes</li>
            <li> ACTUALLY worked in less than a week i began to have eyebrows  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with this purchase, not sure if it&#x27;s authentic or not.</li>
            <li> Ok, so it&#x27;s been a day shy of 8 weeks of using this product and holy cow!!!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes with good mascara actually look fake!!!</li>
            <li> it does leave a little extra &amp;#34;sleep&amp;#34; on your eyes.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it irritates my eyes a little.  </li>
            <li> I had accidently pulled most of my lashes out using a bad eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really.</li>
            <li> It irritates my eyes with minimal results.</li>
            <li> Another trick I&#x27;ve learned is that when I use mascara I just hold the brush (after applying it) against my eyelashes for a few seconds and that pushes the eyelashes and makes them curl up and stay curled, no need to use the eyelash curler which will actually break your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> and then only a few times a week whenever i remembered it and after about 4-6 weeks</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
            <li> but it only lasts for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Buyers be careful.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t work anymore, I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but when I put on mascara last week, my lashes looked like like spider legs!  </li>
            <li> careful if you use a night mask to cover you eyes...</li>
            <li> The bottle  came empty.</li>
            <li> After applying Revitalash daily for a few weeks my lashes were noticeably longer...</li>
            <li> Of course Graham is a typical guy who has long lashes and doesn&#x27;t need any help.  </li>
            <li> then that became unavailable in the US due to a lawsuit, so i tried rapid lash - that made my lashes fall</li>
            <li> I would like to offer some recommendations for use, as I see other reviewers saying they have seen no results.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use every other day because it can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> So I played with it a little and finally decided to use a piece of paper to fan my lashes for a little bit before opening my eyes.</li>
            <li> The wand had a small amount of liquid on it but only lasted about a month.</li>
            <li> The price is extremely affordable through Amazon, which makes it something I can continue using, instead of a luxury expense.</li>
            <li> The other formulation ( nourische)  did not do a thing for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Used other products before, but this eyelash conditioner seems to distribute the growth evenly.</li>
            <li> Since Revitalash worked for her and two other name brands did not, I feel it&#x27;s a matter of getting the product your skin likes and not a deficit of the product itself.</li>
            <li> I bought another bottle to put on every other day to maintain the effect.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but never got the results I have with Revitalash  </li>
            <li> Dr&#x27;s office, used as prescribed and found that my lashes did get somewhat fuller but that the length was inconsistent with random spider-leg lashes I would have to trim because they looked funny -- not worth the $$ or effort.  </li>
            <li> Bimatoprost is the active ingredient that makes your eyelashes grow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste a single drop of this stuff.</li>
            <li> My naturally long and thick lashes look twice as long!</li>
            <li> One receptionist said she needed to trim her lashes and cut down her use to every other day.</li>
            <li> The tube is very small but will last a long time because you need so little of the product for it to work.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, this batch must have been with a new formula-------totally disappointed and surprised as it wasn&#x27;t any different than putting plain water on the lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on a daily basis for one month now and, honestly, I&#x27;ve not seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that now I have some darkish smudges under my lower lashes, and I haven&#x27;t even used it on them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Revitalash  in the past and my eyelashes got so long that I had to trim them.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the side effect of the dark line had remained so that I didn&#x27;t even have to put on eyeliner to look like I was wearing a brown liner.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m wearing natural looking false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> but they were about half the length.</li>
            <li> The label says you need to 18+, not pregnant and not nursing.</li>
            <li> First I tried IMax, which worked well, but was always somehow getting into my eyes and stinging them like crazy.</li>
            <li> Not true as Advertising.</li>
            <li> Her hairdresser suggested she try it and after 2 months her lashes were long and thick.</li>
            <li> ) if you have eye irritation, go a little lighter on the application, and try not to squeeze your eyes shut too tightly.  </li>
            <li> I do have a little itching during the day, but nothing that causes redness or irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing a little mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little self-indulgent</li>
            <li> I use it at night and feel a little bit of a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> prefer this over Latisse because it&#x27;s less expensive and FAR EASIER TO APPLY.  </li>
            <li> the most annoying thing was that they left a white residue along the lash line that would be impossible to remove, you end up pulling at your eyelashes to get it out.  </li>
            <li> have recommended this product to countless women who want in on my little lash secret.</li>
            <li> Starting using approximately two weeks ago, and my lashes already started looking fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li> I have pulled my lashes out accidentally on a few occasions, leaving sparse patches on my lid.</li>
            <li> I have also used this on my eyebrows where they are thinned out and patchy, they are getting fuller everyday.  </li>
            <li> I saw results in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I purchased it back in December after being tired of paying for Eyelash Extensions.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use revitalash everyday.</li>
            <li> Revitalash has been an absolute game changer!!</li>
            <li> Been using for 6 months and my eyelashes have grown long and thick!  </li>
            <li> Works well took a few months will continue to use it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for the past month</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s an allergy, just maybe the function of it stimulating hair growth.</li>
            <li> This is substantially less!!</li>
            <li> I have not experienced the redness on the eyelids that some other reviewers spoke of...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause eye irritation unless it gets inside your eye, but it is supposed to be applied only on the base of the upper eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Try not to look to closely at your lashes for the first few weeks, then you will be shocked at the results!  </li>
            <li> It looked like I was a combination of suffering the worst allergies of my life and trying to get myself high enough to forget about them.</li>
            <li> Now ... after almost another month, my lashes are so long they almost touch my eyebrows, and so thick they look like false lashes!</li>
            <li> at least it looks like that.</li>
            <li> You do have to have patience as it takes at least 6 weeks to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Give it at least 2 months to work.</li>
            <li> At one point, I had thick, medium length eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I instantly had a reaction to it and am mow unable to wear my contacts, my eyes are blood red and swollen :(</li>
            <li> Around the 3 month mark other people began to comment on my lashes, often asking if they were fake.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after destroying my eyelashes with monthly semi-permanent lash application I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> on lashes and brows and first of all, my eyeBROWS are insane!</li>
            <li> Looked sparse and generally weak.</li>
            <li> However, because it&#x27;s expensive, I thought I could switch to a less expensive product to maintain.  </li>
            <li> and it is a very slow process.</li>
            <li> Again - poor value.  </li>
            <li> I hope that it lasts long... :(</li>
            <li> My skin is approximately caramel colored</li>
            <li> This time results weren&#x27;t quite as dramatic although I did notice improvement in length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> and it did cause a little bit of darkening of skin at the lash base -</li>
            <li> or I was just applying it wrong</li>
            <li> No matter what mascara or expensive eyelash curler</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how scary this product is...</li>
            <li> ( well not kind i wanted) now, i even have bottom lashes!!!!</li>
            <li> People think I have fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for gushing on and on</li>
            <li> I also spilled out some liquid, unfortunately, so</li>
            <li> And it is expensive...</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> This is expensive, but it works if you use it every night.  </li>
            <li> I also though Revitalash wasn&#x27;t working, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, i don&#x27;t have a before picture</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for me</li>
            <li> My husband asked if I was wearing fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> hear there are some fake out the market</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know how to recognize what I bought is fake or not</li>
            <li> Revitalash was expensive, so I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Nothing terrible, but a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> ; I hope this review has been helpful to at least a couple of people!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone always ask me if I have fake eyelashes on!  </li>
            <li> Not on a growth cycle falling out but like a bad reaction coming out.</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of forgetting to put it on at night</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Wrong!!  </li>
            <li> and I will not lose ALL of them over this stupid purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> After using for a year, her lashes are outrageous!  </li>
            <li> I apply this product every day and my eyelashes are insane.</li>
            <li> I have a TERRIBLE experience.</li>
            <li> , it was terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far so good. I didn&#x27;t buy this expecting a miracle. (although it would have been nice) But I am a victim of the 90&#x27;s and over plucking my brows. So, I have been trying to regrow them on my own for the past year. (without success) I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month along with taking biotin (a supplement for hair growth) I can honestly say I have had more success in the past month, than in the past year in regrowing my brows. I&#x27;m not saying my brows look perfect and lush, but I don&#x27;t have to use as much eye brow filler and the filler looks much more natural because there are actually hairs where I am filling in. Can I go in public without my eyebrow filler? Not a chance, not yet. But am I loving the results. Yes ma&#x27;am, I sure am. I don&#x27;t regret spending the $75 buck or so on the this product. THAT BEING SAID I also have been using it on my lashes. I have not seen any changes there. So, this week I stopped using it there and focused on the brows. I don&#x27;t want to waste a single drop of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in 30 days. A friend asked me if I had lash extensions.</li>
            <li> ACTUALLY worked in less than a week i began to have eyebrows  both fantastic  75yrs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eye lash works but keep away from edge of eye</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my eye lashes, mostly people ask if they are real or false and I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara if I don&#x27;t want to and they are still beautiful.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever I have very short eyelashes but now I have really long lashes  100% satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;A very happy customer</li>
            <li> using with lash extensions and it is doing a beautiful job</li>
            <li> Within four weeks have seen increase in thickness and length in lashes - have also been using on brows and have some bare spots filling in, as well as overall brow thickness.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, it really works!!!</li>
            <li> Great product great seller</li>
            <li> i was using lilash, which worked great but irritated my eyes. then that became unavailable in the US due to a lawsuit, so i tried rapid lash - that made my lashes fall out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;revitalash has been my eyelash savior. while my results did not show as quickly as with lilash, after a couple months of daily use my lashes are  much longer and slightly thicker looking. it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes the way lilash did; i don&#x27;t have the redness and under-eye darkness that lilash caused. and i love the story behind this product. apply it once a day (i apply at night after my face is washed), and don&#x27;t apply it more than once a day-it won&#x27;t get you result any quicker and will most likely just bother your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;common sense, but do your reseach before you decide to use an eyelash serum! if you think the product you received is a knock-off DON&#x27;T USE IT!</li>
            <li> Love revitalash same ingredients and just as effective as the prescription brand.</li>
            <li> Used it faithfully for 11 WEEKS.  Did not have any improvement what so ever.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Be Patient... IT WORKS!! Use just once a day for about 3 months and you will be amazed.  It won&#x27;t darken like Latisse but no Rx required. A touch of mascara and you have amazing lashes.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the beginning of October as recommended by my dermatologist.  All of the women in the doctors office had such beautiful lashes.  They were all using  Revitalash.  One receptionist said she needed to trim her lashes and cut down her use to every other day. A little over three months later my lashes are longer, thicker and more of them. I have been asked many times if they are fake or I am complemented on how beautiful they are. I LOVE product and have recommended it many times.  I just reordered it and will continue to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Perfect product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has made my lashes longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer, although it does take a while. Noticed that my eyes itches a bit when using this application.</li>
            <li> I used this product for four days.  Then my eyes started to bother me. I lost some of my eye lashes instead of gaining them.&lt;br /&gt;I had a reaction to the serum.  I went to eye doctor and she told me to report this reaction. I would like to get my money back.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. This is my second tube. First one lasted 2-1/2 years. When 1st purchased, used nightly for two weeks, then 2 times per week. Price might seem high but it&#x27;s not really. Service was great. I received 2 days after ordering. If u have short stubby lashes, this will lengthen them. You&#x27;ll see the difference within a month!</li>
            <li> This actually works, even if your eyelashes have stopped growing or are sparse. May not fill in bare patches but still worth it. Makes lash-challenged lids look more normal and attractive. I can only imagine what it does for healthy lashes.</li>
            <li> Works well took a few months will continue to use it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other lash conditioners and Revitalash is consistently the best performer.  Must keep using it, though, to keep the lashes looking full and longer.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for me. It definitely made my lashes grow!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I feel in this case it is warranted. Revitalash DOES work; however, for me it has been with a price. I know this does not happen to everyone. After using it for 6 weeks the results were remarkable. By that time my eyes were itching &amp; my eyelids were swollen &amp; so red that you could not even see my eyelashes. So, why bother? I do sales work, so my appearance is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just writing this review so that potential buyers will be totally aware of this possible side effect. I want thicker eyelashes, but not with this reaction. I would recommend doing an online search, and finding some products that do NOT contain prostoglandins, which is the ingredient that causes this reaction even though it does what it says. BTW Latisse also contains prostoglandins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, if you can find such products, do another thorough search to find out what kind of reviews that particular product has. I have done this..it&#x27;s taken me a day, and many of the enhancers that don&#x27;t have prostoglandins also do not work. It might be worth looking into Galaxy Eyelash Serum. There is a number to call, and I intend to do that this week, because the ingredients are not listed on the website; however, it does say &amp;#34;all natural ingredients&amp;#34; I hope this review has been helpful to at least a couple of people!!!</li>
            <li> Starting using approximately two weeks ago, and my lashes already started looking fuller and longer.  It is a little difficult to apply without touching your lid you do need a steady hand.  All in all the product is good.  Gave Revitalash a four star rating, because it has only been two weeks!</li>
            <li> Great product. Visible effect after a short time. But your eyelash does fall off after you quit. So once you start, you have to keep up with it.</li>
            <li> Been using for 3 weeks. Lashes are definitely getting longer. I hope with continued use I will achieve even longer, thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! My lashes look fab.</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash before with great results; for whatever reason, this one is disappointing.  It irritates my eyes with minimal results.</li>
            <li> Have tried several so the growth products. This one is great. Took about 5 weeks. Lashes longer and thicker!  Definitely recommend.!</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash for years and like everyone else has said you have to be patient, it takes a good 3 to 4 weeks before you start to see anything...then the lashes start coming in longer thicker and darker and curl.  I started by putting it on upper and lower every morning....after they are nice and full you can apply every other day.  I have actually had to trim my lashes over the years every now and then 2 or 3 lashes will get way too long.  When I first purchased Revitalash it was $150.00 a tube....I quickly checked on Ebay and found it much cheaper.  The ones here on Amazon are a good price with free shipping....I will never stop using it.  Plus a tube will last up to 8 months....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 4 weeks now and have noticed considerable growth and darkening of my eyelashes (which is great because they were a darker blonde before and now they are black naturally).  WARNING!! For the first 2 days I used this, my eyes were SO IRRITATED. It looked like I was a combination of suffering the worst allergies of my life and trying to get myself high enough to forget about them. My eyes were itchy, red, and super watery and no amount of eye drops could cause long lasting relief.  However, I did my research and it turns out that is relatively normal? I don&#x27;t know if it my body was sensitive to the product or I was just applying it wrong but I stuck through with it and am very happy with the results. (Just updated my review with a cropped photo where I was wearing mascara 7/31/15)  I apply this once a day at night after I wash my face and moisturize. Shake the bottle, pull out the applicator, and wipe the excess away on the opening of the tube. It&#x27;s a clear liquid and you basically put it on like a liquid eyeliner right above your lash line. I did also notice that the area around the creases of my eyes were darkened for about the first week of using it, but nobody else noticed or said anything. The tube is very small but will last a long time because you need so little of the product for it to work.  Overall, be prepared for any short term side effects and I&#x27;d recommend to start using it on a weekend or a couple days you don&#x27;t have work. I will buy this again when my original tube runs out because I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff cause my eye lashes are so short and after using this for only 10 days I can defiantly see the difference. They are longer and fuller and when they get like that I only have to use Revitalash  a couple  times a week.</li>
            <li> I wish I could&#x27;ve taken a before picture but I tuley have seen some pretty great results. I purchased the Revitalsh because a fellow youtuber I follow uses the same product and good lord I love the thickness and the length of my lashes now!! I will definitely be repurchasing this product when I run out. FYI, we are now in Feb of 2015 and I purchased the product last November of 2014, I&#x27;ve used the Revitalsh for the first month every single night right before I go to bed and now since I&#x27;m so happy with the length I will apply the product every other night.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller, highly recommended +++++A</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are ridiculous. The product is amazing and completely replaces faux lashes, in terms of fullness and length.</li>
            <li> Revitalash eyelash conditioner is great !!! Works perfect!!! Worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash conditioner that works without a prescription. I love it</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS.  Seriously.  Okay, so it&#x27;ll take a few weeks before you see results, and I thought I never would...but then one day a few weeks into daily (evening) application, I took a good look at my eyelashes.  Pow!  Longer, and more of &#x27;em!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even gotten the &amp;#34;what mascara do you use?&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;you look more refreshed, what&#x27;s new?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah.  I&#x27;ll be buying this for life.  Wish this product would thicken lashes too -- perhaps it does for others -- but hey.  Long lashes, I&#x27;ll take you.</li>
            <li> I put it on nightly and I really like it. Has maybe darkened my eyelids a bit, but nothing too obvious. My lashes are getting much thicker however the length has stayed the same!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Everyone comments on my lashes asking if they are real or not. I recommend to everyone and anyone!</li>
            <li> I bought $120.99 in store but this is $80.00!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been blessed in the eyelash department. It takes a lot of work to plump and lengthen my lashes. No matter what mascara or expensive eyelash curler I bought--the results were so-so. I have pulled my lashes out accidentally on a few occasions, leaving sparse patches on my lid. Instead of going for eyelashes extension, I decided to invest and experiment with a treatment, and debated between Revitalash and Latisse. Both had great reviews, and although Latisse seems to have a stronger formula--the perk of not needing a prescription led me to try Revitalash first. Most reviews said they saw results in 3 months. I have to say: I noticed big results in just two! My sparse spots filled in and my lashes are longer and stronger. It&#x27;s nothing I so much noticed with bare lashes, but once I put mascara on--there was a world of difference from before. Can&#x27;t wait to see the full results in another 4 months. Highly recommend. Word of advice: be patient, use every night, and be realistic with your expectations.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It really works.  I now have long and curling eyelashes and I&#x27;m 55! Haven&#x27;t had these kind of lashes for last 20 years.  I had given up even using mascara because they looked short and blunt and one easy sweep of mascara makes my lashes long long long!  Even my kids (boys) says wow.  Another trick I&#x27;ve learned is that when I use mascara I just hold the brush (after applying it) against my eyelashes for a few seconds and that pushes the eyelashes and makes them curl up and stay curled, no need to use the eyelash curler which will actually break your eyelashes.  I have also used this on my eyebrows where they are thinned out and patchy, they are getting fuller everyday.  I&#x27;m feeling like I now have to use revitalash once a week or so because they are getting sooooo long but I still want to get more growth - as in thickness. It&#x27;s funny, as I&#x27;m right handed I start on my right eye first and seem to give it more effort and have noticed that my eyelashes on my right are longer!  Equality is best. I also tried Rapidlash and Lilash, both hi and lower end products, they did not work as well but the most annoying thing was that they left a white residue along the lash line that would be impossible to remove, you end up pulling at your eyelashes to get it out.  I had no such issues with revitalash.</li>
            <li> I like it, however I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days. I hope to see results soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on a daily basis for one month now and, honestly, I&#x27;ve not seen any improvement. However, I&#x27;ll continue and remain hopeful.</li>
            <li> What an awesome product!!! I&#x27;ve been using this daily since April. Within a couple of days I noticed that my pale, sparse lashes were slightly longer and more visible without makeup. Less than 2 months later, they&#x27;re much longer. With one coat of Lancôme Definicils mascara (been using it forever so this is a before and after situation) my lashes look like I&#x27;ve had an eyelash extension treatment or I&#x27;m wearing natural looking false eyelashes. Can&#x27;t even put on a second coat (well....maybe for a very special occasion) as they really look over the top. Love this stuff and the Revitabrow. Amazing products.</li>
            <li> Wow, these products work!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. Makes my eyelashes grow up to my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> i used it for about two weeks once a day and then only a few times a week whenever i remembered it and after about 4-6 weeks i noticed a massive difference. my lashes basically grew over night. you only need a tiny amount of product, however (i always apply it before i go to bed) it does leave a little extra &amp;#34;sleep&amp;#34; on your eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes were itchy every morning after applying Revitalash on my lashes at night.  I put up with it for about a week or two and decided that it just wasn&#x27;t worth the discomfort, even if I did get really full, long lashes.  HOWEVER, after spending all that money on the product, I decided to try it on my eyebrows.  And I must say, it has worked wonders!  I had some spots where hair just quit growing and now those have almost all filled in after just a few weeks.  I&#x27;m hoping with continued use, my eyebrows will get even fuller.  I do have a little itching during the day, but nothing that causes redness or irritation.  Also, Revitalash acts as a nice grooming product.  When it dries, I simply run a brush through my eyebrows and they stay in place.  So, it&#x27;s not the result I was looking for when I bought the product, but I&#x27;m glad I was able to find a use that makes me almost as happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and It is great!</li>
            <li> I had originally gotten a sample from a friend and fell in love! After about 3 weeks of using it my lashes looked amazing! The Revitalash mascara is awesome, too!</li>
            <li> I instantly had a reaction to it and am mow unable to wear my contacts, my eyes are blood red and swollen :( I&#x27;m bummed</li>
            <li> It really works!  I was skeptical but after destroying my eyelashes with monthly semi-permanent lash application I decided to give this a try.  My eyelashes are longer than they have ever been.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> This actually works!  You will still need mascara; however, my lashes were visibly looking in about 2 weeks.  It more lengthens the lashes (perhaps by accelerating growth?) than makes the lashes thicker.  Its worth the $.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.  Within weeks I noticed a difference.  I am a long term contact lense wearer and have not gotten any adverse side effects by using this.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube, i got the first one on January and I love it. It did make a difference. The tube last me about 5 months using it every day so is worth the price. My lashes are longer and fuller. When applying a good mascara i really get the false eye lash look. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Was a little nervous to order this due to cost but figured if it had so many reviews of would be great and worth it! I love how long eyelashes have grown. I use every night and absolutely love my results. I&#x27;m glad I did my research and ordered it. The product stings a bit of it accidentally gets in eye but otherwise no negatives I can think of. I wish I had taken a close up of eye before... Here&#x27;s a picture for 6 weeks of every day use.... I&#x27;m wearing a little mascara but all it does is highlight the lashes so you can see them better. They are much longer!!</li>
            <li> Love it, it really works, after going through chemo and losing my eyelashes, they are long and beautiful now.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> It actually works! Helped to regrow my eyelashes after losing them from chemotherapy treatments. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love it! I really notice that my bottom lashes have grown.</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  THIS PRODUCT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL.  I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT.</li>
            <li> It works. Really works. I saw results in just a few days. It sometimes gets in my eyes and causes a little redness and irritation, but other than that I am very pleased with this product. I recommend it to anyone who wants seemingly longer lashes.</li>
            <li> Have only used this for about 2.5 weeks, so can&#x27;t really attest to it&#x27;s effectiveness yet. Giving it four stars now simply because it did cause a little itching and irritation the first time I used it, but no problems  since then. Will return and edit review once I&#x27;ve used up this container  UPDATE!: have been using for about 3 months (?) on lashes and brows and first of all, my eyeBROWS are insane! Thicker AND darker. I had noticed them getting much lighter and thinner, with tiny little patches missing hair, but they are so full and dark, I have actually cut back to using it only every 3 days.  My lashes are so much darker and fuller, and so long that they actually brush up against my eyeglasses.  Only peculiarity I see is that the lashes of my left eye are slightly longer and curl upward more than the right.  Will try using it in the morning, and very lightly, on my right eye only.  My daughter has noticed the same peculiarity as well.  After using for a year, her lashes are outrageous!  Super long and they curl beautifully.  I would like to offer some recommendations for use, as I see other reviewers saying they have seen no results.:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) You MUST use every single night after cleansing your face&lt;br /&gt;2) Instructions say to apply moisturizer first, then wait 5 minutes to apply the product.  I cleanse, apply the product, wait about 5 minutes for it to dry, then apply my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;3) You have to shake the container well each and every time you use it&lt;br /&gt;4) Be patient. Try not to look to closely at your lashes for the first few weeks, then you will be shocked at the results!  My first tube has lasted me 3 months and I still have some left in the same tube, so just keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;5) if you have eye irritation, go a little lighter on the application, and try not to squeeze your eyes shut too tightly.  I just blink lightly until it dries.</li>
            <li> I use every other day because it can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It really helps with form a nice coating on lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 years.  Prior to this, I had lash extensions, which I loved, but it became too much upkeep and expensive.  I was told about this product by a friend, and I decided to try it while I had my extensions, in hopes that my lashes would not be really short once they came off.  Once my extensions came off, my lashes were at its normal length.  But after using this product and waiting for my full lash cycle to complete with this product, my lashes became longer, darker and thicker.  After using it for almost 2 years, I still get asked if these are my real lashes.  I can confidently say that they are my real lashes.  I love this product and will never stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to apply.  In the beginning apply nightly, then once you get your desired length, apply 3 times a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;It you put too much onto your upper lashes, it can run into your eyes and cause irritation.  My eye color is still the same and has not changed.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended this product to countless women who want in on my little lash secret.</li>
            <li> It seems work, especially for the lower eyelasher,but my eye always red after use it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with the results. I do recommend this product because it really works.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Palm Beach Tan and let me just say...Holy cow! I got this in January and by March was getting complements on my eyelashes. Not going to lie, after about two months I was ready to give up because I didn&#x27;t see any progress. but by the third month they were SO long and I&#x27;m in love with them 😍😍 (left pic is January, right is April. look how much they&#x27;ve grown!!!) this product WORKS!</li>
            <li> I tried this years ago and it worked great. This time results weren&#x27;t quite as dramatic although I did notice improvement in length of my lashes. Perhaps issue is that I&#x27;m older and the effect isn&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li> It took about 6 weeks of nightly use for me to start seeing results, but I am very happy with how long my lashes are getting and will continue to use it. I had eyelash extensions for about a year and don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to those either. There is a mild eye irritation (stinging) if you get it directly in the eye but it only lasts for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Ship really fast which meant I can have great lashes a little quicker</li>
            <li> Works just like the one double the price on their website.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how scary this product is... my eyelashes started to heavily fall out after the first use.  I have never felt such distrust with a product before in my life.  I am returning Revitalash immediately; however, I am truly concerned that I am going to lose all of my eyelashes after only using it several times.  I hope my lashes will regain strength and I will not lose ALL of them over this stupid purchase.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works!! Saw a huge change in the length of my lashes in a matter of 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I don&#x27;t have to use mascara. It makes my eyelashes look darker, longer and thicker!</li>
            <li> It worked for my polish fiance !</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> This product works great! I had skimpy lashes and even gaps in some spots. I&#x27;ve used Revitalash consistently for about three months and my lashes look amazingly long and dark. I don&#x27;t even have to wear mascara. i just curl my incredibly long lashes and it actually looks as if I had on mascara. I apply it lightly once day before bed. I&#x27;d give it more stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;OR</li>
            <li> I had curled my lashes and my eye lashes seemed to have burned off maybe it was time or by the help of this by I have my eyelashes back and happy :) and my lashes seems longer of what I remember they use to be. And I grew some cheek hair but I didn&#x27;t subtract a star for that cuz I just care that I have my lashes :D</li>
            <li> It works.  Fantastic... I don&#x27;t have to wear mascara anymore!  use it daily- never forget a day ... It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Really Works! I saw some longer lashes after 3 weeks of use. After 6 weeks ALL of my lashes are longer and thicker! I tried the prescription stuff and this product works better!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with this purchase, not sure if it&#x27;s authentic or not. But I&#x27;ve used this in the past with great results. Ever since I started using this one from Amazon, all of my lashes started breaking off and coming out. Not on a growth cycle falling out but like a bad reaction coming out. They are now so short and sparse, even mascara doesn&#x27;t make a difference. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again. Buyers be careful.</li>
            <li> If you want long lush lashes...&lt;br /&gt;This is the product&lt;br /&gt;Be patient and u will be rewarded</li>
            <li> Received product the very next day! It is easy to use. Time will tell if it works. :)</li>
            <li> My lashes are the same((( don&#x27;t helps me this product</li>
            <li> noticable difference! Like really i had no lashes or brows ( well not kind i wanted) now, i even have bottom lashes!!!! I ve been using revitalash for 4 weeks and am noticing big difference.i put a picture, its a big deal for me as i had super stubbly lashes. Anyways im a believer and hooked on it!</li>
            <li> I can barely express my love and gratitude for this product!! I have a mild case of Alopecia Areata, which causes a section of my eyelashes to fall out when I am stressed. Revitalash has been an absolute game changer!! Within the first six weeks of using it, I saw an abundance of new growth. Within the first 8-12 weeks, I was back to normal. Nothing else has worked as well, including Latisse. I have used this regularly for five years and have no intention of stopping! You would have to pry this from my fingers! The only difference I have noticed between Revitalash purchased from Amazon and my salon, is the price. This is substantially less!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product, day and night and have not seen ANY results. I&#x27;ve even taken pictures of my lashes each week to keep track of them, incase I overlooked the growth... none. I wish I didn&#x27;t spend money on it.......</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price</li>
            <li> Amazing product but I needed something stronger so I decided to try Royal Lashes. It worked great for me, I got mine from RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li> Love it.....gonna order it again....now!</li>
            <li> I apply this product every day and my eyelashes are insane. People think I have fake eyelashes. Check out this photo with NO MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> I spent my teens, 20&#x27;s, and 30&#x27;s using an eyelash curler that I would warm up with my hair dryer in order to &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; my straight, stubby lashes.  Then the challenge would be to find a mascara that wasn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; lest it flatten out the freshly curled lashes.  I bit the bullet and purchased Latisse at my derm. Dr&#x27;s office, used as prescribed and found that my lashes did get somewhat fuller but that the length was inconsistent with random spider-leg lashes I would have to trim because they looked funny -- not worth the $$ or effort.  AND the applicator brushes absorbed and wasted more product than necessary.  Again - poor value.  Wanted to try a different brand so purchased Revitalash and have been a loyal fan ever since!  Have used this for over 3 years and my lashes have consistently been evenly full with a natural looking upward curve.  I can go without mascara on lazy days when I don&#x27;t wear much or any makeup (very handy when at the beach or swimming) and my eyes looked defined and natural.  I&#x27;ve used it long enough to find that applying it once or twice a week is enough for maintenance, and I can apply it daily for a couple of weeks for a boost.  Applicator is like a fine-tipped art brush for precise placement without waste, will even dab some onto thin spots in my brows with good results, product lasts a loooong time.  And for those worried about potential side effect of change in eye color??  My eyes are still the bright green I was born with.  I&#x27;m sorry for gushing on and on but I really do love this product!  Hope it works as well for others.</li>
            <li> This is the very best lash conditioner on the market. As an esthetician, have tried several other brands, but only use, &amp; recommend Revitalash Advanced!</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash for many years &amp; have found it to be the best product for your eyelashes.  Not only does it lengthen your existing lashes, it causes new lashes to grow which increases the lush look of your lashes.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to write a review on this product for months. I purchased it back in December after being tired of paying for Eyelash Extensions. When I purchased this I honestly didn’t expect to be amazed, but I am. I began to notice a difference within 2 weeks and after a month is was even more noticeable. Around the 3 month mark other people began to comment on my lashes, often asking if they were fake. I have now been using this product for 6 months (daily at first and now about once a week or even less) and my lashes still look longer and fuller than ever. I am extremely happy with this product and recommend it all the time. Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It took about six weeks to see a difference.  This product has made my lashes a bit longer and fuller and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 7 weeks and didn&#x27;t think it was working.  Since I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t work anymore, I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but when I put on mascara last week, my lashes looked like like spider legs!  They just aren&#x27;t as noticeable without the mascara, but this stuff is definitely working, and I&#x27;ll keep using it.  The only complaint I have is that now I have some darkish smudges under my lower lashes, and I haven&#x27;t even used it on them.  I wonder what&#x27;s in this stuff that causes this.</li>
            <li> Ok, so it&#x27;s been a day shy of 8 weeks of using this product and holy cow!!! This stuff is amazing! I could tell a difference after 4 weeks. My lashes are NOT thicker, they are just really long. I get compliments on my lashes all of the time. For all of you contact lense wearers out there....either take out your contacts or fan your lashes so some of the product dries before you open your eyes after applying. I don&#x27;t recall if the instructions say anything about it. My first time using it, I didn&#x27;t let it dry, it burned my eyes slightly but I woke up and honestly thought I had pink eye. My eyes were gooey and SUPER red. So I played with it a little and finally decided to use a piece of paper to fan my lashes for a little bit before opening my eyes. I will keep buying this. I LOVE this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product albeit expensive.  My lashes when using it were long and full.  They were not like that even in my youth.  I really loved the product -- it works!  However, because it&#x27;s expensive, I thought I could switch to a less expensive product to maintain.  Wrong!!  In no time, my lashes were back to being short and stubby an very unexciting.  I&#x27;m back to Revitalash.  It&#x27;s a little self-indulgent but I love the result.  (The four stars is only because of the cost factor.)</li>
            <li> this product has enhanced the length and thickness of my eyelashes. They are more beautiful than when I was in my 30&#x27;s.  I am approaching my 65th birthday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product darkened the pigmentation of my eyelids at first, but now seems to have lightened up some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received the shipment on a timely manner. I have used Revitalise before and it really does make your lashes grow longer, but you just haveto be consistent with aapplying it each night.  I like it better than Latisse as it is easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Bimatoprost is the active ingredient that makes your eyelashes grow. Revitalash used to contain this ingredient before Allergan made them remove it for patent violation (or something like that.) But this will account for the &amp;#34;formula change.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought this at Aesthetic Solutions in Boulder, and it really does work. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but after about 3 months I put on mascara one day, and holy cow were my lashes LONG! Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t notice a difference right away. This is not a product that will give you instant overnight lashes, and if you&#x27;re only using it for a few weeks and not seeing a difference, don&#x27;t give up on it. It DOES work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Careprost (generic Latisse), and I was scared to continue using it because I have blue eyes, and I didn&#x27;t want them to become discolored or turn brown. This product is safe for people with light eyes. In addition, I developed sebaceous hyperplasia in three spots around my eyes from the Careprost, which I had to have removed using ThermoLo treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that my lashes thinned-out again after the switch from Careprost to Revitalash, but after 3 months of consistent use, my lashes are very long, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The applicator is also HIGHLY preferable over those bulky Latisse brushes, and this tube will last MUCH longer than a tiny bottle of Latisse or Careprost.  It lasts about 6 months.  It&#x27;s well worth the money and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is meant to be informative of the product I have personally tried, and is not reflective of the seller distributing this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had eyelash extensions that ruined my lashes using this product I was able to get them back to normal in less than a month</li>
            <li> I have a TERRIBLE experience. My one eye is irritated, red second day and I have to go to the eye doctor.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years...It was WAY before Latese and it works great AND you can use it on upper AND lower lids unlike Latese....&lt;br /&gt;The Competitor  also comes with 60 little applicators, two per day, what does that tell you, lasts only a moth, Revitalash is good for four months!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work - when I received the product, the container was very light and wondered if there was any product inside. The wand had a small amount of liquid on it but only lasted about a month. Very disappointed. I have since bought another bottle from another seller and my eyelashes are amazing!!!  Not sure if this was expired or even authentic??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it nightly for about two weeks, and haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but from what I hear, it should be a winner.  It did arrive immediately which made me happy!  I also spilled out some liquid, unfortunately, so I hope that it lasts long... :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a new formula or not, but I have been using this product for years and this is the first time that it hasn&#x27;t worked the way it used to in the past. It was almost as if I was using nothing at all. Maybe it was this particular batch or store that it came from? I will try again with another store and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Works awesome! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and was very satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> Started using this last conditioner in May and my eyelashes have really grown. They were really puny before. If they weren&#x27;t blonde I probably wouldn&#x27;t have to wear mascara, just curl them. I put in on before bed every night. It doesn&#x27;t work right away. Give it about a month and you will notice a difference in longer fuller lashes. I was considering lash extensions but not anymore!</li>
            <li> Boy does this work!  I was afraid this would be like many products that you have to use forever before you see results but I was really impressed at how quickly I noticed the difference. I had accidently pulled most of my lashes out using a bad eyelash curler.  My friend suggested this and I have never had such full, strong and long lashes in my life and I&#x27;m over 50.  I wish I knew about this sooner. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works great. helps lashes grow.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 3 weeks and my lashes are noticeably longer.  I am hoping they become fuller too but it is still early.  So far, I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> There has apparently been a change to this formula because I&#x27;m experiencing some eye irritation that is probably from a new ingredient.  I will not buy this again!</li>
            <li> I probably gave this 4 stars because it&#x27;s taking longer than I&#x27;d like, but my lashes are longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> applied at night...and it works...careful if you use a night mask to cover you eyes...wait until it dries first because little hairs will grow around your  eye too...you only want the lashes...</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!! Super worth it!!! Got it in the mail earlier than expected :)</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that claim to do the same thing (such as City Lash), but Revitalash truly does work.  I started to see bald spots being filled in within 3 weeks.  I&#x27;ve tried Revitalash  in the past and my eyelashes got so long that I had to trim them.  They would hit my sunglasses when I blinked.  I only tried a different brand because of the expense, but don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.  I came back to Revialash because it works and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Started working within 2 weeks. I&#x27;m in love and will always use the product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It really works if you remember to use it.  I have a bad habit of forgetting to put it on at night but if used consistently it really works.</li>
            <li> Best product for lash lengthening out there, amazing results and the bottle lasts for a very long time . Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Fantastic results!!! You have to use it to believe it!!! My eyelashes with good mascara actually look fake!!! Very happy. Only downside I have been told is if you stop using it eventually your eyelashes will go back to the way they were pre-Revitalash. So I guess that means it is a life time commitment. And it is expensive...</li>
            <li> I have only been using a week. So have to see how it works over next couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for the past month and I can definitely see a noticeable change in the length of my lashes. I&#x27;ve tried Latisse before but it was too strong for me and made my eyes red, swollen and itchy. (I am still using Latisse on my eyebrows though, which doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me.)     Revitalash hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes at all. I&#x27;m loving finally having longer lashes without any irritation or other negative side effects!     P.S. This is Graham&#x27;s wife&#x27;s review. Of course Graham is a typical guy who has long lashes and doesn&#x27;t need any help.  ;)</li>
            <li> Apparently these are all scams. However I could swear this one works. I can&#x27;t get extensions anymore so I use this. It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for a full year. I decided to try a cheaper product of the same sort, but it did nothing for my lashes, despite their claims! I noticed that because I had not used Revitalash in many months my lashes were once again short and thin. I HAD to return to my original product!! This stuff is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> After using this religiously every night, I started noticing results after about 2-3 weeks.. When I stopped the results faded fairly quickly, maybe 5-7 days or so. It is a bit watery and you do not need to put much on the brush to get results, plus it will last longer this way. :)</li>
            <li> Just as the seller promised! I am very please! I will be buying from this vendor again! Thank you</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it. The reason I am not giving it the full 5 stars is because it did not make my eyelashes thicker and it did cause a little bit of darkening of skin at the lash base - but that&#x27;s nothing a tiny bid of BB cream or concealer won&#x27;t blend over. But they do look spectacular. I still have to put on mascara to reveal the full impact, but a single coat of any mascara will do at this point and I don&#x27;t have to search for the next best &amp;#34;fake lashes&amp;#34; look. Without mascara my lashes do look longer, but as they are still thin and the tips are light, it is not as noticeable. I do feel the eyelashes touching my upper eyelid. I am very pleased with the results especially since I was hugely disappointed with brands like mavala and M2, both of which cause a lot of irritation and no advertise results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for a month now and am very pleased. I had eyelash extensions that destroyed my natural lash. I was devastated. I researched quite a few lash serums and Revitalash had great reviews. My lashes are now growing back and look much healthier. I will continue to use revitalash everyday.</li>
            <li> OK. This stuff really works! At the beginning I did not believe this product can make a difference. Like many creams and lotions that really do nothing. I was so wrong. Use daily for about 6 weeks and WHOA!!! My naturally long and thick lashes look twice as long! It is an amazing product, and I am now obsessed with it for good. All women in my family and now my friends all use it! I guess how it really works your lashes do not fall out as they would, and they just keep on growing.... at least it looks like that. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Took about a month to see the difference but I am still very impressed.  Easy to use - just applied it each night before bed.</li>
            <li> Better than latisse.  Must use it every day.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Starting to see improvement after three weeks. I had lost a considerable amount of lashes in the past several years, ( I am 56) and a friend of mine who is 60 had beautiful lashes going on and recommended it.</li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in my lashes!  You need to use it every day for 6 weeks or so.  Now I use it 3 times a week.  One tube lasted me more than two years.</li>
            <li> Too early to know if revitalash works.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps your lashes to grow longer.  It took about 3 weeks to notice results.  The only problem is it irritates my eyes a little.  I use it at night and feel a little bit of a burning sensation.  Nothing terrible, but a little uncomfortable.  It works.</li>
            <li> Luv❤ this product....been using it for over a year.  It&#x27;s ahhhhmazing. My lashes have doubled in length!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. However, I&#x27;d lost my lashes after having lash extensions. I figured I had nothing to lose. So I began using the product. Now, two months later, I&#x27;m amazed! I have long lashes! They actually touch my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I have had a bit of discoloration on my eyelids but nothing major. I do get a tingly feeling when I rub my eyes, but NOTHING that would make me stop using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving it a try. Yeah, it&#x27;s pricey but I spent hundreds on those extensions which ruined my own lashes (which weren&#x27;t that great to begin with). Try it!</li>
            <li> It really works and my lashes look longer and thicker .. Its just an amazing product</li>
            <li> The only conditioner that has ever made my lashes longer.  It took about 3 months to see the results, but my lashes got much longer.  I tried Smart Lash and nothing happened.  This is expensive, but it works if you use it every night.  If you stop using it, your lashes go back to being short, so it is a continual thing......but worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it came quickly!</li>
            <li> I  did not see any effect ,I like to return it ,if it is possible,please let me know.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes and eyebrows are growing nicely after using this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing....only several months and I don&#x27;t even use it every night.  When I put mascara on, my lashes are so long and full, I really love this product</li>
            <li> This works GREAT- My lashes have grown long and thicker since using this product. Last about 6 months</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 6 years, and still get compliments on how long my eyelashes are, compared to what they used to be.  The price is extremely affordable through Amazon, which makes it something I can continue using, instead of a luxury expense.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of using this product my eyelashes are noticeably fuller and longer.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works as long as you use it consistently</li>
            <li> When I first started using, I had already been using a different product, but a friend told me this one had made her eyelashes grow real long and the other  one wasn&#x27;t doing that. I also though Revitalash wasn&#x27;t working, but I was wrong. It is Amazing! My lashes are so long and full with Revitalash. I had short lashes and now they are long and beautiful!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I have a thyroid condition that caused me to basically loose all of my eyelashes, it was terrible! I really was at my wits end about it when my sister told me about this wonderful product. Her hairdresser suggested she try it and after 2 months her lashes were long and thick. I immediately ordered it myself and after about 2 months I had the same results! I truly was shocked at how long and beautiful my lashes grew. I now get compliments all of the time and tell everyone about Revitalash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before it works!!! Will see results in 4 weeks if used overnight and daily!</li>
            <li> Works great and I am very satisfied with product and shipper</li>
            <li> it works but i got red eye so i stop it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but works for me must better than other brands. The effective is clear to see.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is amazing. My eye lashes have grown longer and thicker. It can take a while to start the growth. So be patient. Now that my lashes have grown I only do a maintenance application.</li>
            <li> Have used this successfully for several years. HOWEVER, this batch must have been with a new formula-------totally disappointed and surprised as it wasn&#x27;t any different than putting plain water on the lashes.  Revitalash needs to tighten up their Quality Control or they are going to lose their long-time customers to another brand.</li>
            <li> Good but for price? Don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> Easy to apply applicator allows the formula to go on easy.  You apply it after removing any make-up just before you go to bed. There is no oily residue. I appreciated a change in about two weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonderful. My eye lashes are so long! Five stars!</li>
            <li> LOVE! works well and you will see a change!</li>
            <li> I have used Revitlash before and it lengthen and condition my lashes.</li>
            <li> my all-time favorite beauty trick.....have been using for many years.  i have light green eyes and have never had an issue with the color of my iris changing as has been noted on some websites.  better than mascara!</li>
            <li> You will never regret of buying this, in fact this is one of my most successful purchases. My eyelash have grown double long as before, maybe just because I have short eyelash, but it works, what can I say, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Makes the goodly wife super happy.. only thing that works...</li>
            <li> This is the original and the only formula that has worked for me.  The other formulation ( nourische)  did not do a thing for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Rivitalash is amazing ! I will never try anything else again !</li>
            <li> Used this product before and it works! I&#x27;m very excited to have my long lashes back!</li>
            <li> I have used the lash conditioning product many times and it never fails me. Absolutely makes my lashes thicker and longer without a prescription and at almost half the cost of Latisse. I don&#x27;t really use the mascara that came with so cannot attest to that.  Frankly, I would just by the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I started using this and within two weeks I noticed my eye lashes were getting longer.  It has been about 6 weeks and they are thicker and even longer.  Originally bought at a spa but found it much cheaper on Amazon.  I just ordered more and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Not doing much for my eyelashes..</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I was quite skeptical but after reading the positive reviews decided to give it a shot and am pleased with the results. You do have to have patience as it takes at least 6 weeks to notice a difference. For sure my lashes are now stronger, longer and fuller! Will continue to use Revitalash for sure.</li>
            <li> Used other products before, but this eyelash conditioner seems to distribute the growth evenly. This may also be the continued use of products over the predicted 3 month period to see results. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Makes them eyelashes grow just gotta remember to apply before I go nighty nite!</li>
            <li> Love this product, been using it for 2 years with great results......</li>
            <li> It works!  I&#x27;ve used it for 5 weeks and can see growth.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the original stuff by far...but still helps my poor ole lashes.</li>
            <li> Works its magic! after 2 or 3 weeks you can see your lashes grow!</li>
            <li> Insanely good! My lashes are so long!</li>
            <li> Even though this product is better than the nourishe (sp?) product, it still does not live up to the original product. My opinion is still in review mode. If my opinion changes to reflect a more positive or negative rating, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had this long so I can&#x27;t say yet how well it grows lashes. I use it every single day faithfully before bed as part of my nighttime regimen. My lashes have for sure not gotten shorter and I am starting to see some growth. I&#x27;ll report back if they get to record length!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works on my eyelashes. It doesn&#x27;t cause eye irritation unless it gets inside your eye, but it is supposed to be applied only on the base of the upper eyelashes. I love this product!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;love, love, love&amp;#34; the Revitalash Advanced Eyelash Conditioner..I&#x27;m known as a glamorous grandma, and I&#x27;d like to stay that way..with my reputation intact!  All kidding aside, most of my lashes seem to double in length. enough so, that I have been asked more than once, &amp;#34;are you wearing false lashes?&amp;#34; Needless to say, I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
            <li> The best thing ever.  It worked - like it tells you it will, in two months. You just have to be patient.  I was a fake eyelash user and now - I have my own!!!  Well worth any price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month, and I can see a difference in my lases already.  Checked once to make sure I had taken off my mascara!  Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Item shipped lightning speed! So glad revitalash is back!! I&#x27;ve used several different brands since revitalash was pulled off the market and they were ok. My lashes are lush and full again. Unfortunately, i don&#x27;t have a before picture but they were about half the length.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an amazing result!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive, safe way to grow long lashes, this is it. Love this product and usually a tube lasts about six months when using it once a day.</li>
            <li> Been using Revitalash Advanced for years now, on my brows, and it&#x27;s all &amp;#34;that and more&amp;#34;. Lasts for awhile, helps with the fine hair growth and it&#x27;s a must have in my routine.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This definitely made my lashes longer but is it life changing? Unfortunately, for me no. I would buy again if it was $20-$30. I&#x27;m sure this product works great for others but I&#x27;m naturally blonde, my hair and lashes are very fine. Very easy application and didn&#x27;t have any issues with it changing pigment on eyelids or eye color.</li>
            <li> This product did not do well for me, but my girl friend loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one treatment my eyes reddened and I didn&#x27;t use it again, but gave it to her.  Since Revitalash worked for her and two other name brands did not, I feel it&#x27;s a matter of getting the product your skin likes and not a deficit of the product itself.</li>
            <li> My lashes get so long I have to trim them - so yes it works!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t see any difference, maybe it requires another tube</li>
            <li> I love this product! Nothing looks better than long lush lashed! Especially when you begin to age! I feel so much more attractive!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone always ask me if I have fake eyelashes on!  Sooooo good.  Give it at least 2 months to work. When it starts working it only gets better!</li>
            <li> This product was even more effective before bimoprost was removed because Allergan claimed patent infringement, but even without it, my lashes are noticeably longer.  I remove mascara with Neutrogena makeup remover before applying Revitalash nightly.  First-time users must be patient and wait for lashes to grow out.  With continued use, lashes will get longer and not break off/fall out nearly as much as without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this over Latisse because it&#x27;s less expensive and FAR EASIER TO APPLY.  Get it!</li>
            <li> I was surprised ..it worked quite well. No eye irritation.</li>
            <li> A great product. It should be in every woman&#x27;s &amp;#34;bad of tricks.&amp;#34; Works like a charm - adding length and fullness to lashes.</li>
            <li> Revitalash makes a visible difference.  I have the best lashes of my life at age 70!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this based on a recommendation from a friend. I think it is really making my lashes thicker, fuller, and longer. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, but I&#x27;m told you really notice it after two months of use. Since I&#x27;ve already seen a difference, I&#x27;m looking forward to the two month mark. I&#x27;ve also looked this up on the EWG website, and believe it or not, it is a 2, which makes me even more comfortable using it. I have not experienced the redness on the eyelids that some other reviewers spoke of...personally if it made my eyelids red, I&#x27;d stop using it, as that indicates an allergic reaction, I think. Anyway, so far so good. It hasn&#x27;t made my light brown lashes any darker, but fuller and longer is great.  Update--11/21/2015  So, as some other reviewers mentioned, this began to make my eyelids red, right at the lash line where I apply this. It definitely works and does make your lashes longer and thicker, which is wonderful. However, the red eyes are a real problem if you are not a person who wears makeup every day. My husband even noticed and commented. So, I gave my unused bits to my sister-in-law, who has darker skin. I suppose it&#x27;s a toss-up. I opted not to have red-rimmed eyes, but on my sister-in-law&#x27;s darker skin, the redness didn&#x27;t appear. I am pretty fair-skinned. I thought perhaps the redness was an allergic reaction but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s an allergy, just maybe the function of it stimulating hair growth. So...it&#x27;s mascara for me.</li>
            <li> does not irritate, eyelashes appear longer after several wks of use</li>
            <li> Holy Fishpaste Batman!  Better than the initial formula, doesn&#x27;t turn my eyelids red anymore.  Within a month of using, my eyelashes are freakishly long.  I&#x27;m a 46 year old Irish descent person, whose eyelashes were getting skimpy, this stuff is well worth the money to have gorgeous long, thicker eyelashes</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a good price and it works as long as you remember to use it regularly :)</li>
            <li> I was very happily surprised that is product WORKS!!  Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;It last for a long time. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I got 0 result !!!! Waisted my 74$</li>
            <li> 4th week in and don&#x27;t see a big difference</li>
            <li> At one point, I had thick, medium length eyelashes. Too many hours spent in the desert sun caused them to break and become extremely brittle and short. I read quite a few excellent reviews on this product and hoped for similar results. I was not disappointed.  Week 1. My eyes felt somewhat itchy, kind of like being tired, and I wanted to rub them. No change in length.  Month 1. The itchiness had dissipated and I developed the dark liner that some reviews mentioned. My skin is approximately caramel colored so the effect was rather pretty. It also caused my eyelashes to look even thicker. Thechange in length was not overtly noticeable, but since I spent a lot of time looking in the mirror staring from different angles, I could see the difference.  Week 6. My eyelashes were clearly longer and thicker. The outer ends were curling almost the edges of my eyebrows! In addition, the side effect of the dark line had remained so that I didn&#x27;t even have to put on eyeliner to look like I was wearing a brown liner. The bottle says 8 weeks, but mine was starting to run out at this point.  Week 8. My husband asked if I was wearing fake eyelashes. Awesome!! I bought another bottle to put on every other day to maintain the effect.  Month 3. Some of the longest eyelashes need to trimmed because they have continued growing quickly, but the rest have slowed. I&#x27;m in the middle of bottle 2. I have noticed also that the itchy eye side effect has returned. I still think its worth it. I love being able to leave the house with a really natural appearance. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I saw the almost 5 star rating and that rating is a misperception. I have tried several eyebrow growth serums and this is my comparision:&lt;br /&gt;This product will not promote eyebrow growth however it will make the eyebrows thicker longer and darker. Eyebrows Growth Accelerator Balm PERFECT BROWS actually does promotes the growth of new hairs but it takes a few months to begin working and it is a very slow process. I am currently looking for more effective products but Eyebrows Growth Accelerator Balm PERFECT BROWS is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far. If anyone has additional comparisons please post them. We are all looking for better products.</li>
            <li> Been using for 6 months and my eyelashes have grown long and thick!  So Happy</li>
            <li> I have seen tremendous results in 2 months. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the third eyelash serum I&#x27;ve tried, and so far it is the best. First I tried IMax, which worked well, but was always somehow getting into my eyes and stinging them like crazy. Then I tried RapidLash, which didn&#x27;t work at all for me. But I guess the third time&#x27;s the charm, because I have to tell you, I am blown away by how well Revitalash has been working. My eyelashes were short and seemed to be falling out for some reason. Looked sparse and generally weak. Not good. So I purchased Revitalash in early January, used on both my top and bottom lashes, and after about one month, my eyelashes looked really good ... about as good as they did with the IMax serum, so I was happy. Then after another month, in early March, they looked really full and nice, so I was VERY happy. Now ... after almost another month, my lashes are so long they almost touch my eyebrows, and so thick they look like false lashes! Also.... amazingly ... they have a natural curl to them now. It looks like I used an eyelash curler on them, but I haven&#x27;t! They just naturally curl. Amazing. I am absolutely thrilled with my lashes now, and would recommend Revitalash to anyone!  5 stars! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Have used it for years.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The bottle  came empty.</li>
            <li> It arrived on ti,e but when I&#x27;d open it it was dry inside.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but never got the results I have with Revitalash  it definitely&lt;br /&gt; works!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it good for others but it not work on me. Make me feel burn and itching so I stop used it after a week.&lt;br /&gt;I hear there are some fake out the market but I don&#x27;t know how to recognize what I bought is fake or not but it not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste money and believe in the magic stuff. Not true as Advertising.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really really works.  There was a &amp;#34;reformulation&amp;#34; and they package it as &amp;#34;Nouriche&amp;#34; which didn&#x27;t work AT ALL.  I tracked down the Advanced formula and it amazing</li>
            <li> The screw top broke and the liquid leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now buying my second bottle of Revitalash because, despite my skepticism, it has worked amazingly! I originally bought it while on vacation in Hawaii, at a spa, and the sales gal was so convincing that I couldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;. But after 4 weeks of nightly use my lashes were brushing up against my eyelids...without mascara on! I then just used it a couple of nights a week to maintain them and as others have mentioned, I love being able to get away with minimal eye makeup most days! My new trick is to just curl them and set them with clear mascara for a nice, relaxed, natural look. I love this so much I&#x27;m buying the eyebrow product too, so that I can hopefully cut back on having to fill in my brows everyday!</li>
            <li> Revitalash is the best. I tried rapidlash product for two months but couldn&#x27;t see the result. For me, this product surely works.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product now a couple of times and my mom love this !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 months, and I have not noticed any improvement in my lashes. They are still thin and fall out before they are able to grow any length. Revitalash was expensive, so I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone. The only product that is proven to grow eyelashes is a prescription product, and it can change your eye color.</li>
            <li> When I used the original Revitalash it was great.  this one not so grat</li>
            <li> The label says you need to 18+, not pregnant and not nursing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if worth the money?</li>
            <li> Had used the product a few years back and had decent result but stopped due to pregnancy and nursing.  Thought I&#x27;d give it a shot again.  Used a different product and had great result but cost was getting up there so decided to try Revitalash again.  This appears a bit different, turns out there are some changes to the formula.  This new formula caused red burning irritation after first use.  Could not wear contacts for about 2 weeks, let alone any eye make up.  Waited a month before trying again to see if it&#x27;d be better, but same thing.  would not recommend.  Try LiLash instead.</li>
            <li> This is the best!!! Unbelievable how long and full your lashes are!! Well worth the money!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my lashes longer and more plentiful</li>
            <li> I very rarely take the time to write a review but after using revitalash for over a year I felt compelled to write one. This stuff really works!! As others have said it takes a few weeks to see results but give it time, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Every single time this runs out I will order it again...for the rest of my life.  After applying Revitalash daily for a few weeks my lashes were noticeably longer...now I can even skip days and the long lashes remain.  Putting on mascara is a blast because my lashes are AMAZING!!!  I have been using this for over 2 years and love it...no side effects...just long, beautiful lashes!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have thick long beautiful lashes from using this.</li>
            <li> It works so well, my eyelashes are way thicker and longer than before.  It takes about 4-5 weeks, now I only use it every 2 or 3 days to maintain.  Definitely ordering it again, works way better than the cheaper versions.</li>
