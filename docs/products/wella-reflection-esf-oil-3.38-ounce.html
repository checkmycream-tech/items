            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products and this has by far been the best.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love how this makes my hair smell and feel.  </li>
            <li>I love this product leaves your hair so silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light but leaves my hair tangle-free, glossy, and healthy (and not greasy at all).</li>
            <li>Great product especially if you hair is breaking off .</li>
            <li>This product is worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I have curly/wavy hair and this oil makes my hair soft, I never get tangles, and it makes my hair smell amazing without looking oily</li>
            <li>Not quite the same as what is sold in the US and not as good.</li>
            <li>And while no, this product will not straighten your hair, it will provide a great shine, smoothing, and finishing without weighing down or looking oily.</li>
            <li>love the way it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good product and will last me a very ling time.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this from my hairdresser and loved it, but when I purchased it from this particular vendor, it arrived with Polish writing on the bottle and box, so it&#x27;s not from an american vendor.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely Devine !</li>
            <li>Like so many before my expectations were low.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different oils and none of them work</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I have used for awhile and really like it!</li>
            <li>Manages my fizziness but if you use more than a dime size, can leave your oil very oily the next day.</li>
            <li>have really jumped out of sight though</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it for naturally curly or when I wear it straight!  </li>
            <li>It has a high content of alcohol in it, which dries out the hair</li>
            <li>Lasts forever and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it does not weigh down or make your hair appear greasy!</li>
            <li>this is my fourth bottle, along with Deva &amp;#34;NO Poo and Daily Conditioner&amp;#34; my hair is soft and manageable.  </li>

            <li> Great for my hair!  Price on this and a Nexxus product I like have really jumped out of sight though</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I use it in place of any styling product and my hair looks great with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Devine ! Not greasy at all. Only a few drops is needed. Amazing scent !!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about this product. Like so many before my expectations were low. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;My advice, use when your hair is dry, and before you style. I have tried when wet, and the results were not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, unruly, frizzy hair. And while no, this product will not straighten your hair, it will provide a great shine, smoothing, and finishing without weighing down or looking oily.</li>
            <li> OMG Thank God for this product YES YES YES is the best hair oil ever!! I have tried so many different oils and none of them work, i been using this oil for over 7 months leaves my hair shiny, smells great, it&#x27;s not greasy if you have curly hair and you want the bouncy hair for blow drying..buy this product!! Don&#x27;t waste your money on other hair oils this one is worth it...</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Manages my fizziness but if you use more than a dime size, can leave your oil very oily the next day.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness! This is my holy grail hair product! I have long, medium to thick hair that tends to tangle VERY easily especially when wet and this is the only product that I use now after washing my hair. It is light but leaves my hair tangle-free, glossy, and healthy (and not greasy at all). I&#x27;ve tried so many products and this has by far been the best.</li>
            <li> Great product especially if you hair is breaking off .</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair look great.  LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from my hairdresser and loved it, but when I purchased it from this particular vendor, it arrived with Polish writing on the bottle and box, so it&#x27;s not from an american vendor.  It has a high content of alcohol in it, which dries out the hair and it feels like it has been diluted with a lot of alcohol or water compared with the sample I got. I would recommend it, but perhaps not from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Great product and great value for the money.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I ordered.  Great product!  Great service.  thank you!</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> amazing! I have curly/wavy hair and this oil makes my hair soft, I never get tangles, and it makes my hair smell amazing without looking oily</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for awhile and really like it! I have fine hair and it does not weigh down or make your hair appear greasy! Keeps it very healthy looking!</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair without frizz.  A little goes a loooong way!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair this is my fourth bottle, along with Deva &amp;#34;NO Poo and Daily Conditioner&amp;#34; my hair is soft and manageable.  I towel my hair after showering and then take two pumps and rub through my hair add Deva gel and I can either go curly or blow out....</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It does not weight down my hair and gives it some shine.</li>
            <li> Arrived with a cracked cap. But it&#x27;s a good product and will last me a very ling time.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever and can&#x27;t live without it. Use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it for naturally curly or when I wear it straight!  AMAZING STUFF!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!! Adore the scent &amp; how it stays fragrant in my hair hours &amp; hours after I&#x27;ve used it. Fastest delivery, best price, ordered it before, will order it again &amp; again!!!</li>

            <li> This product is worth the price!  It feels and works to make shine with out the weight of oil.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize I purchased this from a British distributor.  Not quite the same as what is sold in the US and not as good.</li>
