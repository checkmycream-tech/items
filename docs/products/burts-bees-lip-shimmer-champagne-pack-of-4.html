            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss!  </li>
            <li>Great shade!</li>
            <li>My sister got me the beautiful champagne color a couple years ago for my birthday.</li>
            <li>Great for lightweight, daytime look.  </li>
            <li>Great to have in your car at arm&#x27;s reach before you head into work or home.</li>
            <li>My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  </li>
            <li>I always purchase, Its my favorite!!</li>
            <li>Although I have to apply it more often than the chemically altered ones this one has a nice shimmer and tingles deliciously with a hint of mint.</li>
            <li>I have tried the darker colors, but they don&#x27;t look good on me unless I mix them with the Champagne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s minty and makes my lips feel good.</li>
            <li>It looks as good as it feels.</li>
            <li>I have found this to be the perfect product for both the health, and cuteness of my lips--both of which are very important to me.  &#x3D;]  </li>
            <li>Love this, shiny, great smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;lipless.\\&quot; Watermelon is a nice neutral, every-day color on me.</li>
            <li>Plum and caramel I need to sort of dab on lightly, but I think would be gorgeous on someone with a darker complexion.  </li>
            <li>Too much bright lipstick can make us girls look older!!!</li>
            <li>Great color and great healing for dry chapped lips</li>
            <li>I love the hint of color and the coolness of the peppermint.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only moisturizing, it also gives a perfect hint of color to my lips.</li>
            <li>Love Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>Love this minty lip balm.  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t have as many color choices (yet...).</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>love this lip shimmer</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My daughters favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it sells in a 4-pack.</li>
            <li>Love the tingle, love the shimmer, love the hint of color.  </li>
            <li>Love the toffee, too, but it seems they&#x27;ve stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>And at such a good price!</li>
            <li>The champagne color is a gorgeous baby pink and it&#x27;s perfect to wear during the day, especially during the spring.</li>
            <li>The color is light silvery pinkish tone.</li>
            <li>Received exact product and received it very quickly!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my quick, easy, go-to beauty products that I always carry in my purse.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty on its own but looks gorgeous over my pink lip stain.</li>
            <li>the moisturizer is minty cool.  </li>
            <li>I have a light \\&quot;spring\\&quot; complexion, so Champagne (sheer pink) is my favorite color, but I don&#x27;t look good in it in photos.</li>
            <li>The price is right, too.</li>
            <li>Guava--while I love the color--is a bit frosty for my taste, and since I&#x27;ve heard the same said about the strawberry, I have not added that to my collection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good everyday color.</li>
            <li>Nice sheer light pink sheen which leaves an after sting from the peppermint.  </li>
            <li>Pure Shine (which is another of my favorites).  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Was not the color I expected, it was not as indicated on the cap, but I love the product, just did not like the colour</li>
            <li>This shimmer goes on light but enough that you do see it.</li>
            <li>I wish it was the same size as the original.</li>
            <li>The first time I used Champagne over my Jane Iredale color, my husband looked at me and said, \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>It is great alone or over any other lip sticks or mix with other lip glosses.</li>
            <li>Fits nice in a small pocket book.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but I am not paying $2 more than my usual original balm for sheer color &amp; shimmer.in</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think he realized exactly what was different, but he really appreciated my new look!</li>
            <li>I would like if Burt&#x27;s Bees would come out with a light pink that is not frosty, so</li>
            <li>Use this everyday and was glad to purchase in quantity.</li>
            <li>It puts a subtle shimmer on lips that is attractive and similar to the shimmery glaze left by pricier alternatives like Yves Saint Laurent Rouge</li>
            <li>All of the colors that I have tried are flavored with peppermint oil, so you will not want to use it if you are sensitive to that.    </li>
            <li>, it enhances your natural lip color.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty and not intense.</li>
            <li>Champagne is the one I use most often, as its very subtle, and almost a non-color, for when you want a natural look.  </li>
            <li>The Champagne Shimmer is a sheer gloss that gives a young, summery look to your lips.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer isn&#x27;t sticky, adds a classy shimmer, does away with dry lips and is tiny enough to slip into the pocket of your tightest jeans without anyone knowing it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>Great sparkle and protect my lips in cold weather (all year round here).</li>

            <li> Especially in view of the fact that there are common carcinogenic impurities in petroleum jelly (called PAH&#x27;s) and it is considered a probable carcinogen and the use of untested petrolatum in cosmetics has been banned in the EU since 2004.    </li>

            <li> Living in Maine, I have found Mad Gabs Moose Shimmer, a similar product for about half the price, but it is not available on Amazon (yet...)</li>
            <li> Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as I have hit my late fifties-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this shimmery color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks too, not too flashy</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either.  </li>

            <li> I love this product! My sister got me the beautiful champagne color a couple years ago for my birthday. The color is pretty on its own but looks gorgeous over my pink lip stain. I only have two gripes. One is the size, why oh why must it be so stinkin&#x27; tiny? I wish it was the same size as the original. The second is the price. I&#x27;m sorry but I am not paying $2 more than my usual original balm for sheer color &amp; shimmer.in a much, much smaller size. If they lower the price, I will definately make room in my bag for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I love the way it makes my lips feel. It&#x27;s not only moisturizing, it also gives a perfect hint of color to my lips. The champagne color is a gorgeous baby pink and it&#x27;s perfect to wear during the day, especially during the spring. It&#x27;s one of my quick, easy, go-to beauty products that I always carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> Love this, shiny, great smell. Hard to find in stores. I sometimes layer it w/ lipstick and it makes a glossy shimmery shine. Or wear it alone too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as I have hit my late fifties- makes my lips shine and the moisturizer is minty cool.  Great for lightweight, daytime look.  Too much bright lipstick can make us girls look older!!!</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Love this minty lip balm.  It puts a subtle shimmer on lips that is attractive and similar to the shimmery glaze left by pricier alternatives like Yves Saint Laurent Rouge Pure Shine (which is another of my favorites).  The one itch I have with BB&#x27;s lipbalm is that it does not seem to have an exfoliating quality which perhaps the pricier lip balms do.</li>
            <li> Nice sheer light pink sheen which leaves an after sting from the peppermint.  Great to have in your car at arm&#x27;s reach before you head into work or home.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with everything.</li>
            <li> When I heard that factoid a few years ago, I vowed that I was not going to eat chemicals and preservatives. Especially in view of the fact that there are common carcinogenic impurities in petroleum jelly (called PAH&#x27;s) and it is considered a probable carcinogen and the use of untested petrolatum in cosmetics has been banned in the EU since 2004.    I have been using this 100% natural product (marked on the label) for at least ten years.     I have a light \\&quot;spring\\&quot; complexion, so Champagne (sheer pink) is my favorite color, but I don&#x27;t look good in it in photos. I wear Guava when I am wearing lavender or purple. Peony makes me look \\&quot;lipless.\\&quot; Watermelon is a nice neutral, every-day color on me. I have tried the darker colors, but they don&#x27;t look good on me unless I mix them with the Champagne. I also use the darker colors for cheek color. (How I miss the Merlot!!!)     All of the colors that I have tried are flavored with peppermint oil, so you will not want to use it if you are sensitive to that.    I removed one star because I believe that Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Shimmer is overpriced at $4.99 for .09 oz. I am seeking cheaper alternatives. Living in Maine, I have found Mad Gabs Moose Shimmer, a similar product for about half the price, but it is not available on Amazon (yet...) and they don&#x27;t have as many color choices (yet...).</li>
            <li> I love this. The color is light silvery pinkish tone. It&#x27;s minty and makes my lips feel good. The color is pretty and not intense. It&#x27;s a good everyday color.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Has mint taste. Great sparkle and protect my lips in cold weather (all year round here). Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I always purchase, Its my favorite!!</li>
            <li> As described.  Use this everyday and was glad to purchase in quantity.</li>

            <li> love this lip shimmer</li>
            <li> I wear Burts Bees in Champagne over my Burts Bees Nutmeg Lip Shimmer or my Jane Iredale Sarah lipstick. The Champagne Shimmer is a sheer gloss that gives a young, summery look to your lips.  The first time I used Champagne over my Jane Iredale color, my husband looked at me and said, \\&quot;Wow! You look great!\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t think he realized exactly what was different, but he really appreciated my new look!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else! I love it. It looks as good as it feels. Would order again. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Great color and great healing for dry chapped lips</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite.  An excellent product!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss!  Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has.  My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  It isn&#x27;t sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either.  It has no taste (no strawberry, for example).  I think I am one of the last holdouts to try Burt&#x27;s Bees, but now I am a believer!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Never without it! I wear it over a darker lipstick to tone it down some. Great shade!</li>
            <li> This shimmer goes on light but enough that you do see it. It is great alone or over any other lip sticks or mix with other lip glosses. Fits nice in a small pocket book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this shimmery color and I love that it sells in a 4-pack. And at such a good price! Makes my day!</li>
            <li> I have found this to be the perfect product for both the health, and cuteness of my lips--both of which are very important to me.  &#x3D;]  Love the tingle, love the shimmer, love the hint of color.  Champagne is the one I use most often, as its very subtle, and almost a non-color, for when you want a natural look.  My other favorites are peony, and watermelon.  Love the toffee, too, but it seems they&#x27;ve stopped making it.  Plum and caramel I need to sort of dab on lightly, but I think would be gorgeous on someone with a darker complexion.  Guava--while I love the color--is a bit frosty for my taste, and since I&#x27;ve heard the same said about the strawberry, I have not added that to my collection.  I would like if Burt&#x27;s Bees would come out with a light pink that is not frosty, so I hope that they are reading this.  &#x3D;P</li>
            <li> I prefer this one to other lip protection products. Although I have to apply it more often than the chemically altered ones this one has a nice shimmer and tingles deliciously with a hint of mint. I like the way it looks too, not too flashy, it enhances your natural lip color.</li>
