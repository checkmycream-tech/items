            <li>I use it mostly under my eyes</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye treatment.</li>
            <li>If a product makes you feel better about yourself then you should use it.</li>
            <li>Nothing made them look better except fillers.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the 2 mixed together.  </li>
            <li>I find they work much better.  </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I found that it did seems to smooth out my skin and was glad to find it again on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but it does smooth some fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face somewhat smooth</li>
            <li>does smooth the lines under eyes effectively,that being said,every product does not work for everyone.</li>
            <li>I find dabbing a goodly amount and then letting it completely absorb</li>
            <li>I originally tried it when I found it as a closeout at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>After one month of using this serum day and night (it&#x27;s the first thing I put on after washing my face), these wrinkles are mostly gone and my whole face looks lifted.</li>
            <li>And smile lines.  </li>
            <li>This eye serum is worth trying because you&#x27;ll see results right away.</li>
            <li>It has really softened it!</li>
            <li>Very easy to put just a small amount on and rubs in easily.  </li>
            <li>It actually really works for me</li>
            <li>but I do feel like it really does target the lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper here.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>- really doesn&#x27;t do much to them</li>
            <li>Maybe works can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>really nice dried supper fast u could fell tightening but not drying it also had no odor</li>
            <li>It is cheaper than just about any other product out there and has outstanding results.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do more than any other moisturizer that I could have spend $5.00 on.</li>
            <li>and my face is softer, more smooth, and I do see a decrease in the little lines that are starting to show on my forehead and around my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smile lines are now *barely* perceptible.  </li>
            <li>i am 37 and don;t have a ton of wrinkles yet, except for frown lines, and some on forehead from squinting, but the first time i used it the frown lines actually disappeared!!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell if it is making a difference but will continue and probably order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>So far, it is working well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re not going to wake up one day a month after starting it and see a 16 year old face, but it does what it says it does...better, and cheaper than the more expensive over the counter brands.</li>

            <li> Lasts much longer than one would think when you see the small tube.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that there is really anything that will stop aging but at least this cream makes one feel that ones skin is lubricated.  </li>

            <li> the other lines are still there on forehead, but like i said i only used it once!!!!</li>
            <li> This little tube only lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, not sure if its actually doing anything, but I keep applying it!</li>
            <li> Although I have deeper wrinkles around the mouth, this product helps a little but not a lot.  </li>
            <li> Like this product &amp; not available in the stores in my area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this in the store anymore, not sure if they quit making it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve tried expensive creams, serums....  </li>
            <li> So sad that they dicontinued this.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that there is really anything that will stop aging but at least this cream makes one feel that ones skin is lubricated.  It remains to be seen if it works on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 and have/had crows feet.  I&#x27;m a product junky &amp; I&#x27;ve tried expensive creams, serums....  This is one of the better ones.  In conjunction with my L&#x27;Oreal face oil my fine lines are almost gone!!  Also, my sagging eyelid is more taut &amp; I know it&#x27;s because of this product, because I don&#x27;t put the oil there!!  Of course being the nice sister I am I ran out &amp; bought it for my twin sister.  She loves the neat looking bottle!</li>
            <li> Great stuff to plump up wrinkles</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a bit of difference.  Maybe it&#x27;s for younger women whose skin isn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very easy to put just a small amount on and rubs in easily.  Lasts much longer than one would think when you see the small tube.  Have re-ordered and will again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have been using it for a month now, and totally love the results it has given to my appearance. I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends!!!</li>
            <li> have used this product before and like it</li>
            <li> Did not see any improvement.  Used for several weeks, left a film when applying foundation.&lt;br /&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. No recommended.</li>
            <li> So sad that they dicontinued this. It actually really works for me and I can always tell a difference when I run out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for a long period of time but I do feel like it really does target the lines and wrinkles.  I will definitely keep using it.  The only downside to this is finding it...</li>
            <li> have this on auto ship this is great stuff give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Does wonders for my skin. No oily residue. Healthy glow with reduced wrinkle appearance.  Much cheaper here.</li>
            <li> The pump broke,  I didn&#x27;t like the scent, and I did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for some time now and it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s advertised to be.  I use it mostly under my eyes and it really is amazing.  I find dabbing a goodly amount and then letting it completely absorb and I don&#x27;t use any type of make up around my eyes except when I may be experiencing an allergy attack.  Then I put a dab of makeup and a dab of cream in the palm of my hand and blend together and then dab around eye area.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye treatment. It has a cooling feel when you put it on, and my eye area feels tightened. I don&#x27;t see this in the store anymore, not sure if they quit making it. I have yet to find another eye treatment that feels as nice as this one.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li> Given me a breakout...</li>
            <li> Although I have deeper wrinkles around the mouth, this product helps a little but not a lot.  If a product makes you feel better about yourself then you should use it.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, not sure if its actually doing anything, but I keep applying it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I originally tried it when I found it as a closeout at the grocery store.  I found that it did seems to smooth out my skin and was glad to find it again on Amazon.  I use it once a day under a tinted moisturizer and maybe I am seeing what I want to see but for the price, I will continue using it as long as I can find it.  I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is worth trying because you&#x27;ll see results right away. I&#x27;m 37 and getting carded...thank you, Garnier!</li>
            <li> I had wrinkles in my forehead from a bout of shingles 10 years ago. Nothing made them look better except fillers.  After one month of using this serum day and night (it&#x27;s the first thing I put on after washing my face), these wrinkles are mostly gone and my whole face looks lifted. It is cheaper than just about any other product out there and has outstanding results. I just wish it came in a larger size too. This little tube only lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> I was using another, more expensive drug store brand but decided to give this one a try.  It works...it might take a couple weeks before you see a difference, but I do see one.  I use it with the Ultra  lift 2 in 1 and my face is softer, more smooth, and I do see a decrease in the little lines that are starting to show on my forehead and around my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re not going to wake up one day a month after starting it and see a 16 year old face, but it does what it says it does...better, and cheaper than the more expensive over the counter brands.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in a magazine and I loved it - however when I got the product I realized that I&#x27;d opened the sample I&#x27;d received incorrectly so I was only getting the white lotion - wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the 2 mixed together.  Makes my face somewhat smooth but it isn&#x27;t any miracle solution.  I don&#x27;t have crow&#x27;s feet but I do have some wrinkles (frown lines) - really doesn&#x27;t do much to them but it does smooth some fine lines.  I&#x27;m 49 and have used Oil of Olay products since I was 20.  I find they work much better.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again and the price isn&#x27;t all that great for .5 oz.</li>
            <li> I had forehead lines before this product came along.  And smile lines.  The smile lines are now *barely* perceptible.  And I gotta award points to Garnier for presentation.</li>
            <li> I USED A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS ONLY DIANNE YOUNGS UNWRINKLE WORKS. THIS IS A JOKE.I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER.</li>
            <li> once applied felt really nice dried supper fast u could fell tightening but not drying it also had no odor</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, packed well, shipped fast!!</li>
            <li> Okay. Didn&#x27;t do more than any other moisturizer that I could have spend $5.00 on.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with forehead lines but not eyes.  Eyes are puffy after using this. Will not order again.</li>
            <li> i am 37 and don;t have a ton of wrinkles yet, except for frown lines, and some on forehead from squinting, but the first time i used it the frown lines actually disappeared!!!!  the other lines are still there on forehead, but like i said i only used it once!!!!</li>
            <li> The product I have from the Dr.Perricone line does not perform as good as this and that product was over $100,it does smooth the lines under eyes effectively,that being said,every product does not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I adore this! I have a deep frown line between my eyes. It has really softened it! I am over the moon with the results!</li>
            <li> This product works for me!  I like it because it does not break out my skin.  So far, it is working well.</li>
            <li> Like this product &amp; not available in the stores in my area. So thank you.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and at night.  It&#x27;s hard to tell if it is making a difference but will continue and probably order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> So so, not a fan of Garnier&#x27;s fragrances. Maybe works can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
