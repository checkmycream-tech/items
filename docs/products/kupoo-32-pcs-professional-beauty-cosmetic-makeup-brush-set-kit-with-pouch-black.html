            <li>Good for the price to have more brushes</li>
            <li>Love the fan brush most brushes are very soft but the foundation brushes aren&#x27;t the best and a lot of  repeats</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>Look better onine.</li>
            <li>They look better on line for sure..</li>
            <li>most are unusable</li>
            <li>I recently used them and they&#x27;re wonderful</li>
            <li>Was very happy with the entire set at this price.</li>
            <li>I just love these brushes</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get this many brushes for this price anywhere</li>
            <li>Though there is some shedding it is very minimal, wonderful brushes for an even better price!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive these in the mail the day I ordered them online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>yes they&#x27;re somewhat soft and they have a good variety.</li>
            <li>My package was delivered a day before it&#x27;s original delivery date.</li>
            <li>and I love them so much!</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly and in tact.  </li>
            <li>they do smell a bit because of the pleather ( the case) and honestly the case is bigger</li>
            <li>All the bristles are falling out of every brush from the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>All the bristles are falling out of every brush from the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>Came in really fast!</li>
            <li>They are good except that all yhe brushes are basically the same just bigger</li>
            <li>Some of them are good brushes but keep in mind that the photos are lying and they&#x27;re mainly flat brushes so unless you really like working with flat brushes you can purchase this</li>
            <li>The Pouch they come in is very durable and all brushes were in tact.</li>
            <li>My daughter really wanted this brush set, so I ordered it for a gift.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, they were a waste of money, and I threw them all away.</li>
            <li>They arrived right on time, and are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t excited at all when it finally arrived.</li>
            <li>I could have saved up for decent make up brushes.</li>
            <li>Everything else I really love, except tthe fact that I had to throw away one of the fluffy brushes because i would softly run my fingers through it and like more than 20 hairs would fall out...but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li>The big ones do shed a little bit but are okay after 1 use!</li>
            <li>Really soft!</li>
            <li>other than that cool maybe wash before</li>
            <li>My other daughter now wants one too!</li>
            <li>A few of the bristles came out on the first application but haven&#x27;t since that time.</li>

            <li> They do shed a little bit, I only notice the face brushes (blush/powder) shed a little bit</li>
            <li> it is not a good set to use especially around the eyes when bristles fall in to your eyes.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Beware these brushes are very very stiff</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Worst brushes I ever used!</li>

            <li> very nice. I like it a lot</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok. Look better onine. I think they should be label. But you get what you pay for, oh well.</li>
            <li> Good for the price to have more brushes however it was embarrassing to use the brushes on set&lt;br /&gt;and hair from the brush started falling all over my clients face...other than that cool maybe wash before&lt;br /&gt;using or prepare for it to shed.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Minimum shedding. I use them everyday. I have had mines for 2 years now</li>
            <li> All the bristles are falling out of every brush from the first time I used them. They look better on line for sure..</li>
            <li> Beware these brushes are very very stiff most are unusable not worth the money even at such a low price definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> My package was delivered a day before it&#x27;s original delivery date. The brushes are great. A few of the bristles came out on the first application but haven&#x27;t since that time. Overall they were what i expected.</li>

            <li> They are good except that all yhe brushes are basically the same just bigger I hope that makes sences ha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for months now and I love them so much! They do shed a little bit, I only notice the face brushes (blush/powder) shed a little bit but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. For the price I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these brushes. I bought them, yes they&#x27;re somewhat soft and they have a good variety. BUT every time I use them I spend three hours picking the bristles off of my face EVERY brush in this pack sheds an incredible amount it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for. Bristles fall everywhere. This set does not work properly the bristles on these brushes fall apart everywhere it is not a good set to use especially around the eyes when bristles fall in to your eyes. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Bought it as a Christmas present for my sister.  She loves them.</li>
            <li> Great product! Gift for a friend. He loved it.</li>
            <li> Some of them are good brushes but keep in mind that the photos are lying and they&#x27;re mainly flat brushes so unless you really like working with flat brushes you can purchase this</li>
            <li> This came in the mail today ( before I did my makeup) and they work great! The big ones do shed a little bit but are okay after 1 use! they do smell a bit because of the pleather ( the case) and honestly the case is bigger then it looks in the picture but not too much bigger! But, I still recommend this product to anyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive these in the mail the day I ordered them online. However, I wasn&#x27;t excited at all when it finally arrived. The brush strands immediately started to fall off and left a mess everywhere. I don&#x27;t even use them. Honestly, they were a waste of money, and I threw them all away. I could have saved up for decent make up brushes. These are a joke.</li>
            <li> Came in really fast! Really soft!</li>
            <li> The brushes look and feel good...but after using them for one month some bristles appear to be getting loose..</li>
            <li> Not very soft. Lots of choices. But rough.</li>
            <li> I just love these brushes</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this</li>
            <li> These brushes are everything I thought they would be and more! They arrived right on time, and are extremely soft. Though there is some shedding it is very minimal, wonderful brushes for an even better price!</li>

            <li> These brushes are AMAZING!! Love the quality; they arrived on time and they work great!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It&#x27;s cheap so you get what you paid for. There&#x27;s about 3 brushes that I like.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get this many brushes for this price anywhere</li>
            <li> Great brushes, work awesome.</li>
