            <li>That way, I know my laptop will fit!!</li>
            <li>It is so unique and so beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Once it airs out it is super cute and perfect.</li>
            <li>I got this sleeve for my 11.6&amp;#34; netbook and it was a great fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright and cute.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice sleeve for my 11&amp;#34; macbook air.</li>
            <li>Nice zippers, padded and lined.</li>
            <li>Nice made case.  </li>
            <li>Nicely padded inside, also.</li>
            <li>Nice design and make though.</li>
            <li>The interior is a nice plush fabric.  </li>
            <li>The case has a dual zipper, which is kind of neat</li>
            <li>Fits great, beautiful color, and good quality.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, fits great.</li>
            <li>I bought the size suitable for the MacBook air A1370</li>
            <li>Really cute pattern, soft inside, perfect for what I needed it for</li>
            <li>The Color is great &amp; exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>The case isn&#x27;t too bulky and the colors are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I will probably use this until I find a better fitting case.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my laptop safe.</li>
            <li>Nice to look at, and will keep the laptop secure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and attractive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that over time it&#x27;ll stretch out more.</li>
            <li>The design is as shown, perhaps the colors are a tad more muted than pictured.</li>
            <li>The inside lining is soft and it&#x27;s a perfectly snug fit for an 11&#x27; mac book air.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute case</li>
            <li>so I just slip it in backwards and it zips neatly without touching the corners.</li>
            <li>and I get lots of compliments all the time; it&#x27;s really fantastic!</li>
            <li>; there&#x27;s a lot of room at the top.</li>
            <li>It could use more padding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already gotten tons of compliments on this cute case and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I purchased an InCase sleeve for my daughter&#x27;s Mac Book Air and it is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be returning it, though, because I found another solution that suits my needs more than this does.</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>Love the design.</li>
            <li>I love the case.</li>
            <li>No complaints. :)</li>
            <li>Love the retro design.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>We ordered the same thing in a 12 inch and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>Most of the laptop goes in</li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>It is cute in person.</li>
            <li>Very nice design and much appreciated by the person using it.</li>
            <li>Super cute and durable!</li>
            <li>The design is pretty and the material is good quality.</li>
            <li>and although it is a cute looking cover that might be fine for home use, the padding is substandard to keep a traveling computer safe.</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon makes returns easy.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily see the size options.</li>
            <li>Fast, sent me an email to make sure I got it, that it was in good shape.</li>
            <li>My computer fits perfectly inside and it seems to be well made; no frayed ends or loose threads.  </li>
            <li>, it is nice and I will get another of the same kind, but I do like the pattern on the picture better!</li>
            <li>I love the pattern, it&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t able to get my laptop in at first...</li>
            <li>If your laptop is 11.6, you will not be able to fit a charger/mouse inside of this case with the laptop, just FYI.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors, nice foam padding, fits my Macbook well, the zipper slides easily, received item quickly and seller sent a follow-up email promptly - I&#x27;m very pleased with the item and service.</li>
            <li>Overall,  I think its adorable, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, and I think you would be too.</li>
            <li>Strong zipper.</li>
            <li>However, when I received this, it had a really strong mildew smell to it.</li>
            <li>This fits my macbook air (11 inch) and is super cute.</li>
            <li>Super cute, looks like the picture.</li>
            <li>Design is super cute and as shown.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the case.</li>
            <li>Well it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I like the style, portability and fit.</li>
            <li>I ordered the 11&amp;#34; in version for my Dell 11&amp;#34; Inspirion 3000, going by dimensions it should have fit.</li>
            <li>and I wish it would fit, but it does not</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and lovely</li>
            <li>it fit but does not zips all the way</li>
            <li>i wanted a sleeve that my ipad fit in when i travel.</li>
            <li>nice colors and very durable.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my HP Chromebook 11, and I can fit that</li>
            <li>now it has a secure case that is fashionable to my style.</li>
            <li>My laptop is 11.6 and it didn&#x27;t quite fit.  </li>
            <li>This sleeve was supposed to fit an 11-11.6 laptop, but, it would barely fit my 11.6 in laptop.</li>
            <li>The inside is soft, good for protection.</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with this purchase for my Mac its stylish and padded, not necessarily for protection though.</li>
            <li>The size is a perfect fit for the 11\\&quot; small mac book air.</li>
            <li>product was much nicer than expected.. it was a very pleasant surprise</li>
            <li>I love that color and cotton fabric material is really</li>
            <li>It looks cool and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>Nice soft lining.</li>
            <li>The case also comes with a good solid zipper.</li>
            <li>The furry lining makes it easy to slide in the laptop, though I would recommend sliding it in backward, so that the folding side is at the bottom and the opening side is at the top near the zipper.</li>
            <li>I love the new sleeve for my Mac Air!</li>
            <li>Cute pattern, but the fabric colors are not as vibrant in-person.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a snug fit with good protection and easy to find in a black briefcase or purse!</li>
            <li>Its high quality and a cheap price!</li>
            <li>But still very very pretty.</li>
            <li>It was pretty cheap to.  </li>
            <li>This serves very well as an easy sleeve for the MacBook Air.</li>
            <li>The lining on the inside is very soft, I love this product</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The pictures of this laptop case look so pretty!</li>
            <li>The fit on my 11 inch Asus was very snug.</li>
            <li>I love the soft inside</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute and soft on the inside.  </li>
            <li>This case was just right.</li>
            <li>My Samsung chrome book fits just right.</li>
            <li>Really like this laptop case, its cute &amp; very soft inside for my computer.</li>
            <li>Nice material with smooth zipper and soft fuzzy inner lining.</li>
            <li>The charger can also fit nicely into the sleeve if you don&#x27;t mind a little bulge which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is perfect the size i bought is a little big but allows me to keep the cord and plug together.</li>
            <li>It offers good protection as it is well cushioned especially around the edges.</li>
            <li>The inside has a soft, orange lining and the zippers are easy to move.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and has protected my laptop very well</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, the patterns are really lovely, the inside is soft.</li>
            <li>It has great support, but i do suggest that you also use a hard case on your computer as well as the sleeve.</li>
            <li>It has a nice little cushion and a soft interior to keep your tablet safe.</li>
            <li>The lining is very plush!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s cute and durable!</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown in pic.</li>
            <li>This laptop case is really pretty</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I would not use it if you are doing more than just daily transport</li>
            <li>Its pretty and my daughter likes it.  </li>
            <li>Simple, well made, and I love the design.</li>
            <li>like a tiny string shoulder strap or one of those cute purse-type woven bracelet thingies on one end.</li>
            <li>I actually think it looks better in person than in the pic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The print fabric is cheerful and the furry lining is soft to protect from scratches.</li>
            <li>And there is a funny odor to it.</li>
            <li>The design on this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It certainly fits well enough, and the padding makes it feel very secure even with a bit of room to wiggle around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wee bit too large for my 11.6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It fits snugly on the sides, it&#x27;s just at the top that&#x27;s a bit loose.</li>
            <li>the pattern is nice, but the color is actually a little darker than the picture.</li>
            <li>It does not fit my 11.6&amp;#34; notebook I will need a bigger size and not as happy with the color as I thought I would be (but that is a personel preference)</li>
            <li>Very well made product.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and well constructed.</li>
            <li>Very well made....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very snug.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my Microsoft surface 2, and the size fits very well.</li>
            <li>I have an 11.6 inch, very slim, laptop.</li>
            <li>Appears very well made.</li>
            <li>It is available in a larger size that should, after the inconvenience of returning and re-ordering, fit.&lt;br /&gt;She is going to be traveling quite a bit</li>
            <li>I really have to work at getting it in the sleeve.</li>
            <li>My laptop, which is a macbook air fits very snugly in this case.</li>
            <li>Everyone I know loves this macbook case and wants one.</li>
            <li>but I have to really streeeeeetch it over one of the corners by hand then</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I won&#x27;t be using it for this laptop, I really like the bag</li>
            <li>The inside is nice and soft similar to a soft suede.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s unique outside design.  </li>
            <li>Overall not bad, just don&#x27;t expect much room and know that it will take some wiggling to get your computer in.</li>
            <li>I like what is in the picture, but mine has the blue in the middle, and the bottom print up on the top and the stripes on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Upon first glance I noticed that the colors are a little darker than they appear in the picture, but this was fine with me.  </li>
            <li>It has now loosened up and now it fits a little better.</li>
            <li>It is easy to get my air in and out and doesnt make it feel heavly like other cases have.</li>
            <li>, I guess I expected it to be smooth.</li>
            <li>This item is slightly different than pictured in the ad but still looks fun.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t need anything heavy duty as the most traveling it does is from home to the coffee shop.</li>
            <li>The inside of the case has some soft sort of fake fur on it, which is kind of strange, but I think it&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li>A bit of a tight fit for my 11.6&amp;#34; Asus laptop, but should fit a Macbook and any other laptop without a bulky battery very well!</li>
            <li>Love the look, but it is extremely tight on a MacBook Air!</li>
            <li>Bought for my DD to take to college with her new MacBook Air laptop.</li>
            <li>The case is nice - vibrant colors outside, soft, no scratch interior - but my 11.6 inch Dell barely fits in the case and cannot zip closed.</li>
            <li>The colors are different than I expected, but I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Inside the case is a very soft protective lining.  </li>
            <li>The inside is very soft and seems to do well in protecting my computer from scratches.  </li>
            <li>The lining is very soft on the inside</li>
            <li>The product is really cute, and the padding it thick enough that I&#x27;m confident my computer is protected from minor bumps.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sleeve, with a very soft inner lining.</li>
            <li>A sleeve that is exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;I needed something to protect my 11&amp;#34; Macbook Air when carrying it around occasionally.</li>
            <li>Super snug, soft on the inside, and a stiff outer fabric that feels pretty protective.</li>
            <li>The quality is quite decent, however getting my 11.6&amp;#34; macbook air inside is a VERY tight fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tight fit for my 11&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It will slide into the case but it is very snug and It doesn&#x27;t go in far enough to zip</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The inside is lined with a really soft synthetic material.</li>
            <li>Interior is a soft microfiber.</li>
            <li>and she loves the soft feel of the inside of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, other than that (which is why I&#x27;m giving it three stars), I really like the sleeve!!</li>
            <li>Also even if it had fit, the outside fabric is very rough</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not extremely tight.</li>
            <li>Material feels really durable, a bit rough like a flour sack but in a high class way.</li>
            <li>However, I have an 11.6 inch laptop and it&#x27;s a very tight fit.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the size that was (according to the listing) fit my daughter&#x27;s small laptop/</li>
            <li>The case offers optimal padding for general use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days of tiring of fighting to get it in, I ordered a different one, one that&#x27;ll fit 13 inch laptops.</li>
            <li>It has an extremely chemically smell at first.</li>
            <li>I could barely slide it into the case, but could not zip it without scratching the corners of the machine.</li>
            <li>It barely fits my 11.6&amp;#34; laptop.</li>
            <li>a bit small for our laptop not bad though.</li>
            <li>I also love the stylish color and design -- such a nice change from the usual boring old black laptop covers I used to lug around.</li>
            <li>The fit is so tight I don&#x27;t need to worry about the tablet slipping out!</li>
            <li>The colors are not too vibrant, as other commenters have suggested.</li>

            <li> That way, I know my laptop will fit!!</li>
            <li> It is so unique and so beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Once it airs out it is super cute and perfect.</li>
            <li> I got this sleeve for my 11.6&amp;#34; netbook and it was a great fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright and cute.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice sleeve for my 11&amp;#34; macbook air.</li>
            <li> Nice zippers, padded and lined.</li>
            <li> Nice made case.  </li>
            <li> Nicely padded inside, also.</li>
            <li> Nice design and make though.</li>
            <li> The interior is a nice plush fabric.  </li>
            <li> The case has a dual zipper, which is kind of neat</li>
            <li> Fits great, beautiful color, and good quality.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, fits great.</li>
            <li> I bought the size suitable for the MacBook air A1370</li>
            <li> Really cute pattern, soft inside, perfect for what I needed it for</li>
            <li> The Color is great &amp; exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> The case isn&#x27;t too bulky and the colors are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I will probably use this until I find a better fitting case.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my laptop safe.</li>
            <li> Nice to look at, and will keep the laptop secure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and attractive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that over time it&#x27;ll stretch out more.</li>
            <li> The design is as shown, perhaps the colors are a tad more muted than pictured.</li>
            <li> The inside lining is soft and it&#x27;s a perfectly snug fit for an 11&#x27; mac book air.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute case</li>
            <li> so I just slip it in backwards and it zips neatly without touching the corners.</li>
            <li> and I get lots of compliments all the time; it&#x27;s really fantastic!</li>
            <li> ; there&#x27;s a lot of room at the top.</li>
            <li> It could use more padding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gotten tons of compliments on this cute case and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased an InCase sleeve for my daughter&#x27;s Mac Book Air and it is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning it, though, because I found another solution that suits my needs more than this does.</li>
            <li> Cute.</li>
            <li> Love the design.</li>
            <li> I love the case.</li>
            <li> No complaints. :)</li>
            <li> Love the retro design.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> We ordered the same thing in a 12 inch and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Most of the laptop goes in</li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> I love this case.</li>
            <li> It is cute in person.</li>
            <li> Very nice design and much appreciated by the person using it.</li>
            <li> Super cute and durable!</li>
            <li> The design is pretty and the material is good quality.</li>
            <li> and although it is a cute looking cover that might be fine for home use, the padding is substandard to keep a traveling computer safe.</li>
            <li> Glad Amazon makes returns easy.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily see the size options.</li>
            <li> Fast, sent me an email to make sure I got it, that it was in good shape.</li>
            <li> My computer fits perfectly inside and it seems to be well made; no frayed ends or loose threads.  </li>
            <li> , it is nice and I will get another of the same kind, but I do like the pattern on the picture better!</li>
            <li> I love the pattern, it&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t able to get my laptop in at first...</li>
            <li> If your laptop is 11.6, you will not be able to fit a charger/mouse inside of this case with the laptop, just FYI.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors, nice foam padding, fits my Macbook well, the zipper slides easily, received item quickly and seller sent a follow-up email promptly - I&#x27;m very pleased with the item and service.</li>
            <li> Overall,  I think its adorable, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, and I think you would be too.</li>
            <li> Strong zipper.</li>
            <li> However, when I received this, it had a really strong mildew smell to it.</li>
            <li> This fits my macbook air (11 inch) and is super cute.</li>
            <li> Super cute, looks like the picture.</li>
            <li> Design is super cute and as shown.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the case.</li>
            <li> Well it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I like the style, portability and fit.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 11&amp;#34; in version for my Dell 11&amp;#34; Inspirion 3000, going by dimensions it should have fit.</li>
            <li> and I wish it would fit, but it does not</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun and lovely</li>
            <li> it fit but does not zips all the way</li>
            <li> i wanted a sleeve that my ipad fit in when i travel.</li>
            <li> nice colors and very durable.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my HP Chromebook 11, and I can fit that</li>
            <li> now it has a secure case that is fashionable to my style.</li>
            <li> My laptop is 11.6 and it didn&#x27;t quite fit.  </li>
            <li> This sleeve was supposed to fit an 11-11.6 laptop, but, it would barely fit my 11.6 in laptop.</li>
            <li> The inside is soft, good for protection.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this purchase for my Mac its stylish and padded, not necessarily for protection though.</li>
            <li> The size is a perfect fit for the 11\\&quot; small mac book air.</li>
            <li> product was much nicer than expected.. it was a very pleasant surprise</li>
            <li> I love that color and cotton fabric material is really</li>
            <li> It looks cool and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li> Nice soft lining.</li>
            <li> The case also comes with a good solid zipper.</li>
            <li> The furry lining makes it easy to slide in the laptop, though I would recommend sliding it in backward, so that the folding side is at the bottom and the opening side is at the top near the zipper.</li>
            <li> I love the new sleeve for my Mac Air!</li>
            <li> Cute pattern, but the fabric colors are not as vibrant in-person.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a snug fit with good protection and easy to find in a black briefcase or purse!</li>
            <li> Its high quality and a cheap price!</li>
            <li> But still very very pretty.</li>
            <li> It was pretty cheap to.  </li>
            <li> This serves very well as an easy sleeve for the MacBook Air.</li>
            <li> The lining on the inside is very soft, I love this product</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The pictures of this laptop case look so pretty!</li>
            <li> The fit on my 11 inch Asus was very snug.</li>
            <li> I love the soft inside</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute and soft on the inside.  </li>
            <li> This case was just right.</li>
            <li> My Samsung chrome book fits just right.</li>
            <li> Really like this laptop case, its cute &amp; very soft inside for my computer.</li>
            <li> Nice material with smooth zipper and soft fuzzy inner lining.</li>
            <li> The charger can also fit nicely into the sleeve if you don&#x27;t mind a little bulge which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is perfect the size i bought is a little big but allows me to keep the cord and plug together.</li>
            <li> It offers good protection as it is well cushioned especially around the edges.</li>
            <li> The inside has a soft, orange lining and the zippers are easy to move.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and has protected my laptop very well</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, the patterns are really lovely, the inside is soft.</li>
            <li> It has great support, but i do suggest that you also use a hard case on your computer as well as the sleeve.</li>
            <li> It has a nice little cushion and a soft interior to keep your tablet safe.</li>
            <li> The lining is very plush!</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s cute and durable!</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown in pic.</li>
            <li> This laptop case is really pretty</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I would not use it if you are doing more than just daily transport</li>
            <li> Its pretty and my daughter likes it.  </li>
            <li> Simple, well made, and I love the design.</li>
            <li> like a tiny string shoulder strap or one of those cute purse-type woven bracelet thingies on one end.</li>
            <li> I actually think it looks better in person than in the pic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The print fabric is cheerful and the furry lining is soft to protect from scratches.</li>
            <li> And there is a funny odor to it.</li>
            <li> The design on this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It certainly fits well enough, and the padding makes it feel very secure even with a bit of room to wiggle around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wee bit too large for my 11.6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It fits snugly on the sides, it&#x27;s just at the top that&#x27;s a bit loose.</li>
            <li> the pattern is nice, but the color is actually a little darker than the picture.</li>
            <li> It does not fit my 11.6&amp;#34; notebook I will need a bigger size and not as happy with the color as I thought I would be (but that is a personel preference)</li>
            <li> Very well made product.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and well constructed.</li>
            <li> Very well made....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very snug.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my Microsoft surface 2, and the size fits very well.</li>
            <li> I have an 11.6 inch, very slim, laptop.</li>
            <li> Appears very well made.</li>
            <li> It is available in a larger size that should, after the inconvenience of returning and re-ordering, fit.&lt;br /&gt;She is going to be traveling quite a bit</li>
            <li> I really have to work at getting it in the sleeve.</li>
            <li> My laptop, which is a macbook air fits very snugly in this case.</li>
            <li> Everyone I know loves this macbook case and wants one.</li>
            <li> but I have to really streeeeeetch it over one of the corners by hand then</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I won&#x27;t be using it for this laptop, I really like the bag</li>
            <li> The inside is nice and soft similar to a soft suede.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s unique outside design.  </li>
            <li> Overall not bad, just don&#x27;t expect much room and know that it will take some wiggling to get your computer in.</li>
            <li> I like what is in the picture, but mine has the blue in the middle, and the bottom print up on the top and the stripes on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Upon first glance I noticed that the colors are a little darker than they appear in the picture, but this was fine with me.  </li>
            <li> It has now loosened up and now it fits a little better.</li>
            <li> It is easy to get my air in and out and doesnt make it feel heavly like other cases have.</li>
            <li> , I guess I expected it to be smooth.</li>
            <li> This item is slightly different than pictured in the ad but still looks fun.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need anything heavy duty as the most traveling it does is from home to the coffee shop.</li>
            <li> The inside of the case has some soft sort of fake fur on it, which is kind of strange, but I think it&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li> A bit of a tight fit for my 11.6&amp;#34; Asus laptop, but should fit a Macbook and any other laptop without a bulky battery very well!</li>
            <li> Love the look, but it is extremely tight on a MacBook Air!</li>
            <li> Bought for my DD to take to college with her new MacBook Air laptop.</li>
            <li> The case is nice - vibrant colors outside, soft, no scratch interior - but my 11.6 inch Dell barely fits in the case and cannot zip closed.</li>
            <li> The colors are different than I expected, but I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Inside the case is a very soft protective lining.  </li>
            <li> The inside is very soft and seems to do well in protecting my computer from scratches.  </li>
            <li> The lining is very soft on the inside</li>
            <li> The product is really cute, and the padding it thick enough that I&#x27;m confident my computer is protected from minor bumps.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sleeve, with a very soft inner lining.</li>
            <li> A sleeve that is exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;I needed something to protect my 11&amp;#34; Macbook Air when carrying it around occasionally.</li>
            <li> Super snug, soft on the inside, and a stiff outer fabric that feels pretty protective.</li>
            <li> The quality is quite decent, however getting my 11.6&amp;#34; macbook air inside is a VERY tight fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tight fit for my 11&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It will slide into the case but it is very snug and It doesn&#x27;t go in far enough to zip</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The inside is lined with a really soft synthetic material.</li>
            <li> Interior is a soft microfiber.</li>
            <li> and she loves the soft feel of the inside of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, other than that (which is why I&#x27;m giving it three stars), I really like the sleeve!!</li>
            <li> Also even if it had fit, the outside fabric is very rough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extremely tight.</li>
            <li> Material feels really durable, a bit rough like a flour sack but in a high class way.</li>
            <li> However, I have an 11.6 inch laptop and it&#x27;s a very tight fit.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the size that was (according to the listing) fit my daughter&#x27;s small laptop/</li>
            <li> The case offers optimal padding for general use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days of tiring of fighting to get it in, I ordered a different one, one that&#x27;ll fit 13 inch laptops.</li>
            <li> It has an extremely chemically smell at first.</li>
            <li> I could barely slide it into the case, but could not zip it without scratching the corners of the machine.</li>
            <li> It barely fits my 11.6&amp;#34; laptop.</li>
            <li> a bit small for our laptop not bad though.</li>
            <li> I also love the stylish color and design -- such a nice change from the usual boring old black laptop covers I used to lug around.</li>
            <li> The fit is so tight I don&#x27;t need to worry about the tablet slipping out!</li>
            <li> The colors are not too vibrant, as other commenters have suggested.</li>
            <li> arrived and was absolutely too small.</li>
            <li> but it does not fit my new 11.6&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The case is not wide enough, so it will damage my Mac Book and it is too tall, so the computer moves up and down.</li>
            <li> The real item is very stiff and the colors are really flat!</li>
            <li> I am considering purchasing other similar carrying cases in the future</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t taken it out much but the cloth material is thick.  </li>
            <li> Which makes me sad, I was really excited about this case.</li>
            <li> The pattern distribution is not exactly as shown in the picture, but it is the same fabric.</li>
            <li> The main complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to fit the macbook air 11&amp;#34; in... I guess after enough wear and tear it ll open up a little.</li>
            <li> You can get it in there if you insert the MacBook with the thin edge (front edge) first.</li>
            <li> the case closed.</li>
            <li> The material is not very stretchy</li>
            <li> It is snug, sleevelike (which I prefer a minimal laptop case).</li>
            <li> I let it air out for a couple hours after opening it and then had absolutely no issues with any chemical smells that other reviewers had mentioned.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that when I put my Mac air 11 in it, it was very tight.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed only because I have a Lonovo Yoga 2 and one of the questions asked was if it were to fit, and the answer was &amp;#34;it should&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> other than this issue,I like it.</li>
            <li> Just have to be a little careful.</li>
            <li> Its been about a week and its still a little rough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made, so far the zippers haven&#x27;t broken from me trying to close the darn thing.  </li>
            <li> Extremely speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> some other reviewers mentioned, it does have a little bit of a funky smell immediately out of the packaging, so we just sprayed a sprtiz or two of perfume inside it</li>
            <li> This is my recommendation because the folding side is slightly thicker, and the zipper rubs the corners when closing it.</li>
            <li> The sides have a slight bit of rigid feel to them which helps to protect the laptop.</li>
            <li> Well made, but just a smudge tight in width for an 11&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars if it were a little wider and easier to get the Notebook in the case.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, because I really liked the look of the bag.</li>
            <li> Size listed for our tablet did not fit.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s also not easy to take the laptop out of the sleeve, it&#x27;s so darn</li>
            <li> , the fabric pattern is random apparently -</li>
            <li> it is very tight space....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for my small hp laptop.</li>
            <li> I have the smallest Macbook Air on the market, and the case is about an inch too small to hold it.</li>
            <li> The padding layer is very thin and not good enough.</li>
            <li> and if I have to take the cord, it is hard to zip and looks like a tumor.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy with this case...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a fake fur on the inside, I&#x27;m not sure if this is the padding or if there is some sort of padding between the outside material and the fake fur.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that there are some subtle differences between the patterns printed on the photo, and the patterns printed on the sleeve that I purchased.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been tough, but I&#x27;ve gotten it in there.</li>
            <li> disappointed my 11.6 Yoga 2 will not fit in the 11-11.6 case.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m unable to get the corners of the fabric over the corners of the computer.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it wasn&#x27;t the correct size</li>
            <li> Protects it from the cold when in my bag.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the crazy color pattern.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very well made product. It is perfect... we are getting a lot of comments about how nice it looks!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice sleeve for my 11&amp;#34; macbook air. Very affordable and well constructed. Nice zippers, padded and lined. A great deal.</li>
            <li> very nice laptop sleeve. Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> EXCELENT! very happy with this safe product to take my mac everywhere</li>
            <li> It came as it was described. I am disappointed only because I have a Lonovo Yoga 2 and one of the questions asked was if it were to fit, and the answer was &amp;#34;it should&amp;#34;. So I took that gamble.  Well it doesn&#x27;t fit. It doesn&#x27;t zipper close. I will probably use this until I find a better fitting case. Which makes me sad, I was really excited about this case.</li>
            <li> Very nice case but disappointed my 11.6 Yoga 2 will not fit in the 11-11.6 case. It will slide into the case but it is very snug and It doesn&#x27;t go in far enough to zip the case closed. Must return.</li>
            <li> Very well made....beautiful design!</li>
            <li> This item is slightly different than pictured in the ad but still looks fun. The lining is very plush! I bought the size suitable for the MacBook air A1370 circa 2011 (11 in). It&#x27;s very snug. If I were to buy it again I&#x27;d go 1 size up.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and has protected my laptop very well</li>
            <li> Nice made case.  Wife loves it for her Chromebook.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  It is so unique and so beautiful.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use this for my Chromebook and it is awesome.  I love the soft inside and it&#x27;s unique outside design.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> product was much nicer than expected.. it was a very pleasant surprise</li>
            <li> The sleeve is beautiful and it fits and protects my laptop perfectly. The charger can also fit nicely into the sleeve if you don&#x27;t mind a little bulge which I don&#x27;t. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tight fit for my 11&amp;#34; MacBook Air because I have to squeeze the zipper around it. Other than that it&#x27;s cute and durable!</li>
            <li> Good product, and looks just like the picture. Well made, but just a smudge tight in width for an 11&amp;#34; MacBook Air. You can get it in there if you insert the MacBook with the thin edge (front edge) first. Just have to be a little careful. About 1/2&amp;#34; of play across the shorter end of the notebook which is perfect. Would give 5 stars if it were a little wider and easier to get the Notebook in the case. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my Microsoft surface 2, and the size fits very well. the pattern is nice, but the color is actually a little darker than the picture. The inside is soft, good for protection.</li>
            <li> This fits my macbook air (11 inch) and is super cute. The lining on the inside is very soft, I love this product</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown in pic. Vibrant colors, nice foam padding, fits my Macbook well, the zipper slides easily, received item quickly and seller sent a follow-up email promptly - I&#x27;m very pleased with the item and service.</li>
            <li> This laptop case is really pretty and it keeps my laptop safe. It looks just like the picture provided. Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I bought this bag for a laptop I bought for school.  Its high quality and a cheap price! Not to mention its just my style! Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this Laptop Sleeve.  The size was perfect for my 81/2&amp;#34; X 11&amp;#34; Acer Aspire laptop.  The Color is great &amp; exactly as pictured.  Inside the case is a very soft protective lining.  Would recommend this to anyone, who needs a compact, protective cover...needed it to put in my attache case, for travel.</li>
            <li> It does not fit my 11.6&amp;#34; notebook I will need a bigger size and not as happy with the color as I thought I would be (but that is a personel preference)</li>
            <li> Great quality and design. I like the style, portability and fit. I am considering purchasing other similar carrying cases in the future</li>
            <li> Beautiful design, smooth zippers, fits the macbook air perfectly.  The inside is even softer than I thought it would be.  Nice to look at, and will keep the laptop secure.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 11&amp;#34; in version for my Dell 11&amp;#34; Inspirion 3000, going by dimensions it should have fit. I can shove it in there, but cannot get the zippers around the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I will have time to order another one up a size, but that is a pain too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fabric pattern is random apparently - I like what is in the picture, but mine has the blue in the middle, and the bottom print up on the top and the stripes on the bottom. It is also not as bright as the picture. I do still like it, it is nice and I will get another of the same kind, but I do like the pattern on the picture better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this case!  It&#x27;s very sturdy and attractive. Nicely padded inside, also.</li>
            <li> The product is really cute, and the padding it thick enough that I&#x27;m confident my computer is protected from minor bumps.  However, I have an 11.6 inch laptop and it&#x27;s a very tight fit.  I honestly wasn&#x27;t able to get my laptop in at first...I had to force-stretch it out for a day.  I can get it in now, but it&#x27;s still not with ease.  I&#x27;m hoping that over time it&#x27;ll stretch out more.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Perfect size. Strong zipper. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> It is good. But does not look very beautiful.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister and she loves it. It has a nice little cushion and a soft interior to keep your tablet safe.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this purchase for my Mac its stylish and padded, not necessarily for protection though.</li>
            <li> This was specifically described as the correct bag for an 11-11.6 inch netbook/laptop. I have an 11.6 inch, very slim, laptop. I could barely slide it into the case, but could not zip it without scratching the corners of the machine. I was very disappointed, because I really liked the look of the bag. Glad Amazon makes returns easy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this sleeve. The design is as shown, perhaps the colors are a tad more muted than pictured. But still very very pretty. The inside lining is soft and it&#x27;s a perfectly snug fit for an 11&#x27; mac book air. Appears very well made.</li>
            <li> I like the design and how perfectly it covers my macbook air. Its attractive, and form &amp; function is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Fits very good for 11‚Äù MacAir, furry inside what makes more protective for the case of your equipment. ... ...</li>
            <li> I purchased this sleeve to protect my 11 inch Macbook Air.  So far it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My computer fits perfectly inside and it seems to be well made; no frayed ends or loose threads.  Upon first glance I noticed that the colors are a little darker than they appear in the picture, but this was fine with me.  I also noticed that there are some subtle differences between the patterns printed on the photo, and the patterns printed on the sleeve that I purchased.  The inside is very soft and seems to do well in protecting my computer from scratches.  Overall,  I think its adorable, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase, and I think you would be too.</li>
            <li> Good price for a very nice looking sleeve. A bit of a tight fit for my 11.6&amp;#34; Asus laptop, but should fit a Macbook and any other laptop without a bulky battery very well!</li>
            <li> The laptop sleeve is great! I would recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;m using it for my small hp laptop. I was able to easily see the size options. I love the pattern, it&#x27;s very pretty!</li>
            <li> This item states it fits 11-11.6&amp;#34; laptops but it does not fit my new 11.6&amp;#34; lenovo yoga 2 11.  The problem is that the corners of the sleeve are too rounded and my laptop has squared/pointed corners so I&#x27;m unable to get the corners of the fabric over the corners of the computer.  Also even if it had fit, the outside fabric is very rough, I guess I expected it to be smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this case! Great quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Nice material with smooth zipper and soft fuzzy inner lining. Fits my Lenova 8.5 x 11.75 inch computer perfectly.</li>
            <li> I got this sleeve for my 11.6&amp;#34; netbook and it was a great fit. The pattern distribution is not exactly as shown in the picture, but it is the same fabric. The inside is lined with a really soft synthetic material.</li>
            <li> The product information states that this case will hold a Macbook Air. I have the smallest Macbook Air on the market, and the case is about an inch too small to hold it. I can&#x27;t get it in there at all. It&#x27;s a cute case and I wish it would fit, but it does not and I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this to carry my air in my backpack, it has worked well for me. It is easy to get my air in and out and doesnt make it feel heavly like other cases have. I would not use it if you are doing more than just daily transport</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Samsung Chromebook, which is so thin and light it fits neatly in my oversized purse. The sleeve keeps the exterior from getting scratched when carrying it around. The sleeve fits perfectly and snugly, leaving no room for my chromebook to slide around inside it and securing it with padding. The furry lining makes it easy to slide in the laptop, though I would recommend sliding it in backward, so that the folding side is at the bottom and the opening side is at the top near the zipper. This is my recommendation because the folding side is slightly thicker, and the zipper rubs the corners when closing it. Overtime, this would cause some wear and scratching so I just slip it in backwards and it zips neatly without touching the corners. The zipper is also a molded plastic which helps prevent scratching. I also love the stylish color and design -- such a nice change from the usual boring old black laptop covers I used to lug around.</li>
            <li> Love how it looks and fits with my laptop!</li>
            <li> I really love this case! It suits me perfectly. It&#x27;s fun and lovely and I get lots of compliments all the time; it&#x27;s really fantastic! The colors are vibrant, the patterns are really lovely, the inside is soft. It&#x27;s well-padded and the zippers work without a hitch. It&#x27;s a wee bit too large for my 11.6&amp;#34; MacBook Air; there&#x27;s a lot of room at the top. It fits snugly on the sides, it&#x27;s just at the top that&#x27;s a bit loose. It certainly fits well enough, and the padding makes it feel very secure even with a bit of room to wiggle around.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous my iPad fits perfect I want another for my laptop. The inside is nice and soft similar to a soft suede.</li>
            <li> I love that color and cotton fabric material is really good!&lt;br /&gt;But, If I put MacBook Air in the plastic  case  ...it is very tight space....other than this issue,I like it.</li>
            <li> Extremely speedy delivery! I got it next day..Beautiful design. I have a Lenovo yoga 2 11.6 inch laptop. it fit but does not zips all the way</li>
            <li> A sleeve that is exactly what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;I needed something to protect my 11&amp;#34; Macbook Air when carrying it around occasionally. Didn&#x27;t need anything heavy duty as the most traveling it does is from home to the coffee shop. This case was just right. Super snug, soft on the inside, and a stiff outer fabric that feels pretty protective. I let it air out for a couple hours after opening it and then had absolutely no issues with any chemical smells that other reviewers had mentioned. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and it protects my Mac air 11 nicely!</li>
            <li> Its pretty and my daughter likes it.  It could use more padding.</li>
            <li> Love the case fits my computer perfectly.</li>
            <li> This sleeve fits my Lenovo Yoga 11s perfectly and is nice and snug. The inside of the case has some soft sort of fake fur on it, which is kind of strange, but I think it&#x27;s a nice touch. The case isn&#x27;t too bulky and the colors are vibrant and beautiful. I&#x27;ve already gotten tons of compliments on this cute case and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> perfect fit and totally cute</li>
            <li> This serves very well as an easy sleeve for the MacBook Air. It&#x27;s a snug fit with good protection and easy to find in a black briefcase or purse!</li>
            <li> Really cute pattern, soft inside, perfect for what I needed it for</li>
            <li> Size listed for our tablet did not fit.  Too tight.&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning.  Nice design and make though. Recommend to  size up.</li>
            <li> Very cute print and surprisingly durable. Bought for my DD to take to college with her new MacBook Air laptop. She carries it around everywhere and the case keeps it protected. Interior is a soft microfiber.</li>
            <li> Simple, well made, and I love the design.</li>
            <li> i wanted a sleeve that my ipad fit in when i travel. This is perfect the size i bought is a little big but allows me to keep the cord and plug together. nice colors and very durable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sleeve case because it specifically said it was for the 11 inch Mac Book Air. The case is not wide enough, so it will damage my Mac Book and it is too tall, so the computer moves up and down. The padding layer is very thin and not good enough. The printed canvas is not as bright as on the picture. I purchased an InCase sleeve for my daughter&#x27;s Mac Book Air and it is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and perfectly functional!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fitted mac book air 11inch sleeve for their computer. It has great support, but i do suggest that you also use a hard case on your computer as well as the sleeve. If you are looking for something fashionable for sturdy, this is a great product for you!</li>
            <li> Super cute, looks like the picture. I bought it for my HP Chromebook 11, and I can fit that and just enough space for the charger as well. It&#x27;s not extremely tight. Great product!</li>
            <li> great cover that I use for my MacBook Air 11.6 inch.  Fits great, beautiful color, and good quality.  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> The quality is quite decent, however getting my 11.6&amp;#34; macbook air inside is a VERY tight fit. Overall not bad, just don&#x27;t expect much room and know that it will take some wiggling to get your computer in.</li>
            <li> love this case! Super cute and durable!</li>
            <li> I wish I could keep it! The colors are different than I expected, but I was pleased with the product. I&#x27;ll be returning it, though, because I found another solution that suits my needs more than this does. If I hadn&#x27;t, I would have loved having this case around!</li>
            <li> I ordered the size that was (according to the listing) fit my daughter&#x27;s small laptop/tablet.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived and was absolutely too small. It is available in a larger size that should, after the inconvenience of returning and re-ordering, fit.&lt;br /&gt;She is going to be traveling quite a bit and although it is a cute looking cover that might be fine for home use, the padding is substandard to keep a traveling computer safe.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a Christmas present or something. I don&#x27;t remember.  She digs it. It looks cool and does it&#x27;s job.  It was pretty cheap to.  I would buy again.. just not the same color cause I already have it in that design.</li>
            <li> Cute pattern, but the fabric colors are not as vibrant in-person. The fit on my 11 inch Asus was very snug. I really have to work at getting it in the sleeve. It offers good protection as it is well cushioned especially around the edges. However, when I received this, it had a really strong mildew smell to it.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Cute. Works well!</li>
            <li> Fits my girlfriend&#x27;s 11&amp;#34; MacBook Air perfectly. Seems to be made of quality material and she loves the soft feel of the inside of it. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some other reviewers mentioned, it does have a little bit of a funky smell immediately out of the packaging, so we just sprayed a sprtiz or two of perfume inside it and now it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is great!  I got the smallest size for my chromebook 11.6 in.  Wish I&#x27;d gotten a bigger size because I have to smoosh it in and if I have to take the cord, it is hard to zip and looks like a tumor.  It would be great to have a way to carry it alone-- like a tiny string shoulder strap or one of those cute purse-type woven bracelet thingies on one end. It&#x27;s great looking as is though.  I actually think it looks better in person than in the pic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller great!  Fast, sent me an email to make sure I got it, that it was in good shape.</li>
            <li> Love the design. Only thing is that when I put my Mac air 11 in it, it was very tight. Had to squeeze it in. It has now loosened up and now it fits a little better.</li>
            <li> I love the case. The colors are not too vibrant, as other commenters have suggested. Fits my laptop perfectly! No complaints. :)</li>
            <li> The case is nice - vibrant colors outside, soft, no scratch interior - but my 11.6 inch Dell barely fits in the case and cannot zip closed. The fit is so tight I don&#x27;t need to worry about the tablet slipping out!</li>
            <li> Very nice design and much appreciated by the person using it.</li>
            <li> Fits my macbook perfectly. Protects it from the cold when in my bag. I travel with my computer to and from work every day, so now it has a secure case that is fashionable to my style.</li>
            <li> This laptop sleeve is durable and the fabric is a thicker canvas. The inside has a soft, orange lining and the zippers are easy to move. It is also very stylish, of course! I give this laptop sleeve 5/5 stars!</li>
            <li> Love the look, but it is extremely tight on a MacBook Air! Nice soft lining. Well made. Recommend with reservations.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My laptop, which is a macbook air fits very snugly in this case. Design is super cute and as shown. Material feels really durable, a bit rough like a flour sack but in a high class way. Inside is a funky brown suede and has a bit of padding. It&#x27;s a great sleeve but would have gotten a 5 if it had a pocket for the cord.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price. Love the retro design.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. It arrived On time. why Is there an amount of words required for this. This is what I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, fits great. I love the new sleeve for my Mac Air!</li>
            <li> Everyone I know loves this macbook case and wants one. It is durable, and I love the colors--one of a kind!</li>
            <li> Really like this laptop case, its cute &amp; very soft inside for my computer. The colors look just as the photo shown.</li>
            <li> The pictures of this laptop case look so pretty! The real item is very stiff and the colors are really flat! They don&#x27;t look like the pictures at all. Will send back asap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great looking and seems well made but it&#x27;s a fight to squeeze my Lenovo yoga 11s in the case.  I&#x27;m going to return it but I might order a larger size. The print fabric is cheerful and the furry lining is soft to protect from scratches.</li>
            <li> Pretty sleeve, with a very soft inner lining.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this case... It barely fits my 11.6&amp;#34; laptop. I had to struggle to get it in there.  And there is a funny odor to it.</li>
            <li> Great lining and colors. Love it.</li>
            <li> The design on this is exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s bright and cute.  My Samsung chrome book fits just right. The lining is very soft on the inside so I don&#x27;t worry about scratches. I haven&#x27;t taken it out much but the cloth material is thick.  Completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute and soft on the inside.  Sadly it wasn&#x27;t the correct size so I ordered a size up.  My laptop is 11.6 and it didn&#x27;t quite fit.  I&#x27;d recommend ordering a size up.  We ordered the same thing in a 12 inch and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> This sleeve was supposed to fit an 11-11.6 laptop, but, it would barely fit my 11.6 in laptop. Most of the laptop goes in but I have to really streeeeeetch it over one of the corners by hand then try to close the corner with the zipper. The material is not very stretchy so it&#x27;s been tough, but I&#x27;ve gotten it in there. But, it&#x27;s also not easy to take the laptop out of the sleeve, it&#x27;s so darn tight!&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of tiring of fighting to get it in, I ordered a different one, one that&#x27;ll fit 13 inch laptops. That way, I know my laptop will fit!! I did measure the laptop before ordering this sleeve. I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, other than that (which is why I&#x27;m giving it three stars), I really like the sleeve!! It&#x27;s well made, so far the zippers haven&#x27;t broken from me trying to close the darn thing.  It&#x27;s almost like a fake fur on the inside, I&#x27;m not sure if this is the padding or if there is some sort of padding between the outside material and the fake fur. I love the colors. The item arrived quickly. Another thing, even with all of the pulling to try and get it over my laptop, and the using the zipper to try and close it over the corner, the stiches have not busted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I won&#x27;t be using it for this laptop, I really like the bag and I&#x27;ll use it for a toiletry bag when traveling.</li>
            <li> Good laptop case. The size is a perfect fit for the 11\\&quot; small mac book air. The sides have a slight bit of rigid feel to them which helps to protect the laptop. The interior is a nice plush fabric.  The case also comes with a good solid zipper. My daughter loves the crazy color pattern. This is a very good laptop case and would by another.</li>
            <li> Very nice case, I love it.</li>
            <li> We got it... a bit small for our laptop not bad though. The main complaint is the smell. It has an extremely chemically smell at first. Its been about a week and its still a little rough. Once it airs out it is super cute and perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this case. It is cute in person. It perfectly fits my Asus 11.6 Vivo Notebook. It is snug, sleevelike (which I prefer a minimal laptop case). If your laptop is 11.6, you will not be able to fit a charger/mouse inside of this case with the laptop, just FYI. The case has a dual zipper, which is kind of neat and the inside is fuzzy. The case offers optimal padding for general use. I am a huge fan of the case.</li>
            <li> The design is pretty and the material is good quality. The only problem is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to fit the macbook air 11&amp;#34; in... I guess after enough wear and tear it ll open up a little.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she is very pleased with it.</li>
