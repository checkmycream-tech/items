            <li> Cause this is technically not a social media.</li>
            <li> He left the two thicker ones at the ends and he removed a total of six teeth leaving one in between each other.  </li>
            <li> This one is larger than I expected but it does the job of de-tangeling my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> i needed a wide tooth comb that was big and unbreakable.</li>
            <li> Larger than expected, this comb is the size of my forearm with teeth about 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> Extremely practical following a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never use this on my hair when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> Use the comb on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> She has hair that gets curly and tangled when wet</li>
            <li> I use this to detangle my hair while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I have to use a wide tooth comb for my permed hair.</li>
            <li> I had another that I thought was wide</li>
            <li> but I had tears in my eyes combing all of my hair when it was wet.</li>
            <li> what I got is a sturdy, really wide tooth comb which detangles my hair but leaves my waives intact.  </li>
            <li> my hair have always been extremely thick, coarse, and long.</li>
            <li> and since I&#x27;ve gotten this comb I shed less and barely loose hair, the bonus comb I wasnt expecting to be a little teeth comb but for the price and quality...</li>
            <li> it takes out was less hair than other combs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see how this could go wrong, but I use this all the time since I&#x27;m transitioning and trying to keep the breakage to a minimum.</li>
            <li> so far none of the teeth have broken.</li>
            <li> this is the comb for thick and coarse hair like mines!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black,</li>
            <li> and it takes less time to detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> The handle, the jet black color, the way it detangles my hair without breaking it..despite being so sturdy.</li>
            <li> I also ordered one thinking it was brown when it was clearly black.</li>
            <li> The little comb that came with is is neat as well.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> my hair is naturally thin and wavy and what I was finding was that when I would detangle my hair with this comb, (dry)</li>
            <li> Combed through hair without losing excessive strands of hair.</li>
            <li> No more tears and drama</li>
            <li> no more hurts, and no more breakage.</li>
            <li> so my hair is thick n coily and I&#x27;ve been threw over maybe 7combs</li>
            <li> I have THICK CURLY hair.</li>
            <li> i have thick islander/black hair</li>
            <li> its also less painful than other combs(</li>
            <li> but it became worse when i stopped getting perms.</li>
            <li> I am tender headed, so for me this comb means no more painful comb outs that leave my head sore.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m color blind or some thing.</li>
            <li> My hair is crazy curly but this comb doesn&#x27;t break my hair at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so stupid.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase I will purchase this again.</li>

This comb does not brake, I ordered this comb about two months and the delivery was wonderful. I was able to track my delivery on USPS.com and it delivered on time. The size is perfect the ends are not dull so they get between knots in my hair and since I&#x27;ve gotten this comb I shed less and barely loose hair, the bonus comb I wasnt expecting to be a little teeth comb but for the price and quality... I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair is kinda long/medium and SUPER thick. I love using this comb after getting out of the shower. It doesn&#x27;t tug on my hair, either. I bought it because my friend had one like this, but it was like $10. Not only did I get the same one for way cheaper, I also got a smaller comb to part my hair... FOR FREE! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. I see people with these combs but can never find one in store. Great for natural and relaxed. Its my favorite comb!</li>
            <li> The products works for my natural hair, however the shipping and handling cost as much if not more to send. Use the comb on wet or dry hair. Thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact this comb snag my hair so much.  It seems as if the plastic in between the comb had some sticking out and the pulled my strands.  Very disappointed with this purchase I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this comb.  I have THICK CURLY hair. :)  You can&#x27;t go wrong. :)</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this comb. my hair have always been extremely thick, coarse, and long. but it became worse when i stopped getting perms. i needed a wide tooth comb that was big and unbreakable. this is the comb for thick and coarse hair like mines!!!! its also less painful than other combs( im tendered headed). it takes out was less hair than other combs. its big and it takes less time to detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, because it combs my curls nicely and it does not break the hair off if it is done properly.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Nice comb, breaks my hair , doesn&#x27;t untangle. Nice for clumping sections of hair for uniform curls however.</li>
            <li> I always hear ladies using this comb in the shower when washing their hair and I never tried it.  Glad I finally did, wish I had tried it sooner.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best for tangles . My 6 year old daughter is very happy. No more tears and drama</li>
            <li> Works for my 4C Hair!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. I used it once and will use it again. The little comb that came with is is neat as well. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that gets incredibly tangled. I use this in the shower after I put in conditioner.  Best way to comb without ripping out tons of hair</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Big enough</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday. Works good with thick wavy hair!</li>
            <li> This is a very large comb. It&#x27;s perfect for thick hair. I use this to detangle my hair while it&#x27;s wet. However i have to use some type of conditioner on my hair. And if i don&#x27;t use conditioner on my hair while detangling with this comb, it will snag. I&#x27;ve never use this on my hair when it&#x27;s dry so i don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;d get the same results.</li>
            <li> and i think it came with a smaller comb as well.&lt;br /&gt;wide enough but not too big. good for natural hair etc</li>
            <li> I ordered on Jan. 23, 2014, and received on Jan. 27, 2014.&lt;br /&gt;This comb is exactly as described and they even threw in a tiny bonus comb, which is great if you have a small child or animal, My dog will be seeing that tiny comb a lot! As for the big one I ordered for me, it is HUGE, and it did not hurt my hair or damage anything, I used right after getting out of the shower. Wonderful seller, you get what is stated!</li>
            <li> OMG i&#x27;m in love with this comb!!! The handle, the jet black color, the way it detangles my hair without breaking it..despite being so sturdy. It&#x27;s also a very nice quality plastic which is smooth so your hair glides through it. My hair type is 3B and this comb is a must for me. My hair is crazy curly but this comb doesn&#x27;t break my hair at all! Thanks! Go get it ;-)</li>
            <li> great for my little girls with afro. texture hair. no more hurts, and no more breakage. wish i had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality comb.&lt;br /&gt;Just larger than I really wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I should have checked the description better.&lt;br /&gt;It still does the job.</li>
            <li> I kind of dislike this because I didn&#x27;t know that the teeth were SO BIG. I also ordered one thinking it was brown when it was clearly black. I&#x27;m so stupid. I think I&#x27;m color blind or some thing. I want to learn more about you guys too. My mom doesn&#x27;t let me have a social media so I&#x27;m trying to get around that rule through this. Cause this is technically not a social media.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have to use a wide tooth comb for my permed hair. This is the perfect comb! I had another that I thought was wide but I had tears in my eyes combing all of my hair when it was wet. This has eliminated any pain and works great for curly hair!</li>
            <li> Larger than expected, this comb is the size of my forearm with teeth about 2 inches long. I was expecting a second matching one by the description that says free bonus comb, but the second is a narrow tooth barber comb. I bought this based on reviews that it had no sharp seams between the teeth but the comb I received does have a couple seams I&#x27;ll have to sand.</li>
            <li> Might be good for some people, but wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.  The teeth are so far apart you could eat an ear of corn through it.</li>
            <li> Great for wet tangles!</li>
            <li> Does great on my hair on the shower.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this comb to clean the hair from hair brushes.I don&#x27;t use this for combing my hair</li>
            <li> Nice come when detangling my natural thick hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see how this could go wrong, but I use this all the time since I&#x27;m transitioning and trying to keep the breakage to a minimum. This is great! I use it all the time, whether I&#x27;m washing my hair or not! I completely recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great, sturdy and large comb, just perfect for detangling curly and or wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my hair is naturally thin and wavy and what I was finding was that when I would detangle my hair with this comb, (dry) it would basically remove my waves leaving my hair &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34;.  So what my wonderful, inventive, mechanical inclined hobby did was he removed every other tooth with some pliers.  He left the two thicker ones at the ends and he removed a total of six teeth leaving one in between each other.  Now I am not suggesting that you do this as you do run the risk of breaking the comb but I was willing to take the chance and what I got is a sturdy, really wide tooth comb which detangles my hair but leaves my waives intact.  So I&#x27;m a happy camper with a great, wide tooth, leave my waives/curls intact comb ;)</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast product as pictured</li>
            <li> i have thick islander/black hair an using regular combs do not work for me! This is EXTREAMLY durable an gets all the knots out of my hair !! Thank you much!!!</li>
