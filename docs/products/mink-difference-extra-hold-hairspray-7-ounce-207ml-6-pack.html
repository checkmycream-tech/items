            <li>i was pleased with the product</li>
            <li>Has a really nice, clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I first used Mink, I have loved it.</li>

            <li>Thanks for offering this useful product.</li>
            <li>This incredible hairspray is getting harder and harder to find!  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect because it holds without being stiff or sticky and it lasts longer than other sprays.</li>

            <li>Since the very first time I used it, I saw a difference from all the other hair sprays I have used.</li>
            <li>There is no gummy hair -- the hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The only hair spray I have used since high school, and I graduated 21 years ago.</li>

            <li> Then my store stopped selling it as did the other stores like it in my area.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit pricy</li>

            <li> which&lt;br /&gt;is hard to style and hold in place.  </li>
            <li> but it is impossible to locate in my area of Southern California.</li>
            <li> but my wife has been using it fir years that is why we buy in bulk from Amazon and have never been disappointed.....</li>

            <li> This incredible hairspray is getting harder and harder to find!  First the pump spray disappeared and now my Walgreens doesn&#x27;t carry the aerosol.  So, I ordered it.  Please tell me this wonderful product is not going away!  The fragrance alone is enough to keep making it for all the fans, but it is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  Ever.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THIS HAIR SPRAY FOR OVER 30 YRS....ITS THE BEST</li>

            <li> Mink isn&#x27;t available in stores. I&#x27;ve used it for years &amp; like it better than any other brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Holds without being sticky or dulling hair.  I wish the old pump, non-aerosol version was still available so I could travel with it!</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever! Holds great and not heavy at all. Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I have to order it on the Internet in bulk. I&#x27;m just so glad I can still find this.</li>
            <li> So glad to find it.rhe Marc&#x27;s stores in my area no longer sell it. Yeah!!!</li>
            <li> Style wet hair, spray and go. Great hold and shine. Even in wet weather, you don&#x27;t have to worry about frizz.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair spray meets my wives standards to hold and keep soft at the same time time. The merchandise was shipped and received on time and undamaged as promised. It is a little bit pricy but it is impossible to locate in my area of Southern California.</li>
            <li> Many compliments on my hair. Was so glad to find it on Amazon. Stores stopped selling it!&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. I bought 6 cans!  Satisfied and Happy!</li>
            <li> I had been searching everywhere for this product. Since the very first time I used it, I saw a difference from all the other hair sprays I have used. I love it and will continue to use it as long as I can find it. I really need to get the carry size.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased when I seen this on Amazon. Every time I went to buy this product no one had it.&lt;br /&gt;It seems so many products are being discontinued. So many thanks to the person who had this product.</li>
            <li> i was pleased with the product but I expected the lower price for ordering such a large number of cans also I never have recieved any reply on the credit account I applied for !!!</li>

            <li> The only hair spray I have used since high school, and I graduated 21 years ago. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding this in the store.  They used to carry it, but stopped.  It is the only hairspray that does not have that lingering smell especially in damp whether.  This is deffinately your best bet.</li>
            <li> best hairspray ever and it is so hard to find. This is the only hairspray my family has used in over 15 years.. please keep making it</li>
            <li> We just have always liked using this product.  Works for us!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the stuff but my wife has been using it fir years that is why we buy in bulk from Amazon and have never been disappointed.....Duane</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend five years ago who&#x27;s son is a hairdresser. I have used it since. I could only find it at Walgreens but often they&#x27;re out of it so I went online. It&#x27;s perfect because it holds without being stiff or sticky and it lasts longer than other sprays. I don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous hairsprays and Mink Difference by far beats them all!  I have very fine hair which&lt;br /&gt;is hard to style and hold in place.  Mink gives enough hold without being sticky and tacky feeling.  You can still brush&lt;br /&gt;you hair and re-style without feeling like you are ripping your hair out.</li>
            <li> The best hairspray ever</li>
            <li> For my husband he loves it. Wish I could&lt;br /&gt;Find it locally</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this product again.  The value and the quality is great. Thanks for offering this useful product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mother. She has used for years but it is getting harder and harder to find. Why?? Also she likes it best in the pump bottle (non aerosol). But you can&#x27;t get it that way anymore. Again  why???? It only comes in the spray can now that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray in the world.  Superhold, but doesn&#x27;t cake your hair.  Has a really nice, clean fragrance.  I cannot believe Walgreens and Walmart stopped selling it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
            <li> Great product for last 50 years! Thanks for carrying it.</li>
            <li> Ever since I first used Mink, I have loved it. Then my store stopped selling it as did the other stores like it in my area. Thank goodness I could get it through Amazon for about the same price. A little bit goes a long way and doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry and frizzy like others.</li>
            <li> extremely happy with the product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> My Dad&#x27;s fav. Hairspray like no other.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works better than other products tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mink for years - delivery time was awesome!!! Price was right too!!!</li>
            <li> Also, Great hair spray for me and is no longer sold in my area.  Product arrived earlier than anticipated and that was greatl too.</li>
