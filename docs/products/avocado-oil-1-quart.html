            <li>I love the results I received.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so I figured it was ok to buy nonorganic this time:).</li>
            <li>I feel better knowing I&#x27;m not being exposed to a lot of chemicals</li>
            <li>And Essential Depot was wonderful to work with.</li>
            <li>But the vendor should know better to wrap the items to make sure they don&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great oil and the price is completely reasonable.</li>
            <li>Lovely for soaps and for lotions.</li>
            <li>To be sure, I went to the store and bought Avocado Oil from a reputable seller and compared the two.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>My body and hair love it.</li>
            <li>I really love its conditioning effect on my skin and hair</li>
            <li>I  use avocado oil more and more in the beauty products and soaps that I make.</li>
            <li>This avocado oil is ok.</li>
            <li>The oil does everything and more .&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Love this oil in my soap.</li>
            <li>What I love about this oil is the fact that it is not heavy, it makes my skin look so beautiful.</li>
            <li>Very good oil, absorb quickly and I use it on my face and the whole body.</li>
            <li>High quality avocado oil, great for a carrier oil, and priced to sell.</li>
            <li>AMAZON was great they fixed everything.  </li>
            <li>I use hello hydration conditioner with this avocado oil after I wash her, and her hair has never been this easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>The oil came very quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a good company, so this is not a complaint towards this company.</li>
            <li>LOL I looked like a female version of Professor Snape that day.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels moisturized but not oily, which is important for me.  </li>
            <li>Makes fantastic soap.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and won&#x27;t fit in the microwave.</li>
            <li>I mix it with apricot kernal oil and grapeseed oil with several drops of lavender and rose geranium essential oil for a wonderful after shower body oil.</li>
            <li>Happy to see Essential Depot on Amazon site as I am a prime member.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My oil was very fresh.</li>
            <li>Great mixed with sweet almond oil as well.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again when I run out, this is one of my new favorite oils!</li>
            <li>I use the Avocado Oil in soap to help produce a moisturizing bar of soap that is great for more mature and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This oil is so rich and emollient.  </li>
            <li>Even though its not organic, avocado&#x27;s are on the list for \\&quot;The clean 15 for 2013\\</li>
            <li>Love having large quantity for</li>
            <li>I love the large bottle .</li>
            <li>I really like this product, I have so many use for it.</li>
            <li>I really got into using oils this winter and this turned out to be my favorite one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but i must say i ordered 3 oils (this coconut and sweet almond)</li>
            <li>Love this oil, it makes my hair shiny, soft and strong.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves no smell.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is always quick, the products are sealed well</li>
            <li>Now it  feels so smooth and looks absolutely radiant...</li>
            <li>old skin look better than ever with lotions.</li>
            <li>The oil was packaged well, was fresh and did not leak at all.</li>
            <li>I love to experiment with natural oils for a variety of hair and beauty products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of avocado oil - which I am mixing with essential oils for fragrance and other benefits to my skin  - this is one of the best oils for your skin</li>
            <li>While this is a decent quality oil, I bought it in attempts to get it cheaply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several Essential Depot items and been quite happy with them.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and natural hair, I make my own skin and hair care products.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as the seller described it.</li>
            <li>arrived promptly, exactly as described</li>
            <li>I love this oil, I use it for my entire body from head to toe.  </li>
            <li>The first delivery had to be denied, the box it was delivered in was saturated with oil.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing avocado oil.</li>
            <li>have been quite pleased with Essential Depot oils and butters.</li>
            <li>I have funny hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Fresh and very well sealed.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair oil and this gigantic bottle will last me forever.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this oil.</li>
            <li>Everything I&#x27;ve gotten from Essential Depot has been top notch.</li>
            <li>My daughter gets this stuff for I don&#x27;t know what, but she loves it and will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li>Guess it works pretty well</li>
            <li>I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>It is very rich but absorbs into your skin in a short period of time leaving you soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This avocado oil is light and clean; a huge bottle for such a low price that I initially thought it was a mistake......Can&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere.</li>
            <li>It virtually smells like nothing which does not bother me because I&#x27;m not really crazy about making sure my hair smell like citrus because I really don&#x27;t care how it smells as long as it doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>am almost positive</li>
            <li>I like it, but it&#x27;s really large.</li>
            <li>This large size of oil has gone faster than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I mix this with vegetable glycerine, rose water and a little emu oil.</li>
            <li>I bought this for soap making, and it worked very well in the shampoo bars I made.</li>
            <li>It helps me detangle my hair soo much faster</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so much softer and silkier, with fewer knots and tangles, fewer strands in the comb.</li>
            <li>Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li>I had not opened mine, so I really cannot explain the problem.</li>
            <li>I have received many plastic bottles sucessfully over the years, and most of those were taped well in the mail journey; but I&#x27;ve received untaped products like L-Glutathione &amp; shampoos with very little left in the bottles.</li>
            <li>This bottle is really big and reasonably priced, so this not really a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very smooth and soft, but be careful..</li>
            <li>I love avocado oil because it works great and is less expensive than my other favorite Jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>I like Avocado Oil mainly for the body products because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause pimples.</li>
            <li>If you want to prevent wrinkles, or want what you might have to disappear, then I would highly suggest that you use Avocado oil!&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(I can actually just smell my shower gel after this oil has absorbed, which I like).</li>
            <li>I use this avocado oil mixed with a little coconut oil and rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li>The Avocado oil was a new product for me, after trying it</li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas, and my family</li>
            <li>One day, I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>:::shrugs::: if anyone in the near future wants to see and can clue me in on how to post photos, I will!</li>
            <li>should include some kind of pour spout on their bottles (like the ones that come on commercial olive oil bottles from the store) - I end up wasting some because it&#x27;s hard to control when pouring.</li>
            <li>I use this as a conditioner for my hair.there is no harsh smell.</li>
            <li>I will never shop anywhere else for natural oils.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap.</li>
            <li>last much longer.</li>
            <li>As I said, I make a LOT of natural products.</li>
            <li>Our hair is natural.</li>
            <li>:) I use only a little bit on my hair, and it works!</li>
            <li>(3) Absorption - Essential Depot&#x27;s oil sat on my hair and skin and was never absorbed; the other brand was easily absorbed and left my skin feeling soft, smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I purchased it I found I can get a larger size of pure avocado oil a dollar or two cheaper at my local farmers market.</li>
            <li>Bottle should last me a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I put this in my hair (mixed w/ grapeseed oil) before adding conditioner and my hair is soft, moisturized and looks shiny.</li>
            <li>This is the only oil I can put in my 10 year old daughters hair and it is not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>It would be unfortunate for the producers (who worked so hard [labor of love] to make a good thing they cared about &amp; didn&#x27;t want wasted) &amp; consumers if all the oil were to leak out.</li>
            <li>The only improvement I would suggest to this is to place tape across the bottle lids continuing some down the left &amp; right side of the bottles because the argan oil in the box had leaked out onto the box.</li>
            <li>I bought this a year ago, and did not try to use this product until recently simply because I was really sastisfied with my other recipes.</li>
            <li>Apparently, avocado oil only lasts 1 year.</li>
            <li>The oil isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the oil does not pour easily from this bottle due to its design.</li>

            <li> Nice and moisterizing</li>
            <li> Good product, will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> An expiration date on the bottle would have been nice.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes my hair and my daughters and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light feel, mild aroma, and incorporates perfectly.  </li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> so I figured it was ok to buy nonorganic this time:).</li>
            <li> I feel better knowing I&#x27;m not being exposed to a lot of chemicals</li>
            <li> And Essential Depot was wonderful to work with.</li>
            <li> But the vendor should know better to wrap the items to make sure they don&#x27;t leak.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great oil and the price is completely reasonable.</li>
            <li> Lovely for soaps and for lotions.</li>
            <li> To be sure, I went to the store and bought Avocado Oil from a reputable seller and compared the two.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My body and hair love it.</li>
            <li> I really love its conditioning effect on my skin and hair</li>
            <li> I  use avocado oil more and more in the beauty products and soaps that I make.</li>
            <li> This avocado oil is ok.</li>
            <li> The oil does everything and more .&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Love this oil in my soap.</li>
            <li> What I love about this oil is the fact that it is not heavy, it makes my skin look so beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very good oil, absorb quickly and I use it on my face and the whole body.</li>
            <li> High quality avocado oil, great for a carrier oil, and priced to sell.</li>
            <li> AMAZON was great they fixed everything.  </li>
            <li> I use hello hydration conditioner with this avocado oil after I wash her, and her hair has never been this easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> The oil came very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a good company, so this is not a complaint towards this company.</li>
            <li> LOL I looked like a female version of Professor Snape that day.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels moisturized but not oily, which is important for me.  </li>
            <li> Makes fantastic soap.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and won&#x27;t fit in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I mix it with apricot kernal oil and grapeseed oil with several drops of lavender and rose geranium essential oil for a wonderful after shower body oil.</li>
            <li> Happy to see Essential Depot on Amazon site as I am a prime member.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> My oil was very fresh.</li>
            <li> Great mixed with sweet almond oil as well.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again when I run out, this is one of my new favorite oils!</li>
            <li> I use the Avocado Oil in soap to help produce a moisturizing bar of soap that is great for more mature and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is so rich and emollient.  </li>
            <li> Even though its not organic, avocado&#x27;s are on the list for \\&quot;The clean 15 for 2013\\</li>
            <li> Love having large quantity for</li>
            <li> I love the large bottle .</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I have so many use for it.</li>
            <li> I really got into using oils this winter and this turned out to be my favorite one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but i must say i ordered 3 oils (this coconut and sweet almond)</li>
            <li> Love this oil, it makes my hair shiny, soft and strong.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves no smell.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is always quick, the products are sealed well</li>
            <li> Now it  feels so smooth and looks absolutely radiant...</li>
            <li> old skin look better than ever with lotions.</li>
            <li> The oil was packaged well, was fresh and did not leak at all.</li>
            <li> I love to experiment with natural oils for a variety of hair and beauty products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of avocado oil - which I am mixing with essential oils for fragrance and other benefits to my skin  - this is one of the best oils for your skin</li>
            <li> While this is a decent quality oil, I bought it in attempts to get it cheaply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several Essential Depot items and been quite happy with them.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and natural hair, I make my own skin and hair care products.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as the seller described it.</li>
            <li> arrived promptly, exactly as described</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I use it for my entire body from head to toe.  </li>
            <li> The first delivery had to be denied, the box it was delivered in was saturated with oil.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing avocado oil.</li>
            <li> have been quite pleased with Essential Depot oils and butters.</li>
            <li> I have funny hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Fresh and very well sealed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair oil and this gigantic bottle will last me forever.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this oil.</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve gotten from Essential Depot has been top notch.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets this stuff for I don&#x27;t know what, but she loves it and will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> Guess it works pretty well</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> It is very rich but absorbs into your skin in a short period of time leaving you soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This avocado oil is light and clean; a huge bottle for such a low price that I initially thought it was a mistake......Can&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere.</li>
            <li> It virtually smells like nothing which does not bother me because I&#x27;m not really crazy about making sure my hair smell like citrus because I really don&#x27;t care how it smells as long as it doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> am almost positive</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s really large.</li>
            <li> This large size of oil has gone faster than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I mix this with vegetable glycerine, rose water and a little emu oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this for soap making, and it worked very well in the shampoo bars I made.</li>
            <li> It helps me detangle my hair soo much faster</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so much softer and silkier, with fewer knots and tangles, fewer strands in the comb.</li>
            <li> Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li> I had not opened mine, so I really cannot explain the problem.</li>
            <li> I have received many plastic bottles sucessfully over the years, and most of those were taped well in the mail journey; but I&#x27;ve received untaped products like L-Glutathione &amp; shampoos with very little left in the bottles.</li>
            <li> This bottle is really big and reasonably priced, so this not really a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very smooth and soft, but be careful..</li>
            <li> I love avocado oil because it works great and is less expensive than my other favorite Jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> I like Avocado Oil mainly for the body products because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause pimples.</li>
            <li> If you want to prevent wrinkles, or want what you might have to disappear, then I would highly suggest that you use Avocado oil!&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> (I can actually just smell my shower gel after this oil has absorbed, which I like).</li>
            <li> I use this avocado oil mixed with a little coconut oil and rose hip seed oil.</li>
            <li> The Avocado oil was a new product for me, after trying it</li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas, and my family</li>
            <li> One day, I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> :::shrugs::: if anyone in the near future wants to see and can clue me in on how to post photos, I will!</li>
            <li> should include some kind of pour spout on their bottles (like the ones that come on commercial olive oil bottles from the store) - I end up wasting some because it&#x27;s hard to control when pouring.</li>
            <li> I use this as a conditioner for my hair.there is no harsh smell.</li>
            <li> I will never shop anywhere else for natural oils.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap.</li>
            <li> last much longer.</li>
            <li> As I said, I make a LOT of natural products.</li>
            <li> Our hair is natural.</li>
            <li> :) I use only a little bit on my hair, and it works!</li>
            <li> (3) Absorption - Essential Depot&#x27;s oil sat on my hair and skin and was never absorbed; the other brand was easily absorbed and left my skin feeling soft, smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I purchased it I found I can get a larger size of pure avocado oil a dollar or two cheaper at my local farmers market.</li>
            <li> Bottle should last me a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair (mixed w/ grapeseed oil) before adding conditioner and my hair is soft, moisturized and looks shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil I can put in my 10 year old daughters hair and it is not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> It would be unfortunate for the producers (who worked so hard [labor of love] to make a good thing they cared about &amp; didn&#x27;t want wasted) &amp; consumers if all the oil were to leak out.</li>
            <li> The only improvement I would suggest to this is to place tape across the bottle lids continuing some down the left &amp; right side of the bottles because the argan oil in the box had leaked out onto the box.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago, and did not try to use this product until recently simply because I was really sastisfied with my other recipes.</li>
            <li> Apparently, avocado oil only lasts 1 year.</li>
            <li> The oil isn&#x27;t super thick</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the oil does not pour easily from this bottle due to its design.</li>
            <li> Got the oil earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> but recently I realize my legs were dry and rough....</li>
            <li> Use it after showering to help moisturizer dry sun beat skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have a problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> So, I set out to make a moisturizing soap for us that wouldn&#x27;t dry out our skin.</li>
            <li> Her hair was so dry and brittle after one month of using.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they were old.</li>
            <li> (2) Smell - Essential Depot&#x27;s oil reminded me of a less pungent version of oil-based paint; the other brand smelled nutty.</li>
            <li> I usually buy in bulk, and my oils usually keep for much longer than this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to put unknown substances on my hair/skin.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and natural and loves this oil.  </li>
            <li> Extremely emollient like cocoa of coco butter, but liquid at room temperature and easier to apply.</li>
            <li> There were three major differences I saw: (1) Color - Essential Depot&#x27;s oil was yellow, which, in all fairness, is also a characteristic of refined avocado oil; the other brand I bought was green (characteristic of unrefined oil).</li>
            <li> No distinct smell with this oil.</li>
            <li> I wish that it had a pour spout or something to keep the oil from dripping down the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I use in other cosmetic applications and it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use it plain on my body/face, or with other oils.</li>
            <li> use just a little.</li>
            <li> Compared to the avocado oil that I have from Now, this feels a little watery and is lighter in color.</li>
            <li> I went to work looking like a dirty oily head one day because I used way too much on my hair the night before and didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair again in the morning when I saw that it was sticking to my head.</li>
            <li> I use it in a Dead Sea Salt Scrub.</li>
            <li> moisturizes without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li> Been using this oil for a few months now and it lasts....</li>
            <li> I use a narrow tipped applicator at night once per week and do not wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware of trying to save a few bucks by buying from a no-name seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dissapointed because I wasted my money, and I did not get to make the beauty product I had in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> And my hair has gotten a little thicker despite already having thick hair.</li>
            <li> The product is ok but the way it pours is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how I will like this product and will have to see if I will order again from the user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about using this oil for cooking - there is a lot of oil to use, and it&#x27;s in a plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I also purchased Argan Oil from Essential Depot but am going to throw that out as well.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick and green as others that i have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Usually this is in unopened containers.</li>
            <li> You may end up with a fake product and then have to spend twice the amount of money (once on the fake product, then to buy the real thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even using a small funnel is difficult as all the oil drips down the sides.</li>
            <li> However, oils tend to not go bad if properly stored.</li>
            <li> They fixed the problem, it was just annoying to have to deal with the tracking and reporting.  </li>
            <li> This was the worse oil for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Sorry Essential Depot. :(</li>
            <li> Works as well as expensive cream.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Avocado Oil, my body and hair loves this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, bacteria cultures were growing in my bottle</li>
            <li> Used for cold process soap making</li>
            <li> Used for making cold process soap.</li>
            <li> Not problem or bad issues or experiences with it.</li>
            <li> The packing was horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

I use this as a conditioner for my hair.there is no harsh smell. I would recommend this product to others. Item arrived on time from seller.</li>
            <li> The product is ok but the way it pours is terrible.  I wish that it had a pour spout or something to keep the oil from dripping down the side of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a week or so and I love it. I use it for my face as a moisturizer and it is nice and light, also does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> good product good price value</li>
            <li> This is the only oil I can put in my 10 year old daughters hair and it is not dry or greasy. I use hello hydration conditioner with this avocado oil after I wash her, and her hair has never been this easy to comb through. I love this oil. She has 3b/3c hair.</li>
            <li> Used for cold process soap making</li>
            <li> arrived promptly, exactly as described</li>
            <li> Use this product for my handmade soap making. This is really great for adding to my soaps, will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The Avocado oil was a new product for me, after trying it I love the results I received. Great product for your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it&#x27;s really large. I think it&#x27;ll take me 10 years to use up all of it. :) I use only a little bit on my hair, and it works! It made my hair very smooth and soft, but be careful.. use just a little. :) I went to work looking like a dirty oily head one day because I used way too much on my hair the night before and didn&#x27;t have time to wash my hair again in the morning when I saw that it was sticking to my head. LOL I looked like a female version of Professor Snape that day. Yikes! :) But yea, this product works for me.</li>
            <li> Im talking old sun fried freckled skin living in Hawaii 38 years and this sinks in and makes my 63 yr. old skin look better than ever with lotions. Good quality &amp; good cost!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use it in a Dead Sea Salt Scrub.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Use it in everything I make from face wash, facial moisturizer, and my bar soap. Even though its not organic, avocado&#x27;s are on the list for \\&quot;The clean 15 for 2013\\&quot; so I figured it was ok to buy nonorganic this time:). Excellent quality for an awesome price, and with the right carrier oil, makes my skin silky soft!!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I use it for my entire body from head to toe.  I think it is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot of avocado oil - which I am mixing with essential oils for fragrance and other benefits to my skin  - this is one of the best oils for your skin and I have had good luck with this vendor.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good quality avocado oil with a nice feel and you can&#x27;t beat the price any where else.</li>
            <li> Got the oil earlier than expected. So far so good. I read about the benefits of avocado oil so I am hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> i put it on my cuticles and under my eyes. moisturizes without feeling heavy.  have not made soap out of it yet but i will one day</li>
            <li> I am allergic to coconut, so I was looking for something that would work well as a hair mask that did not contain coconut oil. THIS WORKS GREAT! I have healthy hair already, but I have noticed a difference in hair growth and texture! The shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li> I will never shop anywhere else for natural oils. This avocado oil is light and clean; a huge bottle for such a low price that I initially thought it was a mistake......Can&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere.</li>
            <li> Compared to the avocado oil that I have from Now, this feels a little watery and is lighter in color. The label was rubbed off on both bottles. Not sure if they were old. Not sure how I will like this product and will have to see if I will order again from the user. Sorry Essential Depot. :(</li>
            <li> What I love about this oil is the fact that it is not heavy, it makes my skin look so beautiful. I have been blessed with good skin but recently I realize my legs were dry and rough....Now it  feels so smooth and looks absolutely radiant...love! love! love!</li>
            <li> Use it after showering to help moisturizer dry sun beat skin.  Absorbs quickly and leaves no smell.  I feel better knowing I&#x27;m not being exposed to a lot of chemicals</li>
            <li> Been using this oil for a few months now and it lasts....it&#x27;s a great hair moisturizer in the winter but also a wonderful skin lotion too....</li>
            <li> Applying this oil after a bath is one of my favorit things.  It is very rich but absorbs into your skin in a short period of time leaving you soft and smooth.  Great mixed with sweet almond oil as well.</li>
            <li> I use this avocado oil mixed with a little coconut oil and rose hip seed oil. Makes for a perfect after-shower oil (I apply before lightly toweling off). Neutral smell, which doesn&#x27;t linger (I can actually just smell my shower gel after this oil has absorbed, which I like). I&#x27;m looking forward to using this oil in a hair treatment as well.  I&#x27;m not sure about using this oil for cooking - there is a lot of oil to use, and it&#x27;s in a plastic bottle.  I&#x27;ll stick with coconut and sesame for cooking for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good amount of oil for a good price too. Bottle should last me a pretty long time. I&#x27;ll definitely order from Essential Depot again.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my hair for hair growth and its amazing! My edges are stronger and Im happy with the results</li>
            <li> Love this oil, it makes my hair shiny, soft and strong. It is non greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been more nourished, I am extremely happy that I chose to purchase this oil.  And Essential Depot was wonderful to work with.</li>
            <li> The first delivery had to be denied, the box it was delivered in was saturated with oil.  The packing was horrible.  They fixed the problem, it was just annoying to have to deal with the tracking and reporting.  AMAZON was great they fixed everything.  But the vendor should know better to wrap the items to make sure they don&#x27;t leak.  The product quality was great.</li>
            <li> Great buy for my learning process. This is my first time purchasing avocado oil. So I will have to write another review after uusage.</li>
            <li> This seems to be very nice oil. I ordered this avocado oil &amp; some argan oil from the same company that came in the same box. Both are very good for skin elacisity. The oil came very quickly. The only improvement I would suggest to this is to place tape across the bottle lids continuing some down the left &amp; right side of the bottles because the argan oil in the box had leaked out onto the box. It would be unfortunate for the producers (who worked so hard [labor of love] to make a good thing they cared about &amp; didn&#x27;t want wasted) &amp; consumers if all the oil were to leak out. I have received many plastic bottles sucessfully over the years, and most of those were taped well in the mail journey; but I&#x27;ve received untaped products like L-Glutathione &amp; shampoos with very little left in the bottles. This is a good company, so this is not a complaint towards this company.</li>
            <li> I mix this brand of avocado oil and castor oil and apply it to my scalp with great results.  My hair is thick and natural and loves this oil.  I use a narrow tipped applicator at night once per week and do not wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I will try warming it up prior to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been quite pleased with Essential Depot oils and butters.</li>
            <li> I bought this for soap making, and it worked very well in the shampoo bars I made. I&#x27;ve purchased several Essential Depot items and been quite happy with them.</li>
            <li> I use this while I&#x27;m still in the shower so my pore absorb it well. It&#x27;s great oil and the price is completely reasonable. I even use it to hydrate my face. Works as well as expensive cream.</li>
            <li> I have funny hair and skin. Never enough moisture. This works great on both. I put this in my hair (mixed w/ grapeseed oil) before adding conditioner and my hair is soft, moisturized and looks shiny.</li>
            <li> I use this in soap and have bought this product as well as several others from this company. Shipping is always quick, the products are sealed well and I have never had a problem with the products leaking. I use the Avocado Oil in soap to help produce a moisturizing bar of soap that is great for more mature and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! Its great for your &#x27;HAIR &amp; SKIN!!!</li>
            <li> While this is a decent quality oil, I bought it in attempts to get it cheaply. After I purchased it I found I can get a larger size of pure avocado oil a dollar or two cheaper at my local farmers market. Check locally before you buy.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my body and hair products. I like Avocado Oil mainly for the body products because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or cause pimples.</li>
            <li> Love having large quantity for when ever I want to tinker!  Love this product!  Great!</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my face and entire body.  If you want to prevent wrinkles, or want what you might have to disappear, then I would highly suggest that you use Avocado oil!&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> I use avocado oil for almost everything.  I have sensitive skin and natural hair, I make my own skin and hair care products.  I love avocado oil because it works great and is less expensive than my other favorite Jojoba oil.  I use it in my body butter and in the spray, wax and pomade I make for my hair.  You can&#x27;t beat the price or the oil!</li>
            <li> Very good oil, absorb quickly and I use it on my face and the whole body. I think is 1 Qt will last for 6 months based on 3 times a week uses. Great deal~</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I have so many use for it. I love it!!!! It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I love it very nice. Fresh and very well sealed. Lovely for soaps and for lotions. Great for the skin.</li>
            <li> Bottom Line Up Front: Beware of trying to save a few bucks by buying from a no-name seller. You may end up with a fake product and then have to spend twice the amount of money (once on the fake product, then to buy the real thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost positive whatever &amp;#34;Avocado Oil&amp;#34; was sent to me, was inauthentic. To be sure, I went to the store and bought Avocado Oil from a reputable seller and compared the two. There were three major differences I saw: (1) Color - Essential Depot&#x27;s oil was yellow, which, in all fairness, is also a characteristic of refined avocado oil; the other brand I bought was green (characteristic of unrefined oil). (2) Smell - Essential Depot&#x27;s oil reminded me of a less pungent version of oil-based paint; the other brand smelled nutty. (3) Absorption - Essential Depot&#x27;s oil sat on my hair and skin and was never absorbed; the other brand was easily absorbed and left my skin feeling soft, smooth and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I will be throwing away whatever oil was sent to me because I don&#x27;t trust the label or Essential Depot. Unfortunately I also purchased Argan Oil from Essential Depot but am going to throw that out as well. I don&#x27;t want to put unknown substances on my hair/skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice sized bottle&lt;br /&gt;Clear labeling&lt;br /&gt;Quality product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;They should include some kind of pour spout on their bottles (like the ones that come on commercial olive oil bottles from the store) - I end up wasting some because it&#x27;s hard to control when pouring.</li>
            <li> Its for soap making lol was going to use it for cooking oh well skin moisturizer now lol</li>
            <li> The wife uses this to make her hair products, her hair is smoooth and silky now.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It was a great buy. I use in other cosmetic applications and it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Avocado Oil, my body and hair loves this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  I&#x27;ve been mixing this oil in with cheapie conditioner and using it as a deep conditioner.  My hair is in love!! It helps me detangle my hair soo much faster and my hair feels moisturized but not oily, which is important for me.  This is my favorite hair oil and this gigantic bottle will last me forever. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I will continue to purchase. It&#x27;s a very good oil for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my hair and on my skin and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> High quality avocado oil, great for a carrier oil, and priced to sell. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the oil does not pour easily from this bottle due to its design. Even using a small funnel is difficult as all the oil drips down the sides. The oil itself is good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never ordered the course I want to try itand it smells great. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m happy with shipping, coast and size</li>
            <li> Use every night on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing pre shampoo treatment. You do not need a lot and your hair feels amazing after.</li>
            <li> I love the large bottle . I add it to my skin ,hair, and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this oil. My body and hair love it.</li>
            <li> Makes fantastic soap. Everything I&#x27;ve gotten from Essential Depot has been top notch.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair. And my hair has gotten a little thicker despite already having thick hair. The oil does not have a smell. It virtually smells like nothing which does not bother me because I&#x27;m not really crazy about making sure my hair smell like citrus because I really don&#x27;t care how it smells as long as it doesn&#x27;t stink. The oil isn&#x27;t super thick it&#x27;s quite then so it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. The bottle is huge and won&#x27;t fit in the microwave.</li>
            <li> This oil is so rich and emollient.  I mix it with apricot kernal oil and grapeseed oil with several drops of lavender and rose geranium essential oil for a wonderful after shower body oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome in my home made soaps and shampoo bars.  I really love its conditioning effect on my skin and hair</li>
            <li> My daughter gets this stuff for I don&#x27;t know what, but she loves it and will be getting more in the future. Guess it works pretty well or she would never make a second purchase.</li>
            <li> This is amazing oil. Great for skin and hair. I add it to my bath and foot soaks and it is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> I really got into using oils this winter and this turned out to be my favorite one.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on regularly with and without shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;It always feels wonderful on my skin, love it.</li>
            <li> I  use avocado oil more and more in the beauty products and soaps that I make.I felt this was a good price for the size bottle.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the avocado oil. Used for making cold process soap. Not problem or bad issues or experiences with it. Happy to see Essential Depot on Amazon site as I am a prime member. The oil was packaged well, was fresh and did not leak at all. Very happy with end result. Will definitely buy again and again as avocado oil is one of my favs for soap making.</li>
            <li> This avocado oil is ok. It is not as thick and green as others that i have used in the past. But i think it is because this brand is for commercial use and is not food grade. As a result I only use it on my skin and on my hair. This bottle is really big and reasonably priced, so this not really a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Extremely emollient like cocoa of coco butter, but liquid at room temperature and easier to apply. I use it plain on my body/face, or with other oils. This large size of oil has gone faster than I thought it would. I will buy it again when I run out, this is one of my new favorite oils! No distinct smell with this oil. My oil was very fresh.</li>
            <li> I simply use this as a moisturizer. Great for the skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Nice and moisterizing</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Instantly made my hands, neck and face appear smoother with fewer lines. I soak my hair in it the night before shampooing. It leaves my hair so much softer and silkier, with fewer knots and tangles, fewer strands in the comb.</li>
            <li> The oil does everything and more .&lt;br /&gt;You can put it in your bath, on your face , shampoo with it , it&#x27;s awesome .</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my first batch of homemade soap. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and in myself for making the soap. I live in Las Vegas, and my family and I have a problem with dry skin. So, I set out to make a moisturizing soap for us that wouldn&#x27;t dry out our skin. Mission Accomplished.</li>
            <li> Use this for my sugar scrubs and LOVE it!  Very nice product.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love this oil in my soap.</li>
            <li> This was the worse oil for my daughter&#x27;s hair. I wonder if this is actually oil in the bottle? Her hair was so dry and brittle after one month of using. I threw the bottle away. Never again.</li>
            <li> Good product, will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love to experiment with natural oils for a variety of hair and beauty products. I bought this a year ago, and did not try to use this product until recently simply because I was really sastisfied with my other recipes. One day, I decided to try something new. Unfortunately, bacteria cultures were growing in my bottle and I had to toss it. If it had a known expiration date, it should be printed on the product. However, oils tend to not go bad if properly stored. This makes me think something happened to my avacado oil in its manufactoring/processing/handling. Ive had macademia oil and others last much longer. In fact, it was the only time I had ever seen fungus or whatever in any oil whatsoever. I&#x27;m dissapointed because I wasted my money, and I did not get to make the beauty product I had in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/4/2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I did my research. Apparently, avocado oil only lasts 1 year. Usually this is in unopened containers. I had not opened mine, so I really cannot explain the problem. As I said, I make a LOT of natural products. I usually buy in bulk, and my oils usually keep for much longer than this. Changed to 4 stars to give them the benefit of the doubt since I found out that it \\&quot;technically\\&quot; expires in a year. An expiration date on the bottle would have been nice. Also, I have photos of the contaminants, but I cannot figure out how to upload them. :::shrugs::: if anyone in the near future wants to see and can clue me in on how to post photos, I will!</li>
            <li> I love this oil for soap making! It has a nice light feel, mild aroma, and incorporates perfectly.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good price great product</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes my hair and my daughters and gives it a nice shine. Our hair is natural. I mix this with vegetable glycerine, rose water and a little emu oil. I put it in a spray bottle and spray our hair daily.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had hoped for.  Seems to be a good product, and arrived in great time.</li>
            <li> Great oil to use!! love the smell!!!!</li>
            <li> I have not use this but i must say i ordered 3 oils (this coconut and sweet almond) andsurprisingly they all have no smell and are very light to the touch as well as goes on smoothe. I look forward to using it soon (for hair and skin)</li>
