            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t say all day, but probably a good 6-8 hours (on me</li>
            <li>I spritz this on fairly liberally</li>
            <li>I noticed on a gal I work with and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The price is really good, considering that it is a Vera Wang fragrance.</li>
            <li>So this is a good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I originally loved the scent, but after a while, the scent started to change.</li>
            <li>Good thing the lotion was included.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, it is an eau de parfum, which is weaker than an eau de toilette or perfume.  </li>
            <li>My sister and best friend also enjoy this perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, I will order another for myself.  </li>

            <li>Nice gift for my daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li>I say it gives off its scent nicely for a couple hours and then starts to fade, but as do a lot of perfumes.</li>

            <li>Vera Wang fragrances are my favorite and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>lotion (not a discount when it was basically free with the perfume)!</li>
            <li>I believe that you count on most customers not wanting to bother with returns.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love most of Vera Wang&#x27;s scents.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok, even when it&#x27;s mostly dissipated from my body, it lingers on the clothes all day.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it and would recommend it.</li>

            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Excellent eau de parfum,more concentrated than eau de toilet.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and refreshing and I love this parfum.  </li>
            <li>This is a very sweet and floral scent.</li>
            <li>It is light and feminine, but it is still sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Smell great and soft goes.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this and loved it so much that I HAD to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I love love love the way this smells, and the price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li>, strongly recommend it for considering customers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definetely recomend this to people that don&#x27;t like strong essences.</li>
            <li>It looks authentic, and smells exactly like it did in the store!</li>
            <li>I also own the lotion which is much stronger and lasts for days on my clothes.</li>
            <li>The bottle was nicely secure in its package and it did come in time with prime shipping.</li>
            <li>I was extremely happy that the scent was the same.</li>
            <li>if available)</li>
            <li>Smells so great that I actually wanted to sleep with my wife.</li>
            <li>eau de parfum at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>I got a fantastic price on it here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>to heavy or to light, is a perfect scent for everyday&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sweet and sexy, but not sugar-y sweet.</li>
            <li>Sweet smelling but not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this perfume before and it seemed to smell much better the first time.</li>
            <li>I orderd this perfum for te first time and am in love with it.</li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several nice comments on the scent, mostly in the cooler months of the year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will certainly buy more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works for any season&lt;br /&gt;Sophisticated and feminine&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Spray doesn&#x27;t last&lt;br /&gt;Expensive when full priced&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li>I love it that much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not what I would call &#x27;sweet&#x27;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost woodsy in a way, a sweet woodsy smell, perhaps cedar or something like that.</li>
            <li>Sweet, sophistication.</li>
            <li>Subtle and delicious!</li>
            <li>and I was lucky to find it here</li>
            <li>It came quickly in the mail...</li>
            <li>It also last more than one hour like most perfumes.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of perfumes &amp; I&#x27;m pretty picky.</li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful and heavy.</li>
            <li>This really isn&#x27;t a strong perfume, it&#x27;s a lil sweet and very different from most perfumes</li>
            <li>THHIS PERFUME IS LONG LASTING, A GREAT SMELL, AND NOT OVERPOWERING!</li>
            <li>the only parfum purchased that my wife actually liked.</li>
            <li>So worth it and</li>
            <li>I was worried that it might be too powerful</li>
            <li>The girls love it, very unique, very nice aroma, not overbearing, small dab goes a long way, a winner here!</li>
            <li>Shipping was right around the time it had stated</li>
            <li>The price I paid was an outstanding deal, I got the large bottle for else than the smaller bottle price in a department store, it was shipped promptly and securely.</li>
            <li>This is a very feminine sweet scent for a girly girl.  </li>
            <li>You not only get the 3.4 oz perfume, but you also get a large container of lotion which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I returned it and decide to spend a little more for the authentic parfum spray.  </li>
            <li>Amazon shipped it super fast</li>
            <li>I love that although it is a floral fragrance it still smells modern rather than like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.  </li>
            <li>shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Soft and light as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I first discovered in department store and took a sample home</li>
            <li>I was a bit reluctant to purchase this perfume after so many people said the scent did not last.</li>
            <li>precious woods, sheer musk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I finally purchased it.</li>
            <li>and I can assure you this is not the real thing!</li>
            <li>It just reminds me of a sexy, floral, romantic scent.</li>
            <li>Its pretty on my vanity.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, I have received several compliments while wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li>Again I really liked the original bottle but not sure if the one I got here was &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a scent every woman wil love, young or old.</li>
            <li>It is light enough for spring, but sophisticated enough for fall and winter.</li>
            <li>very musky but sweet, some say even on the masculine side, but I kinda like</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells good but it  does not last long.  </li>
            <li>I recommend getting the large spritzer for this reason.</li>
            <li>you know, VW&#x27;s line traditionally markets towards weddings or young women (hence the princess line).&lt;br /&gt;Has pretty good lasting power</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold on purchasing from amazon because it is so much cheaper than department store prices.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is really an any age kinda scent, wouldn&#x27;t recommend for under age of 22</li>
            <li>Seems like it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li>Very deceptive sales tactics.</li>
            <li>very feminine and soft&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>Smells chip not the real deal, be carefull is not the real perfume.</li>
            <li>I wanted this perfume for about 3 months now, and found it much cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say too much about the others that I bought for her.</li>
            <li>It was much appreciated..</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is light, floral and romantic.</li>
            <li>It also arrived fast</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of this, the first I bought at a department store for full price.</li>
            <li>, The scent lasts on a long time on me and it&#x27;s a great subtle, sweet, floral smell.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this particular Parfum Spray does not even last for a second.</li>
            <li>Returned original 1oz purchase from Sams Club @ same price as  this 3oz purchase in a sealed box.</li>
            <li>Great product, only problem is the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great smell, Great price, Very Subtle</li>
            <li>Overall i&#x27;m satisfied with the product and in my opinion its worth what I spent on Amazon ($35ish)</li>
            <li>It has a sweet smell and I have gotten several compliments on it.</li>
            <li>To me this is a versatile scent that true to its name, smells incredibly romantic and feminine.  </li>
            <li>I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would certainly reccomend this Eau De Parfum for any young lady...</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it, especially for the price it was at.</li>
            <li>It is light enough for daily wear, but it is bold enough to turn heads at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not hard to please.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and got it for half the price I would pay in the stores!</li>
            <li>It starts with spicy, oriental notes and then finishes with a mandarin note, but not strong in the citrus area, more fruit.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong and it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would expect an eau de &#x27;parfum&#x27;</li>
            <li>probably.&lt;br /&gt;Could be a day or night scent, it&#x27;s pretty universal that way, I think.</li>
            <li>although I sample other perfumes from time to time, none seem as unique and continually pleasing as this one.  </li>
            <li>but I love it for everyday wear or daytime wear!</li>
            <li>ass topper, be careful when you open it as I&#x27;ve heard some say they broke the top when trying to open</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a young scent, not &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfume.</li>
            <li>I frequently get comments on it and</li>
            <li>During a visit she mentioned how much she loved it and was unhappy</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed in seeing that, but other wise happy with the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty scent but is not long lasting.  </li>
            <li>One of the flowers on the bottle top was broken and looked like it was glued back together with a hot gun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and it may not last a long time, but it&#x27;s a big bottle and that WILL last a long time.;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This scent is soft and very subtle, which most all men seem to appreciate.</li>
            <li>The scent barely lasted a half-a-day.  </li>
            <li>I usually go for fruity or sweet smells but this floral smell attracted me.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy for summer, but bold enough to wear in winter,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>SShe wears it exclusively and now wants the other items (i.e., lotion, bath gels etc.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, so I went through the bottle faster than normal reapplying.</li>
            <li>Not real compared it to my real bottle the scent s off and want keep long.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and my daughter loved it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a really good friend of mine, and she loved it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t say all day, but probably a good 6-8 hours (on me</li>
            <li> I spritz this on fairly liberally</li>
            <li> I noticed on a gal I work with and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The price is really good, considering that it is a Vera Wang fragrance.</li>
            <li> So this is a good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I originally loved the scent, but after a while, the scent started to change.</li>
            <li> Good thing the lotion was included.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, it is an eau de parfum, which is weaker than an eau de toilette or perfume.  </li>
            <li> My sister and best friend also enjoy this perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, I will order another for myself.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is gorgeous...</li>

            <li> Anything by Vera Wang is lovely.</li>
            <li> I love the deals I find on Amazon, as I purcahsed this 3.4 oz bottle for $35.00.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my god daughter many years ago.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love how this perfume smells</li>
            <li> Vera Wang fragrances are my favorite and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> lotion (not a discount when it was basically free with the perfume)!</li>
            <li> I believe that you count on most customers not wanting to bother with returns.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love most of Vera Wang&#x27;s scents.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok, even when it&#x27;s mostly dissipated from my body, it lingers on the clothes all day.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>

            <li> I was pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> and I love how it releases as it flows with ones every move.....</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent eau de parfum,more concentrated than eau de toilet.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and refreshing and I love this parfum.  </li>
            <li> This is a very sweet and floral scent.</li>
            <li> It is light and feminine, but it is still sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Smell great and soft goes.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this and loved it so much that I HAD to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I love love love the way this smells, and the price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li> , strongly recommend it for considering customers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definetely recomend this to people that don&#x27;t like strong essences.</li>
            <li> It looks authentic, and smells exactly like it did in the store!</li>
            <li> I also own the lotion which is much stronger and lasts for days on my clothes.</li>
            <li> The bottle was nicely secure in its package and it did come in time with prime shipping.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy that the scent was the same.</li>
            <li> if available)</li>
            <li> Smells so great that I actually wanted to sleep with my wife.</li>
            <li> eau de parfum at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> I got a fantastic price on it here at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> to heavy or to light, is a perfect scent for everyday&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sweet and sexy, but not sugar-y sweet.</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling but not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this perfume before and it seemed to smell much better the first time.</li>
            <li> I orderd this perfum for te first time and am in love with it.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several nice comments on the scent, mostly in the cooler months of the year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will certainly buy more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works for any season&lt;br /&gt;Sophisticated and feminine&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Spray doesn&#x27;t last&lt;br /&gt;Expensive when full priced&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> I love it that much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I would call &#x27;sweet&#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost woodsy in a way, a sweet woodsy smell, perhaps cedar or something like that.</li>
            <li> Sweet, sophistication.</li>
            <li> Subtle and delicious!</li>
            <li> and I was lucky to find it here</li>
            <li> It came quickly in the mail...</li>
            <li> It also last more than one hour like most perfumes.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of perfumes &amp; I&#x27;m pretty picky.</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful and heavy.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t a strong perfume, it&#x27;s a lil sweet and very different from most perfumes</li>
            <li> THHIS PERFUME IS LONG LASTING, A GREAT SMELL, AND NOT OVERPOWERING!</li>
            <li> the only parfum purchased that my wife actually liked.</li>
            <li> So worth it and</li>
            <li> I was worried that it might be too powerful</li>
            <li> The girls love it, very unique, very nice aroma, not overbearing, small dab goes a long way, a winner here!</li>
            <li> Shipping was right around the time it had stated</li>
            <li> The price I paid was an outstanding deal, I got the large bottle for else than the smaller bottle price in a department store, it was shipped promptly and securely.</li>
            <li> This is a very feminine sweet scent for a girly girl.  </li>
            <li> You not only get the 3.4 oz perfume, but you also get a large container of lotion which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I returned it and decide to spend a little more for the authentic parfum spray.  </li>
            <li> Amazon shipped it super fast</li>
            <li> I love that although it is a floral fragrance it still smells modern rather than like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.  </li>
            <li> shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Soft and light as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I first discovered in department store and took a sample home</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant to purchase this perfume after so many people said the scent did not last.</li>
            <li> precious woods, sheer musk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I finally purchased it.</li>
            <li> and I can assure you this is not the real thing!</li>
            <li> It just reminds me of a sexy, floral, romantic scent.</li>
            <li> Its pretty on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, I have received several compliments while wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> Again I really liked the original bottle but not sure if the one I got here was &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a scent every woman wil love, young or old.</li>
            <li> It is light enough for spring, but sophisticated enough for fall and winter.</li>
            <li> very musky but sweet, some say even on the masculine side, but I kinda like</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells good but it  does not last long.  </li>
            <li> I recommend getting the large spritzer for this reason.</li>
            <li> you know, VW&#x27;s line traditionally markets towards weddings or young women (hence the princess line).&lt;br /&gt;Has pretty good lasting power</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on purchasing from amazon because it is so much cheaper than department store prices.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is really an any age kinda scent, wouldn&#x27;t recommend for under age of 22</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li> Very deceptive sales tactics.</li>
            <li> very feminine and soft&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> Smells chip not the real deal, be carefull is not the real perfume.</li>
            <li> I wanted this perfume for about 3 months now, and found it much cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say too much about the others that I bought for her.</li>
            <li> It was much appreciated..</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is light, floral and romantic.</li>
            <li> It also arrived fast</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this, the first I bought at a department store for full price.</li>
            <li> , The scent lasts on a long time on me and it&#x27;s a great subtle, sweet, floral smell.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this particular Parfum Spray does not even last for a second.</li>
            <li> Returned original 1oz purchase from Sams Club @ same price as  this 3oz purchase in a sealed box.</li>
            <li> Great product, only problem is the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great smell, Great price, Very Subtle</li>
            <li> Overall i&#x27;m satisfied with the product and in my opinion its worth what I spent on Amazon ($35ish)</li>
            <li> It has a sweet smell and I have gotten several compliments on it.</li>
            <li> To me this is a versatile scent that true to its name, smells incredibly romantic and feminine.  </li>
            <li> I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would certainly reccomend this Eau De Parfum for any young lady...</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth it, especially for the price it was at.</li>
            <li> It is light enough for daily wear, but it is bold enough to turn heads at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not hard to please.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and got it for half the price I would pay in the stores!</li>
            <li> It starts with spicy, oriental notes and then finishes with a mandarin note, but not strong in the citrus area, more fruit.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strong and it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would expect an eau de &#x27;parfum&#x27;</li>
            <li> probably.&lt;br /&gt;Could be a day or night scent, it&#x27;s pretty universal that way, I think.</li>
            <li> although I sample other perfumes from time to time, none seem as unique and continually pleasing as this one.  </li>
            <li> but I love it for everyday wear or daytime wear!</li>
            <li> ass topper, be careful when you open it as I&#x27;ve heard some say they broke the top when trying to open</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a young scent, not &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfume.</li>
            <li> I frequently get comments on it and</li>
            <li> During a visit she mentioned how much she loved it and was unhappy</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in seeing that, but other wise happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty scent but is not long lasting.  </li>
            <li> One of the flowers on the bottle top was broken and looked like it was glued back together with a hot gun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and it may not last a long time, but it&#x27;s a big bottle and that WILL last a long time.;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This scent is soft and very subtle, which most all men seem to appreciate.</li>
            <li> The scent barely lasted a half-a-day.  </li>
            <li> I usually go for fruity or sweet smells but this floral smell attracted me.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy for summer, but bold enough to wear in winter,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> SShe wears it exclusively and now wants the other items (i.e., lotion, bath gels etc.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, so I went through the bottle faster than normal reapplying.</li>
            <li> Not real compared it to my real bottle the scent s off and want keep long.</li>
            <li> This perfume usually retails for at least 20-30.00 more in the department stores.</li>
            <li> I have received compliments on it, but the reason I rated it 4 stars was because the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on long and people have to actually lean in close and intentionally sniff me to smell it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt last as long as I hoped for</li>
            <li> not thrilled by the bottle, but i&#x27;m not a bottle fanatic, i care more about the fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted it for a long time</li>
            <li> Unlike other parfumes that are discernible not only to yourself but others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However,what I did not expect from such a high end name was poor staying power.</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable, considering I paid $100 dollars for it as a birthday present for my mom last year.</li>
            <li> Very different smell to it, more musky instead of fruity, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pink guava, mandarin.&lt;br /&gt;Mid</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a delicate and womanly scent.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about buying perfume off the internet due to \\&quot;knock-offs\\&quot; and the inability to view the product in person before buying, but I went for it.</li>
            <li> so when I saw it online for slightly cheaper</li>
            <li> If this was a mistake it was very sloppy, if it wasn&#x27;t it was very sleazy.</li>
            <li> You will wither love it or hate it  -- it is a bit juvenile and tacky for my taste.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that it either doesn&#x27;t last long or I can&#x27;t smell it after a while.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a bubblegum little girl smell.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of fragrances; I want a scent that gives me the \\&quot;AH HA!\\&quot; feeling everyday.</li>
            <li> I like musky and floral scents, but I am put off when they are too sweet/sugary, or too heavy in one note.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to reapply a few time throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and just too much trouble to pack up and return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for a few years now</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday to school</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance that can be worn year round...</li>
            <li> the pivot was misplaced so I had to fix it, but aside from that it was what I wanted</li>
            <li> And I paid half the price I would have paid at the department store!</li>
            <li> This is not a strong smell.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is how long the fragrance lasts.</li>
            <li> so that is one small issue.</li>
            <li> If I chose a stronger fragrance, such as Angel by Thiery Mugler, I can smell that at least an hour after I&#x27;ve sprayed, though it is faint.</li>
            <li> to locate (Some Sephora locations no longer carry it so it may be hard to find a sample)</li>
            <li> It seems to stay on for a while, but then it fades away and stays subtle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, not an &amp;</li>
            <li> a really expensive body spray.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch this time or if this was a knock off.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I hate that Vera Wang discontinued this fragrance!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The bottle is unbelievably beautiful. It&#x27;s a work of art that smells wonderful.  I bought it as a gift but now I&#x27;ll have to buy another for myself.  Expecially,  since the price is so adorable.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Great price and packaged well</li>
            <li> This fragrance is so romantic!  Not to mention the bottle is so beautiful as well.  The ribbon adds just a touch of whimsy.  You can leave it out, instead of putting it away.</li>
            <li> great price and smells wonderful.  I love this fragrance</li>
            <li> Returned original 1oz purchase from Sams Club @ same price as  this 3oz purchase in a sealed box. What an AWESOME deal!! Very satisfied and quick shipping!!</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet and floral scent. It seems to stay on for a while, but then it fades away and stays subtle. This is a perfect gift for young girls,teenagers,or a woman who loves sweets. I have received compliments on it, but the reason I rated it 4 stars was because the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on long and people have to actually lean in close and intentionally sniff me to smell it.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my girlfriend because she couldn&#x27;t find it in any store and I was lucky to find it here and she loved it. shipping was fast and pricing was good too!!!</li>
            <li> Soft and light as I wanted. Smells great.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume and this is a great value for the large bottle. I use it every day. Yea.</li>
            <li> I first discovered in department store and took a sample home and my daughter loved it.  Purchased for my daughter from amazon once before and then for myself.  It&#x27;s a great scent and I have to agree it doesn&#x27;t last like some others but I still get lots of compliments when I wear it. I&#x27;m sold on purchasing from amazon because it is so much cheaper than department store prices.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a really good friend of mine, and she loved it... totally satisfied were her remarks, strongly recommend it for considering customers.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my perfume. I bout this one because I wanted a fragrance to wear year around! I have definitely found it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and I would love to order it again.</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant to purchase this perfume after so many people said the scent did not last. Every time I have used it the scent has lasted almost all day! It was definitely worth it, especially for the price it was at.</li>
            <li> very musky but sweet, some say even on the masculine side, but I kinda like that it&#x27;s strong.&lt;br /&gt;Big ass topper, be careful when you open it as I&#x27;ve heard some say they broke the top when trying to open it.&lt;br /&gt;But you know, VW&#x27;s line traditionally markets towards weddings or young women (hence the princess line).&lt;br /&gt;Has pretty good lasting power, I wouldn&#x27;t say all day, but probably a good 6-8 hours (on me anyway).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not thrilled by the bottle, but i&#x27;m not a bottle fanatic, i care more about the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;this is really an any age kinda scent, wouldn&#x27;t recommend for under age of 22 probably.&lt;br /&gt;Could be a day or night scent, it&#x27;s pretty universal that way, I think.</li>
            <li> I adore this scent. I have been searching for the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of fragrances; I want a scent that gives me the \\&quot;AH HA!\\&quot; feeling everyday. I feel like Lovestruck is the closest I have come! I like musky and floral scents, but I am put off when they are too sweet/sugary, or too heavy in one note. I love the smell of roses but I don&#x27;t want to be dominated by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found out about Lovestruck in a magazine ad, of all places. I went to the store and purchased a roller ball. I was in love! It was about 95% of what I was looking for! It is light and feminine, but it is still sophisticated. It blends all of the notes together without having an one scent taking over. The notes have been described:&lt;br /&gt;Top notes: Pink guava, mandarin.&lt;br /&gt;Mid notes: tuberose, lotus blossom.&lt;br /&gt;Base notes: precious woods, sheer musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a delicate and womanly scent. It is light enough for daily wear, but it is bold enough to turn heads at night. It is light enough for spring, but sophisticated enough for fall and winter. I love it! It is everything you&#x27;d expect with the name \\&quot;Vera Wang.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,what I did not expect from such a high end name was poor staying power. I spritz this on fairly liberally and I feel like I&#x27;m not wearing anything in about 20 minuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to be fair, I&#x27;m sure someone else may smell the scent. I realize that I will become desensitized after a short time. THat being said, I feel like I can&#x27;t smell this at all after about 15-20 minutes. If I chose a stronger fragrance, such as Angel by Thiery Mugler, I can smell that at least an hour after I&#x27;ve sprayed, though it is faint. I can&#x27;t detect Lovestruck at ALL! I recommend getting the large spritzer for this reason. You&#x27;ll want to reapply a few time throughout the day. Also, there is a lotion and bodywash set. That may help the staying power. I have the lotion but I don&#x27;t use it. My thoughts are speaking towards the spray longevity specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;Other than the staying power, I ADORE this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced (Often on sale online or on Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;Great for day/night&lt;br /&gt;Works for any season&lt;br /&gt;Sophisticated and feminine&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Spray doesn&#x27;t last&lt;br /&gt;Expensive when full priced&lt;br /&gt;Hard to locate (Some Sephora locations no longer carry it so it may be hard to find a sample)</li>
            <li> Smells great. Very light scent though. I also own the lotion which is much stronger and lasts for days on my clothes.</li>
            <li> It smelt like strawberries not the smell I was going for. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Love Struck by Vera Wang.  I get compliments all the time.  I don&#x27;t know if it is just me; but the wonderful scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day;  but I just reapply. :)  I love it that much.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and I love the perfume.  It has a sweet smell and I have gotten several compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased as a gift for my daughter and she is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Anything by Vera Wang is lovely. I love the deals I find on Amazon, as I purcahsed this 3.4 oz bottle for $35.00. It would still cost you upward $70 in department stores. The scent is lasting but not overpowering,.</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s the real deal.  I know sometimes you end up with a counterfeit, but this one seems legit.  Smells Great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my god daughter many years ago.  During a visit she mentioned how much she loved it and was unhappy she did not&lt;br /&gt;have any of this product left.  So, we got on Amazon, ordered and she is happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always nervous about buying perfume online HOWEVER, This is my favorite. I&#x27;ve wanted it for a long time and I couldn&#x27;t justify the price in the store so when I saw it online for slightly cheaper I jumped on the deal. I think the seller gave me a great bottle. It looks authentic, and smells exactly like it did in the store!, The scent lasts on a long time on me and it&#x27;s a great subtle, sweet, floral smell. It&#x27;s romantic. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it and I&#x27;m so glad I finally purchased it. The bottle was nicely secure in its package and it did come in time with prime shipping. I would purchase again and I recommend the seller!</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this fragrance.  The scent barely lasted a half-a-day.  I returned it and decide to spend a little more for the authentic parfum spray.  I&#x27;m a fan of Vera Wang&#x27;s fragrance and I can assure you this is not the real thing!</li>
            <li> I love how this perfume smells and it was the price that I paid at the mall for the smallest bottle.</li>
            <li> Vera Wang fragrances are my favorite and this is no exception.  The scent is light and refreshing and I love this parfum.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent eau de parfum,more concentrated than eau de toilet.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  My daughter loves it too.  Sweet smelling but not too strong or overpowering.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne. Not to loud and just a pleasant scent!!!</li>
            <li> This product was not delivered as shown. The perfume was delivered in a box set including the body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;At the time of ordering all indications were that I was just buying perfume. An offer was presented on your site for a discounted body lotion since I was buying the perfume. So I added the individual body lotion to my order. When I received the boxes I saw that I I got perfume and lotion in one box and another lotion of the same size in another box. So I had paid $33 for perfume and lotion and another $21 just for the &amp;#34;discounted&amp;#34; lotion (not a discount when it was basically free with the perfume)! Very deceptive sales tactics.This was a Christmas gift and just too much trouble to pack up and return. I believe that you count on most customers not wanting to bother with returns. If this was a mistake it was very sloppy, if it wasn&#x27;t it was very sleazy.</li>
            <li> I noticed on a gal I work with and loved it.  I have worn the same perfume for 45 years.....this is the only fragrance in that time that appealed enough for me to want it.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This perfum arrived on time. The price is really good, considering that it is a Vera Wang fragrance. I&#x27;m so happy with this, even though I did not use yet, but I will soon.</li>
            <li> I love most of Vera Wang&#x27;s scents. Her clothes/sleepwear is nice as well. This scent is soft and very subtle, which most all men seem to appreciate. It starts with spicy, oriental notes and then finishes with a mandarin note, but not strong in the citrus area, more fruit. It&#x27;s not what I would call &#x27;sweet&#x27; so it&#x27;s not a bubblegum little girl smell. It isn&#x27;t strong and it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would expect an eau de &#x27;parfum&#x27; so that is one small issue. That&#x27;s ok, even when it&#x27;s mostly dissipated from my body, it lingers on the clothes all day. I&#x27;m not hard to please. I&#x27;m satisfied with the product and it may not last a long time, but it&#x27;s a big bottle and that WILL last a long time.;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, Great price, Very Subtle</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, wish the smell lasted longer on my skin though.</li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorite perfumes! It smells delicious, not too flowery or musky. It&#x27;s a young scent, not &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfume. It doesnt last as long as I hoped for but when I have it on I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrists. The bottle is beautiful and heavy. Amazon shipped it super fast I think I got it in two days. The price is unbelievable, considering I paid $100 dollars for it as a birthday present for my mom last year. All in all, this is a scent every woman wil love, young or old.</li>
            <li> THHIS PERFUME IS LONG LASTING, A GREAT SMELL, AND NOT OVERPOWERING! I LOVE IT!!! WILL BUY IT AGAIN FOR SURE!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase. I love this perfume and got it for half the price I would pay in the stores!</li>
            <li> I hate that Vera Wang discontinued this fragrance!  But, I am so glad Amazon had it!  I&#x27;ve ordered twice now and I hope they keep supplying it.  I receive so many compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for a few years now and I absolutely love it.  To me this is a versatile scent that true to its name, smells incredibly romantic and feminine.  I love that although it is a floral fragrance it still smells modern rather than like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.  I frequently get comments on it and although I sample other perfumes from time to time, none seem as unique and continually pleasing as this one.  It&#x27;s become my signature scent and I absolutely love it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> just received my perfume today. shipping was very fast. I love love love the way this smells, and the price is more than reasonable. This perfume usually retails for at least 20-30.00 more in the department stores. So this is a good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING! Great price and fast shipping. I will be re-ordering from this seller when I run out. I love love love this scent!</li>
            <li> this is one of the best perfumes I had bought and was a present for my wife she loved thank you seller</li>
            <li> Upon sampling this scent, I decided to purchase the 3.4 ounce bottle. I originally loved the scent, but after a while, the scent started to change. It&#x27;s very very warm, but not in a vanilla sense. It&#x27;s almost woodsy in a way, a sweet woodsy smell, perhaps cedar or something like that. It&#x27;s got great packaging, and the bottle is very sturdy. I&#x27;ve had several nice comments on the scent, mostly in the cooler months of the year. I wouldn&#x27;t classify this as a summer fragrance, and will probably only wear it in the winter or fall.</li>
            <li> Nice gift for my daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this perfume before and it seemed to smell much better the first time. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch this time or if this was a knock off. I don&#x27;t like it at all. Reminds me of my grandmas perfume. Again I really liked the original bottle but not sure if the one I got here was &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> very feminine and soft&lt;br /&gt;not to heavy or to light, is a perfect scent for everyday&lt;br /&gt;i will certainly buy more</li>
            <li> Smells chip not the real deal, be carefull is not the real perfume. My mom had to give the perfume away, a lost of money.</li>
            <li> Great product, only problem is the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. It is a great bargain for the price and it arrived in the original packaging.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this sent!</li>
            <li> The item is lovely, beautifully packaged and make a wonderful gift.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the tuberose scent, lovely indeed.  Already bought two of them.</li>
            <li> I wanted this perfume for about 3 months now, and found it much cheaper here on Amazon. I was a little nervous about buying perfume off the internet due to \\&quot;knock-offs\\&quot; and the inability to view the product in person before buying, but I went for it. Shipping was right around the time it had stated and I was very happy upon delivery. I will definitely buy perfume from the internet again, especially from Amazon and this seller. The perfume itself is beautiful, my boyfriend absolutely loves it, as well as my co-workers. The only bad thing is how long the fragrance lasts. I say it gives off its scent nicely for a couple hours and then starts to fade, but as do a lot of perfumes. I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even received this yet I must give it 5 stars. Honestly, it&#x27;s because it was the only parfum purchased that my wife actually liked. I can&#x27;t say too much about the others that I bought for her. Let&#x27;s just say she saved face because I bought it. Lol. Oh the wonders of marriage. :-)</li>
            <li> I orderd this perfum for te first time and am in love with it. Smell great and soft goes. The best fo all is that I put in the morning bwhen go to work and the smell stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetely recomend this to people that don&#x27;t like strong essences.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty scent but is not long lasting.  Good thing the lotion was included.  I do like it enough to order again.</li>
            <li> I love it! This is not a strong smell. Subtle and delicious! And I paid half the price I would have paid at the department store!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really nice - for about 5 minutes.  After that, I can&#x27;t even smell it on myself, even if I put on a lot.  To be fair, it is an eau de parfum, which is weaker than an eau de toilette or perfume.  The lasting power is similar to a body spray....a really expensive body spray.  I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she loves it and so do I.  This is a very feminine sweet scent for a girly girl.  This price is fabulous too!</li>
            <li> They quit making the perfume I used to wear.  Now I&#x27;m happy they did.  I never would have tried this one if they hadn&#x27;t.  Light vanilla undertones make this great for day and night.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t a strong perfume, it&#x27;s a lil sweet and very different from most perfumes but I love it for everyday wear or daytime wear!</li>
            <li> this perfume is one of my favourites! it smells so good,its a must for every lady</li>
            <li> great scent. However, it only lasts about a couple hrs and you have to reapply again. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m probably going to find a longer lasting scent. It came quickly in the mail...no problem what so ever.</li>
            <li> It is so good!!!!!  It smells so good!  I wear it everyday to school and I&#x27;m in LOVE WITH LOVESTRUCK!!!!!  So worth it and its just amazing!!  BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Tested this out many times before buying. It is a very light and lovely fragrance, read the decription ... Itis absiolutely on the mark.  This is a fragrance that can be worn year round... Not too heavy for summer, but bold enough to wear in winter,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two gripes,,, lasting power is on the short side. After maybe five hours it is gone. And the bottle... You will wither love it or hate it  -- it is a bit juvenile and tacky for my taste.</li>
            <li> Product came in box like store.  I have not used, since it was a gift for daughter.</li>
            <li> my fave scent. Lingers for days, and is great for both winter and spring. I get tons of compliments when i wear it.</li>
            <li> So the perfume came on time but not in one piece. One of the flowers on the bottle top was broken and looked like it was glued back together with a hot gun. I was very disappointed in seeing that, but other wise happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this. The bottle was even bigger than I thought it was gonna be! I recommend this one to anyone!</li>
            <li> My Daughter uses this and bought this bottle for her friend&#x27;s birthday...It was much appreciated..I would certainly reccomend this Eau De Parfum for any young lady...</li>
            <li> It just reminds me of a sexy, floral, romantic scent. A good buy for a Woman you love. I personally bought it to treat myself. And am very glad i did. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This perfume has a nice floral scent. I was worried that it might be too powerful but it&#x27;s not. I usually go for fruity or sweet smells but this floral smell attracted me. My sister and best friend also enjoy this perfume.</li>
            <li> I simply love this scent!  The bottle can best be described as a little over the top but, It&#x27;s a great scent and is perfect for every day use. Sweet, sophistication.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter. Her favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Love this scent &amp;#60;3 lasts all day and smells amazing! Has a sweet but light floral scent.. perfect for me</li>
            <li> Not real compared it to my real bottle the scent s off and want keep long. Would Not recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Honestly, this particular Parfum Spray does not even last for a second. I could not smell it on myself and neither can my husband. Does nothing and literally the scent is invisible :) Unlike other parfumes that are discernible not only to yourself but others. It&#x27;s like spraying water on yourself.</li>
            <li> She picked out two or three scents, and this was my fovorite. I&#x27;ll get her the big bottle next time</li>
            <li> I ordered this parfum for my best friend for christmas.  It smells really good, I will order another for myself.  The delivery was really fast,  really impressed.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is moms favorite perfume, she gets so many compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Just the pivot was misplaced so I had to fix it, but aside from that it was what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this, the first I bought at a department store for full price. I was extremely happy that the scent was the same. The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, so I went through the bottle faster than normal reapplying. Overall i&#x27;m satisfied with the product and in my opinion its worth what I spent on Amazon ($35ish)</li>
            <li> Just received this perfume today. I was a bit nervous, since I never smelled the scent before placing the order. Glad I made that decision to purchase! I am a HUGE fan of perfumes &amp; I&#x27;m pretty picky. This fragrance is gorgeous...no complaints :) I also love the bottle. Its pretty on my vanity.</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells good but it  does not last long.  I have to reapply during the day. I will not re-purchase this one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for myself after trying it once in a store. This was, by far, the best deal I could have gotten on this perfume. You not only get the 3.4 oz perfume, but you also get a large container of lotion which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, I have received several compliments while wearing this perfume. It also last more than one hour like most perfumes.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. It is light, floral and romantic. I wish it would last longer but it is still a great perfume.</li>
            <li> The girls love it, very unique, very nice aroma, not overbearing, small dab goes a long way, a winner here!</li>
            <li> This is lovely perfume in a beautiful bottle. The price I paid was an outstanding deal, I got the large bottle for else than the smaller bottle price in a department store, it was shipped promptly and securely.</li>
            <li> This product didnt seem to have the same smell it had when I tested it in the mall. Very different smell to it, more musky instead of fruity, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter requested this fragrance for Christmas.  SShe was delighted to recieve.  SShe wears it exclusively and now wants the other items (i.e., lotion, bath gels etc. if available)</li>
            <li> Great buy!! :-) The Purdue is a lot cheaper on amazon!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my granddaughter. She loves it. Great scent</li>
            <li> Smells so great that I actually wanted to sleep with my wife.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my order. It also arrived fast</li>
            <li> This is a exquisite parfume and I love how it releases as it flows with ones every move.....</li>
            <li> I was VERY HAPPY to find this size (3.4 ounce) eau de parfum at such a great price.  My daughter loves her Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this and loved it so much that I HAD to buy it.  It&#x27;s subtle, not an &amp;#34;in your face&amp;#34; kind of fragrance.  The only bad thing is that it either doesn&#x27;t last long or I can&#x27;t smell it after a while.  Either way, I don&#x27;t care.  I love it!  I got a fantastic price on it here at Amazon.  As usual, Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> The perfume is so amazing I love it it smells amazing just like all of Vera wants products great great</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Sweet and sexy, but not sugar-y sweet.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  Too my surprise it even came with the lotion.  The box is also really nice.</li>
