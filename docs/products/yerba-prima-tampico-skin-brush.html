            <li>but I will say that it feels really good</li>

            <li>bath gloves that I like better.  </li>
            <li>I really love how it comes apart and can be used with or without the handle.</li>
            <li>the brush tends to fall off where it inserts into the elongator, but I do love the brush itself.</li>
            <li>I love to use it to help remove cellulite spots.</li>
            <li>love it love it, feel refreshed after using this.</li>
            <li>also find the stick component more of an inconvenience than anything.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s made appropriately for what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>I feel so much physically better after brushing with this brush.</li>
            <li>I Love It.</li>
            <li>Love this skin brush, followed by sesame oil and a shower</li>
            <li>I it use without the handle for most scrubbing, and insert the handle for as needed.</li>
            <li>so it felt better on the skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful as a back scratcher too!!  </li>
            <li>I love using this weekly.</li>
            <li>love this brush.  </li>
            <li>It also is wonderful for circulation, and I love my daily ritual with it.</li>
            <li>love love love body brushing</li>
            <li>It has much more effect in stimulating and exfoliating the skin when used that way, and I like it even better.</li>
            <li>MEN, if you have a bald head or very short hair these are the best hair brushes in the world.</li>
            <li>I love that the handle detaches, I can pack just the brush portion if I want to travel with it.</li>
            <li>Thank for the business ! :)</li>
            <li>Just OK.  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li>Okay .... if you are one of those who came looking for this product after listening to Food Babe&#x27;s you tube video BEWARE.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it again.</li>
            <li>Love my brush.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist turned me onto a glycolic body wash, which I like better as an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten used to the brush for the most part.</li>
            <li>It really helps to use it right before you self tan so that your application comes out flawless.</li>
            <li>Just the right stiffness for a good skin scrubbing without scratching.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush, I&#x27;ve never used a Tampico brush before, so it felt a bit rough at first, but once you get how to use it, it feels really great!</li>
            <li>This works really great particularly before self tanning.  </li>
            <li>Great brush, would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>And it is super appealing that it is made in the USA!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice skin brush - firm bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Great Service, quick shipping, awesome product...</li>
            <li>GREAT quality natural bristles for the price!!  </li>
            <li>She loved it so much she bought one for each of us kids!</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Since I got it, my body acne has been significantly reduced!</li>
            <li>I am new to body brushing but have found it to be a great experience.</li>
            <li>Excellent  brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>You should use it on dry skin just before having a shower for best results.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry brushing</li>
            <li>Perfect brush for dry skin brushing.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry body brushing.</li>
            <li>dry brushing your skin is the best feeling--</li>
            <li>perfect for dry brushing</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product that we will enjoy..</li>
            <li>Great, great product, especially for the reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Excellent dry brush!</li>
            <li>My husband likes this brush, it is a good quality and large head</li>
            <li>Always brush away from Center for best and noticeable results</li>
            <li>so a light brushing is perfectly okay.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, natural bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>Have bought others that have fallen appart ,this one is of good quality &amp; does a good job for dry brushing,does not scratch the skin.</li>
            <li>But once your skin is use to the toughness of the bristles, its easy sailing.</li>
            <li>say the brush gets mouldy easily when they use it in the shower-</li>
            <li>The brush is separate from the handle but they attach so you can easily hold the brush head or attach the handle for a longer reach.</li>
            <li>I feel really clean when I take the time to cover most of my skin.</li>
            <li>As I use it brushing up toward my heart for an improved circulation bonus, the handle is superfluous but it removes easily.  </li>
            <li>I like that the handle is removable which makes it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>so it slides in until stuck, but easily comes out.</li>
            <li>The handle comes off the head easily, it just operates on a type of wedge/groove system to fasten the handle to the head while remaining removable.</li>
            <li>Better than a back scratcher and a great wake-me-up each morning.  </li>
            <li>Bristles do not fall out or break off easily.  </li>
            <li>Great back brush or bottom of feet.......used them many years.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and assemble.</li>
            <li>No instructions on putting the brush onto the handle but easy to figure out paying close attention to the shapes.</li>
            <li>ALSO, SHIPPING WAS VERY QUICK</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>the bristles come off easily.</li>
            <li>The brush comes off the handle too easily.</li>
            <li>I also like that the handle is removable, but it doesn&#x27;t fall off too easily.</li>
            <li>This is not an easy to use product.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It does feel good and makes your skin so soft &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li>Good brush, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice, the delivery was very fast</li>
            <li>The detachable handle is were its at, super easy to use without dealing with the goofy handle in the way</li>
            <li>I actually really love skin brushing now, and have seen results pretty immediately; I don&#x27;t go a day without it now and am so glad I got this brush.</li>
            <li>(Like all super enjoyable things, moderation is recommended.)</li>
            <li>Awesome product- bristles are stiff yet easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>This brush is great,  I love it for dry brushing!</li>
            <li>This brush has a great handle and is good for reaching those hard to get places.</li>
            <li>When I brush my face gently I find that my Clarisonic works much smoother as well, great bonus there.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brush that I have purchased thus far.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for 2 mos and can tell a huge difference in my skintone and energy level.</li>
            <li>This has made a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It stimulates my skin and is going to be perfect for winter to slough off those dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC PURCHASE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have been using this brush for 3 days now, and it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>I literally see the cellulite become smooth.</li>
            <li>Start off using light pressure and increase as your skin adjusts to it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth after brushing.</li>
            <li>I can see the dead skin falling off, its awesome!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and the removable handle is easy/awesome.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy using</li>
            <li>It does not seem to fit into the brush and falls off.  </li>
            <li>Fast and effective results.</li>
            <li>What I do not like is the cheap design of the handle.</li>
            <li>The Yerba Prima Tampico Skin Brush has been a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic item.</li>
            <li>and of course, it feels great scratching my back with it.</li>
            <li>Recently I&#x27;ve discovered something else they are great for.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the brush and the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy they still make it and make it of the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its a great product, simple and efficient.</li>
            <li>Works great for back and feet.</li>
            <li>Skin so soft and bright.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this brush for about a week, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>It does feel like light scratching but as others have said, you will get used to it.</li>
            <li>Now my 9 year old has picked up ours and brushes herself with it before every shower so passing along good habits to my girls.</li>
            <li>Gently brushing my back felt especially wonderful.</li>
            <li>Good price for what it is, natural brush</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new brush.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to &amp;#34;install&amp;#34; the head in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for the best body brush and this is it.  </li>
            <li>It does the job pretty well - I just have to use very light pressure</li>
            <li>Easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>When this came in, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Particularly if you have dry skin, this brush is perfect before a shower, just rub lightly all over.  </li>
            <li>Works great for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>/looks like it needs a clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(Best way to clean</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference immediately, my skin was much softer and more smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this brush for dry brushing and am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>However when I needed to clean the mold off I couldn&#x27;t get the head to come off.  </li>
            <li>They exfoliate the skin and you can use them like a bath buff to clean yourself.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to clean the brush periodically with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Sure, my skin feels amazingly soft and silky and I&#x27;m sure my lymphatic system is benefiting but trust me</li>
            <li>This is a great brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>Oh the joy of dry skin brushing every morning before a shower!  </li>
            <li>Great for dry brushing!</li>
            <li>its a great brush for dry brushing, it doesn&#x27;t leave hairs from the brush all over, lightweight and does the job well, love it and fast shipping from this seller...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to use it much but excited to see the results.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>- they&#x27;re just right!</li>
            <li>Works great for the reduction of the appearance of rough textured skin as well as improves the circulation, look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>Good for scrubbing the back when taking a shower.</li>
            <li>but it really does make your skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li>Good solid product for my husband.</li>
            <li>It feels so good on my back.  </li>
            <li>oh so good for a back rub.  </li>
            <li>I have used this very brush for years - keep buying more when I wear one out.  </li>
            <li>It feels so good.. now and later.</li>
            <li>WIFE LOVE PRODUCT MUCH</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush, VERY firm, but does a good job.</li>
            <li>I love dry brushing and this brush is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth when I use it right before</li>
            <li>It was pretty easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this particular product and I would certainly buy two of them because it makes a great gift.</li>
            <li>The Yerba Prima Skin brush was a totally new experience for me,but being on a health trip and wanting to ensure my lymphatic system is in top shape, and after numerous good reviews, I purchased 3 brushes.</li>
            <li>Shipped really quickly.</li>
            <li>so the quick circulation is a benefit for my body ..</li>
            <li>This brush is super sturdy, dries really quickly after washing and has a detachable handle.</li>
            <li>(either they have softened already or my skin has adjusted quickly).  </li>
            <li>but the sting quickly dissipates so</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need a swiffer or something because this thing is worth it and really makes you feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li>quickly  molded and split and had to throw it out</li>
            <li>The brush arrived quickly but with out a handle.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Iv use most expensive brushes that haven&#x27;t been halfway as good as this one , 5 stars !!!</li>
            <li>If you used with light strokes, it is effective enough.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>I usually brush myself before shower, and the effect is very good.</li>
            <li>I love to use it right before a spray tan and at the very end of a spray tan to get rid of any of the spots.</li>
            <li>used it several times, very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>My skin has become more soft, am sure it is helping in all the things it claims but my skin is so much healthy.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to go light handed at first until bristles soften up a bit with use.&lt;br /&gt;Great for hands and feet from the get.</li>
            <li>It leaves red scratches all over (with very light brushing!).  </li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, it touched my body and bristles fell out.</li>
            <li>my new favorite.</li>
            <li>These are strong bristles but do soften a bit over time but no too much</li>
            <li>The length of the handle makes it easy to reach the whole body.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and care for product that gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read about how dry brushing is supposed to be so good for the lymph system, etc.</li>
            <li>Dry brushing is good for the skin and the lymph nodes.  </li>
            <li>This brush has very stiff bristles, and it&#x27;s very good for exfoliating skin.</li>
            <li>With consistent use, my skin issues have resolved!</li>
            <li>Enjoying it thus far!</li>
            <li>They definitely exfoliate that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>but I almost skinned myself the first time I used it -ha,ha!</li>
            <li>Prefer using this than a back scratcher for sure!</li>
            <li>, it was exactly what I was hoping for and I am excited to add this treatment to my beauty routine</li>
            <li>I have done many cleanses over the years, and many of them recommend dry skin brushing as it helps with the lymph flow.</li>
            <li>I love dry brushing and love this brush and the removable handle.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much, and agree with other reviewers that it smooths skin and leaves a very nice tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>I still prefer it over having no handle at all, but it would be nice if it was a little more</li>
            <li>in my opinion, they are perfect, but I know everyone is different, so if they&#x27;re too hard for you, dont worry as they will soften the more you use</li>
            <li>Works great to exfoliated dead skin.</li>
            <li>AND THIS BRUSH IS GOING TO MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR A FEW PEOPLE ON MY LIST THIS YEAR.</li>
            <li>Once the bristles soften up after a few uses, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This being said, those with more sensitive skin may be required to soften the bristles if outer dermal layer irritation becomes an issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will leave your skin so soft I have bought so many of these.</li>
            <li>Overall nice product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s an economical AND environmentally frienldy option.  </li>
            <li>Rarely use now and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still worth keeping.  </li>
            <li>Handle is kind of short.</li>
            <li>What I love about this brush is that it feels so natural.  </li>
            <li>It is coarse but not too rough and does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>Find a more durable alternative if you&#x27;re going to use this brush near water.</li>
            <li>i personally don&#x27;t have to use the handle, but it&#x27;s nice to have an option.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Very glad I chose this one with a long handle.</li>
            <li>The bristles rarely fall out.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely piece, made of wood and natural fibers, so I like to have it out on display, in my bathroom&lt;</li>
            <li>It was just supposed to be my brush, but after seeing how good it felt, my whole family wants to use it (including my 2 year old).</li>
            <li>but then again I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a bath brush, and this item was near the top of that list.  </li>
            <li>It also makes your skin soft and smooth, which is an added benefit!</li>
            <li>Not too rough but gives a good scrub.  </li>
            <li>The handle easily comes on and off for high accessibility around the body.</li>
            <li>Ladies may find the brush a bit too stiff for their softer skin, but it&#x27;s great for men.</li>
            <li>Also, I am new to dry skin brushing, and this product is great for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Love the detachable handle, it makes dry brushing easy.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a dry body brush for awhile now and searched for best dry body brushes online</li>
            <li>right before I shower.</li>
            <li>I have seen my body change right before my eyes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not seeing any of that right now.</li>
            <li>Bristles are just the right stiffness.  </li>
            <li>The bristles, for me, are just the right degree of firmness, and of course you can vary the pressure yourself in how you brush.</li>
            <li>It is bristles are just right to make your skin tingle.  </li>
            <li>Well made and just right for cleaning up our sauna.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush seem harsh at first, but my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the handle very easily separates from the head since it&#x27;s not glued together, the handles just fits into a slot.</li>
            <li>Is it becoming clear that I like this product?</li>
            <li>Nice and long with quality bristles</li>
            <li>It also helps remove dry skin which is also nice.</li>
            <li>I got this to scrub my back properly and it goes a great job.  </li>
            <li>That experience taught me to be super gentle while brushing my skin.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and stiff and feel scratchy on your skin even with light pressure.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality brush!</li>
            <li>I like this brush very much.</li>
            <li>Brushing does hurt a little, but I&#x27;m agree with the mindset &amp;#34;no pain, no gain.&amp;#34; Sometimes it even feels good hahaha!</li>
            <li>cannot speak to durability yet, am still on my first month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>First one I ordered had no handle.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Way better than those sponge type back cleaners.  </li>
            <li>The first 2 times using it</li>
            <li>First time I had to wash the brush and use it in the shower to soften the bristles but after that I use it every day, I use it before the shower and inside while showering.</li>
            <li>It definitely feels better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>They can make the bristles dense and shorter and use the same amount for a better product.</li>
            <li>I have two of these, because I thought I lost the first one and ordered another.</li>
            <li>my skin is so smooth and clear, because of how fast it eliminates toxins now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>I tried running the brush under hot water and then drying it out, but that didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li>so it is a bit of a surprise at first</li>
            <li>After the first time using it I got into the shower and my loofah literally glided across my skin instead of feeling like sandpaper like it has for years.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>I have never used a skin brush and after trying it the first time I was hooked.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST TIME I USED IT</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth already, I would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I love that this has a handle to get my back, but is removable to use on the rest of me.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty course and stuff</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Felt like the bristles were wore out after the first use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more practical to make it one solid piece and just hang on to the brush area if you don&#x27;t need the handle.</li>
            <li>It did smell funny when you first get it.</li>
            <li>I ran hot water over it for a bit and added soap and rinsed three times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it is my second one.</li>
            <li>ur skin will most likely burn when you get in the hot shower ....</li>
            <li>I love the brush and use it before a bath and will order again in the future.</li>
            <li>The body wash is more convenient and doesn&#x27;t require an extra step for me.</li>
            <li>Improve circulation, I body brush before working out (dry skin of course), because dry brushing gets the blood flowing and is a good pre-warmup!</li>
            <li>The nice long handle makes it easy to reach all areas of your back.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and its a bit irritating in certain spots, but for the most part it does a great job.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and the brush is just right.  </li>
            <li>This really is a must have right before summer to prep your skin for swimsuit season.</li>
            <li>This brush is quite stiff, good for feet and calves.</li>
            <li>Good stiff bristles and the handle can be removed if you just want to use the brush by itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only a newbie thus far, so I have yet to see results, but in the meantime, it is making my skin a lot smoother and more supple!</li>
            <li>and I start my day with more energy, mental clarity, and calm.</li>
            <li>Seriously these feel great on the head and neck.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are the perfect texture for dry brushing-not too rough or too soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough to use just the bar alone and covers a good amount of skin.</li>
            <li>The top of the brush will fall off if not secure tightly otherwise a great brush.</li>
            <li>Good stiff bristled brush that really makes you feel cleaner when you use it.</li>
            <li>This is my first dry brush, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Great for dry brushing - the bristles are good for clearing dead skin but not too rough.</li>
            <li>I admit i don&#x27;t have much to compare it to because this is my first brush</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much shedding from the bristles, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s pretty well built.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this for a few months now and am very pleased with the quality given the affordability.</li>
            <li>The brush is very abrasive and the handle broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Not sure what all the good reviews are about.</li>
            <li>I like this brush, but you need to use a very light touch or it can be pretty rough on your skin.</li>
            <li>(my lymphatic system is now 20 years younger and my kidneys have never looked better!), but it does help with dry skin and a gives a quick morning charge.</li>
            <li>Well maybe it got a bit softer over time which is good because some may think of it as &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; at first, especially if used dry.  </li>
            <li>I love dry brushing every morning, it makes me feel energized and helps exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put back on</li>
            <li>My body absorbs the body oil I use on my body after showering better-- which results to making the dry scales on my skin disappear.  </li>
            <li>Went ahead and used the brush as-is in the shower and made sure to leave it somewhere to fully dry afterwards.  </li>
            <li>so glad I learned about dry brushing</li>
            <li>I love brushing off the dry skin while in the shower.</li>
            <li>any my digestions seems to be better after incorporating dry brushing.</li>
            <li>Love dry brushing.</li>
            <li>I use this for dry brushing and have been satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good firm, but not hard, brush</li>
            <li>This feels great for both wet and dry?  </li>
            <li>Great for wet or dry brushing.</li>
            <li>Very high quality</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels after using this brush for the first time!</li>
            <li>Nice little string attached for hanging up.</li>
            <li>a bit scratchy takes some getting used to but good purchase for the money..wish it had a loop to hang it as hard to store in bathroom..</li>
            <li>Brush &amp; handle is very well made</li>
            <li>I really like how my skin feels after a shower.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it much because this.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush</li>
            <li>I can really feel my circulation being boosted.</li>
            <li>Try brushing a bit lighter, although skin redness is a sign of the circulation being boosted, so dont worry too much about it.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a much softer brush for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much stiffness, but the brushes don&#x27;t scratch too much</li>
            <li>Look into the sunflower oil, it&#x27;s an absolute must-have.  </li>
            <li>it is very stable.  </li>
            <li>they are fantastic and simple.</li>
            <li>I never relaized what skin brushing could really do the body.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing to use; brush away your agitation and grumpiness.</li>
            <li>be gentle...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>It looks so much healthier</li>
            <li>I really expected better from the company.</li>

            <li>Handle is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>it really is invigorating.</li>
            <li>I was being gentle too.</li>
            <li>really exfoliates the skin</li>
            <li>Will leave you feeling refreshed and ready for the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be, but need to be gentle.</li>
            <li>Very well made and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>really wakes me up in the morning using this durable yet gentle brush.</li>
            <li>Didnt notice much of a difference until i got the detox body wraps...</li>
            <li>My skin is ever so much improved.</li>
            <li>really easily&lt;br /&gt;Comes</li>
            <li>The back of the brush has a groove where the handle is supposed to fit into so you can attach and detach depending on your needs.</li>
            <li>I have found a way to make it stay, but it took me many tries.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS PACKAGED VERY PROTECTIVELY.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>This item was very well-described</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very relaxing for me.</li>
            <li>Really liking this brush.</li>
            <li>and my skin appears so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>really noticed a difference yet, after three weeks.</li>
            <li>It is really relaxing.</li>
            <li>I really like this skin brush.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t say I see much of a difference</li>
            <li>I used it once and my lymph nodes in my neck got really swollen and almost sore to touch.</li>
            <li>Satisfied and as expected.</li>
            <li>The extender stick is really helpful, too.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like them.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle brush, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li>The brush had instructions and came well packaged and ready to use.</li>
            <li>but I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Also the handle does not stay on very well.</li>
            <li>We are just beginning to skin brush and have read much about the benefits.  </li>
            <li>and I think it works okay for men as they have much rough skin</li>
            <li>I was using too much pressure.</li>
            <li>but I am able to swipe across my arms and legs without being as careful.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush when i saw some youtube videos saying a bunch of nice stuff like remove dead skin cells, detox and lot of health benefits.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and firm for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are nice and firm.</li>
            <li>This thing will remove all your dead skin leaving you all nice</li>
            <li>Bristle are nice and firm very durable.</li>
            <li>Nice firm bristle brush.</li>
            <li>Nice and stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li>Nice stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li>The long handle makes it easy to do you feet and legs.</li>
            <li>The long handle makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a skin brush, maybe I&#x27;m too sensitive but the brush was just so rough, it was not an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a try, so I bought one at a local health food store and was so excited to find out it was made in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it lightly all over my body, right before I shower every other day.  </li>
            <li>Dry brushing with this brush (the handle stays on well, but removes easily as needed)</li>
            <li>I got this brush to help clean and scratch my back when in the tub or shower.  </li>
            <li>Thus is my first dry brush, it felt right, at first itime scared me..</li>
            <li>I expected them to be a little softer, but the more I used it, the more I like it.</li>
            <li>I am very new to the practice</li>
            <li>I think it is important and will make this a long term habit.</li>
            <li>use two brushes, one in each hand, removed from the sticks used to reach back areas, and brush the full body towards the heart to assist the lymph system in being cleansed.&lt;br /&gt;For myself and my clients...</li>
            <li>I chose to wash the brush in warm soapy water (using a small amount of dish soap) before using it.</li>
            <li>At first, my skin was so sensitive to it, I bled from the scratches</li>
            <li>That is why I put a little nail in the wall and hung it outside my shower because I think lymph brushing is a good thing to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great brush for those hard to reach spots on your back!</li>
            <li>Good quality but REALLY HARD bristles!  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic dry brush.</li>
            <li>main reason was to improve the tightness of my skin, and to reduce the cellulite.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that my skin looks, and feels healthier and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Decent for the price</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was worth the hassle of sending it back.</li>
            <li>Use as a &#x27;hand&#x27; brush or add the handle for a quick reach for your back.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel good, they are a little rough at first, but soften up well.</li>
            <li>First time skin brusher here, and it&#x27;s a little scratchy the first 2-3 days, but getting used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>It would highly recommenced this brush to others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is high quality and inexpensive</li>
            <li>High quality item.</li>
            <li>Feels nice if you don&#x27;t press hard.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find a good shower brush that really scrubs your back.  </li>
            <li>I do keep meaning to give it a few more chances, but keep forgetting.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a try when my body was normal and could take the roughness...</li>
            <li>Takes off the dead skin cells and is a great exfoliator, as long as you&#x27;re gentle enough using it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are sturdy but not too harsh, and you can take the paddle off the stick if you prefer a more manual approach.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so inexpensive, sending it back isn&#x27;t worth the time.  </li>
            <li>use it in the bathtub, as using it dry is a  bit rough, and I think that by softening my skin in the hot water, it works more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Most back brushes have fine, soft bristles that hardly do anything at all.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush and use it daily (dry) as part of a detox routine.  </li>
            <li>The handle is the right length to reach your back.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right stiffness for my upper legs and buttocks.  </li>
            <li>This one is just right and helps me with my daily skin brushing.</li>
            <li>The price was right, and several reviews also convinced me to buy this brush over one with synthetic bristles.  </li>
            <li>It is one of the few natural bristle brushes available at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have to be extra gentle when exfoliating certain areas of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as I am, just remember that it takes a bit for the body to get used to something new.  </li>
            <li>Maybe, it&#x27;s because the brush is new</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li>May be just because it&#x27;s new..</li>
            <li>BUT, has also made a tremendous difference in my (dry) skin.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are firm, as others have noted, but soften a little over time yet remain very effective.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised that something with this level of quality is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for four days, have found that my skin has improved very much and that even my facial acne has gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel like its very important to aid our body in detoxing because lymph only moves around if we stay active</li>
            <li>You will notice obvious difference after first use.</li>
            <li>It leaves scratches sometimes too (even using barely any pressure and being gentle)</li>
            <li>So far, I concur!</li>
            <li>In the future I will try purchasing one with a more solid handle and would recommend the same to others.</li>
            <li>and I have experienced a few breakouts and raw skin.</li>
            <li>Ok Brush...a bit tough at first.  </li>
            <li>This brush exfoliates and detox you from head to toe, making your skin glow because it encourages new skin and brushes off the old.      </li>
            <li>I really like this brush--it&#x27;s not too abrasive, and I really like that it has the long handle for making it easier to brush.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>If STRONGLY suggest you give the bristles a serious soak before using it for the first time, then again before each use.</li>
            <li>I have not used it fully as yet but just wanted to give feedback to address those saying its super rough.</li>
            <li>cause I am able to reach all down my back.</li>
            <li>Love the long handle which helps reach the middle of my back.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, soft bristles but sturdy enough to get rid of dead skin!</li>
            <li>Your skin will be free of that dead skin layer that bothers and hinders new healthier skin.</li>
            <li>Dry or wet, I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Tried it out and it works fine at helping to remove dead skin.</li>
            <li>Since they are an add on item, the last time I needed one I ddin&#x27;t have a large purchase to make from Amazon</li>
            <li>The bristle are a little to hard for me, but the service was great</li>
            <li>Wow ive used it just a few times and my skin is already super softer and shinier!</li>
            <li>Watch out, if you scrub too hard, you might scratch yourself :)  </li>
            <li>The brush is really hard, but your skin starts to love that after awhile.</li>
            <li>the dead skin on top of the blemishes can help to heal them faster and rejuvenate the skin-be gentle of course!I am planning on gifting these to new moms as well as other add-ons to birthday gifts.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it right of he box and scrubbed my arm raw on the first swipe.</li>
            <li>It took me a few times to get used to it, but now I thoroughly enjoy the sensation and how soft my skin feels after.</li>
            <li>Mature, sensitive skin can be a concern when looking for skin care products and this brush offers stimulation without irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a natural brush before but</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is just sensitive</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what it is supposed to feel like though, so this might be a personal problem.  </li>
            <li>You just feel so alive after brushing and hopping in shower.</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 3-4 months now.</li>
            <li>Recommended if you&#x27;re skin&#x27;s not deathly sensitive.</li>
            <li>This brush didn&#x27;t hurt, but wasn&#x27;t so soft that I couldn&#x27;t feel it either.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t figured out how to take the head apart from the handle yet, but it hasn&#x27;t really been necessary.</li>
            <li>Have yet to use it enough to really say if it makes a difference</li>
            <li>The entire family uses it and can really feel the increased circulation.</li>
            <li>I have one that&#x27;s near 20 years old</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remove the brush from the handle (mostly because I&#x27;m afraid I would be able to get it back on).  </li>
            <li>After just 4 gentle uses, the brush began to crack through the middle.</li>
            <li>and once I finish the skin brushing my skin is sooo soft.</li>
            <li>For those of you with sensitive skin, a lighter touch is require</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too soft or too course.</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble using this brush.</li>
            <li>It is soooo soft.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>and wow did I find it.</li>
            <li>I try to be soft, but it&#x27;s too scratchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to believe she&#x27;s absolutely getting money to endorse these products.</li>
            <li>not too soft buy</li>
            <li>When the bristles start getting soft, I replace it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not so soft that you feel like they&#x27;re doing nothing</li>
            <li>I have just begun using this (1 wk so far)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even kinda soft on your skin.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves how soft her skin is after use.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>Works really well, my skin tone has improved immensely.</li>
            <li>My skin is way too sensitive for the brush.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how smooth my skin was after just a few times in using it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest starting slowly, brushing in gentle circles and then gradually applying more pressure.  </li>
            <li>It hurts a little if done to hard or long but just brush lightly and u will love it too!</li>
            <li>Comfortable handle and stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li>At first it seems very stiff and scratchy however after several uses (lightly brushing) my skin became adjusted to the brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel nice and stiff but the handle is a little long and hard to get a good grip.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush to anyone interested in dry brushing</li>
            <li>This brush is my first dry brush</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but all my back acne is gone, and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>The handle is long enough to comfortably brush your back</li>
            <li>I know people like to buy natural products, but in this case, plastic wins hands down.</li>
            <li>..know they have to be somewhat firm to brush away top layer of dry skin but</li>
            <li>handle is long enough, but not too long to fit in the cabinet.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I was using an exfoliating scrub in the shower but now use this on occasion because its much cheaper in the long run than continually buying the scrubs.</li>
            <li>You just brush 2 minutes per day before showering and brush toward the heart (don&#x27;t brush the face) using long gentle strokes.</li>
            <li>No it is not soft and does not require much pressure.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>A bit rough at first</li>
            <li>but it seemed to be exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>It felt rough at first</li>
            <li>It feels rough at first</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what I expected and wanted.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Howevet, anything but a feather light touch scratches my skin, leaving little white marks.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic of dry brushing until I researched the topic and found this particular brush!</li>
            <li>What seems a simple and straightforward design is flawed by a cheap untreated softwood.  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves dry brushing.</li>
            <li>It really does get your circulation going and helps slough away dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped so much with dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my energy levels even though it seems like such a simple technique.</li>
            <li>The last brush I had was old and soft.</li>
            <li>Apparently, it does work!</li>
            <li>The bristles are firm enough to accomplish the task, but soft enough to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>If you are new to dry brushing or have sensitive skin, this is not the brush for you.</li>
            <li>Dry brushing is very new to me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this long handled brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so hard on my skin, no matter how light I brush it, it hurts.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are hard and somewhat scratchy, but I was expecting that when I purchased it, and you aren&#x27;t supposed to scrub your skin with it, just lightly brush it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend use BEFORE  vacuuming, &#x27;cause it really sluffs off the dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I have regular skin, not too sensitive but not rough.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the brush as an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; for around $6 I said &amp;#34;hey, why not?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It looks to be made really well and seems that it would last a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The bristles are sturdy, but not excessively rough.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a brush particularly for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li>I have used this once so far and has already  made  a  big difference in  my skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and I like the fack I can reach my back without straining.</li>
            <li>The bristles are much gentler wet.</li>
            <li>but the bristles are soft enough once they soak up a bit.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a brush to use in the bath or shower, do yourself a big favor and avoid all the brushes that have natural bristles.  </li>
            <li>Honestly dont waste your money, pointless and didnt make a difference.</li>
            <li>I would recommend replacing every few months, but for this price, it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>I use it as a dry skin brush and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The brush is very hard and hurt a little the first dozen times I used it, but it got better and my skin got used to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second and am planning to buy one for my Dad, who has recently become interested in dry brushing to assist on detox.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old lady with thin skin that bruises easily.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff enough to be effective, but not too stiff.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to dry brushing,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to dry brushing</li>
            <li>I am new to dry skin brushing.  </li>
            <li>I have tried using the new one dry instead of in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to dry brushing</li>
            <li>Be careful using this in more delicate areas though.</li>
            <li>I HAD NO DRY AND SCALY SKIN ON MY ELBOWS.</li>
            <li>I would suggest to dry rub very gently on the skin starting at the feet and always working towards the heart as recommended for dry brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little abrasive at first</li>
            <li>The second time I used it I was a little gentler and used softer strokes in a few areas, which felt better.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer in the benefits of dry brushing, as I see layers of dead skin falling off before I get into the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to dry skin brushing -- and am sold on it!  </li>
            <li>I was worried about this buy initially because of the comments about the brush being rough on sensitive skin, but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Well in my researching all of that I stumbled upon &amp;#34;skin brushing&amp;#34; which apparently has been done for generations in a lot of cultures to give the lymphatic system an extra boost in detoxing the body.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty firm and exfoliate well.</li>
            <li>This  skin brush is quite firm but, does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>off I&#x27;m new to dry brushing but have read numerous articles about it.</li>
            <li>Tough, durable bristles attached to a strong yet detachable arm; this skin brush functions as 2 in 1.</li>
            <li>It has an aggressive scratchy feel which might be a little much at first, but you soon get used to it and actually look forward to it.</li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty stiff and will scrub the hide off you until the soften, but they do soften a bit after use.  </li>
            <li>At first I felt that it was to stiff.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I thought the bristles were stiff.</li>
            <li>Seriously, you could use this brush to clean your BBQ or take the paint off your car.</li>
            <li>At first it felt like it would be too harsh but on the second day me &amp; my skin were saying &amp;#34;aaaahhh&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Pretty harsh actually....</li>
            <li>Dry brushing is really great for the skin and especially necessary during the cold, dry winter months.</li>
            <li>Too rough for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I brush my skin SOFTLY, apply rosewater and glycerin, following by a dry skin lotion.</li>
            <li>Does not get moldy like my last dry brush by earth therapeutics and is not as soft either.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure if the bristles are really supposed to be this intense or if this brush is just extra rough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent brush, but not worth the function design.</li>
            <li>One reviewer wrote that natural bristles held on to soap better than synthetic bristles, which by the way is -wrong-, and another reviewer wrote that although the bristles were stiff at first, once they were wet they softened up.  </li>
            <li>I found that this brush was a little cheaper at my local Whole Foods store.</li>

            <li> Perfect -- just what I needed, and at a better price than comparable products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t yet know if this is doing anything great for detoxing my body, but it does feel good.</li>
            <li> Feels so good.</li>
            <li> I read it is good to exfoliate every day using a brush</li>
            <li> But it feels sooo good.</li>
            <li> Good sized brush for the price.</li>
            <li> Its therapeutic, plus extremely good for my body, skin &amp; circulation.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really a good sized brush.</li>
            <li> hurts so good&#x27; type of things?  </li>
            <li> so I discovered that body brushing is a good thing</li>
            <li> This is a particularly good brush for devotees and newcomers.</li>
            <li> CAN HAVE A GOOD SCRUBBING OUT IT</li>
            <li> good for the price.</li>
            <li> Good price as well.  </li>
            <li> The bristles felt so good</li>
            <li> and it feels good,</li>
            <li> I loved this brush.</li>
            <li> It feels so good.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN FELT SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> good product, good price</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s a good thing to do.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking good</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m feeling the benefits of the good circulation that it enhances.</li>
            <li> And it probably is, but it also just feels really good to use it--makes my skin tingle</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush.  </li>
            <li> In fact they feel so good on my dome</li>
            <li> Good service.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush for exfoliating...</li>
            <li> Still a good product.</li>
            <li> but I will say that it feels really good</li>
            <li> This brush is really good because the head of the brush detaches from the handle, which makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Good condition.  </li>
            <li> but it does NOT feel good to run this over your legs or arms.</li>
            <li> This brush is great to help keep your blood circulation going strong!</li>
            <li> Super sturdy and feels great!</li>
            <li> VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great, really love it.&lt;br /&gt;frankenseitz</li>
            <li> It was the perfect stocking stuffer - a must use, needed and priced right luxury item.</li>
            <li> lol after more brushes it pleased me!</li>
            <li> Very strong bristles, definitely nice for a good scrub if you are looking for a good exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my skin and a very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this brush!</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love this brush!</li>

            <li> Love that the product has a detachable head.</li>
            <li> I love the roughness of this brush and its durability.</li>
            <li> I use it as a way to help my lymph flow better as I have acne and think it&#x27;s one of the causes, so I brush towards my heart.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE there</li>
            <li> The handle length is perfect so you can reach your back.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush.</li>

            <li> I think men would like it better.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading that these are great for keratosis pilaris and they really are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I discovered this.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great and feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> and I love that it detaches from the handle.</li>
            <li> My kids love for me to brush them as well.  </li>
            <li> I felt much more awake after I did it.</li>
            <li> satisfied customer here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Natural bristles do a better job than the plastic synthetic type.  </li>
            <li> Much better than Loofa to me.</li>
            <li> but you come to love the feeling.</li>
            <li> Love the firmness of this body brush.  </li>
            <li> Love the brush, love the price, and I love my skin ever since I started body brushing.</li>
            <li> Love how the handle is removable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d almost love it if not for the tricky handle that disconnects</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> bath gloves that I like better.  </li>
            <li> I really love how it comes apart and can be used with or without the handle.</li>
            <li> the brush tends to fall off where it inserts into the elongator, but I do love the brush itself.</li>
            <li> I love to use it to help remove cellulite spots.</li>
            <li> love it love it, feel refreshed after using this.</li>
            <li> also find the stick component more of an inconvenience than anything.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s made appropriately for what you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> I feel so much physically better after brushing with this brush.</li>
            <li> I Love It.</li>
            <li> Love this skin brush, followed by sesame oil and a shower</li>
            <li> I it use without the handle for most scrubbing, and insert the handle for as needed.</li>
            <li> so it felt better on the skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful as a back scratcher too!!  </li>
            <li> I love using this weekly.</li>
            <li> love this brush.  </li>
            <li> It also is wonderful for circulation, and I love my daily ritual with it.</li>
            <li> love love love body brushing</li>
            <li> It has much more effect in stimulating and exfoliating the skin when used that way, and I like it even better.</li>
            <li> MEN, if you have a bald head or very short hair these are the best hair brushes in the world.</li>
            <li> I love that the handle detaches, I can pack just the brush portion if I want to travel with it.</li>
            <li> Thank for the business ! :)</li>
            <li> Just OK.  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product.  </li>
            <li> Okay .... if you are one of those who came looking for this product after listening to Food Babe&#x27;s you tube video BEWARE.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it again.</li>
            <li> Love my brush.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist turned me onto a glycolic body wash, which I like better as an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten used to the brush for the most part.</li>
            <li> It really helps to use it right before you self tan so that your application comes out flawless.</li>
            <li> Just the right stiffness for a good skin scrubbing without scratching.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush, I&#x27;ve never used a Tampico brush before, so it felt a bit rough at first, but once you get how to use it, it feels really great!</li>
            <li> This works really great particularly before self tanning.  </li>
            <li> Great brush, would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> And it is super appealing that it is made in the USA!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice skin brush - firm bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Great Service, quick shipping, awesome product...</li>
            <li> GREAT quality natural bristles for the price!!  </li>
            <li> She loved it so much she bought one for each of us kids!</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Since I got it, my body acne has been significantly reduced!</li>
            <li> I am new to body brushing but have found it to be a great experience.</li>
            <li> Excellent  brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> You should use it on dry skin just before having a shower for best results.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry brushing</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for dry skin brushing.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry body brushing.</li>
            <li> dry brushing your skin is the best feeling--</li>
            <li> perfect for dry brushing</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product that we will enjoy..</li>
            <li> Great, great product, especially for the reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Excellent dry brush!</li>
            <li> My husband likes this brush, it is a good quality and large head</li>
            <li> Always brush away from Center for best and noticeable results</li>
            <li> so a light brushing is perfectly okay.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, natural bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> Have bought others that have fallen appart ,this one is of good quality &amp; does a good job for dry brushing,does not scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> But once your skin is use to the toughness of the bristles, its easy sailing.</li>
            <li> say the brush gets mouldy easily when they use it in the shower-</li>
            <li> The brush is separate from the handle but they attach so you can easily hold the brush head or attach the handle for a longer reach.</li>
            <li> I feel really clean when I take the time to cover most of my skin.</li>
            <li> As I use it brushing up toward my heart for an improved circulation bonus, the handle is superfluous but it removes easily.  </li>
            <li> I like that the handle is removable which makes it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> so it slides in until stuck, but easily comes out.</li>
            <li> The handle comes off the head easily, it just operates on a type of wedge/groove system to fasten the handle to the head while remaining removable.</li>
            <li> Better than a back scratcher and a great wake-me-up each morning.  </li>
            <li> Bristles do not fall out or break off easily.  </li>
            <li> Great back brush or bottom of feet.......used them many years.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and assemble.</li>
            <li> No instructions on putting the brush onto the handle but easy to figure out paying close attention to the shapes.</li>
            <li> ALSO, SHIPPING WAS VERY QUICK</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> the bristles come off easily.</li>
            <li> The brush comes off the handle too easily.</li>
            <li> I also like that the handle is removable, but it doesn&#x27;t fall off too easily.</li>
            <li> This is not an easy to use product.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does feel good and makes your skin so soft &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li> Good brush, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice, the delivery was very fast</li>
            <li> The detachable handle is were its at, super easy to use without dealing with the goofy handle in the way</li>
            <li> I actually really love skin brushing now, and have seen results pretty immediately; I don&#x27;t go a day without it now and am so glad I got this brush.</li>
            <li> (Like all super enjoyable things, moderation is recommended.)</li>
            <li> Awesome product- bristles are stiff yet easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> This brush is great,  I love it for dry brushing!</li>
            <li> This brush has a great handle and is good for reaching those hard to get places.</li>
            <li> When I brush my face gently I find that my Clarisonic works much smoother as well, great bonus there.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush that I have purchased thus far.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for 2 mos and can tell a huge difference in my skintone and energy level.</li>
            <li> This has made a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It stimulates my skin and is going to be perfect for winter to slough off those dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC PURCHASE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have been using this brush for 3 days now, and it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> I literally see the cellulite become smooth.</li>
            <li> Start off using light pressure and increase as your skin adjusts to it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth after brushing.</li>
            <li> I can see the dead skin falling off, its awesome!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and the removable handle is easy/awesome.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy using</li>
            <li> It does not seem to fit into the brush and falls off.  </li>
            <li> Fast and effective results.</li>
            <li> What I do not like is the cheap design of the handle.</li>
            <li> The Yerba Prima Tampico Skin Brush has been a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic item.</li>
            <li> and of course, it feels great scratching my back with it.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve discovered something else they are great for.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the brush and the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy they still make it and make it of the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its a great product, simple and efficient.</li>
            <li> Works great for back and feet.</li>
            <li> Skin so soft and bright.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this brush for about a week, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> It does feel like light scratching but as others have said, you will get used to it.</li>
            <li> Now my 9 year old has picked up ours and brushes herself with it before every shower so passing along good habits to my girls.</li>
            <li> Gently brushing my back felt especially wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good price for what it is, natural brush</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new brush.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to &amp;#34;install&amp;#34; the head in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for the best body brush and this is it.  </li>
            <li> It does the job pretty well - I just have to use very light pressure</li>
            <li> Easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> When this came in, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Particularly if you have dry skin, this brush is perfect before a shower, just rub lightly all over.  </li>
            <li> Works great for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> /looks like it needs a clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(Best way to clean</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference immediately, my skin was much softer and more smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for dry brushing and am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> However when I needed to clean the mold off I couldn&#x27;t get the head to come off.  </li>
            <li> They exfoliate the skin and you can use them like a bath buff to clean yourself.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to clean the brush periodically with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Sure, my skin feels amazingly soft and silky and I&#x27;m sure my lymphatic system is benefiting but trust me</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Oh the joy of dry skin brushing every morning before a shower!  </li>

            <li> Works great for the reduction of the appearance of rough textured skin as well as improves the circulation, look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> Good for scrubbing the back when taking a shower.</li>
            <li> but it really does make your skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li> Good solid product for my husband.</li>
            <li> It feels so good on my back.  </li>

            <li> It feels so good.. now and later.</li>
            <li> WIFE LOVE PRODUCT MUCH</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush, VERY firm, but does a good job.</li>
            <li> I love dry brushing and this brush is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth when I use it right before</li>
            <li> It was pretty easy to figure out.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this particular product and I would certainly buy two of them because it makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> The Yerba Prima Skin brush was a totally new experience for me,but being on a health trip and wanting to ensure my lymphatic system is in top shape, and after numerous good reviews, I purchased 3 brushes.</li>
            <li> Shipped really quickly.</li>
            <li> so the quick circulation is a benefit for my body ..</li>
            <li> This brush is super sturdy, dries really quickly after washing and has a detachable handle.</li>
            <li> (either they have softened already or my skin has adjusted quickly).  </li>
            <li> but the sting quickly dissipates so</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need a swiffer or something because this thing is worth it and really makes you feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li> quickly  molded and split and had to throw it out</li>
            <li> The brush arrived quickly but with out a handle.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Iv use most expensive brushes that haven&#x27;t been halfway as good as this one , 5 stars !!!</li>
            <li> If you used with light strokes, it is effective enough.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> I usually brush myself before shower, and the effect is very good.</li>
            <li> I love to use it right before a spray tan and at the very end of a spray tan to get rid of any of the spots.</li>
            <li> used it several times, very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> My skin has become more soft, am sure it is helping in all the things it claims but my skin is so much healthy.&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to go light handed at first until bristles soften up a bit with use.&lt;br /&gt;Great for hands and feet from the get.</li>
            <li> It leaves red scratches all over (with very light brushing!).  </li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, it touched my body and bristles fell out.</li>
            <li> my new favorite.</li>
            <li> These are strong bristles but do soften a bit over time but no too much</li>
            <li> The length of the handle makes it easy to reach the whole body.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and care for product that gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about how dry brushing is supposed to be so good for the lymph system, etc.</li>
            <li> Dry brushing is good for the skin and the lymph nodes.  </li>
            <li> This brush has very stiff bristles, and it&#x27;s very good for exfoliating skin.</li>
            <li> With consistent use, my skin issues have resolved!</li>
            <li> Enjoying it thus far!</li>
            <li> They definitely exfoliate that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> but I almost skinned myself the first time I used it -ha,ha!</li>
            <li> Prefer using this than a back scratcher for sure!</li>
            <li> , it was exactly what I was hoping for and I am excited to add this treatment to my beauty routine</li>
            <li> I have done many cleanses over the years, and many of them recommend dry skin brushing as it helps with the lymph flow.</li>
            <li> I love dry brushing and love this brush and the removable handle.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much, and agree with other reviewers that it smooths skin and leaves a very nice tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> I still prefer it over having no handle at all, but it would be nice if it was a little more</li>
            <li> in my opinion, they are perfect, but I know everyone is different, so if they&#x27;re too hard for you, dont worry as they will soften the more you use</li>
            <li> Works great to exfoliated dead skin.</li>
            <li> AND THIS BRUSH IS GOING TO MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR A FEW PEOPLE ON MY LIST THIS YEAR.</li>
            <li> Once the bristles soften up after a few uses, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This being said, those with more sensitive skin may be required to soften the bristles if outer dermal layer irritation becomes an issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will leave your skin so soft I have bought so many of these.</li>
            <li> Overall nice product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an economical AND environmentally frienldy option.  </li>
            <li> Rarely use now and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still worth keeping.  </li>
            <li> Handle is kind of short.</li>
            <li> What I love about this brush is that it feels so natural.  </li>
            <li> It is coarse but not too rough and does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> Find a more durable alternative if you&#x27;re going to use this brush near water.</li>
            <li> i personally don&#x27;t have to use the handle, but it&#x27;s nice to have an option.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Very glad I chose this one with a long handle.</li>
            <li> The bristles rarely fall out.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely piece, made of wood and natural fibers, so I like to have it out on display, in my bathroom&lt;</li>
            <li> It was just supposed to be my brush, but after seeing how good it felt, my whole family wants to use it (including my 2 year old).</li>
            <li> but then again I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a bath brush, and this item was near the top of that list.  </li>
            <li> It also makes your skin soft and smooth, which is an added benefit!</li>
            <li> Not too rough but gives a good scrub.  </li>
            <li> The handle easily comes on and off for high accessibility around the body.</li>
            <li> Ladies may find the brush a bit too stiff for their softer skin, but it&#x27;s great for men.</li>
            <li> Also, I am new to dry skin brushing, and this product is great for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Love the detachable handle, it makes dry brushing easy.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a dry body brush for awhile now and searched for best dry body brushes online</li>
            <li> right before I shower.</li>
            <li> I have seen my body change right before my eyes.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not seeing any of that right now.</li>
            <li> Bristles are just the right stiffness.  </li>
            <li> The bristles, for me, are just the right degree of firmness, and of course you can vary the pressure yourself in how you brush.</li>
            <li> It is bristles are just right to make your skin tingle.  </li>
            <li> Well made and just right for cleaning up our sauna.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush seem harsh at first, but my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the handle very easily separates from the head since it&#x27;s not glued together, the handles just fits into a slot.</li>
            <li> Is it becoming clear that I like this product?</li>
            <li> Nice and long with quality bristles</li>
            <li> It also helps remove dry skin which is also nice.</li>
            <li> I got this to scrub my back properly and it goes a great job.  </li>
            <li> That experience taught me to be super gentle while brushing my skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and stiff and feel scratchy on your skin even with light pressure.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality brush!</li>
            <li> I like this brush very much.</li>
            <li> Brushing does hurt a little, but I&#x27;m agree with the mindset &amp;#34;no pain, no gain.&amp;#34; Sometimes it even feels good hahaha!</li>
            <li> cannot speak to durability yet, am still on my first month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> First one I ordered had no handle.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Way better than those sponge type back cleaners.  </li>
            <li> The first 2 times using it</li>
            <li> First time I had to wash the brush and use it in the shower to soften the bristles but after that I use it every day, I use it before the shower and inside while showering.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> They can make the bristles dense and shorter and use the same amount for a better product.</li>
            <li> I have two of these, because I thought I lost the first one and ordered another.</li>
            <li> my skin is so smooth and clear, because of how fast it eliminates toxins now!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> I tried running the brush under hot water and then drying it out, but that didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> so it is a bit of a surprise at first</li>
            <li> After the first time using it I got into the shower and my loofah literally glided across my skin instead of feeling like sandpaper like it has for years.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> I have never used a skin brush and after trying it the first time I was hooked.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST TIME I USED IT</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth already, I would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I love that this has a handle to get my back, but is removable to use on the rest of me.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty course and stuff</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Felt like the bristles were wore out after the first use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more practical to make it one solid piece and just hang on to the brush area if you don&#x27;t need the handle.</li>
            <li> It did smell funny when you first get it.</li>
            <li> I ran hot water over it for a bit and added soap and rinsed three times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is my second one.</li>
            <li> ur skin will most likely burn when you get in the hot shower ....</li>
            <li> I love the brush and use it before a bath and will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> The body wash is more convenient and doesn&#x27;t require an extra step for me.</li>
            <li> Improve circulation, I body brush before working out (dry skin of course), because dry brushing gets the blood flowing and is a good pre-warmup!</li>
            <li> The nice long handle makes it easy to reach all areas of your back.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and its a bit irritating in certain spots, but for the most part it does a great job.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the brush is just right.  </li>
            <li> This really is a must have right before summer to prep your skin for swimsuit season.</li>
            <li> This brush is quite stiff, good for feet and calves.</li>
            <li> Good stiff bristles and the handle can be removed if you just want to use the brush by itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only a newbie thus far, so I have yet to see results, but in the meantime, it is making my skin a lot smoother and more supple!</li>
            <li> and I start my day with more energy, mental clarity, and calm.</li>
            <li> Seriously these feel great on the head and neck.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are the perfect texture for dry brushing-not too rough or too soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to use just the bar alone and covers a good amount of skin.</li>
            <li> The top of the brush will fall off if not secure tightly otherwise a great brush.</li>
            <li> Good stiff bristled brush that really makes you feel cleaner when you use it.</li>
            <li> This is my first dry brush, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great for dry brushing - the bristles are good for clearing dead skin but not too rough.</li>
            <li> I admit i don&#x27;t have much to compare it to because this is my first brush</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much shedding from the bristles, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s pretty well built.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a few months now and am very pleased with the quality given the affordability.</li>
            <li> The brush is very abrasive and the handle broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the good reviews are about.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, but you need to use a very light touch or it can be pretty rough on your skin.</li>
            <li> (my lymphatic system is now 20 years younger and my kidneys have never looked better!), but it does help with dry skin and a gives a quick morning charge.</li>
            <li> Well maybe it got a bit softer over time which is good because some may think of it as &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; at first, especially if used dry.  </li>
            <li> I love dry brushing every morning, it makes me feel energized and helps exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put back on</li>
            <li> My body absorbs the body oil I use on my body after showering better-- which results to making the dry scales on my skin disappear.  </li>
            <li> Went ahead and used the brush as-is in the shower and made sure to leave it somewhere to fully dry afterwards.  </li>
            <li> so glad I learned about dry brushing</li>
            <li> I love brushing off the dry skin while in the shower.</li>
            <li> any my digestions seems to be better after incorporating dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Love dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry brushing and have been satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good firm, but not hard, brush</li>
            <li> This feels great for both wet and dry?  </li>
            <li> Great for wet or dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Very high quality</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels after using this brush for the first time!</li>
            <li> Nice little string attached for hanging up.</li>
            <li> a bit scratchy takes some getting used to but good purchase for the money..wish it had a loop to hang it as hard to store in bathroom..</li>
            <li> Brush &amp; handle is very well made</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin feels after a shower.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it much because this.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush</li>
            <li> I can really feel my circulation being boosted.</li>
            <li> Try brushing a bit lighter, although skin redness is a sign of the circulation being boosted, so dont worry too much about it.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a much softer brush for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much stiffness, but the brushes don&#x27;t scratch too much</li>
            <li> Look into the sunflower oil, it&#x27;s an absolute must-have.  </li>
            <li> it is very stable.  </li>
            <li> they are fantastic and simple.</li>
            <li> I never relaized what skin brushing could really do the body.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing to use; brush away your agitation and grumpiness.</li>
            <li> be gentle...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> It looks so much healthier</li>
            <li> I really expected better from the company.</li>
            <li> Made very well.</li>
            <li> Just gotta be gentle.</li>
            <li> Handle is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> it really is invigorating.</li>
            <li> I was being gentle too.</li>
            <li> really exfoliates the skin</li>
            <li> Will leave you feeling refreshed and ready for the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be, but need to be gentle.</li>
            <li> Very well made and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> really wakes me up in the morning using this durable yet gentle brush.</li>
            <li> Didnt notice much of a difference until i got the detox body wraps...</li>
            <li> My skin is ever so much improved.</li>
            <li> really easily&lt;br /&gt;Comes</li>
            <li> The back of the brush has a groove where the handle is supposed to fit into so you can attach and detach depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> I have found a way to make it stay, but it took me many tries.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS PACKAGED VERY PROTECTIVELY.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> This item was very well-described</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very relaxing for me.</li>
            <li> Really liking this brush.</li>
            <li> and my skin appears so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>

            <li> It is really relaxing.</li>
            <li> I really like this skin brush.  </li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t say I see much of a difference</li>
            <li> I used it once and my lymph nodes in my neck got really swollen and almost sore to touch.</li>
            <li> Satisfied and as expected.</li>
            <li> The extender stick is really helpful, too.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> and I really like them.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle brush, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> The brush had instructions and came well packaged and ready to use.</li>
            <li> but I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> Also the handle does not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> We are just beginning to skin brush and have read much about the benefits.  </li>
            <li> and I think it works okay for men as they have much rough skin</li>
            <li> I was using too much pressure.</li>
            <li> but I am able to swipe across my arms and legs without being as careful.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush when i saw some youtube videos saying a bunch of nice stuff like remove dead skin cells, detox and lot of health benefits.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and firm for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are nice and firm.</li>
            <li> This thing will remove all your dead skin leaving you all nice</li>
            <li> Bristle are nice and firm very durable.</li>
            <li> Nice firm bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Nice and stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> Nice stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> The long handle makes it easy to do you feet and legs.</li>
            <li> The long handle makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a skin brush, maybe I&#x27;m too sensitive but the brush was just so rough, it was not an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try, so I bought one at a local health food store and was so excited to find out it was made in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it lightly all over my body, right before I shower every other day.  </li>
            <li> Dry brushing with this brush (the handle stays on well, but removes easily as needed)</li>
            <li> I got this brush to help clean and scratch my back when in the tub or shower.  </li>
            <li> Thus is my first dry brush, it felt right, at first itime scared me..</li>
            <li> I expected them to be a little softer, but the more I used it, the more I like it.</li>
            <li> I am very new to the practice</li>
            <li> I think it is important and will make this a long term habit.</li>
            <li> use two brushes, one in each hand, removed from the sticks used to reach back areas, and brush the full body towards the heart to assist the lymph system in being cleansed.&lt;br /&gt;For myself and my clients...</li>
            <li> I chose to wash the brush in warm soapy water (using a small amount of dish soap) before using it.</li>
            <li> At first, my skin was so sensitive to it, I bled from the scratches</li>
            <li> That is why I put a little nail in the wall and hung it outside my shower because I think lymph brushing is a good thing to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great brush for those hard to reach spots on your back!</li>
            <li> Good quality but REALLY HARD bristles!  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic dry brush.</li>
            <li> main reason was to improve the tightness of my skin, and to reduce the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that my skin looks, and feels healthier and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Decent for the price</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was worth the hassle of sending it back.</li>
            <li> Use as a &#x27;hand&#x27; brush or add the handle for a quick reach for your back.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel good, they are a little rough at first, but soften up well.</li>
            <li> First time skin brusher here, and it&#x27;s a little scratchy the first 2-3 days, but getting used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> It would highly recommenced this brush to others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is high quality and inexpensive</li>
            <li> High quality item.</li>
            <li> Feels nice if you don&#x27;t press hard.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find a good shower brush that really scrubs your back.  </li>
            <li> I do keep meaning to give it a few more chances, but keep forgetting.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a try when my body was normal and could take the roughness...</li>
            <li> Takes off the dead skin cells and is a great exfoliator, as long as you&#x27;re gentle enough using it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy but not too harsh, and you can take the paddle off the stick if you prefer a more manual approach.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so inexpensive, sending it back isn&#x27;t worth the time.  </li>
            <li> use it in the bathtub, as using it dry is a  bit rough, and I think that by softening my skin in the hot water, it works more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> Most back brushes have fine, soft bristles that hardly do anything at all.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it daily (dry) as part of a detox routine.  </li>
            <li> The handle is the right length to reach your back.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness for my upper legs and buttocks.  </li>
            <li> This one is just right and helps me with my daily skin brushing.</li>
            <li> The price was right, and several reviews also convinced me to buy this brush over one with synthetic bristles.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few natural bristle brushes available at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have to be extra gentle when exfoliating certain areas of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as I am, just remember that it takes a bit for the body to get used to something new.  </li>
            <li> Maybe, it&#x27;s because the brush is new</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li> May be just because it&#x27;s new..</li>
            <li> BUT, has also made a tremendous difference in my (dry) skin.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, as others have noted, but soften a little over time yet remain very effective.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised that something with this level of quality is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for four days, have found that my skin has improved very much and that even my facial acne has gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel like its very important to aid our body in detoxing because lymph only moves around if we stay active</li>
            <li> You will notice obvious difference after first use.</li>
            <li> It leaves scratches sometimes too (even using barely any pressure and being gentle)</li>
            <li> So far, I concur!</li>
            <li> In the future I will try purchasing one with a more solid handle and would recommend the same to others.</li>
            <li> and I have experienced a few breakouts and raw skin.</li>
            <li> Ok Brush...a bit tough at first.  </li>
            <li> This brush exfoliates and detox you from head to toe, making your skin glow because it encourages new skin and brushes off the old.      </li>
            <li> I really like this brush--it&#x27;s not too abrasive, and I really like that it has the long handle for making it easier to brush.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> If STRONGLY suggest you give the bristles a serious soak before using it for the first time, then again before each use.</li>
            <li> I have not used it fully as yet but just wanted to give feedback to address those saying its super rough.</li>
            <li> cause I am able to reach all down my back.</li>
            <li> Love the long handle which helps reach the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, soft bristles but sturdy enough to get rid of dead skin!</li>
            <li> Your skin will be free of that dead skin layer that bothers and hinders new healthier skin.</li>
            <li> Dry or wet, I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Tried it out and it works fine at helping to remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> Since they are an add on item, the last time I needed one I ddin&#x27;t have a large purchase to make from Amazon</li>
            <li> The bristle are a little to hard for me, but the service was great</li>
            <li> Wow ive used it just a few times and my skin is already super softer and shinier!</li>
            <li> Watch out, if you scrub too hard, you might scratch yourself :)  </li>
            <li> The brush is really hard, but your skin starts to love that after awhile.</li>
            <li> the dead skin on top of the blemishes can help to heal them faster and rejuvenate the skin-be gentle of course!I am planning on gifting these to new moms as well as other add-ons to birthday gifts.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it right of he box and scrubbed my arm raw on the first swipe.</li>
            <li> It took me a few times to get used to it, but now I thoroughly enjoy the sensation and how soft my skin feels after.</li>
            <li> Mature, sensitive skin can be a concern when looking for skin care products and this brush offers stimulation without irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a natural brush before but</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just sensitive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what it is supposed to feel like though, so this might be a personal problem.  </li>
            <li> You just feel so alive after brushing and hopping in shower.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 3-4 months now.</li>
            <li> Recommended if you&#x27;re skin&#x27;s not deathly sensitive.</li>
            <li> This brush didn&#x27;t hurt, but wasn&#x27;t so soft that I couldn&#x27;t feel it either.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to take the head apart from the handle yet, but it hasn&#x27;t really been necessary.</li>
            <li> Have yet to use it enough to really say if it makes a difference</li>
            <li> The entire family uses it and can really feel the increased circulation.</li>
            <li> I have one that&#x27;s near 20 years old</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remove the brush from the handle (mostly because I&#x27;m afraid I would be able to get it back on).  </li>
            <li> After just 4 gentle uses, the brush began to crack through the middle.</li>
            <li> and once I finish the skin brushing my skin is sooo soft.</li>
            <li> For those of you with sensitive skin, a lighter touch is require</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft or too course.</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble using this brush.</li>
            <li> It is soooo soft.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> and wow did I find it.</li>
            <li> I try to be soft, but it&#x27;s too scratchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to believe she&#x27;s absolutely getting money to endorse these products.</li>
            <li> not too soft buy</li>
            <li> When the bristles start getting soft, I replace it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not so soft that you feel like they&#x27;re doing nothing</li>
            <li> I have just begun using this (1 wk so far)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even kinda soft on your skin.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves how soft her skin is after use.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> Works really well, my skin tone has improved immensely.</li>
            <li> My skin is way too sensitive for the brush.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how smooth my skin was after just a few times in using it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest starting slowly, brushing in gentle circles and then gradually applying more pressure.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a little if done to hard or long but just brush lightly and u will love it too!</li>
            <li> Comfortable handle and stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> At first it seems very stiff and scratchy however after several uses (lightly brushing) my skin became adjusted to the brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel nice and stiff but the handle is a little long and hard to get a good grip.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush to anyone interested in dry brushing</li>
            <li> This brush is my first dry brush</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but all my back acne is gone, and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to comfortably brush your back</li>
            <li> I know people like to buy natural products, but in this case, plastic wins hands down.</li>
            <li> ..know they have to be somewhat firm to brush away top layer of dry skin but</li>
            <li> handle is long enough, but not too long to fit in the cabinet.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was using an exfoliating scrub in the shower but now use this on occasion because its much cheaper in the long run than continually buying the scrubs.</li>
            <li> You just brush 2 minutes per day before showering and brush toward the heart (don&#x27;t brush the face) using long gentle strokes.</li>
            <li> No it is not soft and does not require much pressure.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> A bit rough at first</li>
            <li> but it seemed to be exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> It felt rough at first</li>
            <li> It feels rough at first</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what I expected and wanted.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Howevet, anything but a feather light touch scratches my skin, leaving little white marks.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic of dry brushing until I researched the topic and found this particular brush!</li>
            <li> What seems a simple and straightforward design is flawed by a cheap untreated softwood.  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves dry brushing.</li>
            <li> It really does get your circulation going and helps slough away dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped so much with dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my energy levels even though it seems like such a simple technique.</li>
            <li> The last brush I had was old and soft.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it does work!</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to accomplish the task, but soft enough to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> If you are new to dry brushing or have sensitive skin, this is not the brush for you.</li>
            <li> Dry brushing is very new to me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this long handled brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so hard on my skin, no matter how light I brush it, it hurts.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are hard and somewhat scratchy, but I was expecting that when I purchased it, and you aren&#x27;t supposed to scrub your skin with it, just lightly brush it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend use BEFORE  vacuuming, &#x27;cause it really sluffs off the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I have regular skin, not too sensitive but not rough.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the brush as an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; for around $6 I said &amp;#34;hey, why not?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It looks to be made really well and seems that it would last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The bristles are sturdy, but not excessively rough.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush particularly for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have used this once so far and has already  made  a  big difference in  my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and I like the fack I can reach my back without straining.</li>
            <li> The bristles are much gentler wet.</li>
            <li> but the bristles are soft enough once they soak up a bit.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a brush to use in the bath or shower, do yourself a big favor and avoid all the brushes that have natural bristles.  </li>
            <li> Honestly dont waste your money, pointless and didnt make a difference.</li>
            <li> I would recommend replacing every few months, but for this price, it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> I use it as a dry skin brush and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The brush is very hard and hurt a little the first dozen times I used it, but it got better and my skin got used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second and am planning to buy one for my Dad, who has recently become interested in dry brushing to assist on detox.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old lady with thin skin that bruises easily.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff enough to be effective, but not too stiff.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to dry brushing,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to dry brushing</li>
            <li> I am new to dry skin brushing.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using the new one dry instead of in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to dry brushing</li>
            <li> Be careful using this in more delicate areas though.</li>
            <li> I HAD NO DRY AND SCALY SKIN ON MY ELBOWS.</li>
            <li> I would suggest to dry rub very gently on the skin starting at the feet and always working towards the heart as recommended for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little abrasive at first</li>
            <li> The second time I used it I was a little gentler and used softer strokes in a few areas, which felt better.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in the benefits of dry brushing, as I see layers of dead skin falling off before I get into the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to dry skin brushing -- and am sold on it!  </li>
            <li> I was worried about this buy initially because of the comments about the brush being rough on sensitive skin, but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Well in my researching all of that I stumbled upon &amp;#34;skin brushing&amp;#34; which apparently has been done for generations in a lot of cultures to give the lymphatic system an extra boost in detoxing the body.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty firm and exfoliate well.</li>
            <li> This  skin brush is quite firm but, does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> off I&#x27;m new to dry brushing but have read numerous articles about it.</li>
            <li> Tough, durable bristles attached to a strong yet detachable arm; this skin brush functions as 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> It has an aggressive scratchy feel which might be a little much at first, but you soon get used to it and actually look forward to it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty stiff and will scrub the hide off you until the soften, but they do soften a bit after use.  </li>
            <li> At first I felt that it was to stiff.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I thought the bristles were stiff.</li>
            <li> Seriously, you could use this brush to clean your BBQ or take the paint off your car.</li>
            <li> At first it felt like it would be too harsh but on the second day me &amp; my skin were saying &amp;#34;aaaahhh&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Pretty harsh actually....</li>
            <li> Dry brushing is really great for the skin and especially necessary during the cold, dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Too rough for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I brush my skin SOFTLY, apply rosewater and glycerin, following by a dry skin lotion.</li>
            <li> Does not get moldy like my last dry brush by earth therapeutics and is not as soft either.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if the bristles are really supposed to be this intense or if this brush is just extra rough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush, but not worth the function design.</li>
            <li> One reviewer wrote that natural bristles held on to soap better than synthetic bristles, which by the way is -wrong-, and another reviewer wrote that although the bristles were stiff at first, once they were wet they softened up.  </li>
            <li> I found that this brush was a little cheaper at my local Whole Foods store.</li>
            <li> It is the first time for me to try dry brushing, and I did not find the brush too harsh</li>
            <li> This brush is very scratchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in this brush,the handle has fallen off once and the bristles seem to become misshapen,,I like the way it feels don&#x27;t feel like it was a very good value.</li>
            <li> As the bristles wear down it is always advisable to replace it with a new one.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the handle slides into the back of the head and &amp;#34;wedges&amp;#34; in, so the brush head comes off a little too easily.</li>
            <li> A little rough at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough on the skin at first</li>
            <li> When I use it, if I brush the same area for too long, then my skin will turn red, so I aim to keep the brush moving on different parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> Sturdy wooden handle that is long enough to reach your back, and my husband likes that the handle is removable</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to reach the back.</li>
            <li> As some have complained, the bristles did feel hard to me at first, but only about the first 2-3 times.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive as in I have a lot of allergies and even minor skin trauma such as a scratch can set off a psoriasis outbreak, so I&#x27;m very careful with the products I use.</li>
            <li> First of all the brush is hard ....</li>
            <li> with almost no instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to YouTube, I found out dry brushing only works when do it correctly (brushing in upward strokes to your heart starting from your feet)</li>
            <li> , it is long enough to reach every place you want to.</li>
            <li> and some are really long like it didnt get cut properly.</li>
            <li> As for the handle, there are two different ways to slide the long part in, when done correctly</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the brush is detached from the long wood stem part.</li>
            <li> I mean, very very.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, but it&#x27;s a little too rough for me.  </li>
            <li> Seems to do the job, bristles are on the hard side so really can only be used on less sensitive areas  like limbs and butt.</li>
            <li> while using this one I could actually see the streaks it was making in my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like it can if I start dry brushing several times a week.  </li>
            <li> I had recently heard of all of the benefits of dry brushing.</li>
            <li> dry brushing was one thing i needed to do definitely for my lymphatic system.  </li>
            <li> I actually feel  invigorated after doing dry skin brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> I use this brush daily before showering for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> I feel far less bloated</li>
            <li> so they hurt, but not gentle enough to deeply exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> and they last a long long time.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the bristles are very stiff and it is actually too rough for me to use on my whole body.</li>
            <li> The sickness only lasted maybe 5 minutes or less but that really proved to me that the little brushing I did was effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very stiff and intense, but</li>
            <li> So i bought it the same day i saw the video and tried it after i received, OMG the bristles are really rough</li>
            <li> I like the long handle.  </li>
            <li> It has a long handle and works well.  </li>
            <li> If brush comes off, replace and tap harder next time.</li>
            <li> bad:&lt;br /&gt;Detatches from the long handle</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm but not harsh.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, but not harsh.</li>
            <li> But not nearly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I follow the long version of the procedure outlined on http://naturalhealthtechniques.com/healingtechniquesdry_brushing_technique.htm</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone who suffers with depression or something like that, I find this is a nice self- treat to wind down.</li>
            <li> I had one in the past and it was just time for a new one.</li>
            <li> It is well made and the bristles are not to soft or to stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well crafted out of quality materials and the bristles are neither too stiff or too soft</li>
            <li> Initially purchased due to circulation issues, and has drastically improved that situation.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are pretty stiff and hard when new, but after a few days in the shower, they become softer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just began dry brushing</li>
            <li> DONT use it in the shower, its called a &#x27;Dry&#x27; brush for a reason.</li>
            <li> This is a quality dry skin brush.</li>
            <li> I have never  used a dry brush before</li>
            <li> The product is well made but the bristles are stiffer than what I am used to for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed and would recommend it to anyone for dry skin brushing.  </li>
            <li> coconut oil could help my dry skin stay moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought this for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> I use it for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive skin brush to start dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I heard about dry brushing on Pinterest.  </li>
            <li> So I came across dry body brushing on a health blog that popped up in my news reader app.</li>
            <li> It helps to slough off dry skin, and my knees, elbows, and knuckles are looking a lot</li>
            <li> I am on a detox regime and I bought this for dry brush massage.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of and the benefits that dry brushing is supposed to exhibit</li>
            <li> I think I will have to dry another softer brush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I had dry skin</li>
            <li> Got this for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I dry brush before my showers.</li>
            <li> - I use for dry skin brushing.</li>
            <li> It is scratchy when dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dry brushing before my showers and it feels delicious&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dry skin brush with this brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> I store this brush with the handle removed so it can completely dry out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for dry skin brushing for lymphatic drainage.</li>
            <li> I use these for a Dry Brushing Service I offer along with massage.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin not as dry.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t properly dry brush with this.</li>
            <li> Since I found out about dry brushing, my skin feels like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I just started using these for dry brushing my skin</li>
            <li> Just have to keep dry or over time the wood warps, cracks which I would assume would happen to any wood brush.</li>
            <li> I have just begun dry brushing after reading about it a lot online and the ordering this brush.</li>
            <li> I find it relaxing to dry brush.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I use it for dry brushing but it leaves scratch marks on my skin.</li>
            <li> This was bought for the purpose of dry brushing my skin before a shower.</li>
            <li> The handle in the back slides on the bar; the bar has an opening on the back that gets narrow</li>
            <li> It appears rough enough to be stimulating but not too rough to avoid using it.</li>
            <li> Dry brushing your skin is not new; if you haven&#x27;t tried it, then you should.  </li>
            <li> Brush is not too rough and does not hurt me at all, in fact it feels SO GOOD (especially if you have an itchy back or something, no more painful scratches from sharp finger</li>
            <li> I do agree with some of the other reviews that it is a bit stiff the first few days</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and the bristles are stiff without being too stiff.  </li>
            <li> The brush is a little hard at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful to dry it between uses by placing it face down in a basket with an open weave.</li>
            <li> Having really dry skin in the winter, and body scrubs and lotions never really working too well</li>
            <li> Others would call it &amp;#34;invigorating.&amp;#34;  I use mine exclusively for dry brushing your skin, but have not used it in the shower, so I cannot comment on wet brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought another and see the tag has &amp;#34;directions for dry brushing.&amp;#34; If mine hadn&#x27;t gotten wet every time I took a shower, it would not have broken.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to stimulate the skin without scratching and helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> The cons with this brush are very minimal tho if you like the option of using the brush detached from the long handle</li>
            <li> But I have been a little freaked out to keep doing it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> My skin has become less itchy and dry since using this dry brush.</li>
            <li> The company should really put that on the instructions because I had initially thought that mine was useless as well.</li>
            <li> Only used the brush a few times up to now.  </li>
            <li> Only used a few days</li>
            <li> I spent time reading the reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Plus it molded while hanging in my shower after only a few months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this, not even when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough and my boyfriend thinks they rather hurt, but, I think they do their job well.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly rough-  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I buy things like this and only use them a few times before putting them in a drawer and forgetting about them.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Rough but not too rough.</li>
            <li> AND IT DID FEEL A BIT ROUGH</li>
            <li> it is so rough it makes it not usable.</li>
            <li> Yea I like it alright, but be careful and don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure into brushing, the bristles are made of wood and not boars hair.</li>
            <li> A bit harder bristles than I thought</li>
            <li> and it shouldn&#x27;t get wet.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times, but I can already see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> and I found it too rough.</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit stiffer than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday prior to showering.</li>
            <li> It is as rough as you use it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t loose bristles with use like some other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is still very firm after a long time of daily use.  </li>
            <li> so stiff that it actually hurts to skin brush with....</li>
            <li> Brushing with this skin brush was a little tough at first...</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff but not so stiff that they bother my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have less dry, flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Since dry brushing, my skin has been less itchy after showers wen</li>
            <li> I brush before as well as less dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li> This brush relaxes me every night after a long dy of chasing my little one around.  </li>
            <li> , I guess i was not ready for a harsh dry exfoliation.</li>
            <li> bought one for myself and 2 other family members</li>
            <li> I was planning on buying the brush for some other people, now I never will.</li>
            <li> and she swears that its due to skin brushing.</li>
            <li> /&gt; OTHER SOFTER BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems keeping the brush and handle together as other reviewers have.</li>
            <li> Now, my husband on the other hand, loves it.</li>
            <li> The bristle ends are sharp and scratchy</li>
            <li> I had to buy a softer brush for other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Maybe there are other brush heads that you can buy.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t made extremely well</li>
            <li> I purchased it based on the reviews, after researching other brands.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve never had that problem, as some other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would be for scrubbing the back</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will help me lose inches and tighten skin as I&#x27;ve heard other say.</li>
            <li> Initially the brushing felt a little harsh</li>
            <li> Very rough and scratchy</li>
            <li> The bristles are very rough</li>
            <li> Very rough on my skin</li>
            <li> VERY rough bristles.  </li>
            <li> Stiff vegetable bristles a long detachable handle</li>
            <li> I brush my skin without pushing down at all and it is extremely scratchy/painful.</li>
            <li> I have very rough and thick skin and have tried lots of different exfoliators and moisturizers</li>
            <li> This is a little rough</li>
            <li> It was a little rough to use at the beginning</li>
            <li> and I have had pretty dramatic, noticable results!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to take the time to use it, even though it only takes a minute.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying drybrushing, and perhaps I don&#x27;t understand the fundamentals enough, but this brush is SOOO hard.  </li>
            <li> With just a light brush, it was quite painful.</li>
            <li> Even light brushing is painful.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is what others have mentioned..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it ladies.</li>
            <li> I have used this same brand brush for at least 30 years.</li>
            <li> I still feel it&#x27;s harsh, so not good on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Brush up towards the heart, not circular or down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little dubious about all the other claims out there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortably stiff &amp; rough.</li>
            <li> Oh, one other major problem with it: when you first get the brush, the bristles STINK so bad you can hardly stand to be in the shower with it.</li>
            <li> Item broke after using it less then 10 times.  </li>
            <li> Brush broke in half.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference in my skin being less flaky.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed less skin issues (like ashy/dry skin) this winter.  </li>
            <li> Which they did, ever so slightly.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day before a hot and then cold shower to promote flushing.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first - it seemed like the bristles were very stiff</li>
            <li> The smell died down after i washed/air dried it.</li>
            <li> I ALMOST FELT LIGHTER IN WEIGHT BECAUSE THE DEAD SKIN WAS DOWN THE DRAIN.</li>
            <li> I try to dry brush at least once a week</li>
            <li> and I have much less dead skin clinging to me in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I kept at it and now sometimes wish they were a little courser now</li>
            <li> so I give it a  little Gorilla glue</li>
            <li> Also, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; as I was a little worried it might either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little scratchy</li>
            <li> You do get used to it, but I would think it could be a little softer and still do the job.  </li>
            <li> It is very stiff and rough at the beginning until you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are super hard!!!!</li>
            <li> but this are super hard!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush will feel still &amp; hard til you get used to it, especially if you haven&#x27;t body brushed before, but it seems that my skin gets red quicker which tells me my circulation is working quicker than a soft bristled brush, I am thin with a lot of cellulite, menopause :(</li>
            <li> A little too harsh on softer areas of the skin but manageable.</li>
            <li> you have to be careful not to brush to hard.</li>
            <li> I have dry and bumpy skin but other kinds of exfoliating either don&#x27;t work or are irritating.  </li>
            <li> just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had bought quite a few of these.</li>
            <li> because you know it&#x27;s removing all the dead skin that no longer serves you.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of time and postage.  </li>
            <li> Not a comfortable scrub ,feels needly.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too harsh.</li>
            <li> I bought one for the bathroom and one I have for washing my car as the brush is firm but not too firm when cleaning my car.</li>
            <li> I replace them every 6 to 8 months of heavy use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush cleans the shit out of you.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended for aiding in getting dead skin removed.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars, but I&#x27;ve had a few bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely harsh.</li>
            <li> BUT AFTER I DRIED AND LOTIONED  </li>
            <li> flakes of dead skin were in my bathroom and that sort of grossed me out.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to increase blood flow, lymph drainage and help remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I dry-brush for a few minutes before taking my shower.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday this week.</li>
            <li> I also use this before I shave to get all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and need to brush with firm bristles.  </li>
            <li> A bit too firm and has a skinny handle.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using it and feel I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> If I had to change something it would be the handle because the head of the brush and handle do not fit as well as it should</li>
            <li> the bristles are really really harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> Much to harsh for all over your body.</li>
            <li> A few bristles have fallen out, but maybe I just don&#x27;t have it broken in enough yet.</li>
            <li> It seems very well constructed, and I like the wooden base and handle.</li>
            <li> This brush is just a little too stiff for me.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is almost half of the price at the health food store where I usually buy it.</li>
            <li> Bristles stay stiff for months.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was a bit stiff.  </li>
            <li> Too stiff.</li>
            <li> bristles are stiff</li>
            <li> I was looking for a stiff brush</li>
            <li> My problem is that it never stays on the handle, I actually threw the handle away and just use the brush which makes getting areas like my back very difficult.</li>
            <li> At this point, it&#x27;s still pretty scratchy and painful</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a water proof sealant on it (like varnish) because it is raw wood</li>
            <li> I did my brushing for the first time and started feeling really sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit rough but just don&#x27;t rub too hard!</li>
            <li> I am a grandmother and have thin, dry skin that is part of the aging.</li>
            <li> Afraid that brushes would irritate my very sensitive skin, I did some research and came upon this brush.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not soft at all on the skin!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is to hard for me to use and it leaves little scratches on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is firm and hard just the way I like it.  </li>
            <li> I was scared it was going to be small</li>
            <li> This is not your ordinary body brush.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not enjoyable like one would expect skin brushing to be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing, I&#x27;m not sure why the handle is removable.  </li>
            <li> Was a tiny bit skeptical that this would make a difference</li>
            <li> Fell apart almost immediately and it was past the time I could return it.</li>
            <li> It also helps sloth off dead skin cells!</li>
            <li> Not sure,</li>
            <li> I drilled 2 small holes in the handle and screwed it to the brush.</li>
            <li> I have used them in the past.  </li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m not really sure, but just know</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t brush hard because it is too stiff for that</li>
            <li> THE BRISTOLS ARE VERY FIRM</li>
            <li> Bristles are very harsh on skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult for me hold on too, due to a stroke.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very stiff and hard, but that is what I like about it.</li>
            <li> Really hard bristle but doe the job.</li>
            <li> Do not rub too hard.  </li>
            <li> HARD.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Many say that the bristles are too hard-</li>
            <li> Not too hard on the skin.  </li>
            <li> but I realized I was scrubbing too hard.</li>
            <li> Not too hard and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to stop brushing it.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re not so hard that they feel like brillo on your skin.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I push up the bristle part into the wood handle, it will still pop out periodically.</li>
            <li> Very stiff brush, the bristles are certainly not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> Was also delivered late.</li>
            <li> I feel really weird writing this review because I got on a whole kick of doing all this crazy stuff like oil pulling and using clay toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I must have some tough skin because the bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as I would like them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stiff enough to get the job done without being too painful.</li>
            <li> a little, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle is uncomfortable and is still an awkward reach for the back.  </li>
            <li> Very small nick where the handle is inserted, but this does not affect use or quality.</li>
            <li> Before it came in, I saw others that were less expensive at the store.</li>
            <li> I think I just get bored brushing myself and feel oddly like a dog.</li>
            <li> Stiff!!</li>
            <li> It was a different experience, but wasn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> No good for lotions if that&#x27;s what your after.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong or why it leaves scratches.</li>
            <li> I cannot dry brush with this because it is too painful.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are tough.</li>
            <li> I do not think that bristles are supposed to be that tough in my understanding.</li>
            <li> It does take about a week to get used to the tough bristles, but it grows on you.</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH IS UNBELIEVABLE!!</li>
            <li> This is poor quality.</li>
            <li> This is a poorly made product</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s so addicted, she travels with it.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very rough and somewhat painful.</li>
            <li> The brush has slowly helped remove the calluses on the bottom of my feet, which I thought would be impossible.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> WAS DIFFICULT WITH&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because, like everyone else, I blindly follow Food Babe.</li>
            <li> You may want to keep it for reaching spots on your back if you aren&#x27;t terribly flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the head keeps popping off it&#x27;s installed in the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> useless now, buy one that is permanently connected.</li>
            <li> and I started to get broken capillaries everywhere!</li>
            <li> Sorry that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I kept brushing until finished and I felt weird and sick</li>
            <li> Also, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive either!</li>
            <li> coincidentally on my foot each time grr</li>
            <li> Although some people may feel painful at the beginning</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I like that the handle can be removed from the base of the brush but that I also haven&#x27;t had any issues with the two parts coming apart when I don&#x27;t want them to.</li>
            <li> The handle tends to come disconnected from the head, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed!</li>
            <li> The handle does not stay on as well was very disappointed</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s scratching my skin, and feels terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it!  Feels so good. I use it about 3-4 times a week right before I shower. Gives your skin a nice glow. Brush &amp; handle is very well made and I like the fact that you can buy replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the brush but the handle doesn&#x27;t stay on. I just hold it in my hand as I use it pre-shower with Life-Flo Organic Purse Sesame Oil.</li>
            <li> Good quality but REALLY HARD bristles!  I&#x27;ve used a natural brush before but while using this one I could actually see the streaks it was making in my dry skin.  Maybe my skin is just sensitive but I winced with every brush and that was doing it lightly!</li>
            <li> Only used the brush a few times up to now.  I really like how my skin feels after a shower.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but all my back acne is gone, and my skin looks amazing. I strongly recommend this product. I also use this product with Kiss My Face soap products and begun using both at the same time so I believe the combination helped remove my acne. Just a thought.</li>
            <li> I read it is good to exfoliate every day using a brush and this one does the job. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a skin brush, maybe I&#x27;m too sensitive but the brush was just so rough, it was not an enjoyable experience. I don&#x27;t really know what it is supposed to feel like though, so this might be a personal problem.  I haven&#x27;t really used it much because this.  I do keep meaning to give it a few more chances, but keep forgetting. So for now, 3 stars... the quality of the brush is great and I like the way the handle detaches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.  Bristles stay stiff for months.  Great for the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a removable handle. It does stink like garlic after a while, but I guess that meant it was time to wash it. The smell died down after i washed/air dried it.</li>
            <li> Really hard bristle but doe the job.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush! Works great for dry brushing. Love the detachable handle, it makes dry brushing easy.</li>
            <li> Using to eliminate cellulite. Only used a few days and I feel the difference. It makes my thighs tingle! Do not rub too hard.  Brush up towards the heart, not circular or down. Will see how it goes in 2 - 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Honestly dont waste your money, pointless and didnt make a difference. just a waste of money. Very rough and scratchy</li>
            <li> Excellent brush, the handle isn&#x27;t so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to dry brushing, as I am, just remember that it takes a bit for the body to get used to something new.  As some have complained, the bristles did feel hard to me at first, but only about the first 2-3 times.  I kept at it and now sometimes wish they were a little courser now if anything.  This brush feels great on the skin and I think the periodic washing softens the bristles a little, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle is uncomfortable and is still an awkward reach for the back.  I still prefer it over having no handle at all, but it would be nice if it was a little more ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak to durability yet, am still on my first month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I love dry brushing every morning, it makes me feel energized and helps exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great to exfoliated dead skin.</li>
            <li> The Yerba Prima Tampico Skin Brush is the best course fiber brush on the market for lymphatic stimulation. This being said, those with more sensitive skin may be required to soften the bristles if outer dermal layer irritation becomes an issue.&lt;br /&gt;If the Yerba Prima brush is soaked, the bristles do become softer as they also do with time as well.&lt;br /&gt;I use two brushes, one in each hand, removed from the sticks used to reach back areas, and brush the full body towards the heart to assist the lymph system in being cleansed.&lt;br /&gt;For myself and my clients...this brush is best!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, it is long enough to reach every place you want to.</li>
            <li> I had bought quite a few of these. This one is the best for the price.  Always brush away from Center for best and noticeable results</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! It was exactly what I wanted and I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> Love this brush! First time user of this type of brush and purpose but the benefits were too great to pass by. Brushing with this skin brush was a little tough at first...you have to be careful not to brush to hard. But once your skin is use to the toughness of the bristles, its easy sailing. You will notice obvious difference after first use. Your skin will be free of that dead skin layer that bothers and hinders new healthier skin. I would recommend this brush to anyone that needs to regenerate healthier skin and tightening . Also, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive either!</li>
            <li> 1st off I&#x27;m new to dry brushing but have read numerous articles about it. All I can say is I love this brush! At first it felt like it would be too harsh but on the second day me &amp; my skin were saying &amp;#34;aaaahhh&amp;#34;  I actually felt a difference in my skin I had a glow you could say. It definitely has gotten smoother. I have fallen off my regular  routine of brushing before I shower but I&#x27;m back on it as of tomorrow. You can&#x27;t go wrong w/this brush!</li>
            <li> Excellent  brush for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Very stiff and intense, but somehow it does not hurt/damage your skin. (Like all super enjoyable things, moderation is recommended.)</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic of dry brushing until I researched the topic and found this particular brush! I am a true believer in the benefits of dry brushing, as I see layers of dead skin falling off before I get into the shower. This is a great product, and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> used it several times, very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> HARD. But it feels sooo good.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush when i saw some youtube videos saying a bunch of nice stuff like remove dead skin cells, detox and lot of health benefits. But the thing that someone said was it was good for weight loss! Not sure if it has really done any weight loss but after pregnancy the word claiming &#x27;weight loss&#x27;, yes..that will make your mind say its for you!LOL! So i bought it the same day i saw the video and tried it after i received, OMG the bristles are really rough, I guess i was not ready for a harsh dry exfoliation. I regretted my buy and kept it aside.&lt;br /&gt;After around 6 months I wanted to give it a try when my body was normal and could take the roughness...OMG i now understand why so many people recommend and its so good for health. You just feel so alive after brushing and hopping in shower. My skin has become more soft, am sure it is helping in all the things it claims but my skin is so much healthy.&lt;br /&gt;BTW the handle keeps coming off now, so i just use the brush and no longer the handle. Also i use couple of times a week before going in shower.</li>
            <li> This will leave your skin so soft I have bought so many of these.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this brush!!! It would highly recommenced this brush to others. you can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality!!</li>
            <li> I like how the handle is removable. I guess it does what its supposed to but the one I got has some bristles that fall out and some are really long like it didnt get cut properly. It leaves scratches sometimes too (even using barely any pressure and being gentle) so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong or why it leaves scratches. Its an okay brush though, maybe its just the one i got that has those problems.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a dry body brush for awhile now and searched for best dry body brushes online and this is the one that was listed as number one. If you are looking for a good firm, but not hard, brush this is it. I love it. It stimulates my skin and is going to be perfect for winter to slough off those dead skin cells. I plan on making buying this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Just began dry brushing and I just love it!  The price is great too!: wish it had a hhand strap though.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC PURCHASE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this brush for 3 days now, and it feels fantastic. I can really feel my circulation being boosted. I spent time reading the reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Many say that the bristles are too hard- in my opinion, they are perfect, but I know everyone is different, so if they&#x27;re too hard for you, dont worry as they will soften the more you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Some say the brush gets mouldy easily when they use it in the shower- DONT use it in the shower, its called a &#x27;Dry&#x27; brush for a reason. You should use it on dry skin just before having a shower for best results. Wash it in warm soapy water when it feels/looks like it needs a clean. Store it out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Some say it makes their skin red- Try brushing a bit lighter, although skin redness is a sign of the circulation being boosted, so dont worry too much about it. When I use it, if I brush the same area for too long, then my skin will turn red, so I aim to keep the brush moving on different parts of my skin. You can look up helpful video tutorials on how to correctly skin brush on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in conclusion, it is a fantastic brush, it does what it is supossed to do and is made with great quality and care. The bristles dont fall out either. I would recommend this brush to anyone interested in dry brushing</li>
            <li> First one I ordered had no handle.  Second one price went up.  What&#x27;s up?</li>
            <li> Very high quality brush! I&#x27;m new to dry brushing and I love my Tampico! Great price. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Bought 2.  My husband liked his and I thought it was a bit stiff.  Over all they are very nice brushes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Shipped really quickly. Great price too. The brush is separate from the handle but they attach so you can easily hold the brush head or attach the handle for a longer reach.</li>
            <li> The detachable handle is were its at, super easy to use without dealing with the goofy handle in the way</li>
            <li> Works great.  Good for scrubbing the back when taking a shower.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super hard!!!! I know they need to b to exfoliate but this are super hard!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my mother for Christmas. She loved it so much she bought one for each of us kids! My whole family loves dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Yerba Prima Tampico is an essential exfoliator brush for shower. I use it every time. Bristles are very stiff and hard, but that is what I like about it. I feel really clean when I take the time to cover most of my skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are tough.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a great price--natural materials that feel good in your hand.  As I use it brushing up toward my heart for an improved circulation bonus, the handle is superfluous but it removes easily.  Would buy again (but probably won&#x27;t have to.)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected. Good sized brush for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortably stiff &amp; rough. I don&#x27;t know if I can get used to using it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, I have been body brushing for over a year. Its therapeutic, plus extremely good for my body, skin &amp; circulation. This brush will feel still &amp; hard til you get used to it, especially if you haven&#x27;t body brushed before, but it seems that my skin gets red quicker which tells me my circulation is working quicker than a soft bristled brush, I am thin with a lot of cellulite, menopause :( so the quick circulation is a benefit for my body .. you will get used to the feeling, its like a tingling, &amp; the redness goes away within 1 min.  Your body will thank you :)</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the products.  I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> This brush is not for the timid.  These are strong bristles but do soften a bit over time but no too much so you still get that nice scratch when using it.  No good for lotions if that&#x27;s what your after.  Way better than those sponge type back cleaners.  The head does remove from the handle if you want  but my experience with all wedge handles like this eventually the brush doesn&#x27;t want to stay on and this one was no different.  I don&#x27;t take mine off so I give it a  little Gorilla glue and it&#x27;s on there forever.  Will definitely look for this one again when or if it wears out.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love my skin brush! It is perfect! Dry brushing is very new to me. I just heard about it and now do it daily before my shower.</li>
            <li> This is a quality dry skin brush. And it is super appealing that it is made in the USA! Cudos!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I am glad I bought it. I have never  used a dry brush before but it really does make your skin look and feel better. I probably use it 3-4 times a week. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love that the product has a detachable head. Although the head has fallen off while hanging up before. Overall nice product.</li>
            <li> I love the roughness of this brush and its durability. I&#x27;ve been using it since March of 2013 and it&#x27;s only lost maybe 3 bristles in that time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Best way to clean it is with Dr. bronner&#x27;s liquid hemp soup!)</li>
            <li> This brush works well for skin brushing prior to bathing. The handle is helpful for reaching your back and legs. The bristles are firm enough to stimulate the skin without scratching and helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush. It&#x27;s a little difficult for me hold on too, due to a stroke.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about 3-4 months now. The first 2 times using it I noticed a difference immediately, my skin was much softer and more smooth. I use it as a way to help my lymph flow better as I have acne and think it&#x27;s one of the causes, so I brush towards my heart. I usually brush myself before shower, and the effect is very good. When I brush my face gently I find that my Clarisonic works much smoother as well, great bonus there. Brush is not too rough and does not hurt me at all, in fact it feels SO GOOD (especially if you have an itchy back or something, no more painful scratches from sharp finger nails!).&lt;br /&gt;Great product, have recommended it, and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is the absolute best. I have seen my body change right before my eyes. I literally see the cellulite become smooth.</li>
            <li> Well constructed.  Not too hard on the skin.  Works well for its intended purposes.  I would recommend this product. Bye.</li>
            <li> I like this brush. It&#x27;s soft enough but still gets the job done. I like you can use it with the handle or without.&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for myself and 2 other family members</li>
            <li> The product is well made but the bristles are stiffer than what I am used to for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Best shower utensil to ever be created. Can literally scrub the dirt off your skin. A bit rough at first but then you get used to it.</li>
            <li> My favorite body brush! Super sturdy and feels great! I need to buy another one soon!</li>
            <li> I luv the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> Too stiff/scratchy/painful to use on my skin</li>
            <li> Good solid product for my husband. Since he has yet to use it a follow up review with come after this.  Thus far very happy with the delivery service and quality of the brush.</li>
            <li> Good stiff bristled brush that really makes you feel cleaner when you use it. It is a favorite of mine!</li>
            <li> After reading a blog post about skin brushes, I had to try this thing out. I looked online and ordered this one. Before it came in, I saw others that were less expensive at the store. :( When this came in, I was not disappointed. This brush is super sturdy, dries really quickly after washing and has a detachable handle. (the ones at the store did not have detachable handles.) The brush never falls off it&#x27;s handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is long enough, but not too long to fit in the cabinet.</li>
            <li> Really great exfoliating brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush, but not worth the function design.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first - it seemed like the bristles were very stiff (either they have softened already or my skin has adjusted quickly).  I have used the product 4 times now and I have had pretty dramatic, noticable results!  I&#x27;m amazed and would recommend it to anyone for dry skin brushing.  I also LOVE there the head of the brush is detachable so I can use it in my palm once in awhile and so I can simply replace the head when it&#x27;s time.  That&#x27;s an economical AND environmentally frienldy option.  Great, great product, especially for the reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the quality of the product and it is so easy to use in the shower!  The nice long handle makes it easy to reach all areas of your back.</li>
            <li> Never used a skin brush before. Bought one after reading up on how skin brushing + coconut oil could help my dry skin stay moisturized. Bought the Yerba brush because of all the great reviews. So far, I concur! Love the long handle which helps reach the middle of my back. Brushing does hurt a little, but I&#x27;m agree with the mindset &amp;#34;no pain, no gain.&amp;#34; Sometimes it even feels good hahaha! Got the husband to try it out too and he likes it as well.</li>
            <li> Well made brush. Nice bristles - perfect for dry brushing your skin before you shower or in the shower. The handle length is perfect so you can reach your back.</li>
            <li> We received the brush promptly and it is very good quality.  Sturdy wooden handle that is long enough to reach your back, and my husband likes that the handle is removable so he can just use the brush part in his hand. My only gripe is that the bristles are very stiff and it is actually too rough for me to use on my whole body. I would prefer a much softer brush for my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for dry brushing and am really happy with the results. The bristles are stiff but not so stiff that they bother my extremely sensitive skin. Sensitive as in I have a lot of allergies and even minor skin trauma such as a scratch can set off a psoriasis outbreak, so I&#x27;m very careful with the products I use. I like that the handle can be removed from the base of the brush but that I also haven&#x27;t had any issues with the two parts coming apart when I don&#x27;t want them to. I chose to wash the brush in warm soapy water (using a small amount of dish soap) before using it. The bristles seemed a bit softer afterwards. A heads up on price, though. I found that this brush was a little cheaper at my local Whole Foods store.</li>
            <li> I use this for &amp;#34;dry brushing&amp;#34;. The bristles are firm enough to accomplish the task, but soft enough to be comfortable. I like that the handle is removable which makes it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Have bought others that have fallen appart ,this one is of good quality &amp; does a good job for dry brushing,does not scratch the skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are the PERFECT stiffness. It&#x27;s not so much stiffness, but the brushes don&#x27;t scratch too much so they hurt, but not gentle enough to deeply exfoliate the skin. Absolutely love this brush. The handle in the back slides on the bar; the bar has an opening on the back that gets narrow so it slides in until stuck, but easily comes out. It&#x27;s big enough to use just the bar alone and covers a good amount of skin. I was scared it was going to be small but it&#x27;s really a good sized brush. Recommended if you&#x27;re skin&#x27;s not deathly sensitive.</li>
            <li> Very good quality brush. I got it for body brushing, as I had recently heard of this as a detoxing method.  It was a different experience, but wasn&#x27;t bad.  I didn&#x27;t know how, but found a couple how to videos on you tube to follow.  It was pretty easy to figure out.  This brush didn&#x27;t hurt, but wasn&#x27;t so soft that I couldn&#x27;t feel it either.  Also, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; as I was a little worried it might either.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and you can feel that it is well made. The handle comes off the head easily, it just operates on a type of wedge/groove system to fasten the handle to the head while remaining removable. The bristles feel good, they are a little rough at first, but soften up well. Very surprised that something with this level of quality is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I have had several skin brushes before but the bristles on this made scratch marks in my skin. I do not think that bristles are supposed to be that tough in my understanding. With just a light brush, it was quite painful.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out how to take the head apart from the handle yet, but it hasn&#x27;t really been necessary.</li>
            <li> Maybe, it&#x27;s because the brush is new but it&#x27;s not soft at all on the skin!!!!!!! Pretty harsh actually....So, giving it a week...</li>
            <li> The Yerba Prima Skin brush was a totally new experience for me,but being on a health trip and wanting to ensure my lymphatic system is in top shape, and after numerous good reviews, I purchased 3 brushes. My wife and I have been using them every morning and we love the feeling of &amp;#34;goodness&amp;#34; that comes after you brush your skin prior to showering. First time I had to wash the brush and use it in the shower to soften the bristles but after that I use it every day, I use it before the shower and inside while showering. Now my 9 year old has picked up ours and brushes herself with it before every shower so passing along good habits to my girls.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It is reasonably priced and lasts a long time.  I also like the option of removing the brush part from the handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. Perfect for dry brushing</li>
            <li> This is a very nice skin brush - firm bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Great Service, quick shipping, awesome product...</li>
            <li> Awesome skin brush!! It&#x27;s so weird to see all the skin particles in the air but satisfying because you know it&#x27;s removing all the dead skin that no longer serves you.  I use it about 4 times a week for a month and have definitely seen a difference in cellulite, along with my skin feeling softer. I have very rough and thick skin and have tried lots of different exfoliators and moisturizers and I think I found the perfect combo. I use this brush for exfoliation and then follow up with sunflower oil.  Look into the sunflower oil, it&#x27;s an absolute must-have.  Absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  Hello summer dresses!</li>
            <li> Nice brush, soft bristles but sturdy enough to get rid of dead skin!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush that I have purchased thus far.  It is firm and hard just the way I like it.  I use it as a back scratcher, and it definitely stops my back from itching.</li>
            <li> The heaf of the brush kept falling off of the handle (it is two pieces). Plus it molded while hanging in my shower after only a few months.</li>
            <li> With consistent use, my skin issues have resolved! I would recommend replacing every few months, but for this price, it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li> We have used these brushes for years and have not found any that can compare to them. The best we think on the market</li>
            <li> Comfortable handle and stiff bristles.  Feels nice if you don&#x27;t press hard.  I&#x27;ve always had an itchy back so I decided to purchase this thinking it will help.  Have yet to use it enough to really say if it makes a difference but I feel like it can if I start dry brushing several times a week.  It definitely feels better than I thought it would.  Best to do before showering.  Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful! The entire family uses it and can really feel the increased circulation.</li>
            <li> I bought this for dry brushing.  I am very new to the practice so I am not sure if the bristles are really supposed to be this intense or if this brush is just extra rough.  Like is it supposed to be one of those &#x27;hurts so good&#x27; type of things?  I&#x27;m assuming that over time, I&#x27;ll get used to the stiffness.  At this point, it&#x27;s still pretty scratchy and painful but the sting quickly dissipates so maybe it&#x27;s working?!  As for the handle, there are two different ways to slide the long part in, when done correctly it is very stable.  Though, I never use the handle, I just hold the brush head so no matter.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more bristles. They can make the bristles dense and shorter and use the same amount for a better product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this! I use it for dry brushing. My skin feels so great afterwards. Does a fabulous job exfoliating!</li>
            <li> This feels great for both wet and dry?  Only problem ... I used it three times in the shower and it cracked in two places on the brush head, so I have to return it. For that it gets only 1 star.  What a waste of time and postage.  Anyone else have this problem?</li>
            <li> I just love this brush.  It is very sturdy and the bristles are stiff without being too stiff.  It feels so good on my back.  I would buy from this maker again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels after using this brush for the first time! I like that you can take the brush head off the handle or leave it on. Great brush and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I admit i don&#x27;t have much to compare it to because this is my first brush but it seemed to be exactly what i expected. It does what it&#x27;s designed to do. It&#x27;s well made. Doesn&#x27;t strike me as something that will fall apart any time soon. The brush comes off the handle for ease of use. The bristles are pretty firm and exfoliate well. Great and inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little scratchy but I believe it works great.  The length of the handle makes it easy to reach the whole body.</li>
            <li> The handle always detaches itself which makes the brush fall...coincidentally on my foot each time grr&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual brush works great!!</li>
            <li> its a great brush for dry brushing, it doesn&#x27;t leave hairs from the brush all over, lightweight and does the job well, love it and fast shipping from this seller...</li>
            <li> Too stiff. I can&#x27;t use this, not even when it&#x27;s wet. It feels like it&#x27;s scratching my skin, and feels terrible. I&#x27;ll save it for scrubbing walls or something.</li>
            <li> I had recently heard of all of the benefits of dry brushing. Not sure if it&#x27;s true but I gave this brush a try anyway. It rocks!High quality at a great price. While I don&#x27;t believe it is a great miracle for cellulite removal,I do think it does wonders for the skin. Think about it, if you have body blemishes (AKA &amp;#34;backne&amp;#34;),removing the dead skin on top of the blemishes can help to heal them faster and rejuvenate the skin-be gentle of course!I am planning on gifting these to new moms as well as other add-ons to birthday gifts.</li>
            <li> I have two of these, because I thought I lost the first one and ordered another. they are fantastic and simple. I never relaized what skin brushing could really do the body. my skin is so smooth and clear, because of how fast it eliminates toxins now!</li>
            <li> It took me a few times to get used to it, but now I thoroughly enjoy the sensation and how soft my skin feels after.</li>
            <li> High quality...love it!!!!!!! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new brush. It is very good quality. The bristles are sturdy, but not excessively rough. Start off using light pressure and increase as your skin adjusts to it. It does feel good and makes your skin so soft &amp; smooth!</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ordered to date, skin feeling smoother already.</li>
            <li> Excellent skin brush, albeit a bit more abrasive than I would have liked, but that&#x27;s coming from someone with rather sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and can say that it&#x27;s quite an invigorating experience. Takes off the dead skin cells and is a great exfoliator, as long as you&#x27;re gentle enough using it. Enjoying it thus far!</li>
            <li> Works great! My skin feels so smooth after brushing. I can see the dead skin falling off, its awesome! Delivery was great!</li>
            <li> Item broke after using it less then 10 times.  Brush broke in half.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush very much. It is well made and the bristles are not to soft or to stiff.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush--it&#x27;s not too abrasive, and I really like that it has the long handle for making it easier to brush.</li>
            <li> Mold and mildrew will build up on the wood if exposed to water.  I left the brush in a holder where it is constantly exposed to shower water.  Started noticing mold and mildrew building up.  Soaked in bleach and cleaned up after some time.  I must have some tough skin because the bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as I would like them.  Head keeps falling off.  However when I needed to clean the mold off I couldn&#x27;t get the head to come off.  Rarely use now and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice.. They definitely exfoliate that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> I have one that&#x27;s near 20 years old and it&#x27;s still worth keeping.  Nice and stiff bristles.  It&#x27;s the roughest skin brush I&#x27;ve been able to find in years.  Very relaxing to use; brush away your agitation and grumpiness.</li>
            <li> Better than a back scratcher and a great wake-me-up each morning.  Dry brushing with this brush (the handle stays on well, but removes easily as needed) is energizing and I have much less dead skin clinging to me in the winter.  Excellent dry brush!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush particularly for dry brushing.  The bristles are nice and firm for that purpose.  I don&#x27;t remove the brush from the handle (mostly because I&#x27;m afraid I would be able to get it back on).  The brush has not come off the handle, which I&#x27;ve experienced before.  This works great for me</li>
            <li> im impressed.  dry brushing was one thing i needed to do definitely for my lymphatic system.  i am glad i began and this brush is awesome.  be gentle...</li>
            <li> I am trying to get healthy so I discovered that body brushing is a good thing and I love this brush for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Skin brushing is an excellent way to promote detoxification and to flush out toxins throughout your blood and skin. I use this every day before a hot and then cold shower to promote flushing. Make sure to do some research and always brush towards the heart to maximize the benefits. The bristles are rough and my boyfriend thinks they rather hurt, but, I think they do their job well. No pain no gain.</li>
            <li> After reading all the benefits of skin brushing, I decided I would give it a try. Afraid that brushes would irritate my very sensitive skin, I did some research and came upon this brush. The bristles are sturdy but not too harsh, and you can take the paddle off the stick if you prefer a more manual approach. I haven&#x27;t seen much shedding from the bristles, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s pretty well built. The benefits of skin brushing (per Dr. Mercola) are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1. Stimulate Your Lymphatic System&lt;br /&gt;2. Exfoliation&lt;br /&gt;3. Increase Circulation&lt;br /&gt;4. Reduce Cellulite&lt;br /&gt;5. Stress Relief&lt;br /&gt;6. Improve Digestion and Kidney Function&lt;br /&gt;7. It&#x27;s Invigorating&lt;br /&gt;My main reason was to improve the tightness of my skin, and to reduce the cellulite. There&#x27;s been a lot of research that shows this is one of the most effective ways to improve your skin for these conditions. I&#x27;m only a newbie thus far, so I have yet to see results, but in the meantime, it is making my skin a lot smoother and more supple!</li>
            <li> Just as described!  I had no idea that brushing my skin would be such a treat!  Highly recommend!  Product is durable and washable.</li>
            <li> Hoping for better. Handle is kind of short. Not a comfortable scrub ,feels needly. Not what I expected. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have done many cleanses over the years, and many of them recommend dry skin brushing as it helps with the lymph flow. It&#x27;s always recommended to brush towards the heart. It also helps remove dry skin which is also nice. The bristles aren&#x27;t too harsh. I actually feel  invigorated after doing dry skin brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> Very stiff brush, the bristles are certainly not for the faint of heart. For ankles, legs, back this is wonderful. Be careful using this in more delicate areas though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive skin brush to start dry brushing. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin! It looks so much healthier and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Nice brush. Purchased to start body brushing and it does the job well. My only complaint is what others have mentioned.. the head of the brush often slips off of the stick and falls to the ground during brushing. It&#x27;s easy to put back on but I took off a star for that.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, but you need to use a very light touch or it can be pretty rough on your skin. Great price though.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed. After just 4 gentle uses, the brush began to crack through the middle. I contacted both the seller and the company, no response from either. After only a week, now the handle won&#x27;t even stay on because of the crack. I was planning on buying the brush for some other people, now I never will. I really expected better from the company.</li>
            <li> Loving this body brush!!!  Wow ive used it just a few times and my skin is already super softer and shinier! It hurts a little if done to hard or long but just brush lightly and u will love it too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to dry skin brushing -- and am sold on it!  It really does get your circulation going and helps slough away dry skin.  A great feeling!</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for dry skin brushing. My mom had done skin brushing for many years and she does not have one bit of cellulite and she swears that its due to skin brushing. I had always heard of the benefits of skin brushing and I feel like its very important to aid our body in detoxing because lymph only moves around if we stay active but if someone is sedentary the lymph just sits there and your body can&#x27;t get rid of toxins. Its a great quality brush and once I finish the skin brushing my skin is sooo soft. I will keep incorporating it into my daily routine to receive all the benefits.</li>
            <li> Made very well. Doesn&#x27;t loose bristles with use like some other brushes I&#x27;ve used. Has the perfect firmness for my taste.</li>
            <li> I was worried about this buy initially because of the comments about the brush being rough on sensitive skin, but I have sensitive skin and it ain&#x27;t too shabby! Just gotta be gentle. Love the brush though - it&#x27;s cheap and the removable handle is easy/awesome. Since I got it, my body acne has been significantly reduced! (You know those bumps on the back of your arms? Practically gone ladies!)</li>
            <li> I have used this once so far and has already  made  a  big difference in  my skin.</li>
            <li> Great brush for dry-brushing.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have one, buy one.  This is not your ordinary body brush.  This brush exfoliates and detox you from head to toe, making your skin glow because it encourages new skin and brushes off the old.      The bristle are organic, no man-made fibers.</li>
            <li> What I love about this brush is that it feels so natural.  I use it lightly all over my body, right before I shower every other day.  Watch out, if you scrub too hard, you might scratch yourself :)  It&#x27;s slightly rough-  so a light brushing is perfectly okay.  I can tell you that my skin looks, and feels healthier and vibrant.  My body absorbs the body oil I use on my body after showering better-- which results to making the dry scales on my skin disappear.  I do like it, i feel refreshed and it works.  I think men would like it better.</li>
            <li> Oh the joy of dry skin brushing every morning before a shower!  I&#x27;ve done it for thirty years and wouldn&#x27;t want to do without it, like brushing your teeth.  This is a particularly good brush for devotees and newcomers.</li>
            <li> good product as described :)</li>
            <li> I got this after reading that these are great for keratosis pilaris and they really are. It makes a big difference without any chemicals or creams. I&#x27;m glad I discovered this.</li>
            <li> Wish the handle came off for scrubbing close up, but still a great brush. If they sold a handheld one I would want both.</li>
            <li> I used this once and the hands fell out of the brush. I have to insert it each time and even then it falls out as I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> I love dry brushing and love this brush and the removable handle.  I would definitely buy it again.  My skin looks great and feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It makes my skin feel soft and I like the fack I can reach my back without straining.</li>
            <li> THE BRISTOLS ARE VERY FIRM AND THEY SEEM WELL ATTACHED TO THE HEAD,&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD SCRUBBING OUT IT WITH FOR ME WAS DIFFICULT WITH&lt;br /&gt; OTHER SOFTER BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> This  skin brush is quite firm but, does exactly what it is suppose to do. For those of you with sensitive skin, a lighter touch is require but, it is does what it is suppose to do. Happy detoxification!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to use it much but excited to see the results. Hopefully it works!</li>
            <li> This brush has a great handle and is good for reaching those hard to get places. I bought one for the bathroom and one I have for washing my car as the brush is firm but not too firm when cleaning my car.</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality. good for the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush seem harsh at first, but my skin feels great.  Handle is very convenient.  I am new to dry skin brushing.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I heard about dry brushing on Pinterest.  I have dry and bumpy skin but other kinds of exfoliating either don&#x27;t work or are irritating.  I like the long handle.  It felt rough at first but I have gotten used to it.  I notice a difference in my skin being less flaky.</li>
            <li> So I came across dry body brushing on a health blog that popped up in my news reader app. Having really dry skin in the winter, and body scrubs and lotions never really working too well, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;ve used this brush for two weeks now every day before showering, and I have to say it is working. It helps to slough off dry skin, and my knees, elbows, and knuckles are looking a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it really is invigorating. Not sure why, but it does seem to help get the blood pumping in the morning. I&#x27;m a little dubious about all the other claims out there (my lymphatic system is now 20 years younger and my kidneys have never looked better!), but it does help with dry skin and a gives a quick morning charge.</li>
            <li> I got this brush to help clean and scratch my back when in the tub or shower.  It works wonderfully.  It is coarse but not too rough and does an excellent job.  My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> Strong and durable! It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve ever bought so I was startled when it came off the stick! But yeah it&#x27;s supposed to... Lol</li>
            <li> It occurred to me when buying that the wood did not appear to be sealed in the photo.  I thought about sealing it myself after delivery, but who needs to make a project out of every purchase?  Went ahead and used the brush as-is in the shower and made sure to leave it somewhere to fully dry afterwards.  Sizable splits formed along the outer rim of the brush grip after 3 uses.  What seems a simple and straightforward design is flawed by a cheap untreated softwood.  BOTTOM LINE: Find a more durable alternative if you&#x27;re going to use this brush near water.</li>
            <li> Feels great!  Really enjoy using</li>
            <li> great quality and great price! if you&#x27;re looking for a skin brush, look no further. i like that it comes with a removable handle. i personally don&#x27;t have to use the handle, but it&#x27;s nice to have an option. the bristles are nice and firm.</li>
            <li> I am on a detox regime and I bought this for dry brush massage. It is one of the few natural bristle brushes available at a very reasonable price. The handle is long enough to comfortably brush your back and I love that it detaches from the handle.</li>
            <li> This is a little rough and I have experienced a few breakouts and raw skin. I was being gentle too. I tried running the brush under hot water and then drying it out, but that didn&#x27;t help either. I like the idea of and the benefits that dry brushing is supposed to exhibit but I&#x27;m not seeing any of that right now. I think I will have to dry another softer brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and use it daily (dry) as part of a detox routine.  It feels rough at first but now I love it!  I have zero eczema/rough patches and I have always had roughness on my arms/legs.  My kids love for me to brush them as well.  Great price and really great customer service from seller.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Skin looks brighter and healthier after a week of daily use.</li>
            <li> I did my brushing for the first time and started feeling really sick to my stomach. I kept brushing until finished and I felt weird and sick so I looked it up and I gathered this happens to some people because the lymph is moving and detoxifying your system. The sickness only lasted maybe 5 minutes or less but that really proved to me that the little brushing I did was effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are stiff so it is a bit of a surprise at first but it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I felt much more awake after I did it. I didn&#x27;t think I had dry skin but I saw dust coming off my leg when I was brushing so it was exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I buy things like this and only use them a few times before putting them in a drawer and forgetting about them. That is why I put a little nail in the wall and hung it outside my shower because I think lymph brushing is a good thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click the button if this review helped you at all.</li>
            <li> Great brush. The handle comes off all the time, so it can&#x27;t be used for reaching the back.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. I have had no problems keeping the brush and handle together as other reviewers have. I use the brush every morning before i shower. I see an improvement in my skin, as well. I have less dry, flakey skin. The brush has slowly helped remove the calluses on the bottom of my feet, which I thought would be impossible. Also, I am new to dry skin brushing, and this product is great for a beginner. It&#x27;s not too soft or too course.</li>
            <li> No directions included regarding the handle. It does not seem to fit into the brush and falls off.  No directions regarding use of brush or anything else.  Was also delivered late.</li>
            <li> Does what it should.  It has a long handle and works well.  Good price as well.  I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Bristles are pretty stiff and hard when new, but after a few days in the shower, they become softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head comes off easily--that&#x27;s by design--so I put a spot of Gorilla Glue on it to keep it from falling off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this brush several times before, and I&#x27;ll buy again. It will last 8-10 months and then it&#x27;s time for a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made for human skin, I would say it would find the use for my dog only. Planning on returning it.</li>
            <li> Works great for the reduction of the appearance of rough textured skin as well as improves the circulation, look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> really exfoliates the skin</li>
            <li> Great brush! Will leave you feeling refreshed and ready for the day. A little too harsh on softer areas of the skin but manageable.</li>
            <li> Well made, but had to decide how to put on the handle! There are no directions, so I looked back at the picture. This brush feels great. Some may like a softer brush.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, well packaged.  Brush is in great condition, does not seem like it will break or wear easily.  Bristles do not fall out or break off easily.  The bristles are the perfect texture for dry brushing-not too rough or too soft.  satisfied customer here.</li>
            <li> Great back brush or bottom of feet.......used them many years.  I replace them every 6 to 8 months of heavy use.&lt;br /&gt;Natural bristles do a better job than the plastic synthetic type.  Much better than Loofa to me.</li>
            <li> Meh. Not sure what all the good reviews are about. The bristles are like steel and are so coarse that soap won&#x27;t lather on it. Seriously, you could use this brush to clean your BBQ or take the paint off your car. Maybe use it as a weapon. The sky&#x27;s the limit, I suppose. Oh, one other major problem with it: when you first get the brush, the bristles STINK so bad you can hardly stand to be in the shower with it. The smell goes away after a week or so, though. Either that, or your nose just gives up and accepts its fate.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very harsh on skin so I do not recommend!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this as a gift for my friend.  I have owned mine for about 8 years and it hasn&#x27;t lost a bristle, cracked, warped or changed in any way since I purchased it.  Well maybe it got a bit softer over time which is good because some may think of it as &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; at first, especially if used dry.  Others would call it &amp;#34;invigorating.&amp;#34;  I use mine exclusively for dry brushing your skin, but have not used it in the shower, so I cannot comment on wet brushing. I highly recommend this particular product and I would certainly buy two of them because it makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> Got this for dry brushing. Seems to do the job, bristles are on the hard side so really can only be used on less sensitive areas  like limbs and butt. Decent for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a similar brush I had had for years.  The bristles are nice and stiff and feel scratchy on your skin even with light pressure.  After about a week of use in the shower the head fell off.  It will not stay on.  Since then the wood has started to check/crack. This is poor quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old lady with thin skin that bruises easily. I have had no trouble using this brush. I like it very much, and agree with other reviewers that it smooths skin and leaves a very nice tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> Stiff!! It&#x27;s supposed to be, but need to be gentle.</li>
            <li> Very well made and does the job.  Initially purchased due to circulation issues, and has drastically improved that situation.  BUT, has also made a tremendous difference in my (dry) skin.  I highly recommend use BEFORE  vacuuming, &#x27;cause it really sluffs off the dead skin.  Have had for 3 months and use it almost every day ... shows no wear at all.  If this thing ever does break, I&#x27;ll replace it immediately with another!</li>
            <li> The brush cleans the shit out of you.  I got this to scrub my back properly and it goes a great job.  The head is removable, it you don&#x27;t want to use the handle.  This thing will remove all your dead skin leaving you all nice</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in this brush,the handle has fallen off once and the bristles seem to become misshapen,,I like the way it feels don&#x27;t feel like it was a very good value.</li>
            <li> This skin brush does an excellent job. I use it as a dry skin brush and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! The handle is the right length to reach your back. Excellent for dry body brushing. I&#x27;ve ordered them for gifts as well.</li>
            <li> This thing&#x27;s a rockstar. It&#x27;s a little abrasive at first but you come to love the feeling. After the first time using it I got into the shower and my loofah literally glided across my skin instead of feeling like sandpaper like it has for years. Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t start using these sooner. Wish I could use it on my face!</li>
            <li> Great brush, great condition. Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Love the firmness of this body brush.  It was recommended for aiding in getting dead skin removed.</li>
            <li> The handle doesn&#x27;t stay attached to the brush. This is a poorly made product</li>
            <li> The bristles are very rough and somewhat painful. The perfect product when you want to literally scrub yourself with a cactus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the questionable choice of a cactus as the perfect bristle material, it&#x27;s beautifully made.</li>
            <li> This brush is to hard for me to use and it leaves little scratches on my skin.  I would not recommend it for body brushing.</li>
            <li> I had one in the past and it was just time for a new one. Love the brush, love the price, and I love my skin ever since I started body brushing.</li>
            <li> Bristle are nice and firm very durable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for skin brushing.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Packaged very well. The bristles felt so good but I almost skinned myself the first time I used it -ha,ha! That experience taught me to be super gentle while brushing my skin. Gently brushing my back felt especially wonderful. All in all nice product would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it! I dry brush before my showers. Already notice smoother and softer skin.</li>
            <li> This brush is great! Rough but not too rough. Feels amazing - I use for dry skin brushing. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell the difference with my skin since I started using this brush.  It is soooo soft.  I highly recommend this brush and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived as promised.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I like it and use it in the shower.  Nice stiff bristles.  Brush may come off handle if not properly seated.  Tap end of handle (that is the end opposite the brush) on the floor several times.  If brush comes off, replace and tap harder next time.</li>
            <li> I fell into all the &amp;#34;dry brush&amp;#34; hype.  I have regular skin, not too sensitive but not rough.  This brush hurts!  I cannot dry brush with this because it is too painful.  Now, my husband on the other hand, loves it. If you are new to dry brushing or have sensitive skin, this is not the brush for you.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Love how the handle is removable</li>
            <li> dry brushing your skin is the best feeling--really wakes me up in the morning using this durable yet gentle brush. follow the instructions on the tag for best results!</li>
            <li> The bristle ends are sharp and scratchy so I don&#x27;t use it on my body but it works great at cleaning my bathtub and tile!</li>
            <li> Dry or wet, I love this brush.  Handle is perfect length.  It is scratchy when dry but oh so good for a back rub.  I have read complaints about the handle coming off.  Not a big deal, it was designed to come off.  Just put it back on.  You could use gorilla glue to keep it on if it annoys you.  The handle comes off so you can use it in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> A little rough at first but I got used to it.  It is great to use this for circulation and skin &amp;#34;renewal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Perfect size.  Helps your skin feel awake when you use it.</li>
            <li> Didnt notice much of a difference until i got the detox body wraps...they work well together.</li>
            <li> This thing is nice! Good price for what it is, natural brush and it feels good, so glad I learned about dry brushing I think it is important and will make this a long term habit.</li>
            <li> Skin brush in the sauna feels amazing!</li>
            <li> This brush is quite stiff, good for feet and calves. I had to buy a softer brush for other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> My eldest daughter introduced me to the Yerba skin brush. I am a grandmother and have thin, dry skin that is part of the aging. Ugh! Following my daughter&#x27;s suggestion, I purchase the Yerba brush. The long handle makes it easy to do you feet and legs. I highly recommend this long handled brush. I brush my skin SOFTLY, apply rosewater and glycerin, following by a dry skin lotion. Fast and effective results. My skin is ever so much improved. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! I&#x27;d almost love it if not for the tricky handle that disconnects easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;I looove how baby smooth my skin is after a good brush and shower&lt;br /&gt;Strong bristles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;Detatches from the long handle really easily&lt;br /&gt;Comes with almost no instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to YouTube, I found out dry brushing only works when do it correctly (brushing in upward strokes to your heart starting from your feet) The cons with this brush are very minimal tho if you like the option of using the brush detached from the long handle but I personally start feeling like I&#x27;m a horse lol</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any miracles yet...but works well enough.</li>
            <li> Good brush, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my skin and a very fast delivery. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this!  I&#x27;m dry brushing before my showers and it feels delicious&lt;br /&gt;!  It&#x27;s only been a week and it feels quite invigorating.  A few bristles have fallen out, but maybe I just don&#x27;t have it broken in enough yet.</li>
            <li> I have never used a skin brush and after trying it the first time I was hooked. This is the brush I ordered and I like that it is organic. What I do not like is the cheap design of the handle. The back of the brush has a groove where the handle is supposed to fit into so you can attach and detach depending on your needs. My problem is that it never stays on the handle, I actually threw the handle away and just use the brush which makes getting areas like my back very difficult. In the future I will try purchasing one with a more solid handle and would recommend the same to others.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush. It is sturdy and does the job well. The only problem is that the brush is detached from the long wood stem part. I have found a way to make it stay, but it took me many tries. Otherwise it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush works great for skin brushing. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars, but I&#x27;ve had a few bristles fall out. May be just because it&#x27;s new..</li>
            <li> Love it. Does not get moldy like my last dry brush by earth therapeutics and is not as soft either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely harsh. Even light brushing is painful. If the point is to make your skin red (causing circulation to all the layers of dermis), this definitely does the trick. It&#x27;s just not enjoyable like one would expect skin brushing to be.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Easy to use and assemble.</li>
            <li> This brush is just a little too stiff for me. It was recommended to me as a pre-bath scrub. I like it on my back like a back scratcher but for the rest of my body, ouch! Maybe I can break it in, and maybe my skin is too sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, I&#x27;m not sure why the handle is removable.  Maybe there are other brush heads that you can buy.  But the handle comes off some times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have &amp;#34;scratchy&amp;#34; bath gloves that I like better.  They exfoliate the skin and you can use them like a bath buff to clean yourself.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent service, recommended</li>
            <li> This works really great particularly before self tanning.  I really love how it comes apart and can be used with or without the handle.</li>
            <li> This is my first dry brush, and I love it. It feels so good. The bristles are firm but not harsh. My six- and two-year-olds both want me to use it on their backs! We are hooked!</li>
            <li> Too hard/rough for me. Leaves scratch marks on my skin.</li>
            <li> the brush tends to fall off where it inserts into the elongator, but I do love the brush itself.</li>
            <li> The bristle are a little to hard for me, but the service was great</li>
            <li> Very glad I chose this one with a long handle. It feels great-like scratching itches all over your body that you didn&#x27;t even know itched! Easy and quick to use. No instructions on putting the brush onto the handle but easy to figure out paying close attention to the shapes.</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH IS UNBELIEVABLE!! THE FIRST TIME I USED IT I HAD NO DRY AND SCALY SKIN ON MY ELBOWS. I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND IT DID FEEL A BIT ROUGH AS I USED IT IN THE SHOWER BUT AFTER I DRIED AND LOTIONED  MY SKIN FELT SO GOOD. I ALMOST FELT LIGHTER IN WEIGHT BECAUSE THE DEAD SKIN WAS DOWN THE DRAIN. THANKS SO MUCH AND THIS BRUSH IS GOING TO MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR A FEW PEOPLE ON MY LIST THIS YEAR. ALSO, SHIPPING WAS VERY QUICK AND IT WAS PACKAGED VERY PROTECTIVELY.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. I use it all over and it works almost like a massage. I feel a big difference using it versus not using it, a lot cleaner with it. Ladies may find the brush a bit too stiff for their softer skin, but it&#x27;s great for men.</li>
            <li> Great brush, would highly recommend.  Well made and sturdy.  Have been using for 2 mos and can tell a huge difference in my skintone and energy level.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for the best body brush and this is it.  Search no further. This is the brush you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Ok Brush...a bit tough at first.  You&#x27;ll need to go light handed at first until bristles soften up a bit with use.&lt;br /&gt;Great for hands and feet from the get.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a stiff brush and wow did I find it. If STRONGLY suggest you give the bristles a serious soak before using it for the first time, then again before each use. If not, just get yourself a porcupine and a stick to use at your next bath. I tried to use it right of he box and scrubbed my arm raw on the first swipe. Once soaked, it did a great job.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product!  would buy again</li>
            <li> The Yerba Prima Tampico Skin Brush has been a fantastic purchase. I&#x27;ve owned this for a few months now and am very pleased with the quality given the affordability. The handle easily comes on and off for high accessibility around the body. The bristles rarely fall out. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This hurts a bit. I try to be soft, but it&#x27;s too scratchy.</li>
            <li> Dissatisfied- the handle falls off each time. Poor design.</li>
            <li> good product, good price</li>
            <li> This item was very well-described so I decided to try it.  The description turned out to be spot-on.  It&#x27;s well crafted out of quality materials and the bristles are neither too stiff or too soft - they&#x27;re just right!</li>
            <li> OUCH!!!!  This brush hurts!  The bristles are so hard on my skin, no matter how light I brush it, it hurts.  It leaves red scratches all over (with very light brushing!).  I couldn&#x27;t use this brush nor do I recommend it!!!  Wish I could send back for a refund!</li>
            <li> This thing is heaven! I love to use it to help remove cellulite spots. It really does work. At first, my skin was so sensitive to it, I bled from the scratches but I realized I was scrubbing too hard. Eventually, my body got used to it. I love to use it right before a spray tan and at the very end of a spray tan to get rid of any of the spots. I was using it daily for a while but it works so well, flakes of dead skin were in my bathroom and that sort of grossed me out. Maybe I just need a swiffer or something because this thing is worth it and really makes you feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely piece, made of wood and natural fibers, so I like to have it out on display, in my bathroom&lt;br /&gt;It also works very  nicely. It feels good to lightly brush the skin, before the bath or shower.&lt;br /&gt;I know it helps exfoliate and nourish the skin, so it&#x27;s a good thing to do.</li>
            <li> I received this brush about a week ago and I have used it every day since. It&#x27;s a great brush, I&#x27;ve never used a Tampico brush before, so it felt a bit rough at first, but once you get how to use it, it feels really great! My skin is so soft and smooth already, I would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> It is missing bristles straight out of the box</li>
            <li> it is so rough it makes it not usable. The handle does not stay on as well was very disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started dry brushing.  I love that this has a handle to get my back, but is removable to use on the rest of me.  GREAT quality natural bristles for the price!!  VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> love it love it, feel refreshed after using this. Although some people may feel painful at the beginning but after it getting soft, it is perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this because, like everyone else, I blindly follow Food Babe. The handle is a joke. The brush is really hard, but your skin starts to love that after awhile. So, A for the brush and F for the handle. You will NOT reach your back with this baby. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I also didn&#x27;t see all those amazing health benefits Food Babe raves about. I&#x27;m starting to believe she&#x27;s absolutely getting money to endorse these products. I&#x27;ve been had AGAIN</li>
            <li> Great skin brush!  Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Received product without the handle.</li>
            <li> Tried it out and it works fine at helping to remove dead skin. Its not a miracle worker like some people seem to think but whatever, to each their own. I think I just get bored brushing myself and feel oddly like a dog. I was using an exfoliating scrub in the shower but now use this on occasion because its much cheaper in the long run than continually buying the scrubs.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, but it&#x27;s a little too rough for me.  I have to be extra gentle when exfoliating certain areas of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find the stick component more of an inconvenience than anything.  I took it off the moment I got the brush, and I honestly don&#x27;t know what I did with it.  Might have thrown it away.  I can reach all of the spots on my body without it.  You may want to keep it for reaching spots on your back if you aren&#x27;t terribly flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make my skin very smooth and I&#x27;ve noticed less skin issues (like ashy/dry skin) this winter.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> quickly  molded and split and had to throw it out</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, it touched my body and bristles fell out. Only in one hole so I didn&#x27;t really feel like it was worth the hassle of sending it back. It isn&#x27;t made extremely well but it&#x27;s made appropriately for what you pay for it. The bristles are very rough but I like it that way. It&#x27;s a great exfoliater.</li>
            <li> Great brush!  Works well.  I looped a hair band through it to hang in the shower.</li>
            <li> so stiff that it actually hurts to skin brush with....but my skin is getting softer so I guess it works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this skin brush after learning about a technique called &amp;#34;dry brushing&amp;#34; (google it). It is supposed to increase blood flow, lymph drainage and help remove dead skin cells. If nothing else, it sure feels great! After reading the reviews, I chose to purchase this brush. It was just supposed to be my brush, but after seeing how good it felt, my whole family wants to use it (including my 2 year old). The bristles are coarse, but you are no supposed to use a lot of pressure. I was always told to only use the amount of pressure it would take to move a coin across the table. You just brush 2 minutes per day before showering and brush toward the heart (don&#x27;t brush the face) using long gentle strokes. It feels great. I did see some reviews about the handle not staying on. The wood handle needs to be turned over and inserted that way, which is opposite from the way that you would expect the wood to slide in to the back of the brush. I made that same mistake when I got the brush, but turned the handle over and slid it on that way and it has never fallen off the brush since. The company should really put that on the instructions because I had initially thought that mine was useless as well. I would definately recommend this brush if you are looking for a skin brush. The price is reasonable. The handle is long enough to reach the back. The bristles are made from tampico fiber, which is the unbleached stem of the agave plant. The instructions say to clean the brush periodically with soap and water. Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> It is very stiff and rough at the beginning until you get used to it.  It is still very firm after a long time of daily use.  I dry-brush for a few minutes before taking my shower. I can literally see the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; flying around when I brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  The delivery was fast and the brush is just right.  I used it everyday this week.</li>
            <li> The reviews actually helped me make my choice.  This brush is great,  I love it for dry brushing! It is pretty course and stuff but it works great.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing. Wish I had known about it earlier. The difference after skin brushing is noticeably seen and felt. I love it. It&#x27;s also very relaxing for me.</li>
            <li> Loving this brush. It makes my skin so smooth when I use it right before I shower, even if I haven&#x27;t put any lotion on.</li>
            <li> Nice and long with quality bristles</li>
            <li> Really liking this brush. Was a tiny bit skeptical that this would make a difference but it has.  Amin is smooth and feels good.  Glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I dry skin brush with this brush and I start my day with more energy, mental clarity, and calm. I feel so much physically better after brushing with this brush. I don&#x27;t have another brush to compare it with but this one is great for a great price!</li>
            <li> Dry brushing your skin is not new; if you haven&#x27;t tried it, then you should.  Particularly if you have dry skin, this brush is perfect before a shower, just rub lightly all over.  Put lots of conditioner on afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular brush is quite good and the price is perfect.  It&#x27;s a bit rough but just don&#x27;t rub too hard!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic item. This has made a HUGE difference in my skin. I Love It.</li>
            <li> Love this skin brush, followed by sesame oil and a shower and my skin appears so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> The brush arrived quickly but with out a handle. It&#x27;s so inexpensive, sending it back isn&#x27;t worth the time.  Been using the brush for about a week. I&#x27;ll update after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  My skin is looking good and i&#x27;m feeling the benefits of the good circulation that it enhances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for dry brushing.  Bristles are just the right stiffness.  Ordered extra brushes for the future.</li>
            <li> Yea I like it alright, but be careful and don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure into brushing, the bristles are made of wood and not boars hair.</li>
            <li> Too rough for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I store this brush with the handle removed so it can completely dry out. I it use without the handle for most scrubbing, and insert the handle for as needed. It has an aggressive scratchy feel which might be a little much at first, but you soon get used to it and actually look forward to it. Very well made.</li>
            <li> it is a nice brush but i was hoping for the bristles to be a bit softer so it felt better on the skin. Hoping after using it a bit they will loosen up!</li>
            <li> I have been happily using this brand of skin brush for 6 years and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> First time skin brusher here, and it&#x27;s a little scratchy the first 2-3 days, but getting used to it quickly.  Wonderful as a back scratcher too!!  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and care for product that gently exfoliates. Use as a &#x27;hand&#x27; brush or add the handle for a quick reach for your back. Mature, sensitive skin can be a concern when looking for skin care products and this brush offers stimulation without irritation. A great choice for me!</li>
            <li> This is my second brush.  A wonderful way to improve skin health.</li>
            <li> Works great, really love it.&lt;br /&gt;frankenseitz</li>
            <li> This brush is my first dry brush and I love it! It appears rough enough to be stimulating but not too rough to avoid using it. It was the perfect stocking stuffer - a must use, needed and priced right luxury item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for dry skin brushing for lymphatic drainage. I purchased it based on the reviews, after researching other brands. It works great and the price is right. The bristles, for me, are just the right degree of firmness, and of course you can vary the pressure yourself in how you brush. I actually really love skin brushing now, and have seen results pretty immediately; I don&#x27;t go a day without it now and am so glad I got this brush. It seems very well constructed, and I like the wooden base and handle. I don&#x27;t find that the brush falls off the handle at all - I&#x27;ve never had that problem, as some other reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this brush, it is a good quality and large head</li>
            <li> Great skin brush! It was a little rough to use at the beginning but it works great to exfoliate the skin. The top of the brush will fall off if not secure tightly otherwise a great brush.</li>
            <li> Great body brush. Just make sure to &amp;#34;install&amp;#34; the head in the right direction. If the head keeps popping off it&#x27;s installed in the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> Great value.  I use these for a Dry Brushing Service I offer along with massage.  I send the client home with the brush and instructions for home use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rough on the skin at first but then it becomes rather nice. Especially the back. Prefer using this than a back scratcher for sure!</li>
            <li> Very rough on my skin</li>
            <li> Loved it!  It is the first time for me to try dry brushing, and I did not find the brush too harsh, it was exactly what I was hoping for and I am excited to add this treatment to my beauty routine</li>
            <li> I love using this weekly. I love brushing off the dry skin while in the shower. It helps keep my skin not as dry.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this brush! Ever since I started using this brush my husband can&#x27;t keep his hands off me! Sure, my skin feels amazingly soft and silky and I&#x27;m sure my lymphatic system is benefiting but trust me it&#x27;s not worth it ladies. It&#x27;s the same thing every night, I&#x27;ve had to learn jiu jitsu just to defend myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for nothing Tampico Skin Brush!</li>
            <li> love this brush.  nice way to brush off the night and get going in the morning./</li>
            <li> This really is a must have right before summer to prep your skin for swimsuit season. It really helps to use it right before you self tan so that your application comes out flawless. My skin has never been smoother! I do agree with some of the other reviews that it is a bit stiff the first few days but the bristle do soften over time. The packaging was nice, the delivery was very fast and I&#x27;m a fan of this skin brush for life!</li>
            <li> I have used this very brush for years - keep buying more when I wear one out.  I will continue to purchase.  Great for wet or dry brushing.</li>
            <li> My skin has stopped itching and looks so much better since using it if you like nice skin try it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about how dry brushing is supposed to be so good for the lymph system, etc. And it probably is, but it also just feels really good to use it--makes my skin tingle and of course, it feels great scratching my back with it. LOL</li>
            <li> I love my skin brush!  Sometimes it is hard to take the time to use it, even though it only takes a minute.  I also feel like taking the time to put lotion all over my skin after I shower and after I use the skin brush.  I probably use it once a week, and I can tell a big difference in my skin!  I can&#x27;t tell any difference in circulation, but who would?  The bristles are hard and somewhat scratchy, but I was expecting that when I purchased it, and you aren&#x27;t supposed to scrub your skin with it, just lightly brush it.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> perfect for dry brushing</li>
            <li> I use this for dry brushing. I use to have a lot of acne scars on my back but I used this once a day and my back has toned out in color. I also use this before I shave to get all the dead skin off. I love this brush!</li>
            <li> Fell apart almost immediately and it was past the time I could return it. Very disappointing. I mean, very very.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality brush.  The bristles are pretty stiff and will scrub the hide off you until the soften, but they do soften a bit after use.  Either that or my hide is tougher.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a good shower brush that really scrubs your back.  I have oily skin and need to brush with firm bristles.  Most back brushes have fine, soft bristles that hardly do anything at all.  This one does the job and I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with it is that the handle slides into a slot on the back of the brush, and the brush falls off every day when it is hanging in the shower.  Every morning I have to slide the handle back into the slot, but no matter how well it seems to be attached it is off again the next morning.  I would prefer that it be permanently affixed to the handle.  As it is, I may use wood glue to attach it and hope that it stops coming off.</li>
            <li> Dry brushing is really great for the skin and especially necessary during the cold, dry winter months. This one gets the job done! I have sensitive skin and its a bit irritating in certain spots, but for the most part it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for dry brushing. Howevet, anything but a feather light touch scratches my skin, leaving little white marks. Couldn&#x27;t properly dry brush with this. However, it is a great exfoliating tool in the shower. The bristles are much gentler wet.</li>
            <li> Great brush for those hard to reach spots on your back! Nice little string attached for hanging up.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Good stiff bristles and the handle can be removed if you just want to use the brush by itself. Since I found out about dry brushing, my skin feels like a baby&#x27;s. Try the AmLactin 12% lotion (also on Amazon) with this and you&#x27;ll never go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> I am using the brush to help stimulate the lymphatic system.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet, after three weeks.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush, because it makes your skin smoother &amp; softer. It also is wonderful for circulation, and I love my daily ritual with it. It is really relaxing. If you&#x27;re someone who suffers with depression or something like that, I find this is a nice self- treat to wind down.</li>
            <li> Oh my...  This brush relaxes me every night after a long dy of chasing my little one around.  Not too hard and not too soft buy the bristles come off easily.</li>
            <li> I really like this skin brush.  It is bristles are just right to make your skin tingle.  I went on a trip for a week and didn&#x27;t bring it with me and I missed my morning brushing as it invigorates me in the morning.  I gave it 4 stars because the brush would fall off the handle when I hung it up (the handle and brush come apart).  So my husband drilled a hole where the handle and brush are together and inserted a peg to keep it from falling apart.  Now it works great and I can still take the peg out if I don&#x27;t want to use the handle with the brush.</li>
            <li> It does take about a week to get used to the tough bristles, but it grows on you. I use it for exfoliation, to even my skin tone and detoxification. Miss it if I don&#x27;t do it every day now!</li>
            <li> A bit harder bristles than I thought..know they have to be somewhat firm to brush away top layer of dry skin but a bit scratchy takes some getting used to but good purchase for the money..wish it had a loop to hang it as hard to store in bathroom..currently put it on towel rack</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months and I wouldn&#x27;t say I see much of a difference but then again I rarely use it. I try to dry brush at least once a week but now I&#x27;m going to start doing it again and will update this review.</li>
            <li> I use this brush daily before showering for dry brushing.  Dry brushing is good for the skin and the lymph nodes.  I feel far less bloated any my digestions seems to be better after incorporating dry brushing.</li>
            <li> love love love body brushing</li>
            <li> I feel really weird writing this review because I got on a whole kick of doing all this crazy stuff like oil pulling and using clay toothpaste.Well in my researching all of that I stumbled upon &amp;#34;skin brushing&amp;#34; which apparently has been done for generations in a lot of cultures to give the lymphatic system an extra boost in detoxing the body. When I saw the brush as an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34; for around $6 I said &amp;#34;hey, why not?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It looks to be made really well and seems that it would last a long time. I used it once and my lymph nodes in my neck got really swollen and almost sore to touch. Apparently, it does work! But I have been a little freaked out to keep doing it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> My brush broke in two after years of use. I bought another and see the tag has &amp;#34;directions for dry brushing.&amp;#34; If mine hadn&#x27;t gotten wet every time I took a shower, it would not have broken.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have tried using the new one dry instead of in the shower. It has much more effect in stimulating and exfoliating the skin when used that way, and I like it even better.</li>
            <li> I like using  this brush, but the bristles  are constantly  falling  out while I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right stiffness for my upper legs and buttocks.  The long handle makes it easy to use.  The brush is sturdy and well made.  I do wish it had a water proof sealant on it (like varnish) because it is raw wood and it shouldn&#x27;t get wet.</li>
            <li> Satisfied and as expected. Does what it claims. A bit too firm and has a skinny handle. I found a bit softer one at Walmart made by Eco tools....my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Never had a problem with these brushes. Since they are an add on item, the last time I needed one I ddin&#x27;t have a large purchase to make from Amazon so I bought a Bernard Jensen one from my health food store instead. Felt like the bristles were wore out after the first use. I&#x27;ve seen some people complain about the stiffness of this brush, but that&#x27;s how I like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skin brushing for almost 20 years and these are the best skin brushes of all  in my opinion.  Recently I&#x27;ve discovered something else they are great for.  MEN, if you have a bald head or very short hair these are the best hair brushes in the world. They provide great stimulation that is just right and never hurts.  In fact they feel so good on my dome it&#x27;s hard to stop brushing it.  Seriously these feel great on the head and neck.  You&#x27;ll feel all warm and tingly afterward but without causing pain to your noggin. The blood rush to your scalp is truly invigorating.  Try it guys, then try it on the rest of your bod.  It&#x27;s the best wake up in the morning I&#x27;ve ever found and it also improves my mood for the day.  Is it becoming clear that I like this product? Oh yeah and they last a long long time.</li>
            <li> Ouch!  Hurts my skin.  Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> Nice firm bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect -- just what I needed, and at a better price than comparable products.  I love that the handle detaches, I can pack just the brush portion if I want to travel with it.</li>
            <li> I had never dry-brushed before and all the reviews I read led me to this brush. I really enjoy the brush and the results. The extender stick is really helpful, too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t yet know if this is doing anything great for detoxing my body, but it does feel good. Also, the removable handle functionality works well.</li>
            <li> This brush is great to help keep your blood circulation going strong! It also helps sloth off dead skin cells! I was surprised at how smooth my skin was after just a few times in using it.</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> My skin has become less itchy and dry since using this dry brush. I did wash it once or twice and that softened the brush fibers up a bit. I don&#x27;t actually use any pressure because my skin is so sensitive, but gently and slowly move it across my skin. It really helps my energy levels even though it seems like such a simple technique. The brush is high quality and inexpensive so I feel like I can buy another one if needed.</li>
            <li> Great for dry brushing - the bristles are good for clearing dead skin but not too rough. The handle tends to come disconnected from the head, which is annoying. It slips back in and holds for awhile, but then falls out again.</li>
            <li> I have used this same brand brush for at least 30 years. I&#x27;m so happy they still make it and make it of the same quality.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the bathtub, as using it dry is a  bit rough, and I think that by softening my skin in the hot water, it works more thoroughly.  I&#x27;m careful to dry it between uses by placing it face down in a basket with an open weave. Each brush lasts about a year. When the bristles start getting soft, I replace it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m read-headed, and I&#x27;ve never used soap except for on my face and under my arms. With this brush, I can remove all but the toughest dirt.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had cellulite, and maybe this is one of the reasons.&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is almost half of the price at the health food store where I usually buy it.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Good service.</li>
            <li> I do not like this. I brush my skin without pushing down at all and it is extremely scratchy/painful. I have stopped using it and feel I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Loved this brush for exfoliating... Its not for people with gentile skin on their backs, but if u looking to give Ur back a good, refreshing cleaning its a great one!</li>
            <li> Love dry brushing. Really makes a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> Great quality, natural bristle brush.  I have only used it a few times, but I can already see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> nice to start but the handle is removable and after some time in the shower does not stay attached. useless now, buy one that is permanently connected.</li>
            <li> Its a great product, simple and efficient. Definately worth the money I paid. Thank for the business ! :)</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend who can&#x27;t stop raving about this brush. She&#x27;s so addicted, she travels with it. Is it working? Not sure, but she says it feels great and it feels like &amp;#34;it&#x27;s doing something.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just started using these for dry brushing my skin and I really like them.  They&#x27;re not so soft that you feel like they&#x27;re doing nothing and they&#x27;re not so hard that they feel like brillo on your skin.  I would suggest starting slowly, brushing in gentle circles and then gradually applying more pressure.  My skin feel softer after only a couple of weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Not horrible, but I was not impressed, it&#x27;s just a brush and I found it too rough.</li>
            <li> This skin exfoliating brush was just what I was hoping for. The price of a similar brush from a health and beauty store is much more expensive and the results are the same.  I know, my ex wife had one.</li>
            <li> Just OK.  Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love dry brushing and this brush is pretty good. The bristles feel nice and stiff but the handle is a little long and hard to get a good grip. It&#x27;s almost too skinny so the handles moves in your hand. I hold closer to the brush.</li>
            <li> Well made and just right for cleaning up our sauna. I&#x27;m not sure how it would be for scrubbing the back but the bristles are soft enough once they soak up a bit. High quality item.</li>
            <li> Once the bristles soften up after a few uses, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The brush comes off the handle too easily. I drilled 2 small holes in the handle and screwed it to the brush. The brush itself is nice. It&#x27;s stiff enough to get the job done without being too painful. I understand that they&#x27;re trying to make it a 2-in-1 feature but it&#x27;s more practical to make it one solid piece and just hang on to the brush area if you don&#x27;t need the handle.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I push up the bristle part into the wood handle, it will still pop out periodically. Probably should glue it.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, bristles are great for lymph brushing.</li>
            <li> Very strong bristles, definitely nice for a good scrub if you are looking for a good exfoliating brush.</li>
            <li> I swear by this brush!!</li>
            <li> The brush part came off of the handle after 4 uses. Now I have a scrub brush and cannot reach my back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped so much with dry itchy skin.  Used with oil after.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Very good quality product.</li>
            <li> Works great for back and feet. My only complaint is the handle slides into the back of the head and &amp;#34;wedges&amp;#34; in, so the brush head comes off a little too easily. Still a good product.</li>
            <li> Finally, an excellent, sturdy, natural brush that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune! I bought another.</li>
            <li> Thus is my first dry brush, it felt right, at first itime scared me.. lol after more brushes it pleased me! It feels so good.. now and later. Skin so soft and bright.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Improve circulation, I body brush before working out (dry skin of course), because dry brushing gets the blood flowing and is a good pre-warmup! Helps with cellulite as well, amazing, it really does, We are all beautiful, and this brush makes me and everyone I have gifted it to feel beautiful, confident, and healthy. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Sufficient for what it is supposed to do.  I have used them in the past.  Just have to keep dry or over time the wood warps, cracks which I would assume would happen to any wood brush.</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This brush has very stiff bristles, and it&#x27;s very good for exfoliating skin. If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle brush, this is not the one for you. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the handle very easily separates from the head since it&#x27;s not glued together, the handles just fits into a slot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this brush for about a week, but it works great.  It was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I have just begun dry brushing after reading about it a lot online and the ordering this brush. The brush had instructions and came well packaged and ready to use. I like the linger handle cause I am able to reach all down my back. I have just begun using this (1 wk so far) but I will say that it feels really good and after you shower there is this overall feeling of freshness and smoothness on my skin. I plan to use this daily along with pursuing a healthier lifestyle. Hopefully this will help me lose inches and tighten skin as I&#x27;ve heard other say.</li>
            <li> WILL RECOMMAND TO A FRIEND. WIFE THINK SO, SHE USES IT EVERY NITE WHEN SHE SHOWERS. WIFE LOVE PRODUCT MUCH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying drybrushing, and perhaps I don&#x27;t understand the fundamentals enough, but this brush is SOOO hard.  You do get used to it, but I would think it could be a little softer and still do the job.  Again, I&#x27;m not really sure, but just know it&#x27;s not even kinda soft on your skin.  It&#x27;s literally like raking a bristled hair brush over your skin...</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I really like this brush. I&#x27;m new to dry brushing but I have been looking on the internet and reading books about it. I thought I would give it a try, so I bought one at a local health food store and was so excited to find out it was made in the USA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this on my face but in the future will someday purchase a face brush. I have been using this brush for four days, have found that my skin has improved very much and that even my facial acne has gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all I find this brush works great.</li>
            <li> Great for dry brushing!</li>
            <li> The last brush I had was old and soft. This one is just right and helps me with my daily skin brushing.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little hard at first, but you get used to it. I like that you can detach it from the handle. My wife loves how soft her skin is after use.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what I expected and wanted. The bristles are firm, but not harsh. If I had to change something it would be the handle because the head of the brush and handle do not fit as well as it should</li>
            <li> Awesome brush!  It did smell funny when you first get it. I ran hot water over it for a bit and added soap and rinsed three times.&lt;br /&gt;Brush now smells like soap</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is my second one. As the bristles wear down it is always advisable to replace it with a new one.</li>
            <li> I am new to body brushing but have found it to be a great experience. This brush is really good because the head of the brush detaches from the handle, which makes it easier to use. The brush is very hard and hurt a little the first dozen times I used it, but it got better and my skin got used to it. I recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for dry brushing. The bristles are stiff enough to be effective, but not too stiff. I also like that the handle is removable, but it doesn&#x27;t fall off too easily. Over all a great product. It was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit stiffer than I had expected. Also the handle does not stay on very well. It does the job pretty well - I just have to use very light pressure so I don&#x27;t scratch or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> We are just beginning to skin brush and have read much about the benefits.  Thanks for a great product that we will enjoy..</li>
            <li> I was searching for a bath brush, and this item was near the top of that list.  The price was right, and several reviews also convinced me to buy this brush over one with synthetic bristles.  One reviewer wrote that natural bristles held on to soap better than synthetic bristles, which by the way is -wrong-, and another reviewer wrote that although the bristles were stiff at first, once they were wet they softened up.  Which they did, ever so slightly.  But not nearly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a brush to use in the bath or shower, do yourself a big favor and avoid all the brushes that have natural bristles.  Buy a synthetic bristle brush.  I know people like to buy natural products, but in this case, plastic wins hands down.</li>
            <li> This brush is very scratchy and stiff. I started using it on my problem areas of my legs and I started to get broken capillaries everywhere! I would suggest to dry rub very gently on the skin starting at the feet and always working towards the heart as recommended for dry brushing.</li>
            <li> Tough, durable bristles attached to a strong yet detachable arm; this skin brush functions as 2 in 1. The bristles are firm, as others have noted, but soften a little over time yet remain very effective.  Great quality brush at a great price.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product.  Use it everyday prior to showering.</li>
            <li> Good condition.  Very small nick where the handle is inserted, but this does not affect use or quality. I like the product a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush, VERY firm, but does a good job.</li>
            <li> Iv use most expensive brushes that haven&#x27;t been halfway as good as this one , 5 stars !!!</li>
            <li> Okay .... if you are one of those who came looking for this product after listening to Food Babe&#x27;s you tube video BEWARE. This is not an easy to use product. First of all the brush is hard .... the bristles are really really harsh on your skin. My husband used it ... and I think it works okay for men as they have much rough skin then women  but I couldn&#x27;t bear to use this. If you use this before your shower .... ur skin will most likely burn when you get in the hot shower .... so use luke warm water after you use this.</li>
            <li> Great quality and price!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Seems to do the job that I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I have not used it fully as yet but just wanted to give feedback to address those saying its super rough. It is as rough as you use it. No it is not soft and does not require much pressure. If you used with light strokes, it is effective enough. After all, it is a body brush. It is not meant to be like a baby brush. It does feel like light scratching but as others have said, you will get used to it. Will update after continuous use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Awesome. And it shipped faster than it was supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic dry brush. Stiff vegetable bristles a long detachable handle make this product top-notch. I&#x27;m on my second and am planning to buy one for my Dad, who has recently become interested in dry brushing to assist on detox. It also makes your skin soft and smooth, which is an added benefit!</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Just the right stiffness for a good skin scrubbing without scratching.  All natural.</li>
            <li> Initially the brushing felt a little harsh and I thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it again. The second time I used it I was a little gentler and used softer strokes in a few areas, which felt better. Now after several uses I can brush areas on my skin without any pain. I tend to stick to brushing drier areas on my skin, that&#x27;s where I see the difference.</li>
            <li> I love the brush and use it before a bath and will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. At first I felt that it was to stiff. I was using too much pressure. I find it relaxing to dry brush.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold. Reccommended</li>
            <li> The brush head keeps falling off the stick so I ended up just throwing it away. Totally disappointed!</li>
            <li> VERY rough bristles.  Not what I was expecting.  I use it for dry brushing but it leaves scratch marks on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love my brush.  Not too rough but gives a good scrub.  Great for dry-brushing.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I thought the bristles were stiff. I expected them to be a little softer, but the more I used it, the more I like it. It has already softened the skin on my arms and legs. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Works well at exfoliating. Bristles smell kinda funky. My dermatologist turned me onto a glycolic body wash, which I like better as an exfoliant.  So, I don&#x27;t use this anymore. The body wash is more convenient and doesn&#x27;t require an extra step for me.</li>
            <li> The brush is very abrasive and the handle broke the first time I used it. Sorry that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Much to harsh for all over your body. Maybe if you run it over some bricks or something you could soften it up ... but it does NOT feel good to run this over your legs or arms. I guess this is one of those things you need to feel &amp;#34;in person&amp;#34; before buying.  4-2-15 Updated to 4 stars. I&#x27;ve gotten used to the brush for the most part. I still feel it&#x27;s harsh, so not good on sensitive skin. Great for your feet. On your legs and arms, you have to go very lightly, or it will not feel good.</li>
            <li> Works really well, my skin tone has improved immensely. I follow the long version of the procedure outlined on http://naturalhealthtechniques.com/healingtechniquesdry_brushing_technique.htm</li>
            <li> This was bought for the purpose of dry brushing my skin before a shower. At first it seems very stiff and scratchy however after several uses (lightly brushing) my skin became adjusted to the brush. I still don&#x27;t brush hard because it is too stiff for that but I am able to swipe across my arms and legs without being as careful. Since dry brushing, my skin has been less itchy after showers wen I brush before as well as less dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome product- bristles are stiff yet easy on the skin. I use this for dry brushing and have been satisfied with the results. Fast and easy transaction :D</li>
            <li> My skin is way too sensitive for the brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my daughter and she loves it</li>
