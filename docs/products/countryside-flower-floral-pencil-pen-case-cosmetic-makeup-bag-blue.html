            <li>I love this pencil bag it has to be the best thing I bought on amazon so far it has the cutest little zipper</li>
            <li>Very cute, handy for small items</li>
            <li>The perfect little bag for make up!!!</li>
            <li>I needed a small cheap pencil case to keep my things in and this is of great quality.</li>
            <li>It is really nice and bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>i would say 4 weeks to ship but its so worth</li>
            <li>Totally worth buy it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>took awhile to come but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Such a great, cute little bag.</li>
            <li>i fell in love with this pencil case, but the only downfall is the miss placement  in the words other then that its a very cute bag.</li>
            <li>Good little bag.  </li>
            <li>product was overall okay.</li>
            <li>Pretty design.</li>
            <li>Pretty bummed</li>
            <li>It came on time and I&#x27;d recommend it, especially for the price :)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>it is cute and the same way that show in the picture but the zipper does not work very well.</li>
            <li>Nice little pouch for my Bible markers, pens and pencils.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected which was perfect, product was exactly as i expected.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>it is really chap material.</li>
            <li>a steal because it was reasonably priced</li>
            <li>It is roomy enough to fit all my pens and the zipper is actually decent construction.</li>
            <li>and i love the pink polka dot fabric on the inside!</li>
            <li>For instance if you want a wooden pencil that&#x27;s new, it won&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I thought the color would have been a little more greener.</li>
            <li>It tapers down at the bottom of the bag, so if you sharpen the heck out of your pencils, you might be able to get them to stay towards the top of the bag and use the bottom for pink erasers or for a tiny pencil sharpener.  </li>
            <li>A bit too tight, but they mostly fit.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my eight year old daughter as her teacher specified that the children needed a fabric pencil case for the start of school.  </li>
            <li>things you should know about this product that you can&#x27;t fit anything bigger longer than the regular pens and other objects.</li>
            <li>My compact barely fits in with my mascara and eyeliner in tow.</li>
            <li>Every pencil case I found in stores nearby were ugly and childish and this one was just perfect!.</li>

            <li> It is little on small non durable side, i like the way it looked and how it was cheap</li>
            <li> There is a small typo, but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> it took a long time to get here.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than expected but it will do the job.</li>
            <li> It could double as a cosmetic bag, but only if you travel with one lipstick and a few sample size items.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something to keep my makeup and stuff in my handbag rather than having then loose.</li>
            <li> It was less that 2.00</li>
            <li> I had to wait almost a month and a half for this to ever to go me</li>
            <li> so that was a slight bummer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not true at all.</li>
            <li> LITTLE bag.  </li>
            <li> LITTLE.</li>
            <li> I was worried because I read other reviews that said it was too small.</li>
            <li> I think I have about 10 regular sized pens and lead pencils and I use the thin Bic highlighter, if you were wondering.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> when we opened the package we could not believe how small it was.  </li>
            <li> It is cute, but the grammar on the front is awful.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture and can be used as a pencil case or a small makeup bag for your purse.</li>
            <li> I use if for small to go makeup items, chapsticks and lip gloss.</li>
            <li> This is a small pouch</li>
            <li> Very small and zipper broke within a week.</li>
            <li> thought that was weird</li>
            <li> Bad poor manufacture.</li>
            <li> We were both very disappointed with this purchase.</li>

            <li> super cute! perfect for my makeup essentials</li>
            <li> It is little on small non durable side, i like the way it looked and how it was cheap but i think they can do better.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my eight year old daughter as her teacher specified that the children needed a fabric pencil case for the start of school.  It took a while to receive because it is made overseas and when we opened the package we could not believe how small it was.  It tapers down at the bottom of the bag, so if you sharpen the heck out of your pencils, you might be able to get them to stay towards the top of the bag and use the bottom for pink erasers or for a tiny pencil sharpener.  It could double as a cosmetic bag, but only if you travel with one lipstick and a few sample size items.  I will be using it for neither of those functions and just keep it aside until we can figure out a practical use for it.  We were both very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is really nice and bigger than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s super cute. I definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Very cute, handy for small items</li>
            <li> This case fits my pens and pencils perfectly. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It took forever to come, I&#x27;m guessing because it is from overseas. The bag is really cute if you disregard the errors in writing. The bag says \\&quot;What sunshine to is flowers Smiles to are humanity\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> ok so it takes about i would say 4 weeks to ship but its so worth it cause its so cute!! i ordered this for school for pencils even though it was a makeup case and the pencils fit perfectly without having to force them in there! i love it so much! It reminds me of arizona iced tea!</li>
            <li> I love this pencil bag it has to be the best thing I bought on amazon so far it has the cutest little zipper</li>
            <li> i fell in love with this pencil case, but the only downfall is the miss placement  in the words other then that its a very cute bag.</li>
            <li> it took a long time to get here. it was made cheaply and the zipper thingy fell of very quickly</li>
            <li> It is cute, but the grammar on the front is awful. I would buy it again, just humorous. It is roomy enough to fit all my pens and the zipper is actually decent construction.</li>
            <li> I needed a small cheap pencil case to keep my things in and this is of great quality. I have around 15 pens and pencils and they all fit perfectly, don&#x27;t let the price turn you away, it has lasted me for months.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected which was perfect, product was exactly as i expected.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the New Year for school pens&lt;br /&gt; love the color and size makes a nice gift for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I bought several to have on hand for gifts and such.  Looks just like the picture and can be used as a pencil case or a small makeup bag for your purse.</li>
            <li> Very cute bag for super cheap!</li>
            <li> very cute pencil case. I love it and don&#x27;t mind showing it off in my college classes. Every pencil case I found in stores nearby were ugly and childish and this one was just perfect!.</li>
            <li> The pencil pen case is alright. I thought the color would have been a little more greener. But it does what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li> I use this pouch as my pencil case, I love it! It&#x27;s really cute and it fits all of my pens, highlighters, erasers and lead pencils! I think I have about 10 regular sized pens and lead pencils and I use the thin Bic highlighter, if you were wondering. Everything fits and there&#x27;s still room to add more (:</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to keep my makeup and stuff in my handbag rather than having then loose. I finally received and i must say i actually like it. It is smaller than expected but it will do the job.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t the best thing I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things you should know about this product that you can&#x27;t fit anything bigger longer than the regular pens and other objects. For instance if you want a wooden pencil that&#x27;s new, it won&#x27;t fit. Another thing is the stitching on the front. The words have mistakes and they are not grammatically correct. Plus I can fit around 14 - 15 pens/pencils and an eraser in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was overall okay.</li>
            <li> Such a great, cute little bag. I use it for makeup and hair things.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it, the zipper keeps getting stuck</li>
            <li> Love this bag! Took it to an ice rink and got stolen though. I guess the person who stole it loved it as well hahah. Definitely miss this bag. Totally worth buy it though</li>
            <li> I love it mine took 4 days to ship but it&#x27;s worth it. Very beautiful I&#x27;m getting the minny one as well!!!</li>
            <li> Bought for makeup. Very small and zipper broke within a week.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, perfect quantity size, and extremely cute.  It&#x27;s so lightweight I can even carry it around school in my hand, its perfect.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this little bag. It fits nicely in my purse and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> Super disappointed. It broke the second time I tried to unzip it. Definitely don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Good little bag.  LITTLE bag.  LITTLE.</li>
            <li> Love thisllittle bag. I use if for small to go makeup items, chapsticks and lip gloss. Fits perfectly in my purse.</li>
            <li> Nice little pouch for my Bible markers, pens and pencils. A bit too tight, but they mostly fit. Pretty design.</li>
            <li> it is cute and the same way that show in the picture but the zipper does not work very well.</li>
            <li> This is a small pouch but it is a nice quality canvas and has a pretty pattern on it. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Took over the allowed amount of time to arrive, and wording is backwards. otherwise really cute!</li>
            <li> I was worried because I read other reviews that said it was too small. That&#x27;s not true at all. It holds all of my pens, pencils, highlighters, and erasers. Plus, it&#x27;s really cute, and I get compliments all the time. It&#x27;s a very good deal, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> its a fine bag&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;although it is really chap material.The zipper string is not stitched well.&lt;br /&gt;i would say don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> i love it alot.... Its super cute :) and i love the pink polka dot fabric on the inside! Also the neatest thing about it is the phrase on the front.</li>
            <li> Very cute no problems</li>
            <li> The zipper gets stuck about an inch from the opening. It was less that 2.00 so it would cost me more to return or exchange it. Pretty bummed</li>
            <li> I had to wait almost a month and a half for this to ever to go me so that was a slight bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a lot smaller than I thought. My compact barely fits in with my mascara and eyeliner in tow. It cute though but i might just end up using it for button storage.</li>
            <li> The perfect little bag for make up!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice negociation. Product in good conservation and as the website showed.</li>
            <li> It is very cute! Very light weight and seems durable..Came all folded up and it smelled like vinegar...thought that was weird so I sprayed perfume and it is okay now. There is a small typo, but I don&#x27;t really care. I recommend getting if you have time. Mine came within 2-3 weeks after ordering.</li>
            <li> It is smaller then the picture but it is still cute and useful</li>
            <li> took awhile to come but worth the wait. perfect size to put in a bookbag or purse and plenty of room to put all my pens and pencils. love it! a steal because it was reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I love this bag! There is a typo but I don&#x27;t mind it, personally. I think its adorable inside and out, holds a good amount. It came on time and I&#x27;d recommend it, especially for the price :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Will probably order another one.  I use it to keep my extra phone charger in my purse.</li>
            <li> Super cute and I love the engrish!</li>
            <li> The zippers did not work on all of them. Bad poor manufacture.</li>
