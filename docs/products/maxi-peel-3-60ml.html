            <li>Despite the product drying out her skin it was good overall.</li>
            <li>I use this when I get a pimple it dries it quick.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the super service.  </li>
            <li>i need to order again its real not imitation good product</li>
            <li>I do not think it&#x27;s right to give a product 3 stars or even two just because you haven&#x27;t seen a product work for you</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier thank you is a good new package</li>
            <li>I dont use it as often now because it will bring your skin two shades lighter and I am dark skinned but its pretty good</li>
            <li>will definitely by again... :-)</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>Bottom line my skin is clear and smooth</li>
            <li>I applied the peel to my face each night before bed for 3 night straight</li>
            <li>and the next day I started to lightly peel.  </li>
            <li>I can use it for 5 days since my skin is capable but you do have to give it time to work so the skin won&#x27;t overlap.  </li>
            <li>Have seen spot lighten up, not to much disappear</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>But it was shipped out fast.</li>
            <li>I have hyper pigmentation and after much research purchase Maxi Peel.</li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T DO MUCH PEELING.</li>
            <li>Too harsh .....start with #2 first !!!</li>
            <li>I definitely started to see peeling right away</li>
            <li>Fixed that with Neosporin.</li>
            <li>Even allowing any cream or gel to Penetrate better allowing faster exfoliating of your secondary product.</li>
            <li>Now I use it as a toner, lightly, but only at night as at dries my face to the extreme.</li>
            <li>the shipping is super past.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Delivered promptly.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this product it always holds up to my expectations....I see they have changed the packaging since the last time I bought it...and I&#x27;m not sure if hydroquinone was in this product last time...but overall it works...had me peeling like a snake....will definitely by again... :-)</li>
            <li> Works well,  I&#x27;m African American mocha color skin tone with some hyperpigmentation. I applied the peel to my face each night before bed for 3 night straight and the next day I started to lightly peel.  No downtime needed just use a spf moisturizer.  Where&#x27;s the maxipeel #4?????!!! I need it in my lifehoney</li>
            <li> I do not think it&#x27;s right to give a product 3 stars or even two just because you haven&#x27;t seen a product work for you yet so I will start with 5 stars.  I am currently on tretinoin 0.1% which is the strongest retin-a you can get pharmaceutical and this product contains 25% which is very very low dosage but because it has salicylic acid included (it doesn&#x27;t say what percentage) I notice my skin peeling on my face and neck after 3 days of use.  I can use it for 5 days since my skin is capable but you do have to give it time to work so the skin won&#x27;t overlap.  Good product so far.  I will mix it with 0.1% to use on my body.  0.05% didn&#x27;t work for my body so I know 25% definitely won&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using it for several years and have recommended it to others. Keeps my skin clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this when I get a pimple it dries it quick.</li>
            <li> its ok but the more i apply it..it just cause my face irritation</li>
            <li> i started using this product as a toner both day and night, that was a mistake as I underestimated the strength. I definitely started to see peeling right away and I think I kinda burned my face a bit, as it burned like hell to the touch. Fixed that with Neosporin. Now I use it as a toner, lightly, but only at night as at dries my face to the extreme. Have seen spot lighten up, not to much disappear but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my skin. But it was shipped out fast. I received it fast.&lt;br /&gt; This may work for others, so don&#x27;t turn away just because this didn&#x27;t work for me. Everyone has different skin type.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED IT DAILY FOR A WEEK WITH NO CLEARING OR PEELING.</li>
            <li> I started using maxi peel immediately after I received it and after a week the dead layer of my skin started to peel, I must say this product really works. I dont use it as often now because it will bring your skin two shades lighter and I am dark skinned but its pretty good</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!  I have hyper pigmentation and after much research purchase Maxi Peel. I tried this product three times and I didn&#x27;t even peel. It does not exfoliated the skin. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I need to know how to use it</li>
            <li> Too harsh .....start with #2 first !!!</li>
            <li> Product did not work to my expectations</li>
            <li> Thank you for the super service.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS PRODUCT. SEEN CLEARER SKIN IN 4 DAYS OF THE PEEL.. MY ONLY THING IS THAT I KINDA BURNED MYSELF WITH THE PRODUCT AROUND MY MOUTH AND CHIN DUE TO THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS AREA BUT I USED A DERMA ROLLER AND FADE CREAM AND IN 2 DAYS BACK TO BEAUTIFUL SKIN..</li>
            <li> Product seemed already used... Package had no seal, took a chance and still used it on my skin. Did nothing for me</li>
            <li> No stars this s*** didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> love it, works awesome. the shipping is super past.</li>
            <li> works very good on my dark spots, will buy again</li>
            <li> Actually took care of her acne. Despite the product drying out her skin it was good overall.</li>
            <li> i like it i need to order again its real not imitation good product</li>
            <li> Works slowly but gud stuff ..</li>
            <li> Looooove this peel! It works! Period...</li>
            <li> Maxi peel is the fastest and best skin lightened all hands down. In a couple of weeks you will notice a huge difference. Even allowing any cream or gel to Penetrate better allowing faster exfoliating of your secondary product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Good for micro peeling and exfoliation. I use it to keep a bright complexion and it helps me eliminate blackheads and clogged pores. I use it as a toner 2-3 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, it&#x27;s helped to fade my perma tan if I also use a good Kojic acid soap every now and then.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier thank you is a good new package</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes skin smooth and removes the black heads I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I received my order days late and my package was dented up. I&#x27;ve been using the product for 3 or 4 days now and I haven&#x27;t experienced any peeling or clearing. The bottle is extremely small and I am very dissatisfied. This was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T DO MUCH PEELING.</li>
            <li> Bottom line my skin is clear and smooth</li>
