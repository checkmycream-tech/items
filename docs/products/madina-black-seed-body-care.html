            <li> Read so much about black seed oil soaps...</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last too long either especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The black seed was listed FAR below fragrance on the ingredient list.&lt;br</li>
            <li> may try my hand at making some black seed oil soap that really does contain black seed oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not natural at all.</li>
            <li> soap is a white bar with tiny black \\&quot;pepper\\&quot; looking specks.  </li>
            <li> Husband using on his head for dry scalp, says its working</li>
            <li> Helped with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> didnt dry out my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white soap with some black specks in it.</li>
            <li> I take black seed oil as a daily supplement.</li>
            <li> and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Have only used for a few though.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face too, but I am careful not to get it in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like false advertising to me to call this Black Seed Soap unless it is referring to the black specs in an otherwise commercial type white grossly perfumed white bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There may be other toxic ingredients that they didn&#x27;t list</li>
            <li> Tired of moisturizers and &#x27;extra&#x27; things necessary to keep skin not looking or feeling like an alligator.  </li>
            <li> I also use Black Cumin Seed oil in moderation as well.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the pepper looking specs are black seed hulls?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see anything on the label indicating there is a therapeutic amount of Black Seed Oil in this bar.</li>
            <li> Black seed oil is one of them.  </li>
            <li> just a little scratchy with the seeds in it.</li>
            <li> buy this Black Seed soap!  </li>
            <li> I live in Alaska, and have bad dry skin.</li>
            <li> sickening fragrance was so strong I could smell it without removing the soap from the cellophane it was sealed in.</li>
            <li> but I still have small spots of it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Horrible commercial fragrance!  </li>
            <li> What a disappointing purchase!</li>
            <li> perfumy smell is so bad, I will not be using this soap on my skin!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, should have looked at ingredients before purchasing.</li>

            <li> I live in Alaska, and have bad dry skin. Tired of moisturizers and &#x27;extra&#x27; things necessary to keep skin not looking or feeling like an alligator.  Not even half way through this bar and already notable improvement! without adding layers of moisturizers -- use it in the shower, no dryness, no roughness.... Highly recommend.  Going back to buy the 6 pack !</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I do feel it helps my skin.  I bought it for myself but my teenage son has found it to be great on his skin.  Wish it was a bit cheaper but I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is very nice on your skin.  I really love this stuff and I can&#x27;t say enough about what it does for my skin except I wish I would have known about it sooner.</li>
            <li> Read so much about black seed oil soaps... This was ok... But nothing to write home about as far as skincare.</li>
            <li> I had hope for all natural ingredients...I should have read the description better.  The soap was OK....just a little scratchy with the seeds in it.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!! I use daily and it provides excellent results to more clearer, softer, firmer skin.</li>
            <li> Toxic ingredients. It&#x27;s a white soap with some black specks in it. But it has yellow 6, red 40, and blue 1 lake listed on the box which isn&#x27;t included on sellers list of ingredients. There may be other toxic ingredients that they didn&#x27;t list and I haven&#x27;t uncovered. I should have read ALL the reviews!</li>

            <li> No results yet, just starting using the soap. It does make the skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Horrible commercial fragrance!  I take black seed oil as a daily supplement. I thought this soap would have a similar fragrance.  NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sickening fragrance was so strong I could smell it without removing the soap from the cellophane it was sealed in. The black seed was listed FAR below fragrance on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfumy smell is so bad, I will not be using this soap on my skin!  It is going back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is a white bar with tiny black \\&quot;pepper\\&quot; looking specks.  Perhaps the pepper looking specs are black seed hulls? I can&#x27;t see anything on the label indicating there is a therapeutic amount of Black Seed Oil in this bar. It seems like false advertising to me to call this Black Seed Soap unless it is referring to the black specs in an otherwise commercial type white grossly perfumed white bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try my hand at making some black seed oil soap that really does contain black seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate using several different oils directly on my skin.  Black seed oil is one of them.  I use it on my face too, but I am careful not to get it in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an organic alternative, I would reccomend any of Tropical Traditions coconut oil soaps with or without essential oils added.  My DIL in Alaska says the Tropical Traditions coconut oil soaps works better than any other soaps she has tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance on buying this Black Seed Soap because I am a huge fan of Black Seed Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this Black Seed soap!  Gross chemical soap product!  What a disappointing purchase!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft. There is a fresh smell to it. Fantastic.</li>
