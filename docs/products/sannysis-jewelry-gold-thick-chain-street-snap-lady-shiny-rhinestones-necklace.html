            <li> I truly love this necklace.  Looks very exspensive, but the price is very reasonable.  Will buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> Well, this is okay. It&#x27;s blingish, but the stones seem cheap and like they could fall out very easily. Also was a choker necklace, which I do not remember in the description. I gave it to my 4 yr old for dress-up, she was thrilled ;)</li>
            <li> The necklace was broken when received it. it cost more for the shipping so I did not return it.</li>
            <li> This necklace looks like something you can get out of the quarter machines. The &amp;#34;rhinestones&amp;#34; are beyond cheap looking and i don&#x27;t think I will be able to wear this necklace out. It looks super super cheap. the design is cute but the quality is horrible. I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on this unless it is for a costume or some outfit where it doesn&#x27;t matter if everyone can tell this cost 5o cents.</li>
            <li> The necklace is child size. My daughter enjoyed it until the rhinestones fell out a couple hours after we recieved it.</li>
            <li> this is so nice I have it in gold and silver tone,, the gold is a great statement necklace.. you can dress it up or down with a gown or tee shirt beautiful and you won&#x27;t believe the price less than $10</li>
            <li> seems big....worth for money....its just okay for me...not that much attractive....</li>
            <li> Lovely necklace. Stones could be more secured. Like the colour. Not sure how long colour will last. However for the price it is wort it.</li>
            <li> So pretty and looks exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> For less then $3 total ... It&#x27;s great... No complaints to me... I&#x27;ve worn it a few times..with no problem</li>
