            <li>It is a very good shampoo as it does moisturize the hair.</li>

            <li>Although, I find that I can \\&quot;seal\\&quot; in the moisture using my Garnier Sleek and Shine conditioner (which is great, &#x27;cause I need to use it</li>
            <li>So this shampoo is great for moisture...</li>
            <li>GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>Great shampoo for itchiness.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo from Target after coming across it while browsing the site and reading all the great reviews about it.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but great things to say about this product.  </li>
            <li>Great products.  </li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It works great on his hair too.</li>
            <li>and this is great.</li>
            <li>A bit in the pricey side, but great.</li>
            <li>in great condition and on time as well.</li>
            <li>and it has a creamy consistency and makes my hair smell great days after shampooing.</li>
            <li>Smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>It smells great, has no sulfates, and my hair loves it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found something that works for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of volume and body and my curls are looking great.</li>
            <li>but if this shampoo keeps giving me great results, I might just try the corresponding conditioner.</li>
            <li>Smells great, though.</li>
            <li>I swear my hair is growing and happy this product.</li>
            <li>It is a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>stuff is great.</li>
            <li>but it really isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely happy with this shampoo along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>i love this shampoo!!</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>But not this amazing shampoo!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li>My hair is amazing!</li>
            <li>I did and I have to say my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li>Also, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m loving this product line!</li>
            <li>Both are truly astounding!</li>
            <li>Its the best sulfate free shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Easily the best shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I read a description saying that it would not strip color from hair and was actually good for colored hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is good, BUT it still strips my hair.</li>
            <li>So I picked this up at Target and looked at the ingredients and it looked good to me.      </li>
            <li>and I loved the results this shampoo provided.  </li>
            <li>but this alone works good.</li>
            <li>This product has good reviews however you must look at why they were given one star ratings.</li>
            <li>, it smells so good, I&#x27;ve had compliments about it</li>
            <li>THE BEST SULFATE FREE SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li>Nothing too fancy, but the results were good.  </li>
            <li>I almost opted to forgo the conditioner, but thought a bit on the ends would be good.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for color-treated hair at all.</li>
            <li>Sustainably Produced.&lt;br /&gt;Pioneering Community Commerce and Fair Trade</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells so good</li>
            <li>i thought it would be good</li>
            <li>I must say, this stuff is good.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell</li>
            <li>Although the Wen stuff sounds good, they don&#x27;t mention the ingredients on their website.</li>
            <li>I read all of these good reviews and was hopeful it would be good</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>if you know why you are using it and manage the use of it wisely.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost too good.</li>
            <li>It has lots of the great oils and ingredients I tried on no-poo and a nice fragrance (perhaps a bit too musky</li>
            <li>And I feel good knowing</li>
            <li>I discovered this one after a friend said she&#x27;d had good results.</li>
            <li>one product is perfect for everyone, but overall this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the masque but this great.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful but its what the hair feels like and how it acts afterward that makes it worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with Shea Moisture and will defintely support this product.</li>
            <li>Now is very healthy.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel right unless I&#x27;m scrunching that wonderful soapy suds through my tresses.  </li>
            <li>After a lot of trial and error and years of running from what the Good Lord gave me I can honestly say I love my hair!</li>
            <li>And on top of all that.... it REEKS!   </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This product is pretty much perfect.  </li>
            <li>Love this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m baffled that they&#x27;re being sold for so much more than this!</li>
            <li>It works like magic!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo!</li>

            <li>and my hair feels absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>i love this product, really great on your natural hair, love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great sulfate free, organic shampoo...</li>
            <li>After massaging the shampoo into my hair and scalp and rinsing, my hair felt amazing.</li>
            <li>The product itself is amazing but not the price (online!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2017</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice.     </li>
            <li>I tried doing the conditioner washes but honestly doing that leaves my scalp loaded with buildup.  </li>
            <li>This is the best gentle shampoo I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is so gentle and smells great!</li>
            <li>I tried the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Shampoo and wasn&#x27;t thrilled about how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>smells like chemically altered graham crackers and good for your hair :)</li>
            <li>It also smells nice.</li>
            <li>Awesome really cleans well but does not strip.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased by this product, I also just started buying the lotions and soaps (today), so I will leave a review once I get a good feel for the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am just thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>and I liked that it still created a bit of sud.</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo, and has a nice smell, not overpowering like some.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice texture on your hair when blowdried however which is nice.</li>
            <li>the kind of perfume that you can taste because its</li>
            <li>need someone to do that for me, package it up nicely and let me buy it.</li>
            <li>Smell great, leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I guess I think this shampoo is just average-not really great but not bad either.  </li>
            <li>Always trying new things to find the perfect products for my hair!  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, my hair looks great when I use this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>I learned that it was best to stay away from shampoos that strip the natural oils from your hair, and even heard that I shouldn&#x27;t be shampooing at all!</li>
            <li>Very good shine, no greasiness, but it does feel very moist after rinsing anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They make the best products for natural hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used in my 23 years of having hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Best product for natural and relaxes hair.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best shampoo we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST combination I have used.</li>
            <li>The price is right, it smells very pleasant and after using it to shampoo my hair, it always feels silky and free of tangles.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li>I love love love this brand!</li>
            <li>I am caucasian with fine hair (though a lot of it!), over-processed and shoulder length.</li>
            <li>It rinsed out very nicely, and still, there was no matting; my hair felt clean and smooth and moisturized - almost as if I had used WEN.  </li>
            <li>The lather was incredible for a non-sulfate/all natural shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Most people rave about the scent -</li>
            <li>addition to the conditioner and hair milk I AM IN LOVE with this.</li>
            <li>a thing LOL.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and God bless :)</li>
            <li>I could have been okay with that if it had moisturized my hair at all</li>
            <li>All of them seemed to have stripped my hair of even more moisture.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I think it could be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Still in search of a better shampoo though.</li>
            <li>which I&#x27;m sure just damaged my hair more.</li>
            <li>And at $10 each, a much better value than high-end salon brands.</li>
            <li>Try Aubrey Organics, it&#x27;s 100% better than this.</li>
            <li>Shea butter in itself is very moisturizing and a great product.</li>
            <li>and I love the all-natural list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>After trying it, I definitely agree, this shampoo is the best i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I like the way it cleanses, but the fragrance is overwhelming and cloying</li>
            <li>and I love the way I can control my hair after using.</li>
            <li>I used it and fell in love.</li>
            <li>My hair is 4a/4b (more so 4b).</li>
            <li>After applying this, my curls were more defined and luscious.</li>
            <li>and I love them both.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to use a good product that smells good without the use of chemicals, described only as \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; in the ingredients list of many products.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair felt even more brittle than a henna or keratin treatment has made it feel.</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>BETTER THAN WEN.</li>
            <li>but after a week my hair started to retain its curls better and eventually became easier to comb.</li>
            <li>But if you use a clarifying shampoo once a week in place of the shampoo and then a silicone- glycerine free hair mask your hair will stay nice and volumeous.</li>
            <li>I love the Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair feel and</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>May work better for others.</li>
            <li>The curls are also more defined.</li>
            <li>This time, all I used was the protectant and my hair was more sleek than it&#x27;s ever been and shiny like no tomorrow.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This sulfate free shampoo is a nice balance.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt or looked better.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>Love your products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was incredibly impressed with the initial use.  </li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels; not over conditioned or greasy/oily at all..</li>
            <li>One thing to remember, rinse,rinse, and rinse some more.  </li>
            <li>Ever since having kids my scalp gets flakey and does not like most shampoos at all.</li>
            <li>but it really feels great while washing.</li>
            <li>I never have problems with dandruff or greasy hair using this product any more.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent it has in it as well.</li>
            <li>hair will love the  pampering.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of shampoos and love this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem and have always been pleased with how it made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>This product  leaves my hair moistened and healthy.</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have it bleached every three to six months, and it has made my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to lather it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better shampoos though.</li>
            <li>it love it</li>
            <li>all you wanna do is keep touching it.with the use of the conditioner this all that i need.</li>
            <li>While I love the smell, ingredient list and company ethics, this is not meant for my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo moisturizes my hair even better than some conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite brand of hair care product.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair feels much softer and it smells great.</li>
            <li>So I am glad that some people don&#x27;t react to it, but just a warning to others.</li>
            <li>I love the way his hair smells afterwards</li>
            <li>Love this non sulfate shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure to grab it.</li>
            <li>and my curls are a lot tighter than most Hispanic women</li>
            <li>I almost bought the one for the curly hair but this just seemed better in terms of what it could do and both were about 10 bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many products are branded as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but still contain a lot of toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make sure to update</li>
            <li>If you are paying $16 for this bottle of shampoo, you are getting ripped off unless the weight is greater than 13 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Make sure u buy it online from drugstore.com, walgreens.com or target.com....</li>
            <li>I love this brand their body products and hair.</li>
            <li>and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I get more kisses on the head now while snuggling on the couch.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to use it as often to maintain a healthy scalp so it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy when I do use it now.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this shampoo lathers well, smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It also protects my precious hair color.  </li>
            <li>yet is color safe.  </li>
            <li>get one free, which rocks!  </li>
            <li>I also love the Shea Moisture masks.  </li>
            <li>They work even better if you use them with a heat cap for 45 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>I love it and the smell is beyond.</li>
            <li>After using so many different products, the best advice I can give is examine your hair, examine its texture and style.</li>
            <li>no product in world is going to make your hair any better</li>
            <li>This, as well as the mask and leave in conditioner are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how so many people could like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper and smells so much better.  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>even if you dont know for sure that your hair likes Shea oil</li>
            <li>and I love my hair.</li>
            <li>Tried repeating the combination again but haven&#x27;t been able to duplicate the result.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos</li>
            <li>It just made my hair feel softer, more pliable and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>but Wen is just better.</li>
            <li>In terms of performance Wen is still better.</li>
            <li>Overall, an awesome product to have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too because it really stays, which is great because I wash my hair every-other-day.</li>
            <li>thanks to this wonderful product, i can reach and scrub my scalp super easily</li>
            <li>Our special blend of organic Shea Butter, nourishing Argan Oil and mineral-rich Sea Kelp is perfect for transitioning chemically treated hair to healthy natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea</li>
            <li>very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this brand and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>What kind of shampoo doesn&#x27;t even clean your hair?</li>
            <li>Awesome shampoo, I&#x27;m natural 4C type hair and this shampoo is so moisturizing and makes my hair feel so great before a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I loved the way my hair felt while using it.  </li>
            <li>is pretty good.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is better than the Shea moisture conditioner, but they are both great if you want some natural.</li>
            <li>Nice mild scent; cleans hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>and it feels so clean!</li>
            <li>If this company ever comes out with a truly fragrant free product, I may try again if I can figure out the static issue.</li>
            <li>My hair is the softest its ever been, smells great, and completely repaired my hair after frying it with the no-poo method.</li>
            <li>Leaves the sking incredibly soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>lol it surprised me.</li>
            <li>Great for adults, children, and no harsh chemicals polluting the earth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not the most fruity but the ingredients are fantastic and you can&#x27;t have it all without adding synthetic fragrances.  </li>
            <li>and i ordered it after the reviews on here and let me tell you this is a great product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and light of course I have noticed but</li>
            <li>I used to use a $30 shampoo and $30 conditioner combo, which although better than the cheap $10 combos, contained sodium sulfate.</li>
            <li>I personally enjoy the smell, it&#x27;s not flowery, but more musky, shea butter-like.</li>
            <li>The masks have a bit more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; for those who have fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>The masks have a bit more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; for those who have fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I was happy to know that Shea Moisture hair products were natural and that did not contain any chemical agents.</li>
            <li>I thought since this was sulfate free, that i needed to use more in my hair.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for natural kinky hair and locs.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, my hair smells good all day.  </li>
            <li>It is great for your hair, leaves it soft and makes it easy to detangle.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of these wonderful ingredients, and my hair did not mat at all (which I do have slight problems with in using the Carole&#x27;s Daughter line, and also when I had tried the Yes to Cucumbers shampoo this spring).  </li>
            <li>This shampoos is fabulous and a rare recommended healthy shampoo on EWG&#x27;s ratings!</li>
            <li>At first I thought that it was just me, but after more than one try and a handful of tangles and hair shred, I then knew!  </li>
            <li>trying other products, including Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Organix, As I Am, Curl Junkie, and Jane Carter, I found that this shampoo is still the best one.</li>
            <li>With my curly hair, I&#x27;m a true hair product junkie!  </li>
            <li>I chose it due to its excellent EWG rating.</li>
            <li>After using the conditioner, any tangles are easily combed out.</li>
            <li>After using the conditioner, any tangles are easily combed out.</li>
            <li>, however, the scent was SO STRONG I could not handle it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I can continue using it because I don&#x27;t want to be the person with the strong perfume in crowded places.</li>
            <li>Rosemary has a naturally strong scent.</li>
            <li>Strong scent.</li>
            <li>The honeysuckle smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>I loved this product and used it all the time, until I realized that one of their main ingredients is \\&quot;sugar beets\\&quot;, of which 95% of them are GMO in the U.S.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>In fact, it completely changed the texture of my hair, amazing!</li>
            <li>On the 3rd day, my hair still looks good and most of all it looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li>it was full of static electricity.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Most true sulfate free shampoos do not lather</li>
            <li>The black soap formulas are wonderful for dandruff and ezema.</li>
            <li>I have medium fine hair</li>
            <li>(It worked when I has relaxed hair) and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>With my hair being so fine, I have to wash it every day.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, it had a very strong cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li>My husband is a huge fan.  </li>
            <li>(I wash about once a week) and huge clumps of hair were coming out in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have a chemical sensitivity and this bottle says it&#x27;s free of synthetic fragrance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different shampoos from many different product lines over the years, and this shampoo is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This product is fabulous, and I paired it with the anti-breakage and volumizing biotin hair masque from this company.</li>
            <li>Works great for my 4a/b type hair, wish it came in a larger quantity</li>
            <li>its a great product (for me) but amazon is selling this product for 26 dollars when you can go to your local beauty supply store or target.com and get it for 10.</li>
            <li>, then my hair looks fabulous for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It is a great shampoo that lather and giving moisturze depending on different hair condition.</li>
            <li>one get one free.</li>
            <li>The lather it makes is so smooth</li>
            <li>Which is great cause it will last longer!</li>
            <li>Reduced break outs and head sores which I attribute to sulfate free/ gluten free.</li>
            <li>So this is Alex&#x27;s suggestion for a &amp;#34;low-poo&amp;#34; alternative that&#x27;s free of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Found this shampoo about 6 months ago, absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews for this product seemed like it was genuine</li>
            <li>On that spree I walked into the hair aisle for a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important that I keep them moist.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo not only makes my hair smell great</li>
            <li>It feels light and has plenty of body and shine.</li>
            <li>Since this brand is locally available to me, I decided to give it a</li>
            <li>This formula is great and it only contains around four ingredients!</li>
            <li>I love that it is reasonably priced and readily available!  </li>
            <li>I thought the Yucca was okay, but something wasn&#x27;t quite right about how my hair felt after washing and conditioning.</li>
            <li>but it still great shampoo with moistursing better than other organic and commerical.</li>
            <li>With this shampoo I rarely have to condition my hair, it feels clean and moisturized and healthy all the time(and</li>
            <li>Anyway I started reading more about my hair type and went more toward the natural route which changed my whole styling routine and has left my hair in the best condition its ever been in.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was just as good, leaving my hair soft, yet full.</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair and let&#x27;s be honest</li>
            <li>I have very curly Hispanic hair that is just really dry, probably cause I don&#x27;t take the best care of it</li>
            <li>and my hair tangles significantly</li>
            <li>After using it for a month, I notice my hair looks significantly healthier.</li>
            <li>I anticipate a long and happy relationship with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed when I tried it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product with the Transitioning set for Shea Moisture.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>This is so worth the money!</li>
            <li>Its concentrated and rich consistency makes is so that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li>;, it lathered beautifully and didn&#x27;t dry my hair one bit!!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say as a black women this is the first shampoo I have ever used that has been great to my hair.</li>
            <li>that it lathered well and seemed to get my hair clean</li>
            <li>My daughter has dry curly hair and this dies a great job on her hair.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp was clean but still had moisture, not stripped.  </li>
            <li>it gets my hair clean without stripping any moisture.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair EXTREMELY clean to the point of sticky, squeaky, fall out.  </li>
            <li>It detangles and moisturizes very well and most importantly</li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t use conditioner after this for keep my hair clean longer and i can save money</li>
            <li>but it rinsed away clean.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need the suds for your hair to be clean, just mentioning and as others have said you can find it cheaper in stores.</li>
            <li>Looked at the ingredients and was like how is this going to clean my hair</li>
            <li>It leaves it clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Although I managed to wash out the oil, my hair did have a lingering smell from the shampoo, which was actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>If you want nice soft hair, do NOT buy this goop!</li>
            <li>The consistency is very slimy/oily in comparison to Wen which is much more rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>but I thought nothing special -</li>
            <li>Post relaxer and this shampoo  is most certainly for those who are in a state of transition.</li>
            <li>RIGHT THERE IN THE SHOWER AFTER RINSING!</li>
            <li>They soak right in and banish any static or dryness and leave my hair very supple but strong.</li>
            <li>They soak right in and banish any static or dryness and leave my hair very supple but strong.</li>
            <li>In short, my hair is in pretty great shape.</li>
            <li>AND THEN I went out and got several compliments on how good my hair smelled LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel more moist and nourished and much healthier.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer purchasing this product on-the-ground, but I am glad that I can purchase it through amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the ingredients are natural and sound like they would be good for my moisture-starved, straight hair and for my husband&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo alone has so much moisture that many times I go without conditioner.</li>
            <li>It definitely wasn&#x27;t a good match for me.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair moisturuzed and full.  </li>
            <li>BUT i think it might be because it didnt get rinsed out good enough.</li>
            <li>I have the Shea Moisture body wash for this collection, which I love and have been using for around a year straight now.</li>
            <li>, the good thing is I only shampoo once a month</li>
            <li>I really love this product as it really cleans and adds moisture.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s different and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>even my hair dresser has asked me what I changed because my hair is now so much thicker, healthy looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>I found this to be true.  </li>
            <li>They are not being honest and making people believe they are buying an all natural product, when in fact, that is as unnatural and chemical as you can get.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and thought this shampoo would be good for it, but I can&#x27;t make an evaluation of its cleansing abilities after only one wash.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this Shampoo.</li>
            <li>product, which I initially found in the Afro hair section of a Target, appealed to me initially because it&#x27;s organic, free of sulfates and parabens and also fair traded and the brand is charitable.  </li>
            <li>At $10 it&#x27;s pricier than regular shampoo, cheaper than many high end shampoos that aren&#x27;t nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>Until I had a baby, my hair was beautiful - like Jennifer Aniston hair beautiful: thick, naturally straight, and it withstood regular highlighting quite well, even though it was extremely fine.</li>
            <li>it doesnt dry out my hair which is great as i am able to retain my natural oils as well.</li>
            <li>It was cheap - about $8.50 (the conditioner is the same price), I liked the list of ingredients (esp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had such success with their Curl Enhancing Smoothie that I thought this would work just as good too...not even.</li>
            <li>love this Shampoo and already recommended it to others including my family members, but I would never buy this for more than $10 because this is what it is sold for at stores such as Target and Walgreens-</li>
            <li>but when I give them a try they are always super drying and mat my strands together.</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love the rich texture and lovely fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Love it, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used so many high end products.  </li>
            <li>Not that this product needs anymore amazing reviews, but: I have extremely fine, pin straight hair that is very fragile and easily damaged.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company by email with the lot numbers from the bottles and store addresses and dates where they were purchased, they said they had received no other complaints about this issue and said the would send me free shampoo to compensate me, they were super nice and replayed promptly at first however months have passed</li>
            <li>First off, I am a huge skeptic and read tons of reviews before buying products now.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair smelling good all day long.</li>
            <li>I also used an apple cider vinegar rinse right after this and then rinsed again with cool water.</li>
            <li>Great for my dyed black hair.  </li>
            <li>I get a good lather with this shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and dry out my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I just recently starting using this shampoo and I love it!</li>
            <li>Will go back and get more!</li>
            <li>I bought this originally because i was so excited about it being made 100% from all natural products and is chemical free.</li>
            <li>:) For info purposes, I have natural 4c hair, 4d, 4e and etc.!</li>
            <li>also love Amazon shopping with the convenience it offers and price savings through my Prime Membership!</li>
            <li>My hair gets pretty frizzy but this helped a lot!</li>
            <li>Overall, really pleased!</li>
            <li>I bought this with the conditioner and while I love the short, easy to read product list, I did not reap any of the benefits.</li>
            <li>They make a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I needed to apply less leave-in conditioner and my curly hair feels great, manageable, and most importantly, not dried</li>
            <li>To be honest, I would have missed out on a great hair product given that label because my hair is your typical European hair and I wouldn&#x27;t have even thought to look.</li>
            <li>get one free deals in certain stores.</li>
            <li>Just so some people are aware, Argan Oil has a very strong smell naturally</li>
            <li>I like this company&#x27;s products so much that my bathroom is filled with them.</li>
            <li>I went from using an all natural $25 a bottle shampoo from a company called JustNatural, to using an Aloe shampoo from Organics, to using Garnier Fructis Hydra Recharge (huge HUGE mistake)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to wash my hair another few times or so and see if this shampoo still gives me great results.</li>
            <li>I do appreciate what they are trying to do with healthy ingredients, but there are better natural hair lines out there that make your hair soft and makes it feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>I guess its geared more toward totally natural hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE the fact that&#x27;s the ingredients are ALL natural.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling healthy, soft, shiny, and manageable</li>
            <li>It does have the distinct smell that can be overpowering at times</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Walgreens, so no comment on getting it from Amazon, but this is worth trying out.  </li>
            <li>Love them  Love them but not much use if I can&#x27;t get them out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I had almost convinced myself to buy the $30 Ojon Rare oils shampoo, when I found Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner at WalMart.  </li>
            <li>I also feel like it helps my hair feel thicker and seem to have more volume ,but that is probably because it doesnt strip it of all natural moisture.</li>
            <li>I love what this product is about - no animal testing, &amp; using natural products, no sulfates....</li>
            <li>I love that it is natural.</li>
            <li>After it continued happening, I read the label more completely and it does say to discontinue use if irritation occurs.  </li>
            <li>I had begun to despair at how unmanageable it was, especially in any kind of humidity.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use either the conditioner or the deep conditioner very often at all any more -- mostly I just use the shampoo, and I wash my hair about every 3 days.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised to see so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li>and when i rinse, my coils are soft, looser, and much more manageable.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cause my eye because of the shea butter ingredient and all the other good stuff inside.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>it did not seem right.</li>
            <li>If you didn&#x27;t tone well, this shampoo will pull it right out.</li>
            <li>One part of that learning was finding the right combination of products for both my texture and my environment.  </li>
            <li>Another thing I love is how far it can go, because of how much hair I have I tend to go through both quickly to get all to the scalp, some how with Shea Moisture</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, I love the smell, the down to earth ingredients</li>
            <li>I have short hair with soft curls, but between coloring it monthly in middle age and texture changes that come with age (dryer, coarser greys), I&#x27;ve been dependent on leave in conditioners and fixatives in order for my hair to look as healthy and attractive as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>and  I highly recommend it and the other great Shea Moisture products.o.  </li>
            <li>and  I highly recommend it and the other great Shea Moisture products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the shiniest, softest and prettiest my hair has looked in years of frequent coloring, feels great, and all I do is sort of shake it out and let it dry.  </li>
            <li>The smell is kind of an earthy scent that is very natural which is what I would hope for from a natural product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s a great product and if you don&#x27;t mind spending $10 on a relatively small bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li>The ingredients were exactly what I was looking for, and the price was right, $9.95 for each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not want to get my hopes up too high, but the reviews on Amazon and Walgreens had me excited.</li>
            <li>My hair did comb out easily with my wide toothed comb, and I blew it out as I normally do on the warm setting, then used my hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>It will leave your hair clean and super soft.</li>
            <li>Good product build hair strong but does dry out with daily use</li>
            <li>natural, gentle, and safe for color treated hair</li>
            <li>I rarely buy the same bottle of shampoo twice because Im never truly satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten so strong that the breakage is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>The results of this product are somewhat decent (which is why I gave it a 2 star instead of 1), but feels and smells like there is more to it than \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Makes my daughters natural hair soft and very easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural, but I don&#x27;t like that the smell (though natural and not unpleaseant) is very strong and lingers for days after she washes.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found shampoo that actually makes a huge noticeable difference on my hair before, but this one did!</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d be okay, but it bothered me enough to have to re-shampoo my hair again with another unscented brand I use to get the smell out.  </li>
            <li>this product works so much better then the Mizani moisturefusion shampoo i brought last month...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several products from the Shea Moisture line and love them all.</li>
            <li>It rinsed pretty well</li>
            <li>Who wants to have junk in their shampoo anyway!  </li>
            <li>Garnier Nutrisse triple condition, which now has amodimethicone - any recs are appreciated!)</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture products are always cheaper at Target or your local drugstores so be sure to look there before buying on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strips hair too much!  </li>
            <li>I have long, naturally coarse (but relaxed) hair, and switching to this shampoo (and discontinuing use of sulfate shampoos in general) is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my hair.</li>
            <li>EDIT: Please do not buy this product or any other Shea Moisture hair product for more than $9.99!</li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well in my hair!</li>
            <li>Only reason I give it 4 stars is that it seems to take more effort to get the product out of the bottles... like the bottles are made of denser plastic</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The first week I used it</li>
            <li>They just basically used a different form of it to be able to call it that.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and on the first wash I could see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I am really looking forward to seeing how my hair responds after prolonged use!</li>
            <li>YOU MUST PRE POO FIRST, EVEN WITH A PREE POO YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>We always use natural and cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>Once per month, I will wash my hair first with a clarifying shampoo then wash again with Shea Moisture and then condition as mentioned.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to buy higher end products where I also bought salon brands as well to include the Sebastian line, to which I was using before this</li>
            <li>this seller needs to be aware of this.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use that much!</li>
            <li>I just finished the first bottle of shampoo --</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>So the price might be higher than a retail store, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I first used this product about two days ago</li>
            <li>First I was attracted by the smell.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever tried a Sulfate-Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would leave too much sticky residue, but it does not!</li>
            <li>It does feel a bit greasy when you first start to use it</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my hair lacked body and I was tempted to return it.  </li>
            <li>that is what attracted me to it in the first place - but I cannot fathom why a shampoo would ever smell like this.</li>
            <li>That is exactly what happend to my hair.</li>
            <li>Very close to Wen products!</li>
            <li>For the first time I can remember I did not have to use a detangler.  </li>
            <li>After drying and styling,  my hair felt more in balance with necessary moisture.  </li>
            <li>It was very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I have never had my hair and scalp feel so clean and so soft just from shampoo!</li>
            <li>It was so good that my dry scalp issue is now completely gone.  </li>
            <li>His hair is very soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, dry hair and my scalp tends to get irritated in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my 4 year old bi-racial son&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>I will be trying the conditioner due to this spectacular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Most kiddie shampoos make his beautiful curls feel dry and straw-like after a few uses, however, with the Shea Butter version, his curls were so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Just over a month ago, I tried this shampoo and the Raw Shea Restorative Conditioner because I couldn&#x27;t think of a good reason not to.</li>
            <li>I also love Shea Moisture&#x27;s Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which has apple cider vinegar (but smells really clean) which removes buildup but</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, moisturized, and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>, It cleans... just not in the &#x27;stripping all natural oils from your hair&#x27; kinda way that people tend to perceive  as clean.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t clean and leave as silky soft as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I hope you Natural Hair ladies enjoy as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I then followed up with the conditioner, and then I deep conditioned with the Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque, and my hair absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only positive thing about is that it will LAST YOU, so it&#x27;s a good investment (about $10/bottle in store, and it will be MONTHS before i&#x27;m finished with it for my medium length</li>
            <li>I used a clarifying shampoo first (Paul Mitchell Shampoo One) because I had a lot of product build up and wasn&#x27;t sure this shampoo could remove it all and my hair general felt pretty soft afterwards--definitely softer than after the clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I would just caution everyone that less is more!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, too, mildly floral, and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>shea butter and argan oil), and the reviews were extremely positive.    </li>
            <li>but I like to feel a little more clean that I do with ACW and baking soda.</li>
            <li>Wen - seems designed more for people who have a softer and not as tight curl or for another hair type - not anything special in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathered up well and smelled nice, but after I rinsed it out, it left so much oil in my hair that I had to wash it out with my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair was pretty much &amp;#34;snapping&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture really thought out their ingredient list, no sulfates, gentle cleansers, no alcohols, and lots of moisture!  </li>
            <li>This product is not only all natural, sulfate free, and cheap</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of this in the store and I have used hair products for damaged hair in the past, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, and leaves hair moisturized without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I certainly haven&#x27;t found this to be true, far from it.  </li>
            <li>I certainly haven&#x27;t found this to be true, far from it.  </li>
            <li>hair care...which means not using any commercial shampoos or conditioners, to ultimately give you amazingly shiny, wavy, frizz free, soft, detangled hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried shampoos from the high end to low end and many inbetween.</li>
            <li>The top layer of my hair looked incredibly dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>As soon as I applied the shampoo, IMMEDIATELY my hair felt super soft, not exaggerating at all.</li>
            <li>my scalp is not dry or flaky, and the fragrance in my hair is light and heavenly.  </li>
            <li>I love this shea moisture line and this is my shampoo, but it will leave your hair dry.</li>
            <li>It smells just like super pungent old lady perfume-</li>
            <li>I also believe that sticking to a certain product in your hair for a certain time will help it grow or show you what works or wont work.</li>
            <li>After weeks of heading to the shower with bowls full of mud, egg yolks mixed with avocado, jars of raw honey, whisks, newfangled combs, etc, I realize that I am not the type of person who will enjoy concocting my own homemade and highly perishable shampoo cocktails</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells nice and is not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>To straighten I normally used 3 or 4 products on top of the protenctant to get it to lay decently flat and be shiny.</li>
            <li>I did not know this was marketed towards ethnic hair types until researching it the next day after use because it did such a phenomenal job!</li>
            <li>Although the shampoo smells good, the smell is like a strong perfume (which I don&#x27;t love, but don&#x27;t hate either)so be mindful of that.</li>
            <li>so I used it AGAIN for the first time today on my NATURAL hair and it work VERY, VERY well.</li>
            <li>My hair went from 100% straight to 95% corkscrew-curly and 5% straight, with all the straight hair in the front.</li>
            <li>I have bought this product at Target and I am not totally convinced that their ingredient list is accurate.</li>
            <li>In My late 30&#x27;s now, I have tried from the bottom to top end hair products and this is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I had read such great things about it, but I feel like this was unfortunately a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t found anything close to Shea Moisture at this price point.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>MUCH  </li>
            <li>You know, I was expecting this shampoo to really help</li>
            <li>very creamy</li>
            <li>You can tell because those products get really sudsy.</li>
            <li>Shea moisture doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy, but it still does the job.</li>
            <li>I will be trying their whole line of products.</li>
            <li>well moisturized and feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely dreaded wash days because I couldn&#x27;t detangle my hair after washing without lots of hair breaking off, no matter</li>
            <li>It gave my hair so much \\&quot;slip\\&quot;, as people say.</li>
            <li>breaking anytime I really touched it.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel very moisturized during the shampoo process and after.  </li>
            <li>THEY CARRY THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF SHEA MOISTURE PROUCTS.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my scalp very thoroughly while keeping my hair moisturized, so there was no stripping.</li>
            <li>Just one gentle cleansing agent besides water and the remainder of the ingredients to be moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Anyway, regardless of what shampoo or conditioner I used, my hair was very tangly BUT this shampoo helped with the dryness and over time helped with the tangles.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it so much on my roots as I do on my ends.</li>
            <li>AND after you wash your hair, it feels very moisturizers.</li>
            <li>and they had the whole line buy</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loves LOVES LOVESSSSS this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>That was because they weren&#x27;t really sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>I searched online for a real sulfate-free shampoo, and found this.</li>
            <li>This has made my hair so much softer than it was before.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really indescribable.</li>
            <li>Combined with the matching conditioner, my hair has become much healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li>This is drastically helped my hair fight humidity and really restored it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot use this without saturating my hair with coconut oil and/or using Yes To Cucumbers conditioner along with it.</li>
            <li>In relation to the shampoo, the conditioner, to me, really has no scent.  </li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t really seem to moisturize my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper at either walgreens or walmart.</li>
            <li>I really like how it helps in hair growth also.</li>
            <li>So, it really depends.  </li>
            <li>made my scalp really itchi for some reason and dryout my hair for some reason and</li>
            <li>it dint see much of getting my hair any longuer</li>
            <li>It leathers very well at the beginning of the purchase.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY SCENTED even though there is no fragrance listed on the ingredients!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li>I reacted to this product very soon after I began to use it.  </li>
            <li>it looks really greasy.</li>
            <li>I tried everything: Diva, BedHead, B&amp;B, Loreal Sulfate Free, Goldwell, white vinegar, egg yolk, mayonnaise; I tried not blow drying it and blow drying it with an ion dryer</li>
            <li>It was delivered in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>Like the product&#x27;s quality and results, but not the scent too much.</li>
            <li>After that my hair seemed to adjust to it really well.  </li>
            <li>This product made my hair feel like it had a wax coating on it and made it look very oily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to do much to it</li>
            <li>My hair is very noticably shorter and thinner thanks to this horrid shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was bothersome, but the shampoo and conditioner worked really well for my hair</li>
            <li>(Carol&#x27;s daughter seems to work VERY well on my hair).</li>
            <li>smell is absolutely horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li>at all really, it just needs to be smeared around the head, I guess.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d noticed a different shea moisutre product that didn&#x27;t lather as well but nonetheless left my hair smelling nice and well-hydrated.  8/10.  </li>
            <li>It does smell nice - I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on that, but it left my thick, curly hair feeling even more bulky.</li>
            <li>The Shea Shampoo did not strip my hair of natural oils, which only made my hair feel even better once I applied the conditoner.</li>
            <li>Second time I used it my hair felt even more soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a grand total of once so far, but I can already tell that this product will not strip my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff sucks, and it doesnt smell so good either.</li>
            <li>Low foaming but highly effective without stripping your hair of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Ok, I am truly a cheap person when it comes to buying products, I don&#x27;t believe in spending money on something that goes down the drain literally!!!</li>
            <li>This product cleans my hair but doesn&#x27;t strip the good oils and it leaves my hair soft with a slight butterscotch smell!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled by the real price of $10, not $16.50 or any other marked up price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally use silicone free products (looking for a new conditioner though due to a formula change in my absolute favorite conditioner,</li>
            <li>It completely stripped Redken Shades EQ toner right out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Being natural and mild, it is safe for them and less drying on their skin and coat.   </li>
            <li>I really hope it was just takes longer to rinse out cause other then that i love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t, I just don&#x27;t feel my hair is clean, despite some claims that a low lather shampoo really does do the job.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very easy to get used to and the shampoo does add a little bit of volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>However, it is a better shampoo than some of the other ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li>SELL THIS SHAMPOO AND MOST OF THE OTHER SHEA MOISTURE PRODUCTS FOR $9.99</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, clean, and shiny!</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling goopy instead of clean.</li>
            <li>it does not take much to actually cleanse your hair and it does have kind of a strange slippery feel.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, it&#x27;s company seems to value all the things I value in beauty and hygiene products, but it wasn&#x27;t really living up to my exceptions of moisture retention and it seemed to leave a filmy buildup in our hair no matter how much we rinsed or how little we used.</li>
            <li>the past, I bought pretty much every product available for this hair at Walmart and Target without success.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it was priced a little more cheaply.</li>
            <li>the problem was that I could only really afford it when it was offered at a super price on the shopping channel.  </li>
            <li>This has all natural ingredients and makes my hair super soft, cleanses it well, does not strip my hair color and even gives my hair some body.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for myself because I color my hair red regularly, and I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t strip the color out as quickly.</li>
            <li>I have dry, fine hair, and this shampoo makes it feel silky.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I was blown away by my results leaving my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>To keep it short and sweet, not everything works for everybody.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it and usually buy it at Walgreens along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use the full line of the Shea Moisture products and have noticed a big difference in the texture and growth of my hair.  </li>
            <li>With Shea Moisture after the first wash with a quarter sized amount my hair feels so soft as if I was using conditioner.</li>
            <li>When I used this shampoo my hair didn&#x27;t shed (and it was the first time ON MY NATURAL HAIR - 3 C type).  </li>
            <li>I was worried I&#x27;d run out since the bottle is kind of small</li>
            <li>my hair is VERY picky when it comes to certain natural oils, and by using trial and error</li>
            <li>This is definitely a new staple in my house!</li>
            <li>Not only do their products smell great due to the real essential oils, but they&#x27;re all organic.</li>
            <li>And wet combing with this was just like forget it; the hair got tangled too easy.</li>
            <li>I will say it does have an odd smell, but many people that comment on it don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s not a chemical smell</li>
            <li>It brushes better and knots so much less.</li>
            <li>but I found it feels that way less the more you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>Once I re-washed it with another unscented brand, the static went away, but as I mentioned above, the smell seemed to last forever.  </li>
            <li>But on the second application, 3 days later when it stripped even more color from my hair</li>
            <li>cleans well and moistuizes at the same time, would definitely recommned :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked by how many good reviews this ineffective product has.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and organic for your hair which is so much more healthier without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I spent about 5 extra minutes rinsing my hair under warm water.</li>
            <li>I have blonde super frizzy color treated over processed hair.  </li>
            <li>After just one use of this shampoo, my hair was suddenly very soft, looked much healthier, and my scalp was not irritated at all.</li>
            <li>So much so that I don&#x27;t even want to use my other shampoos, though I did just buy some of this line&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner for fine hair.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really get much of a lather without using a lot more shampoo than usual.</li>
            <li>It is slowly getting better (the itch and scale), but the hair loss stopped right away.  </li>
            <li>I have type \\&quot;2C\\&quot; highly porous, frizzy hair which is now thinning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend giving them a whirl, so to speak.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>used it today after a High Intensity Interval Training Class in which I sweated a lot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, i highly recommend you try this shampoo</li>
            <li>But, ever since trying the Shea Moisture shampoo, my hair has remained soft for weeks without me even using a moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my roots and just a little bit on my ends.</li>
            <li>and it looks a little better already.</li>
            <li>im transitioning my hair from relaxed to not relaxed and its tough to find products that make my hair look and feel good.</li>
            <li>We have thick curly hair that dries very easily at the ends and is very oily at the scalp.</li>
            <li>I am a white woman with curly-wavy hair that tends to get a major frizz halo with some breakage, and decided to try sulfate free.</li>
            <li>It left my fine, straight blonde hair with a waxy coating and made it look stringy and unwashed.</li>
            <li>had to return it due to STRONG SCENT.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised there are so many positive reviews for this product, because this shampoo left my hair DRY and feeling STRIPPED; that too \\&quot;squeaky-clean\\&quot; feeling someone else alluded to.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because some of my Natural friends absolutely raved about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and my hair is always a bit dryer than normal after I wash it.</li>
            <li>a week put coconut oil in from your scalp to your ends (make sure you massage your scalp for a few minutes) then cover your hair with the shower cap for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather well, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t contain the harsh chemicals (sulfates) found in most shampoos that produce that lather.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure all the moisturizing properties would make me look like a greasy mop, but I was so pleasantly surprised to see that not only did it not make my hair greasy, I had the softest, silkiest head of hair that I&#x27;ve seen in recent years since pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>The normal store brands like Tresemme and Clariol.</li>
            <li>pretty much the ONLY shampoo that keeps the itchy flakey scalp at bay).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the extra money</li>
            <li>yet many of us do this regularly, so I did not notice the smell as it was so minor if it existed at all.</li>
            <li>Normal Routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I rarely use heat styling tools and I use Moroccan oil daily.</li>
            <li>I have 4b natural hair and bought this shampoo after hearing lots of great reviews from other natural African American users.</li>
            <li>and it was so so but easily 3 times more expensive,</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it&#x27;s truly free of any harsh cleansing agents; many products claiming to be gentle and all-natural are full of irritating, drying chemicals.</li>
            <li>I decided to search for a natural shampoo after finally coming to the conclusion that the sulfates in my cheap shampoos were causing major dryness, tangles, and breakage.</li>
            <li>After the first day and a half, my hair was super greasy.</li>
            <li>Even with other sulfate free shampoos I have always felt my hair felt somewhat stripped.  </li>
            <li>Enhancing Smoothie is a new purchase and the jury is still out on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new conditoner and came across this product on amazon.</li>
            <li>I have never gone a day in my life without putting half a container full of conditioner on my head after shampooing!</li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps my often dry 4c/b hair super moist.  </li>
            <li>I like their hair masque as a leave-in conditioner and decided to try this on my super dry, flaky scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel very soft but not stripped.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair moisturized and very soft</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft with no breakage.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural shampoo and it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Bought too many products blindly and very rarely have I been amazed.  </li>
            <li>As for the smell, it&#x27;s very old lady like to me.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and my hair feels very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo to any women who are already natural or looking to go natural!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I add a little bit of peppermint oil to the mix when I shampoo and that really helps clean my scalp.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT AMAZON!</li>
            <li>(condition first  and shampoo second).</li>
            <li>Shiny, soft and not frizzy even in the humidity!</li>
            <li>moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became interested in this type of product after seeing a commercial for Wen.</li>
            <li>I read the ingredient list and was surprised to see a non-toxic product like this at CVS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know, natural and relaxed!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed for my Coarse African-American Hair.</li>
            <li>They were not small clumps, either.</li>
            <li>It is the color of mucous, so it is quite possible that&#x27;s exactly what it is.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and there was no frizz, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product (plus conditioner) at my local grocery store for $10.99 each bottle so that alone, I would bypass Amazon and head straight to the store!</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and not weighed down.</li>
            <li>- if you like the stripped &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling some other shampoos give you may not like this</li>
            <li>I liked that a little amount goes a long way</li>
            <li>I was happy with the shampoo as my hair did not get dried out as usual.</li>
            <li>Here is the most amazing and shocking thing since I switched to this product line I have to remind myself to clean my hairbrush now because my hair does not break off in the hairbrush when I brush it.</li>
            <li>My hair grows out quickly and sucks up all the moisture rapidly, making my hair feel dry most of the time</li>
            <li>The first time I used it and saw all the color in the rinse water, I was surprised but thought that maybe I hadn&#x27;t rinsed my hair well enough after coloring it.</li>
            <li>For the record I have medium wavy hair (asian) which is pretty soft to begin with.</li>
            <li>but... It is so strongly perfumed and dried the heck out of my hair.</li>
            <li>My natural red color seems to be a little more vibrant as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is similar to the pink SM line shampoo in the sense that it barely has any lather, and you don&#x27;t need too much to get a decent clean.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try it after reading all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most days I don&#x27;t use any styling products at all, and on the one or two times when I&#x27;ve used my flat iron it took much less time (and consequently, less heat) to make my hair look smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my hair has always been a little drier than most Asian women&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>, you only need a little, and my hair looks so much better when I use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a sulfate free shampoo that lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>it took me hours to clear that scent from my hands...</li>
            <li>Followed up with the  Shea Moisture Conditioner which definitely left my hair very soft--reminded me of the old Cream of Nature softness from years ago.</li>
            <li>4c natural</li>
            <li>I have used this in my child hair which is natural and it leaves her hair soft.</li>
            <li>But when i used it in my hair (transitioning from relaxed to natural)</li>
            <li>It stripped the color almost completely out.</li>
            <li>I have natural type 4 hair and have been in search of a shampoo that thoroughly cleanses my hair and scalp, without stripping it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m growing out my perm, and this shampoo works for both my permed and natural hair.</li>
            <li>and I am always on the look out for natural moisturizing products.</li>
            <li>it is natural with NO SLS.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>(I have shoulder length natural hair).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural oils after washing with it.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it is a shampoo that contains natural ingredients and no sulfates, etc.</li>
            <li>shampoo immediately makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li>Secondly, the moment you put this shampoo on your hair, you can feel how gentle and moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li>Once I finished washing and my hair was airdrying, I began detangling and immediately noticed how soft and easy-to-detangle my hair was.</li>
            <li>Since I have gone natural</li>
            <li>I have been transitioning from relaxed to natural hair for 3 weeks now and have used this shampoo &amp; conditioner as part of my regime.</li>
            <li>I have afro textured hair and am transitioning from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was natural without all the sulfates and chemicals that would still be moisturizing for him without stripping the oils out.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft but helps it to hold body and shine.</li>
            <li>Dries out my frequently colored hair.</li>
            <li>After I wash, my hair still feels soft and never stripped.  </li>
            <li>My hair has gotten so much healthier since I started using this shampoo and overall product line.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but think that some of the more negative reviews have been made by people who might not have given sulfate free/natural products a chance before.  </li>
            <li>i have natural hair btw</li>
            <li>(I think my hair might be protein sensitive).</li>
            <li>I had no trouble getting it to rinse out.  </li>
            <li>My hair has always been frizzy and wild.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got volume, natural curl and shine</li>
            <li>I had eventually found Carole&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Oil line, and used it about 3 months, and found it drying (even after an intense Ojon oil treatment), especially coming into the fall and winter months.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a curly girl and have been natural for about two months now.</li>
            <li>They both have natural hair.  </li>
            <li>and I have incredibly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised this one did.  </li>
            <li>I also started using this on my 3 year old son.</li>
            <li>I found this product at target and since we use all natural hair care in our house</li>
            <li>days ago and my hair has done a 180 with manageability and moisture by far.</li>
            <li>Organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>Since 1912.&lt;br /&gt;Tested on our family for four generations.&lt;br /&gt;Never on animals.&lt;br /&gt;MADE IN THE USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake well, natural ingredients tend to</li>
            <li>hair feels so soft</li>
            <li>I bought this product along with the hair mask treatment because it was all organic and natural</li>
            <li>I have lent some to family and friends, and so far, every one of them has gotten hooked after one try.</li>
            <li>It leaves is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Those of you with curly hair know how frequent washing strip the hair of all</li>
            <li>I am a Latina young woman with frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li>i have 4b/4c natural hair.</li>
            <li>My 21yr old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>My 23yr old son loves it (he is also a beautician).</li>
            <li>It was soft and shiny with plenty of body.  </li>
            <li>Yes I do admit that it does leave your hair (to some degree) &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;, but it so without compromising of it of its natural elasticity and moisture.</li>
            <li>For some, sulfate / residue free products are too harsh and my not provide them with the softness and shine they need.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I understand it&#x27;s a natural product -</li>
            <li>It caused my skin to break out like a 13 year old girl&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>I purchased this from CVS for $9.99, which is far cheaper.</li>
            <li>Feels soft even before using conditioner.</li>
            <li>Matter a fact, I use the whole line of Shea Moisture: shampoo, condition, deep treatment, and oil!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After some research, I discovered a few shampoos that are basically all natural, mostly organic, low or no sudsing.</li>
            <li>hair is soft, shiny, and manageable...</li>
            <li>Since I went natural I decided to try it AGAIN</li>
            <li>so  I knew that this was a natural product</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for natural hair.</li>
            <li>, I found the same shampoo at Walgreens for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I reverted to my natural hair about three years ago.  </li>
            <li>Having had my hair chemically treated for over 20 years there was a learning curve on how to work with my natural hair texture.  </li>
            <li>I have 2A type natural hair</li>
            <li>It has completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft and maneageable.</li>
            <li>My favorite affordable shampoo/conditioner so far: Herbal Essence Hydration (the blue bottle), Kiss My Face (green bottles), and now Shea Moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my CVS coupon (20% off) and bought Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner for $8 each.</li>
            <li>After doing this consistently over 45 days, my hair is so much easier to manage and looks way nicer with much less effort by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most reviews are positive, but I guess some people just aren&#x27;t fit for it.  :(</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the no lather effect, it doesn&#x27;t mean you have to use more.</li>
            <li>I have bounced around with shampoos and conditioners since I stopped giving my hair relaxer treatments, during the summers and some of spring going natural and getting flat ironed straightening very now and then the rest of the year.</li>
            <li>and I realized that my hair was muuuch thinner and less full.</li>
            <li>because with how the hair is dried at an angle, the hair looks straight before flat ironing, I use the flat iron more to style not to straighten.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really leaves my hair greasy and flat.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and after my first use I was shocked by how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li>I have 3b, fine, caucasian curly hair with frizz, porosity, and damage from past bleaching and straightening endeavors.  </li>
            <li>My hair was clean and it didn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue.  </li>
            <li>and I have difficulty getting this product to lather throughout my entire head - even though I try to focus on mainly the scalp area.  </li>
            <li>I JUST WENT OUT AND PURCHASED THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT FROM WALGREENS DRUGSTORE FOR ONLY 9.99!</li>
            <li>The same exact product (12 oz/same size) is only $10 at Target, Meijer, and Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Its strong scent is a little over powering, which is just my personal taste.</li>
            <li>It did not clean my hair and left it feeling more coarse and greasy than before washing.</li>
            <li>I have super long hair and this was recommended to me on the long hair forum.</li>
            <li>Now--I rinsed and rinsed and then conditioned, but my hair still felt heavy, coated with residue and to top it all off, incredibly dry.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this as it&#x27;s so hard to find shampoo/conditioners truly free of harmful chemicals that actually work.  </li>
            <li>Now, because they are truly without sulfates, they barely lather at all when you wash with them - so don&#x27;t be surprised at that.</li>
            <li>At least thats more moisturizing to my hair, I only wanted to try a natural shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair over 3 times to get normal feeling back into it.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night and went to sleep with my hair wet, which I normally don&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>but it left my hair feeling greasier then it normally is and almost slimy.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t particularly like it that the shampoo has, at least to me, a rather strong scent, which is why I gave it four stars.  </li>
            <li>I tried to calm it down with some Argan Oil, but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>Luckily I started with a small amount just to be on the safe side, a little goes a long way with this and all of the Shea Moisture products it seems.</li>
            <li>I knew it was this shampoo since it was the only new product I introduced to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking hmmmm ok doesn&#x27;t sound bad</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry hair (4b afro-american, very porous).</li>
            <li>I know that some products might not work for everyone, but if you have dry, curly hair, I would absolutely recommend you to try it.</li>
            <li>It is both cleansing and gentle, so it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that I ignored this product for awhile because I once tried Shea Moisture&#x27;s Coconut and Hibiscus line, and it did absolutely nothing for my hair besides leaving it dry.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to my third or fourth time using it</li>
            <li>My hair is moisturized and behaves really well in spite of myself and wrong doings. :-)</li>
            <li>My hair feels sticky and dirty after a fresh wash even when I don&#x27;t put conditioner at the root and make sure to rinse.</li>
            <li>I can use this alone and my thick drenched in moister and easy to work through.</li>
            <li>The scent was always a little strong and perfumey but it never stayed in your hair long after rinsing.</li>
            <li>Shea moisture leaves my white girl 3B hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo alone left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It appealed to me originally because of the small amount of ingredients.</li>
            <li>Today my hair is very shiny, silky, and much less frizzy than I normally get.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine straight as an arrow hair, and it did not leave an oil slick like some other reviewers report.</li>
            <li>Normal texture is very course with a tight curl (Andre Scale 4B).</li>
            <li>But the last bottle I purchased, the beginning of June, felt different when I was putting it on my hair, thinner, less rich and creamy somehow</li>
            <li>So im shocked but happy</li>
            <li>And it has all natural ingredients which is a definite plus with me.  </li>
            <li>my mixed afro textured hair completely.</li>
            <li>I spent so much money on products that did not stand by what it was required to do.</li>
            <li>Ever since I went natural in 2009, I have been struggling to find products that my hair agrees with, especially shampoos.</li>
            <li>In fact, my hair was left feeling so soft that I assumed this was because I had not washed all of the product out of my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend this shampoo to naturals who have tried co-washing but would like to use an all natural shampoo instead.shampoo instead.</li>
            <li>I actually still had my old bottle and I compared ingredients</li>
            <li>I do not wet wrap or roller set my hair</li>
            <li>needed!!&lt;br /&gt;Its has a wow factor definitely!</li>
            <li>Once I went back to my old products my scalp started to recover.  </li>
            <li>It even seems to accentuate his natural blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li>Shea Moisture&#x27;s Moisture Retention Shampoo does the complete opposite by restoring the moisture into my strands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to Aveda&#x27;s shampure shampoo and then the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to stick it out and finish off the bottle because it was more expensive than what I normally pay for shampoo, but I just don&#x27;t think I can.</li>
            <li>so it makes my whole head of hair pretty thick.</li>
            <li>I straightened my hair after showering with this and got crazy good results.</li>
            <li>I also used the Carols Daughter line, which was ok, but not great.</li>
            <li>(starting with the crown first and working towards the middle and through the ends) on high initially until the hair gets moderately dry, then I turn it to low as to not overdry the hair.</li>
            <li>And strange as it may sound, I even use their African Black Soap cleansing shampoo on my dogs who have itchy skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten my hair permed recently and needed a new shampoo/conditioner that didn&#x27;t cause any further damage in my hair.</li>
            <li>My entire life my hair has been very frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li>I did some research and found out that raw shampoo is different from the regular stuff (even the sulfate free formulas)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it will be for anyone else, but you won&#x27;t need to be spending extra money on conditioner, so this price is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>In overall the shampoo makes the wash little of a struggle free as it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair when it lather.</li>
            <li>i really recommend this product to any with dry to brittle hair!!!</li>
            <li>No stripping chemicals such as sulfates which give lots of suds but can potentially strip hair of vital oils.</li>
            <li>I still have some conditioner left, and I&#x27;ll use that up, but I&#x27;ll have to find a different natural shampoo, and that is a shame, and and a pain.</li>
            <li>decided to go the &amp;#34;low-poo&amp;#34; route---sort of as an in between step before going back to my old simply sulfate-free ways.</li>
            <li>It has no sulfates in it and it does not dry my hair or strip the color out of it.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical about using this shampoo because of the mixed reviews i found online (not just on amazon).</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel dry and it felt very soft.</li>
            <li>I rate it 5 stars due to it being cruelty free and all natural and being a small family owned business.</li>
            <li>My hair is desert dry and super thick, I never use shampoo normally</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s shampoo for really dry hair, if you have a normal hair this product likely make it oily</li>
            <li>/&gt;SM is generally a hit or miss for me, and this was a definite miss.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with many of the other negative reviewers, this shampoo may not be for you.</li>
            <li>It has completely eliminated my frizz, made my hair extremely moisturized and soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is trying to get the rich, thick lotion out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51, have thick, fine, fairly long hair,</li>
            <li>It smells beautifully, but it&#x27;s the absolute worst shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>strips your hair can make it dry or even unclean looking because it&#x27;s taking away all its natural chemicals.</li>
            <li>I change the color all the time and my hair is naturally a bit dry and damaged feeling</li>
            <li>In reality, if your hair is dry, brittle or you just prefer an all natural approach, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not all Target department stores carry the Shea Moisture line - at least, the one near where I reside doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li>I have disliked my hair pretty much my entire life.</li>
            <li>I will see how the product works on my 8 year old&#x27;s super thick hair, but I will be on the hunt for another shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel very thick, healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out or get itchy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and all other Shea Moisture products normally retail for $9.99, which is the manufacturer&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>It is pretty heavy stuff though and the perfumed scent will last you until the second coming of Moses.</li>
            <li>recommendation for having perfectly soft, LONG, and amazing hair (if you have similar hair to me) is buying extra-virgin cold pressed coconut oil, this shampoo, this hair masque, biotin 5,000 mcg, shower caps, and &amp;#34;its a 10&amp;#34; leave in spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more frizz, tons of shine, no oily roots at the end of the day and my hair color doesn&#x27;t fade the way it does even with other sulfate free shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I recently made the big chop, going natural and my hair is usually really dry with a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li>I have thin, frizzy, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4a\b\c hair that is very dry.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned because it didn&#x27;t lather much in the shower</li>
            <li>This could be bad or good, depending on whether you toned your hair correctly or not</li>
    </ol>

            <li> GREAT product.  </li>
            <li> Great shampoo for itchiness.</li>

            <li> in great condition and on time as well.</li>
            <li> and it has a creamy consistency and makes my hair smell great days after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> It smells great, has no sulfates, and my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found something that works for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of volume and body and my curls are looking great.</li>
            <li> but if this shampoo keeps giving me great results, I might just try the corresponding conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells great, though.</li>
            <li> I swear my hair is growing and happy this product.</li>
            <li> It is a great shampoo.  </li>
            <li> stuff is great.</li>

            <li> I did and I have to say my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li> Also, it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;m loving this product line!</li>
            <li> Both are truly astounding!</li>
            <li> Its the best sulfate free shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Easily the best shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I read a description saying that it would not strip color from hair and was actually good for colored hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is good, BUT it still strips my hair.</li>
            <li> So I picked this up at Target and looked at the ingredients and it looked good to me.      </li>
            <li> and I loved the results this shampoo provided.  </li>
            <li> but this alone works good.</li>
            <li> This product has good reviews however you must look at why they were given one star ratings.</li>
            <li> , it smells so good, I&#x27;ve had compliments about it</li>
            <li> THE BEST SULFATE FREE SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li> Nothing too fancy, but the results were good.  </li>
            <li> I almost opted to forgo the conditioner, but thought a bit on the ends would be good.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for color-treated hair at all.</li>
            <li> Sustainably Produced.&lt;br /&gt;Pioneering Community Commerce and Fair Trade</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so good</li>
            <li> i thought it would be good</li>
            <li> I must say, this stuff is good.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell</li>
            <li> Although the Wen stuff sounds good, they don&#x27;t mention the ingredients on their website.</li>
            <li> I read all of these good reviews and was hopeful it would be good</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> if you know why you are using it and manage the use of it wisely.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost too good.</li>
            <li> It has lots of the great oils and ingredients I tried on no-poo and a nice fragrance (perhaps a bit too musky</li>
            <li> And I feel good knowing</li>
            <li> I discovered this one after a friend said she&#x27;d had good results.</li>
            <li> one product is perfect for everyone, but overall this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the masque but this great.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful but its what the hair feels like and how it acts afterward that makes it worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Shea Moisture and will defintely support this product.</li>
            <li> Now is very healthy.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t feel right unless I&#x27;m scrunching that wonderful soapy suds through my tresses.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of trial and error and years of running from what the Good Lord gave me I can honestly say I love my hair!</li>
            <li> And on top of all that.... it REEKS!   </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty much perfect.  </li>
            <li> Love this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled that they&#x27;re being sold for so much more than this!</li>
            <li> It works like magic!</li>

            <li> If you are looking for a great sulfate free, organic shampoo...</li>
            <li> After massaging the shampoo into my hair and scalp and rinsing, my hair felt amazing.</li>
            <li> The product itself is amazing but not the price (online!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2017</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> the smell is nice.     </li>
            <li> I tried doing the conditioner washes but honestly doing that leaves my scalp loaded with buildup.  </li>
            <li> This is the best gentle shampoo I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is so gentle and smells great!</li>
            <li> I tried the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Shampoo and wasn&#x27;t thrilled about how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> smells like chemically altered graham crackers and good for your hair :)</li>
            <li> It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> Awesome really cleans well but does not strip.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased by this product, I also just started buying the lotions and soaps (today), so I will leave a review once I get a good feel for the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am just thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> and I liked that it still created a bit of sud.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, and has a nice smell, not overpowering like some.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice texture on your hair when blowdried however which is nice.</li>
            <li> the kind of perfume that you can taste because its</li>
            <li> need someone to do that for me, package it up nicely and let me buy it.</li>
            <li> Smell great, leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I guess I think this shampoo is just average-not really great but not bad either.  </li>
            <li> Always trying new things to find the perfect products for my hair!  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, my hair looks great when I use this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li> I learned that it was best to stay away from shampoos that strip the natural oils from your hair, and even heard that I shouldn&#x27;t be shampooing at all!</li>
            <li> Very good shine, no greasiness, but it does feel very moist after rinsing anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They make the best products for natural hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used in my 23 years of having hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Best product for natural and relaxes hair.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best shampoo we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST combination I have used.</li>
            <li> The price is right, it smells very pleasant and after using it to shampoo my hair, it always feels silky and free of tangles.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> I love love love this brand!</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with fine hair (though a lot of it!), over-processed and shoulder length.</li>
            <li> It rinsed out very nicely, and still, there was no matting; my hair felt clean and smooth and moisturized - almost as if I had used WEN.  </li>
            <li> The lather was incredible for a non-sulfate/all natural shampoo!  </li>
            <li> Most people rave about the scent -</li>
            <li> addition to the conditioner and hair milk I AM IN LOVE with this.</li>
            <li> a thing LOL.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and God bless :)</li>
            <li> I could have been okay with that if it had moisturized my hair at all</li>
            <li> All of them seemed to have stripped my hair of even more moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I think it could be more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Still in search of a better shampoo though.</li>
            <li> which I&#x27;m sure just damaged my hair more.</li>
            <li> And at $10 each, a much better value than high-end salon brands.</li>
            <li> Try Aubrey Organics, it&#x27;s 100% better than this.</li>
            <li> Shea butter in itself is very moisturizing and a great product.</li>
            <li> and I love the all-natural list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> After trying it, I definitely agree, this shampoo is the best i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I like the way it cleanses, but the fragrance is overwhelming and cloying</li>
            <li> and I love the way I can control my hair after using.</li>
            <li> I used it and fell in love.</li>
            <li> My hair is 4a/4b (more so 4b).</li>
            <li> After applying this, my curls were more defined and luscious.</li>
            <li> and I love them both.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to use a good product that smells good without the use of chemicals, described only as \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; in the ingredients list of many products.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair felt even more brittle than a henna or keratin treatment has made it feel.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> BETTER THAN WEN.</li>
            <li> but after a week my hair started to retain its curls better and eventually became easier to comb.</li>
            <li> But if you use a clarifying shampoo once a week in place of the shampoo and then a silicone- glycerine free hair mask your hair will stay nice and volumeous.</li>
            <li> I love the Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair feel and</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> May work better for others.</li>
            <li> The curls are also more defined.</li>
            <li> This time, all I used was the protectant and my hair was more sleek than it&#x27;s ever been and shiny like no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This sulfate free shampoo is a nice balance.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt or looked better.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> Love your products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was incredibly impressed with the initial use.  </li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels; not over conditioned or greasy/oily at all..</li>
            <li> One thing to remember, rinse,rinse, and rinse some more.  </li>
            <li> Ever since having kids my scalp gets flakey and does not like most shampoos at all.</li>
            <li> but it really feels great while washing.</li>
            <li> I never have problems with dandruff or greasy hair using this product any more.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent it has in it as well.</li>
            <li> hair will love the  pampering.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of shampoos and love this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem and have always been pleased with how it made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> This product  leaves my hair moistened and healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have it bleached every three to six months, and it has made my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure to lather it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better shampoos though.</li>
            <li> it love it</li>
            <li> all you wanna do is keep touching it.with the use of the conditioner this all that i need.</li>
            <li> While I love the smell, ingredient list and company ethics, this is not meant for my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo moisturizes my hair even better than some conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite brand of hair care product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair feels much softer and it smells great.</li>
            <li> So I am glad that some people don&#x27;t react to it, but just a warning to others.</li>
            <li> I love the way his hair smells afterwards</li>
            <li> Love this non sulfate shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure to grab it.</li>
            <li> and my curls are a lot tighter than most Hispanic women</li>
            <li> I almost bought the one for the curly hair but this just seemed better in terms of what it could do and both were about 10 bucks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many products are branded as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but still contain a lot of toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make sure to update</li>
            <li> If you are paying $16 for this bottle of shampoo, you are getting ripped off unless the weight is greater than 13 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Make sure u buy it online from drugstore.com, walgreens.com or target.com....</li>
            <li> I love this brand their body products and hair.</li>
            <li> and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I get more kisses on the head now while snuggling on the couch.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use it as often to maintain a healthy scalp so it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy when I do use it now.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, this shampoo lathers well, smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It also protects my precious hair color.  </li>
            <li> yet is color safe.  </li>
            <li> get one free, which rocks!  </li>
            <li> I also love the Shea Moisture masks.  </li>
            <li> They work even better if you use them with a heat cap for 45 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> I love it and the smell is beyond.</li>
            <li> After using so many different products, the best advice I can give is examine your hair, examine its texture and style.</li>
            <li> no product in world is going to make your hair any better</li>
            <li> This, as well as the mask and leave in conditioner are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how so many people could like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper and smells so much better.  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> even if you dont know for sure that your hair likes Shea oil</li>
            <li> and I love my hair.</li>
            <li> Tried repeating the combination again but haven&#x27;t been able to duplicate the result.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos</li>
            <li> It just made my hair feel softer, more pliable and easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> but Wen is just better.</li>
            <li> In terms of performance Wen is still better.</li>
            <li> Overall, an awesome product to have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love the smell too because it really stays, which is great because I wash my hair every-other-day.</li>
            <li> thanks to this wonderful product, i can reach and scrub my scalp super easily</li>
            <li> Our special blend of organic Shea Butter, nourishing Argan Oil and mineral-rich Sea Kelp is perfect for transitioning chemically treated hair to healthy natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea</li>
            <li> very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this brand and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> What kind of shampoo doesn&#x27;t even clean your hair?</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo, I&#x27;m natural 4C type hair and this shampoo is so moisturizing and makes my hair feel so great before a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I loved the way my hair felt while using it.  </li>
            <li> is pretty good.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is better than the Shea moisture conditioner, but they are both great if you want some natural.</li>
            <li> Nice mild scent; cleans hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> and it feels so clean!</li>
            <li> If this company ever comes out with a truly fragrant free product, I may try again if I can figure out the static issue.</li>
            <li> My hair is the softest its ever been, smells great, and completely repaired my hair after frying it with the no-poo method.</li>
            <li> Leaves the sking incredibly soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> lol it surprised me.</li>
            <li> Great for adults, children, and no harsh chemicals polluting the earth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not the most fruity but the ingredients are fantastic and you can&#x27;t have it all without adding synthetic fragrances.  </li>
            <li> and i ordered it after the reviews on here and let me tell you this is a great product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and light of course I have noticed but</li>
            <li> I used to use a $30 shampoo and $30 conditioner combo, which although better than the cheap $10 combos, contained sodium sulfate.</li>
            <li> I personally enjoy the smell, it&#x27;s not flowery, but more musky, shea butter-like.</li>
            <li> The masks have a bit more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; for those who have fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> The masks have a bit more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; for those who have fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I was happy to know that Shea Moisture hair products were natural and that did not contain any chemical agents.</li>
            <li> I thought since this was sulfate free, that i needed to use more in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for natural kinky hair and locs.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, my hair smells good all day.  </li>
            <li> It is great for your hair, leaves it soft and makes it easy to detangle.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of these wonderful ingredients, and my hair did not mat at all (which I do have slight problems with in using the Carole&#x27;s Daughter line, and also when I had tried the Yes to Cucumbers shampoo this spring).  </li>
            <li> This shampoos is fabulous and a rare recommended healthy shampoo on EWG&#x27;s ratings!</li>
            <li> At first I thought that it was just me, but after more than one try and a handful of tangles and hair shred, I then knew!  </li>
            <li> trying other products, including Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Organix, As I Am, Curl Junkie, and Jane Carter, I found that this shampoo is still the best one.</li>
            <li> With my curly hair, I&#x27;m a true hair product junkie!  </li>
            <li> I chose it due to its excellent EWG rating.</li>
            <li> After using the conditioner, any tangles are easily combed out.</li>
            <li> After using the conditioner, any tangles are easily combed out.</li>
            <li> , however, the scent was SO STRONG I could not handle it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can continue using it because I don&#x27;t want to be the person with the strong perfume in crowded places.</li>
            <li> Rosemary has a naturally strong scent.</li>
            <li> Strong scent.</li>
            <li> The honeysuckle smell is too strong.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and used it all the time, until I realized that one of their main ingredients is \\&quot;sugar beets\\&quot;, of which 95% of them are GMO in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> In fact, it completely changed the texture of my hair, amazing!</li>
            <li> On the 3rd day, my hair still looks good and most of all it looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li> it was full of static electricity.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Most true sulfate free shampoos do not lather</li>
            <li> The black soap formulas are wonderful for dandruff and ezema.</li>
            <li> I have medium fine hair</li>
            <li> (It worked when I has relaxed hair) and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> With my hair being so fine, I have to wash it every day.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, it had a very strong cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li> My husband is a huge fan.  </li>
            <li> (I wash about once a week) and huge clumps of hair were coming out in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have a chemical sensitivity and this bottle says it&#x27;s free of synthetic fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different shampoos from many different product lines over the years, and this shampoo is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This product is fabulous, and I paired it with the anti-breakage and volumizing biotin hair masque from this company.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 4a/b type hair, wish it came in a larger quantity</li>
            <li> its a great product (for me) but amazon is selling this product for 26 dollars when you can go to your local beauty supply store or target.com and get it for 10.</li>
            <li> , then my hair looks fabulous for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It is a great shampoo that lather and giving moisturze depending on different hair condition.</li>
            <li> one get one free.</li>
            <li> The lather it makes is so smooth</li>
            <li> Which is great cause it will last longer!</li>
            <li> Reduced break outs and head sores which I attribute to sulfate free/ gluten free.</li>
            <li> So this is Alex&#x27;s suggestion for a &amp;#34;low-poo&amp;#34; alternative that&#x27;s free of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Found this shampoo about 6 months ago, absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews for this product seemed like it was genuine</li>
            <li> On that spree I walked into the hair aisle for a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important that I keep them moist.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo not only makes my hair smell great</li>
            <li> It feels light and has plenty of body and shine.</li>
            <li> Since this brand is locally available to me, I decided to give it a</li>
            <li> This formula is great and it only contains around four ingredients!</li>
            <li> I love that it is reasonably priced and readily available!  </li>
            <li> I thought the Yucca was okay, but something wasn&#x27;t quite right about how my hair felt after washing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> but it still great shampoo with moistursing better than other organic and commerical.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo I rarely have to condition my hair, it feels clean and moisturized and healthy all the time(and</li>
            <li> Anyway I started reading more about my hair type and went more toward the natural route which changed my whole styling routine and has left my hair in the best condition its ever been in.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was just as good, leaving my hair soft, yet full.</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair and let&#x27;s be honest</li>
            <li> I have very curly Hispanic hair that is just really dry, probably cause I don&#x27;t take the best care of it</li>
            <li> and my hair tangles significantly</li>
            <li> After using it for a month, I notice my hair looks significantly healthier.</li>
            <li> I anticipate a long and happy relationship with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed when I tried it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product with the Transitioning set for Shea Moisture.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> This is so worth the money!</li>
            <li> Its concentrated and rich consistency makes is so that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> ;, it lathered beautifully and didn&#x27;t dry my hair one bit!!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say as a black women this is the first shampoo I have ever used that has been great to my hair.</li>
            <li> that it lathered well and seemed to get my hair clean</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry curly hair and this dies a great job on her hair.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp was clean but still had moisture, not stripped.  </li>
            <li> it gets my hair clean without stripping any moisture.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair EXTREMELY clean to the point of sticky, squeaky, fall out.  </li>
            <li> It detangles and moisturizes very well and most importantly</li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t use conditioner after this for keep my hair clean longer and i can save money</li>
            <li> but it rinsed away clean.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need the suds for your hair to be clean, just mentioning and as others have said you can find it cheaper in stores.</li>
            <li> Looked at the ingredients and was like how is this going to clean my hair</li>
            <li> It leaves it clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Although I managed to wash out the oil, my hair did have a lingering smell from the shampoo, which was actually quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> If you want nice soft hair, do NOT buy this goop!</li>
            <li> The consistency is very slimy/oily in comparison to Wen which is much more rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> but I thought nothing special -</li>
            <li> Post relaxer and this shampoo  is most certainly for those who are in a state of transition.</li>
            <li> RIGHT THERE IN THE SHOWER AFTER RINSING!</li>
            <li> They soak right in and banish any static or dryness and leave my hair very supple but strong.</li>
            <li> They soak right in and banish any static or dryness and leave my hair very supple but strong.</li>
            <li> In short, my hair is in pretty great shape.</li>
            <li> AND THEN I went out and got several compliments on how good my hair smelled LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel more moist and nourished and much healthier.</li>
            <li> I would much prefer purchasing this product on-the-ground, but I am glad that I can purchase it through amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the ingredients are natural and sound like they would be good for my moisture-starved, straight hair and for my husband&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo alone has so much moisture that many times I go without conditioner.</li>
            <li> It definitely wasn&#x27;t a good match for me.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair moisturuzed and full.  </li>
            <li> BUT i think it might be because it didnt get rinsed out good enough.</li>
            <li> I have the Shea Moisture body wash for this collection, which I love and have been using for around a year straight now.</li>
            <li> , the good thing is I only shampoo once a month</li>
            <li> I really love this product as it really cleans and adds moisture.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s different and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> even my hair dresser has asked me what I changed because my hair is now so much thicker, healthy looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> I found this to be true.  </li>
            <li> They are not being honest and making people believe they are buying an all natural product, when in fact, that is as unnatural and chemical as you can get.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and thought this shampoo would be good for it, but I can&#x27;t make an evaluation of its cleansing abilities after only one wash.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this Shampoo.</li>
            <li> product, which I initially found in the Afro hair section of a Target, appealed to me initially because it&#x27;s organic, free of sulfates and parabens and also fair traded and the brand is charitable.  </li>
            <li> At $10 it&#x27;s pricier than regular shampoo, cheaper than many high end shampoos that aren&#x27;t nearly as good.  </li>
            <li> Until I had a baby, my hair was beautiful - like Jennifer Aniston hair beautiful: thick, naturally straight, and it withstood regular highlighting quite well, even though it was extremely fine.</li>
            <li> it doesnt dry out my hair which is great as i am able to retain my natural oils as well.</li>
            <li> It was cheap - about $8.50 (the conditioner is the same price), I liked the list of ingredients (esp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such success with their Curl Enhancing Smoothie that I thought this would work just as good too...not even.</li>
            <li> love this Shampoo and already recommended it to others including my family members, but I would never buy this for more than $10 because this is what it is sold for at stores such as Target and Walgreens-</li>
            <li> but when I give them a try they are always super drying and mat my strands together.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love the rich texture and lovely fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Love it, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used so many high end products.  </li>
            <li> Not that this product needs anymore amazing reviews, but: I have extremely fine, pin straight hair that is very fragile and easily damaged.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company by email with the lot numbers from the bottles and store addresses and dates where they were purchased, they said they had received no other complaints about this issue and said the would send me free shampoo to compensate me, they were super nice and replayed promptly at first however months have passed</li>
            <li> First off, I am a huge skeptic and read tons of reviews before buying products now.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair smelling good all day long.</li>
            <li> I also used an apple cider vinegar rinse right after this and then rinsed again with cool water.</li>
            <li> Great for my dyed black hair.  </li>
            <li> I get a good lather with this shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and dry out my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I just recently starting using this shampoo and I love it!</li>
            <li> Will go back and get more!</li>
            <li> I bought this originally because i was so excited about it being made 100% from all natural products and is chemical free.</li>
            <li> :) For info purposes, I have natural 4c hair, 4d, 4e and etc.!</li>
            <li> also love Amazon shopping with the convenience it offers and price savings through my Prime Membership!</li>
            <li> My hair gets pretty frizzy but this helped a lot!</li>
            <li> Overall, really pleased!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the conditioner and while I love the short, easy to read product list, I did not reap any of the benefits.</li>
            <li> They make a fine product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I needed to apply less leave-in conditioner and my curly hair feels great, manageable, and most importantly, not dried</li>
            <li> To be honest, I would have missed out on a great hair product given that label because my hair is your typical European hair and I wouldn&#x27;t have even thought to look.</li>
            <li> get one free deals in certain stores.</li>
            <li> Just so some people are aware, Argan Oil has a very strong smell naturally</li>
            <li> I like this company&#x27;s products so much that my bathroom is filled with them.</li>
            <li> I went from using an all natural $25 a bottle shampoo from a company called JustNatural, to using an Aloe shampoo from Organics, to using Garnier Fructis Hydra Recharge (huge HUGE mistake)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to wash my hair another few times or so and see if this shampoo still gives me great results.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate what they are trying to do with healthy ingredients, but there are better natural hair lines out there that make your hair soft and makes it feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> I guess its geared more toward totally natural hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE the fact that&#x27;s the ingredients are ALL natural.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling healthy, soft, shiny, and manageable</li>
            <li> It does have the distinct smell that can be overpowering at times</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens, so no comment on getting it from Amazon, but this is worth trying out.  </li>
            <li> Love them  Love them but not much use if I can&#x27;t get them out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I had almost convinced myself to buy the $30 Ojon Rare oils shampoo, when I found Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner at WalMart.  </li>
            <li> I also feel like it helps my hair feel thicker and seem to have more volume ,but that is probably because it doesnt strip it of all natural moisture.</li>
            <li> I love what this product is about - no animal testing, &amp; using natural products, no sulfates....</li>
            <li> I love that it is natural.</li>
            <li> After it continued happening, I read the label more completely and it does say to discontinue use if irritation occurs.  </li>
            <li> I had begun to despair at how unmanageable it was, especially in any kind of humidity.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use either the conditioner or the deep conditioner very often at all any more -- mostly I just use the shampoo, and I wash my hair about every 3 days.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised to see so many 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> and when i rinse, my coils are soft, looser, and much more manageable.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cause my eye because of the shea butter ingredient and all the other good stuff inside.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> it did not seem right.</li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t tone well, this shampoo will pull it right out.</li>
            <li> One part of that learning was finding the right combination of products for both my texture and my environment.  </li>
            <li> Another thing I love is how far it can go, because of how much hair I have I tend to go through both quickly to get all to the scalp, some how with Shea Moisture</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, I love the smell, the down to earth ingredients</li>
            <li> I have short hair with soft curls, but between coloring it monthly in middle age and texture changes that come with age (dryer, coarser greys), I&#x27;ve been dependent on leave in conditioners and fixatives in order for my hair to look as healthy and attractive as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling strong and soft!</li>
            <li> and  I highly recommend it and the other great Shea Moisture products.o.  </li>
            <li> and  I highly recommend it and the other great Shea Moisture products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the shiniest, softest and prettiest my hair has looked in years of frequent coloring, feels great, and all I do is sort of shake it out and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> The smell is kind of an earthy scent that is very natural which is what I would hope for from a natural product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s a great product and if you don&#x27;t mind spending $10 on a relatively small bottle of shampoo</li>
            <li> The ingredients were exactly what I was looking for, and the price was right, $9.95 for each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not want to get my hopes up too high, but the reviews on Amazon and Walgreens had me excited.</li>
            <li> My hair did comb out easily with my wide toothed comb, and I blew it out as I normally do on the warm setting, then used my hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> It will leave your hair clean and super soft.</li>
            <li> Good product build hair strong but does dry out with daily use</li>
            <li> natural, gentle, and safe for color treated hair</li>
            <li> I rarely buy the same bottle of shampoo twice because Im never truly satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten so strong that the breakage is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> The results of this product are somewhat decent (which is why I gave it a 2 star instead of 1), but feels and smells like there is more to it than \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters natural hair soft and very easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I like that it is all natural, but I don&#x27;t like that the smell (though natural and not unpleaseant) is very strong and lingers for days after she washes.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found shampoo that actually makes a huge noticeable difference on my hair before, but this one did!</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d be okay, but it bothered me enough to have to re-shampoo my hair again with another unscented brand I use to get the smell out.  </li>
            <li> this product works so much better then the Mizani moisturefusion shampoo i brought last month...</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several products from the Shea Moisture line and love them all.</li>
            <li> It rinsed pretty well</li>
            <li> Who wants to have junk in their shampoo anyway!  </li>
            <li> Garnier Nutrisse triple condition, which now has amodimethicone - any recs are appreciated!)</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture products are always cheaper at Target or your local drugstores so be sure to look there before buying on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strips hair too much!  </li>
            <li> I have long, naturally coarse (but relaxed) hair, and switching to this shampoo (and discontinuing use of sulfate shampoos in general) is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my hair.</li>
            <li> EDIT: Please do not buy this product or any other Shea Moisture hair product for more than $9.99!</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well in my hair!</li>
            <li> Only reason I give it 4 stars is that it seems to take more effort to get the product out of the bottles... like the bottles are made of denser plastic</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The first week I used it</li>
            <li> They just basically used a different form of it to be able to call it that.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and on the first wash I could see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I am really looking forward to seeing how my hair responds after prolonged use!</li>
            <li> YOU MUST PRE POO FIRST, EVEN WITH A PREE POO YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> We always use natural and cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> Once per month, I will wash my hair first with a clarifying shampoo then wash again with Shea Moisture and then condition as mentioned.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to buy higher end products where I also bought salon brands as well to include the Sebastian line, to which I was using before this</li>
            <li> this seller needs to be aware of this.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use that much!</li>
            <li> I just finished the first bottle of shampoo --</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> So the price might be higher than a retail store, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I first used this product about two days ago</li>
            <li> First I was attracted by the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever tried a Sulfate-Free Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would leave too much sticky residue, but it does not!</li>
            <li> It does feel a bit greasy when you first start to use it</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my hair lacked body and I was tempted to return it.  </li>
            <li> that is what attracted me to it in the first place - but I cannot fathom why a shampoo would ever smell like this.</li>
            <li> That is exactly what happend to my hair.</li>
            <li> Very close to Wen products!</li>
            <li> For the first time I can remember I did not have to use a detangler.  </li>
            <li> After drying and styling,  my hair felt more in balance with necessary moisture.  </li>
            <li> It was very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I have never had my hair and scalp feel so clean and so soft just from shampoo!</li>
            <li> It was so good that my dry scalp issue is now completely gone.  </li>
            <li> His hair is very soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, dry hair and my scalp tends to get irritated in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my 4 year old bi-racial son&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> I will be trying the conditioner due to this spectacular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Most kiddie shampoos make his beautiful curls feel dry and straw-like after a few uses, however, with the Shea Butter version, his curls were so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Just over a month ago, I tried this shampoo and the Raw Shea Restorative Conditioner because I couldn&#x27;t think of a good reason not to.</li>
            <li> I also love Shea Moisture&#x27;s Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which has apple cider vinegar (but smells really clean) which removes buildup but</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, moisturized, and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> , It cleans... just not in the &#x27;stripping all natural oils from your hair&#x27; kinda way that people tend to perceive  as clean.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t clean and leave as silky soft as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I hope you Natural Hair ladies enjoy as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I then followed up with the conditioner, and then I deep conditioned with the Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque, and my hair absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only positive thing about is that it will LAST YOU, so it&#x27;s a good investment (about $10/bottle in store, and it will be MONTHS before i&#x27;m finished with it for my medium length</li>
            <li> I used a clarifying shampoo first (Paul Mitchell Shampoo One) because I had a lot of product build up and wasn&#x27;t sure this shampoo could remove it all and my hair general felt pretty soft afterwards--definitely softer than after the clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I would just caution everyone that less is more!</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, too, mildly floral, and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> shea butter and argan oil), and the reviews were extremely positive.    </li>
            <li> but I like to feel a little more clean that I do with ACW and baking soda.</li>
            <li> Wen - seems designed more for people who have a softer and not as tight curl or for another hair type - not anything special in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathered up well and smelled nice, but after I rinsed it out, it left so much oil in my hair that I had to wash it out with my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was pretty much &amp;#34;snapping&amp;#34; or</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture really thought out their ingredient list, no sulfates, gentle cleansers, no alcohols, and lots of moisture!  </li>
            <li> This product is not only all natural, sulfate free, and cheap</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this in the store and I have used hair products for damaged hair in the past, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, and leaves hair moisturized without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I certainly haven&#x27;t found this to be true, far from it.  </li>
            <li> I certainly haven&#x27;t found this to be true, far from it.  </li>
            <li> hair care...which means not using any commercial shampoos or conditioners, to ultimately give you amazingly shiny, wavy, frizz free, soft, detangled hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shampoos from the high end to low end and many inbetween.</li>
            <li> The top layer of my hair looked incredibly dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied the shampoo, IMMEDIATELY my hair felt super soft, not exaggerating at all.</li>
            <li> my scalp is not dry or flaky, and the fragrance in my hair is light and heavenly.  </li>
            <li> I love this shea moisture line and this is my shampoo, but it will leave your hair dry.</li>
            <li> It smells just like super pungent old lady perfume-</li>
            <li> I also believe that sticking to a certain product in your hair for a certain time will help it grow or show you what works or wont work.</li>
            <li> After weeks of heading to the shower with bowls full of mud, egg yolks mixed with avocado, jars of raw honey, whisks, newfangled combs, etc, I realize that I am not the type of person who will enjoy concocting my own homemade and highly perishable shampoo cocktails</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells nice and is not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> To straighten I normally used 3 or 4 products on top of the protenctant to get it to lay decently flat and be shiny.</li>
            <li> I did not know this was marketed towards ethnic hair types until researching it the next day after use because it did such a phenomenal job!</li>
            <li> Although the shampoo smells good, the smell is like a strong perfume (which I don&#x27;t love, but don&#x27;t hate either)so be mindful of that.</li>
            <li> so I used it AGAIN for the first time today on my NATURAL hair and it work VERY, VERY well.</li>
            <li> My hair went from 100% straight to 95% corkscrew-curly and 5% straight, with all the straight hair in the front.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product at Target and I am not totally convinced that their ingredient list is accurate.</li>
            <li> In My late 30&#x27;s now, I have tried from the bottom to top end hair products and this is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I had read such great things about it, but I feel like this was unfortunately a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t found anything close to Shea Moisture at this price point.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> MUCH  </li>
            <li> You know, I was expecting this shampoo to really help</li>
            <li> very creamy</li>
            <li> You can tell because those products get really sudsy.</li>
            <li> Shea moisture doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy, but it still does the job.</li>
            <li> I will be trying their whole line of products.</li>
            <li> well moisturized and feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely dreaded wash days because I couldn&#x27;t detangle my hair after washing without lots of hair breaking off, no matter</li>
            <li> It gave my hair so much \\&quot;slip\\&quot;, as people say.</li>
            <li> breaking anytime I really touched it.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel very moisturized during the shampoo process and after.  </li>
            <li> THEY CARRY THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF SHEA MOISTURE PROUCTS.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my scalp very thoroughly while keeping my hair moisturized, so there was no stripping.</li>
            <li> Just one gentle cleansing agent besides water and the remainder of the ingredients to be moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Anyway, regardless of what shampoo or conditioner I used, my hair was very tangly BUT this shampoo helped with the dryness and over time helped with the tangles.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it so much on my roots as I do on my ends.</li>
            <li> AND after you wash your hair, it feels very moisturizers.</li>
            <li> and they had the whole line buy</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves LOVES LOVESSSSS this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> That was because they weren&#x27;t really sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> I searched online for a real sulfate-free shampoo, and found this.</li>
            <li> This has made my hair so much softer than it was before.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really indescribable.</li>
            <li> Combined with the matching conditioner, my hair has become much healthier and shinier.</li>
            <li> This is drastically helped my hair fight humidity and really restored it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot use this without saturating my hair with coconut oil and/or using Yes To Cucumbers conditioner along with it.</li>
            <li> In relation to the shampoo, the conditioner, to me, really has no scent.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t really seem to moisturize my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper at either walgreens or walmart.</li>
            <li> I really like how it helps in hair growth also.</li>
            <li> So, it really depends.  </li>
            <li> made my scalp really itchi for some reason and dryout my hair for some reason and</li>
            <li> it dint see much of getting my hair any longuer</li>
            <li> It leathers very well at the beginning of the purchase.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY SCENTED even though there is no fragrance listed on the ingredients!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> I reacted to this product very soon after I began to use it.  </li>
            <li> it looks really greasy.</li>
            <li> I tried everything: Diva, BedHead, B&amp;B, Loreal Sulfate Free, Goldwell, white vinegar, egg yolk, mayonnaise; I tried not blow drying it and blow drying it with an ion dryer</li>
            <li> It was delivered in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Like the product&#x27;s quality and results, but not the scent too much.</li>
            <li> After that my hair seemed to adjust to it really well.  </li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel like it had a wax coating on it and made it look very oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to do much to it</li>
            <li> My hair is very noticably shorter and thinner thanks to this horrid shampoo.</li>
            <li> It was bothersome, but the shampoo and conditioner worked really well for my hair</li>
            <li> (Carol&#x27;s daughter seems to work VERY well on my hair).</li>
            <li> smell is absolutely horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> at all really, it just needs to be smeared around the head, I guess.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d noticed a different shea moisutre product that didn&#x27;t lather as well but nonetheless left my hair smelling nice and well-hydrated.  8/10.  </li>
            <li> It does smell nice - I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on that, but it left my thick, curly hair feeling even more bulky.</li>
            <li> The Shea Shampoo did not strip my hair of natural oils, which only made my hair feel even better once I applied the conditoner.</li>
            <li> Second time I used it my hair felt even more soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a grand total of once so far, but I can already tell that this product will not strip my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks, and it doesnt smell so good either.</li>
            <li> Low foaming but highly effective without stripping your hair of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Ok, I am truly a cheap person when it comes to buying products, I don&#x27;t believe in spending money on something that goes down the drain literally!!!</li>
            <li> This product cleans my hair but doesn&#x27;t strip the good oils and it leaves my hair soft with a slight butterscotch smell!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled by the real price of $10, not $16.50 or any other marked up price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I generally use silicone free products (looking for a new conditioner though due to a formula change in my absolute favorite conditioner,</li>
            <li> It completely stripped Redken Shades EQ toner right out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Being natural and mild, it is safe for them and less drying on their skin and coat.   </li>
            <li> I really hope it was just takes longer to rinse out cause other then that i love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t, I just don&#x27;t feel my hair is clean, despite some claims that a low lather shampoo really does do the job.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very easy to get used to and the shampoo does add a little bit of volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> However, it is a better shampoo than some of the other ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li> SELL THIS SHAMPOO AND MOST OF THE OTHER SHEA MOISTURE PRODUCTS FOR $9.99</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, clean, and shiny!</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling goopy instead of clean.</li>
            <li> it does not take much to actually cleanse your hair and it does have kind of a strange slippery feel.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, it&#x27;s company seems to value all the things I value in beauty and hygiene products, but it wasn&#x27;t really living up to my exceptions of moisture retention and it seemed to leave a filmy buildup in our hair no matter how much we rinsed or how little we used.</li>
            <li> the past, I bought pretty much every product available for this hair at Walmart and Target without success.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it was priced a little more cheaply.</li>
            <li> the problem was that I could only really afford it when it was offered at a super price on the shopping channel.  </li>
            <li> This has all natural ingredients and makes my hair super soft, cleanses it well, does not strip my hair color and even gives my hair some body.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for myself because I color my hair red regularly, and I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t strip the color out as quickly.</li>
            <li> I have dry, fine hair, and this shampoo makes it feel silky.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I was blown away by my results leaving my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> To keep it short and sweet, not everything works for everybody.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it and usually buy it at Walgreens along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use the full line of the Shea Moisture products and have noticed a big difference in the texture and growth of my hair.  </li>
            <li> With Shea Moisture after the first wash with a quarter sized amount my hair feels so soft as if I was using conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I used this shampoo my hair didn&#x27;t shed (and it was the first time ON MY NATURAL HAIR - 3 C type).  </li>
            <li> I was worried I&#x27;d run out since the bottle is kind of small</li>
            <li> my hair is VERY picky when it comes to certain natural oils, and by using trial and error</li>
            <li> This is definitely a new staple in my house!</li>
            <li> Not only do their products smell great due to the real essential oils, but they&#x27;re all organic.</li>
            <li> And wet combing with this was just like forget it; the hair got tangled too easy.</li>
            <li> I will say it does have an odd smell, but many people that comment on it don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s not a chemical smell</li>
            <li> It brushes better and knots so much less.</li>
            <li> but I found it feels that way less the more you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Once I re-washed it with another unscented brand, the static went away, but as I mentioned above, the smell seemed to last forever.  </li>
            <li> But on the second application, 3 days later when it stripped even more color from my hair</li>
            <li> cleans well and moistuizes at the same time, would definitely recommned :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked by how many good reviews this ineffective product has.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and organic for your hair which is so much more healthier without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I spent about 5 extra minutes rinsing my hair under warm water.</li>
            <li> I have blonde super frizzy color treated over processed hair.  </li>
            <li> After just one use of this shampoo, my hair was suddenly very soft, looked much healthier, and my scalp was not irritated at all.</li>
            <li> So much so that I don&#x27;t even want to use my other shampoos, though I did just buy some of this line&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner for fine hair.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really get much of a lather without using a lot more shampoo than usual.</li>
            <li> It is slowly getting better (the itch and scale), but the hair loss stopped right away.  </li>
            <li> I have type \\&quot;2C\\&quot; highly porous, frizzy hair which is now thinning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend giving them a whirl, so to speak.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> used it today after a High Intensity Interval Training Class in which I sweated a lot.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , i highly recommend you try this shampoo</li>
            <li> But, ever since trying the Shea Moisture shampoo, my hair has remained soft for weeks without me even using a moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my roots and just a little bit on my ends.</li>
            <li> and it looks a little better already.</li>
            <li> im transitioning my hair from relaxed to not relaxed and its tough to find products that make my hair look and feel good.</li>
            <li> We have thick curly hair that dries very easily at the ends and is very oily at the scalp.</li>
            <li> I am a white woman with curly-wavy hair that tends to get a major frizz halo with some breakage, and decided to try sulfate free.</li>
            <li> It left my fine, straight blonde hair with a waxy coating and made it look stringy and unwashed.</li>
            <li> had to return it due to STRONG SCENT.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there are so many positive reviews for this product, because this shampoo left my hair DRY and feeling STRIPPED; that too \\&quot;squeaky-clean\\&quot; feeling someone else alluded to.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because some of my Natural friends absolutely raved about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and my hair is always a bit dryer than normal after I wash it.</li>
            <li> a week put coconut oil in from your scalp to your ends (make sure you massage your scalp for a few minutes) then cover your hair with the shower cap for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather well, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t contain the harsh chemicals (sulfates) found in most shampoos that produce that lather.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure all the moisturizing properties would make me look like a greasy mop, but I was so pleasantly surprised to see that not only did it not make my hair greasy, I had the softest, silkiest head of hair that I&#x27;ve seen in recent years since pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> The normal store brands like Tresemme and Clariol.</li>
            <li> pretty much the ONLY shampoo that keeps the itchy flakey scalp at bay).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the extra money</li>
            <li> yet many of us do this regularly, so I did not notice the smell as it was so minor if it existed at all.</li>
            <li> Normal Routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I rarely use heat styling tools and I use Moroccan oil daily.</li>
            <li> I have 4b natural hair and bought this shampoo after hearing lots of great reviews from other natural African American users.</li>
            <li> and it was so so but easily 3 times more expensive,</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it&#x27;s truly free of any harsh cleansing agents; many products claiming to be gentle and all-natural are full of irritating, drying chemicals.</li>
            <li> I decided to search for a natural shampoo after finally coming to the conclusion that the sulfates in my cheap shampoos were causing major dryness, tangles, and breakage.</li>
            <li> After the first day and a half, my hair was super greasy.</li>
            <li> Even with other sulfate free shampoos I have always felt my hair felt somewhat stripped.  </li>
            <li> Enhancing Smoothie is a new purchase and the jury is still out on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a new conditoner and came across this product on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have never gone a day in my life without putting half a container full of conditioner on my head after shampooing!</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my often dry 4c/b hair super moist.  </li>
            <li> I like their hair masque as a leave-in conditioner and decided to try this on my super dry, flaky scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel very soft but not stripped.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair moisturized and very soft</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft with no breakage.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural shampoo and it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Bought too many products blindly and very rarely have I been amazed.  </li>
            <li> As for the smell, it&#x27;s very old lady like to me.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and my hair feels very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo to any women who are already natural or looking to go natural!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I add a little bit of peppermint oil to the mix when I shampoo and that really helps clean my scalp.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT AMAZON!</li>
            <li> (condition first  and shampoo second).</li>
            <li> Shiny, soft and not frizzy even in the humidity!</li>
            <li> moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became interested in this type of product after seeing a commercial for Wen.</li>
            <li> I read the ingredient list and was surprised to see a non-toxic product like this at CVS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know, natural and relaxed!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed for my Coarse African-American Hair.</li>
            <li> They were not small clumps, either.</li>
            <li> It is the color of mucous, so it is quite possible that&#x27;s exactly what it is.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and there was no frizz, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product (plus conditioner) at my local grocery store for $10.99 each bottle so that alone, I would bypass Amazon and head straight to the store!</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> - if you like the stripped &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling some other shampoos give you may not like this</li>
            <li> I liked that a little amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> I was happy with the shampoo as my hair did not get dried out as usual.</li>
            <li> Here is the most amazing and shocking thing since I switched to this product line I have to remind myself to clean my hairbrush now because my hair does not break off in the hairbrush when I brush it.</li>
            <li> My hair grows out quickly and sucks up all the moisture rapidly, making my hair feel dry most of the time</li>
            <li> The first time I used it and saw all the color in the rinse water, I was surprised but thought that maybe I hadn&#x27;t rinsed my hair well enough after coloring it.</li>
            <li> For the record I have medium wavy hair (asian) which is pretty soft to begin with.</li>
            <li> but... It is so strongly perfumed and dried the heck out of my hair.</li>
            <li> My natural red color seems to be a little more vibrant as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is similar to the pink SM line shampoo in the sense that it barely has any lather, and you don&#x27;t need too much to get a decent clean.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try it after reading all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most days I don&#x27;t use any styling products at all, and on the one or two times when I&#x27;ve used my flat iron it took much less time (and consequently, less heat) to make my hair look smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my hair has always been a little drier than most Asian women&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> , you only need a little, and my hair looks so much better when I use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a sulfate free shampoo that lathers really well.  </li>
            <li> it took me hours to clear that scent from my hands...</li>
            <li> Followed up with the  Shea Moisture Conditioner which definitely left my hair very soft--reminded me of the old Cream of Nature softness from years ago.</li>
            <li> 4c natural</li>
            <li> I have used this in my child hair which is natural and it leaves her hair soft.</li>
            <li> But when i used it in my hair (transitioning from relaxed to natural)</li>
            <li> It stripped the color almost completely out.</li>
            <li> I have natural type 4 hair and have been in search of a shampoo that thoroughly cleanses my hair and scalp, without stripping it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m growing out my perm, and this shampoo works for both my permed and natural hair.</li>
            <li> and I am always on the look out for natural moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> it is natural with NO SLS.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> (I have shoulder length natural hair).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils after washing with it.</li>
            <li> Another plus is that it is a shampoo that contains natural ingredients and no sulfates, etc.</li>
            <li> shampoo immediately makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li> Secondly, the moment you put this shampoo on your hair, you can feel how gentle and moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li> Once I finished washing and my hair was airdrying, I began detangling and immediately noticed how soft and easy-to-detangle my hair was.</li>
            <li> Since I have gone natural</li>
            <li> I have been transitioning from relaxed to natural hair for 3 weeks now and have used this shampoo &amp; conditioner as part of my regime.</li>
            <li> I have afro textured hair and am transitioning from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was natural without all the sulfates and chemicals that would still be moisturizing for him without stripping the oils out.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft but helps it to hold body and shine.</li>
            <li> Dries out my frequently colored hair.</li>
            <li> After I wash, my hair still feels soft and never stripped.  </li>
            <li> My hair has gotten so much healthier since I started using this shampoo and overall product line.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but think that some of the more negative reviews have been made by people who might not have given sulfate free/natural products a chance before.  </li>
            <li> i have natural hair btw</li>
            <li> (I think my hair might be protein sensitive).</li>
            <li> I had no trouble getting it to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> My hair has always been frizzy and wild.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got volume, natural curl and shine</li>
            <li> I had eventually found Carole&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Oil line, and used it about 3 months, and found it drying (even after an intense Ojon oil treatment), especially coming into the fall and winter months.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a curly girl and have been natural for about two months now.</li>
            <li> They both have natural hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have incredibly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised this one did.  </li>
            <li> I also started using this on my 3 year old son.</li>
            <li> I found this product at target and since we use all natural hair care in our house</li>
            <li> days ago and my hair has done a 180 with manageability and moisture by far.</li>
            <li> Organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> Since 1912.&lt;br /&gt;Tested on our family for four generations.&lt;br /&gt;Never on animals.&lt;br /&gt;MADE IN THE USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake well, natural ingredients tend to</li>
            <li> hair feels so soft</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the hair mask treatment because it was all organic and natural</li>
            <li> I have lent some to family and friends, and so far, every one of them has gotten hooked after one try.</li>
            <li> It leaves is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Those of you with curly hair know how frequent washing strip the hair of all</li>
            <li> I am a Latina young woman with frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li> i have 4b/4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> My 21yr old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> My 23yr old son loves it (he is also a beautician).</li>
            <li> It was soft and shiny with plenty of body.  </li>
            <li> Yes I do admit that it does leave your hair (to some degree) &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;, but it so without compromising of it of its natural elasticity and moisture.</li>
            <li> For some, sulfate / residue free products are too harsh and my not provide them with the softness and shine they need.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I understand it&#x27;s a natural product -</li>
            <li> It caused my skin to break out like a 13 year old girl&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from CVS for $9.99, which is far cheaper.</li>
            <li> Feels soft even before using conditioner.</li>
            <li> Matter a fact, I use the whole line of Shea Moisture: shampoo, condition, deep treatment, and oil!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After some research, I discovered a few shampoos that are basically all natural, mostly organic, low or no sudsing.</li>
            <li> hair is soft, shiny, and manageable...</li>
            <li> Since I went natural I decided to try it AGAIN</li>
            <li> so  I knew that this was a natural product</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for natural hair.</li>
            <li> , I found the same shampoo at Walgreens for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I reverted to my natural hair about three years ago.  </li>
            <li> Having had my hair chemically treated for over 20 years there was a learning curve on how to work with my natural hair texture.  </li>
            <li> I have 2A type natural hair</li>
            <li> It has completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft and maneageable.</li>
            <li> My favorite affordable shampoo/conditioner so far: Herbal Essence Hydration (the blue bottle), Kiss My Face (green bottles), and now Shea Moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my CVS coupon (20% off) and bought Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner for $8 each.</li>
            <li> After doing this consistently over 45 days, my hair is so much easier to manage and looks way nicer with much less effort by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most reviews are positive, but I guess some people just aren&#x27;t fit for it.  :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the no lather effect, it doesn&#x27;t mean you have to use more.</li>
            <li> I have bounced around with shampoos and conditioners since I stopped giving my hair relaxer treatments, during the summers and some of spring going natural and getting flat ironed straightening very now and then the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> and I realized that my hair was muuuch thinner and less full.</li>
            <li> because with how the hair is dried at an angle, the hair looks straight before flat ironing, I use the flat iron more to style not to straighten.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really leaves my hair greasy and flat.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and after my first use I was shocked by how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li> I have 3b, fine, caucasian curly hair with frizz, porosity, and damage from past bleaching and straightening endeavors.  </li>
            <li> My hair was clean and it didn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue.  </li>
            <li> and I have difficulty getting this product to lather throughout my entire head - even though I try to focus on mainly the scalp area.  </li>
            <li> I JUST WENT OUT AND PURCHASED THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT FROM WALGREENS DRUGSTORE FOR ONLY 9.99!</li>
            <li> The same exact product (12 oz/same size) is only $10 at Target, Meijer, and Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Its strong scent is a little over powering, which is just my personal taste.</li>
            <li> It did not clean my hair and left it feeling more coarse and greasy than before washing.</li>
            <li> I have super long hair and this was recommended to me on the long hair forum.</li>
            <li> Now--I rinsed and rinsed and then conditioned, but my hair still felt heavy, coated with residue and to top it all off, incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this as it&#x27;s so hard to find shampoo/conditioners truly free of harmful chemicals that actually work.  </li>
            <li> Now, because they are truly without sulfates, they barely lather at all when you wash with them - so don&#x27;t be surprised at that.</li>
            <li> At least thats more moisturizing to my hair, I only wanted to try a natural shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair over 3 times to get normal feeling back into it.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night and went to sleep with my hair wet, which I normally don&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling greasier then it normally is and almost slimy.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t particularly like it that the shampoo has, at least to me, a rather strong scent, which is why I gave it four stars.  </li>
            <li> I tried to calm it down with some Argan Oil, but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Luckily I started with a small amount just to be on the safe side, a little goes a long way with this and all of the Shea Moisture products it seems.</li>
            <li> I knew it was this shampoo since it was the only new product I introduced to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking hmmmm ok doesn&#x27;t sound bad</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair (4b afro-american, very porous).</li>
            <li> I know that some products might not work for everyone, but if you have dry, curly hair, I would absolutely recommend you to try it.</li>
            <li> It is both cleansing and gentle, so it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I ignored this product for awhile because I once tried Shea Moisture&#x27;s Coconut and Hibiscus line, and it did absolutely nothing for my hair besides leaving it dry.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to my third or fourth time using it</li>
            <li> My hair is moisturized and behaves really well in spite of myself and wrong doings. :-)</li>
            <li> My hair feels sticky and dirty after a fresh wash even when I don&#x27;t put conditioner at the root and make sure to rinse.</li>
            <li> I can use this alone and my thick drenched in moister and easy to work through.</li>
            <li> The scent was always a little strong and perfumey but it never stayed in your hair long after rinsing.</li>
            <li> Shea moisture leaves my white girl 3B hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo alone left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> It appealed to me originally because of the small amount of ingredients.</li>
            <li> Today my hair is very shiny, silky, and much less frizzy than I normally get.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine straight as an arrow hair, and it did not leave an oil slick like some other reviewers report.</li>
            <li> Normal texture is very course with a tight curl (Andre Scale 4B).</li>
            <li> But the last bottle I purchased, the beginning of June, felt different when I was putting it on my hair, thinner, less rich and creamy somehow</li>
            <li> So im shocked but happy</li>
            <li> And it has all natural ingredients which is a definite plus with me.  </li>
            <li> my mixed afro textured hair completely.</li>
            <li> I spent so much money on products that did not stand by what it was required to do.</li>
            <li> Ever since I went natural in 2009, I have been struggling to find products that my hair agrees with, especially shampoos.</li>
            <li> In fact, my hair was left feeling so soft that I assumed this was because I had not washed all of the product out of my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend this shampoo to naturals who have tried co-washing but would like to use an all natural shampoo instead.shampoo instead.</li>
            <li> I actually still had my old bottle and I compared ingredients</li>
            <li> I do not wet wrap or roller set my hair</li>
            <li> needed!!&lt;br /&gt;Its has a wow factor definitely!</li>
            <li> Once I went back to my old products my scalp started to recover.  </li>
            <li> It even seems to accentuate his natural blonde highlights.  </li>
            <li> Shea Moisture&#x27;s Moisture Retention Shampoo does the complete opposite by restoring the moisture into my strands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar to Aveda&#x27;s shampure shampoo and then the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to stick it out and finish off the bottle because it was more expensive than what I normally pay for shampoo, but I just don&#x27;t think I can.</li>
            <li> so it makes my whole head of hair pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I straightened my hair after showering with this and got crazy good results.</li>
            <li> I also used the Carols Daughter line, which was ok, but not great.</li>
            <li> (starting with the crown first and working towards the middle and through the ends) on high initially until the hair gets moderately dry, then I turn it to low as to not overdry the hair.</li>
            <li> And strange as it may sound, I even use their African Black Soap cleansing shampoo on my dogs who have itchy skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten my hair permed recently and needed a new shampoo/conditioner that didn&#x27;t cause any further damage in my hair.</li>
            <li> My entire life my hair has been very frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> I did some research and found out that raw shampoo is different from the regular stuff (even the sulfate free formulas)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it will be for anyone else, but you won&#x27;t need to be spending extra money on conditioner, so this price is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> In overall the shampoo makes the wash little of a struggle free as it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair when it lather.</li>
            <li> i really recommend this product to any with dry to brittle hair!!!</li>
            <li> No stripping chemicals such as sulfates which give lots of suds but can potentially strip hair of vital oils.</li>
            <li> I still have some conditioner left, and I&#x27;ll use that up, but I&#x27;ll have to find a different natural shampoo, and that is a shame, and and a pain.</li>
            <li> decided to go the &amp;#34;low-poo&amp;#34; route---sort of as an in between step before going back to my old simply sulfate-free ways.</li>
            <li> It has no sulfates in it and it does not dry my hair or strip the color out of it.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about using this shampoo because of the mixed reviews i found online (not just on amazon).</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel dry and it felt very soft.</li>
            <li> I rate it 5 stars due to it being cruelty free and all natural and being a small family owned business.</li>
            <li> My hair is desert dry and super thick, I never use shampoo normally</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s shampoo for really dry hair, if you have a normal hair this product likely make it oily</li>
            <li> /&gt;SM is generally a hit or miss for me, and this was a definite miss.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with many of the other negative reviewers, this shampoo may not be for you.</li>
            <li> It has completely eliminated my frizz, made my hair extremely moisturized and soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is trying to get the rich, thick lotion out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51, have thick, fine, fairly long hair,</li>
            <li> It smells beautifully, but it&#x27;s the absolute worst shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> strips your hair can make it dry or even unclean looking because it&#x27;s taking away all its natural chemicals.</li>
            <li> I change the color all the time and my hair is naturally a bit dry and damaged feeling</li>
            <li> In reality, if your hair is dry, brittle or you just prefer an all natural approach, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not all Target department stores carry the Shea Moisture line - at least, the one near where I reside doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price.</li>
            <li> I have disliked my hair pretty much my entire life.</li>
            <li> I will see how the product works on my 8 year old&#x27;s super thick hair, but I will be on the hunt for another shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel very thick, healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out or get itchy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and all other Shea Moisture products normally retail for $9.99, which is the manufacturer&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> It is pretty heavy stuff though and the perfumed scent will last you until the second coming of Moses.</li>
            <li> recommendation for having perfectly soft, LONG, and amazing hair (if you have similar hair to me) is buying extra-virgin cold pressed coconut oil, this shampoo, this hair masque, biotin 5,000 mcg, shower caps, and &amp;#34;its a 10&amp;#34; leave in spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more frizz, tons of shine, no oily roots at the end of the day and my hair color doesn&#x27;t fade the way it does even with other sulfate free shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I recently made the big chop, going natural and my hair is usually really dry with a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a\b\c hair that is very dry.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned because it didn&#x27;t lather much in the shower</li>
            <li> This could be bad or good, depending on whether you toned your hair correctly or not</li>
            <li> My hair, which used to be dry and unhealthy looking, is now soft and full of shine.</li>
            <li> This instantly zapped moisture back into my straw-like, flat winter hair.</li>
            <li> If you read the ingredients of other shampoos, you&#x27;ll find they virtually ALL have some kind of sulfate in them, even expensive stuff like Wen.</li>
            <li> Other people hair that i know is natural</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair feel worse than it originally is.</li>
            <li> I am full Hungarian with very thick, coarse and wavy hair and nothing has worked for me like this.</li>
            <li> The raw Shea butter restorative line works really well on my hair.</li>
            <li> When it comes to a gentle alternative to standard shampoos, I have trouble finding a product that beats this one!  </li>
            <li> When I saw the natural ingredient list I was in love, and shocked that such an organic product could be this affordable.</li>
            <li> and my hair just looked flat and</li>
            <li> Then I will flat iron using a ceramic iron to liking.</li>
            <li> Use it several times before I stopped using for travel for long time overseas (6-7 months of not using the product).</li>
            <li> and I must admit it did leave my hair flat</li>
            <li> My hair is long so dryness is always a problem and these masks work well even if you only leave them on for 5 minutes in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got body and it&#x27;s pretty thick.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to balance the oils on your scalp and transition from traditional shampoos to natural.  </li>
            <li> helped to make my hair soft and less tangled.</li>
            <li> I used to suffer from dry, frizzy hair until I found this product and its coinciding conditioner at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> Before my hair was dry and  I always keeps it short.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo at Kroger about a month and a half ago and it COMPLETELY changed the way I style my hair.</li>
            <li> After co-washing my hair (with many different conditioners) my hair was still dirty and did nothing for retaining moisture into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I only blow dry.</li>
            <li> This leave-in or rinse out conditioner deeply moisturizes, detangles and repairs dry, damaged or over-processed hair.</li>
            <li> in mind it won&#x27;t lather like typical hair shampoos since it is natural and sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to those who have trouble with humidity, dry, or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> The next day I kept scratching and it was annoying to the point I decided to clean a second time with my old faithful natural soap bar.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to use it on my very long, straight, caucasian hair which tends to get very oily in the scalp.  </li>
            <li> The only other shampoo I use is Shea Moisture Deep Cleansing Shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt do the same but leave it greasy and looking unclean or some days very dry.</li>
            <li> However, I would recommend this shampoo and contitioner only if you have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> (I have 3a long curly hair, very dry and coarse)</li>
            <li> Bought mine at WalGreens, 9.99 and it works wonderfully on my fine, thin, limp, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Once the hair is dry, you can feel the difference in how the hair sits on the head, it is very flat, not frizzed out.</li>
            <li> I have been getting very allergic lately with burns on my forehead from almost all shampoos with chemicals and sulfates.</li>
            <li> Not wild about the smell</li>
            <li> I have dealt with hair troubles for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Since those specials are incredibly few and far between anymore, and it is not offered anywhere nearby</li>
            <li> This is non-toxic and lasts a long time even with my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped to maybe hear some reviews from others that might of had the strange smell issue as well.</li>
            <li> For my hair type, I have always been told to use the minimal amount of shampoo I possibly could.</li>
            <li> and I have long 1C hair</li>
            <li> I have course and long dreadlocks</li>
            <li> This is strange given that there are no parfums in it.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is so thick I am used to having to overflow my hand with products in order to cover my whole head, not the case with this.</li>
            <li> A little bit went a long way, even with my hair being thick as it is, after first use, couldn&#x27;t even tell I used it!</li>
            <li> And all the organic, natural stuff out there usually makes my hair fall flat.</li>
            <li> A little about my hair before I leave a review (because everyone&#x27;s hair will react differently): I&#x27;m not African-American, I&#x27;m Middle Eastern.</li>
            <li> It was definitely not what I expected would happen!</li>
            <li> with that other 16 you have left you can buy the restorative conditioner to go with it.</li>
            <li> Since starting this product only a little over a month ago, I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I do alternate it every other time with a shampoo that cleans a bit deeper, as it causes buildup if I use it exclusively.</li>
            <li> and I have used several products in the past, both sulfate and sulfate/ residue free and the outcomes were never great-either the product worked well but was cost prohibited (carol&#x27;s daughter) and / made it worse (Wen shampoo).</li>
            <li> I read some other reviews that made reference to their hair being left too &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other people I depend on countless reviews before I even think about buying a product online!</li>
            <li> My hair is dry from straightening procedures, and all other shampoos, even those claiming to be \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot;, left it feeling stripped when I used them.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that they don&#x27;t have ingredients such as parabens, etc. &amp; try to provide natural ingredients, but the shampoo does make your hair hard like it does have some form of sulfates in it.</li>
            <li> day I googled &#x27;all natural shampoos&#x27; and came across Shea Moisture&#x27;s Raw Shea Retention shampoo.</li>
            <li> Even just wetting and co-washing wasn&#x27;t having the desired effect; my hair was frizzy with no defined curls and felt dry and crispy, despite the fact that I stopped brushing it and was strictly air-drying.</li>
            <li> so I blow dry it every day.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry.  </li>
            <li> I couldnt believe how dry it was and no moisturizer in the world could help.</li>
            <li> MIGHT BE ALITTLE DRY</li>
            <li> Not even protein treatments leave my hair feeling as dry as this shampoo did.</li>
            <li> , then I blow dry my hair using a roll brush blow dryer (limits the amount of heat that comes out) at an angle</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, the bleach out, nor dry it out.</li>
            <li> my hair was sooo dry and brittle</li>
            <li> Then I tried Shea Moisture Shampoo for Dry and Damaged Hair.</li>
            <li> It works wonders for my once dry brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> I found this when I started using the Shea moisture line of lotion for my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a solution with Shea butter in it for a severe dry scalp issue I had.  </li>
            <li> The dry feeling continued and my hair started to break off in mass amounts.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp and a tendency to itch.</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel dry after use.</li>
            <li> Having said that, after dying my hair for years at least once a month and perming my hair almost a year ago, my hair is completely fried and breaks constantly.</li>
            <li> No flat hair or weighed down hair, no goo.</li>
            <li> My hair usually feels dry after shampooing, but this shampoo leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li> I have long, red wavy hair that turns into a frizz ball as soon as any slight amount of humidity touches it.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and live in a  hard water area.  </li>
            <li> There is a class action suite against that started this July although I am not sure if the court proceedings have started.</li>
            <li> After a small number of uses, once I used about 25% of the bottle, the smell completely changed.</li>
            <li> but it just weighed my hair down and left it coated and greasy.</li>
            <li> and I finally broke down and decided to do some research.</li>
            <li> I used a very small amount after noticing that Coconut oil was one of the main ingredients and coconut oil has always been a booger for me to rinse out of my hair.</li>
            <li> It left my hair in a dry knotted country mess.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair and my daughters hair felt so dry!</li>
            <li> I noticed for me that a dime size amount is enough for half of my head.  </li>
            <li> I have used numerous hair products for Black women and nothing has come this close.</li>
            <li> By age 19, the widowed mother of four was selling Shea Butter, African Black Soap and her homemade hair and skin preparations all over the countryside.</li>
            <li> For the past few months I have been an absolute product junkie; trying anything and everything that I could for my hair.</li>
            <li> In cold weather down in the single digits, I was tired of fly away frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> LOL!I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo that you can think of with an attempt to moisturize my very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have 4B/4C hair and it gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s just cause I have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> but not least, the ONLY reason I am not giving this a five star is because of the ridiculous price!</li>
            <li> , this shampoo does not make my hair shed as much as other natural shampoos have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Little did I know I have low porosity hair</li>
            <li> I do not flat iron heavily</li>
            <li> I also will run a little 100% organic argan oil through my hair about mid week to keep any frizz from forming.</li>
            <li> This left my hair a dry, tangled, brillo pad MESS!</li>
            <li> I have Asian hair, but naturally a little wavy and not very greasy...</li>
            <li> I do still use a cream rinse and conditioner more out of habit and my &#x27;bad habits with hair&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Bad experience, more than once.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To give it the benefit of the doubt, making sure it wasn&#x27;t just a bad hair day</li>
            <li> Read the labels because they have at least 4 different lines, for different hair types/issues.</li>
            <li> However,  the bottle had a green tint to it and looked different from how the shampoo looks when I buy it at target .</li>
            <li> last few years I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair with Keratin.</li>
            <li> I felt were drying my hair out even when it was wet</li>
            <li> Just after a few uses my hair was definitely shinier and smoother.</li>
            <li> We tried buying it from another store completely and sure enough it smelled awful.</li>
            <li> I never really understood why nor listened but this time I did</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> If you go to Shea Moisture website, they also charge $10 for their products (minus the shipping and handling).</li>
            <li> From the moment I put it on my wet hair</li>
            <li> My hair has always been dry and fizzy, and as I got older, it seemed to get worse.</li>
            <li> This was possibly one of the worst shampoo&#x27;s i&#x27;ve used ever and nothing like the other sulphate free shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used like loreal evercream, aveeno pure renewal, redken etc.</li>
            <li> I will go back to my regular co wash and try to find something else in the mean time.</li>
            <li> Even when I ran my fingers through my hair my hands were left feeling waxy and my hair was just a tangled mess!</li>
            <li> and she recommended I use a dime size amount next time and try rinsing the shampoo out using hot water then rinsing with cold water after conditioning.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> a little of this product goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have very thick dry natural 3c/4a/4b hair</li>
            <li> My hair was no longer a dry, tangled, breaking, unmanageable mess after washing.  </li>
            <li> which is a feat when you have thick coarse long hair like mine!</li>
            <li> One day we bought a bottle that smelled like someone had crushed garlic and some other terrible potent smell into it, we exchanged it and the second bottle was the same.</li>
            <li> but more disappointed that my hair is stripped.</li>
            <li> So I applied another dime sized amount for the other side.  </li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped after I rinse it out unlike with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Hear me rave about this and some other shea moisture products i purchased on my youtube beauty channel search me on youtube @diamondrosaaye&lt;</li>
            <li> Since I started using this about 6 months ago, I havent let any other shampoo touch my hair.  </li>
            <li> other times it&#x27;s a wavy/curly mix.</li>
            <li> The aloe and rosemary help with dandruff and itching, so any comments on itch being caused by this from other raters is probably just an allergy to something in it.</li>
            <li> and I have tried other &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; methods for hair cleansing before</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather like other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My daughters both use shampoos and conditioners in the company&#x27;s other hair lines and they like them.  </li>
            <li> This makes buying this shampoo extremely affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was only $9 at walgreens and usually they have a BOGO sale or B2G1</li>
            <li> I have not found any other product that comes close.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and leave-conditioner due to the \\&quot;positive\\&quot; reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li> for the past 1 year my hair has being shedding excessively that i developed bald spots!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair oily due to the coconut oil in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other&#x27;s complain about the smell, but all I know is my boyfriend loves the way it smells.</li>
            <li> For some products that may contain sulfates and other chemicals may work.</li>
            <li> I used other shampoos and when I did my hair would shed a lot.  </li>
            <li> (take my chances) because every other shampoo I used that claim to have Shea butter shed my hair.</li>
            <li> but it was shedding from other shampoos that claim they have Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extreme frizz due to the humidity in my city.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, and I like the scent, plus a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> and I have to be very careful.  </li>
            <li> For starters, I have Caucasian, dark brown curly/wavy hair that is past bra strap length (in the back).</li>
            <li> In a few washes this has not only made my crispy ends disappear from my 4a/4b-ish type hair, I no longer have any problems with dry scalp or any spots of flaking (which always confused me considering I was only using conditioner and wasn&#x27;t heat drying).</li>
            <li> After I dried my hair with a t-shirt and let it air dry for a while, my hair felt even softer!</li>
            <li> one advice when using this shampoo is a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> So, my next go &#x27;round I picked up the Raw Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner..</li>
            <li> Less shampoo needed than other shampooes.</li>
            <li> Actually, my clarifying shampoos don&#x27;t make my hair hard like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have 4c hair, and my coils are very tight and dry.</li>
            <li> my leave-ins, gels and conditioners are all homemade, so all I need is a delicate cleanser (decyl glucoside) which is the 2nd ingredient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take to repair the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just average.</li>
            <li> only negative feedback i have about the product on amazon is the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> but it gets brittle and thin near the ends.  </li>
            <li> While this made the ends of my hair soft, shiny, and not frizz up at all, my scalp was in worse shape than before.  </li>
            <li> In a shampoo i was worried it would weigh my hair down or be sticky.</li>
            <li> The combination of this shampoo and matching conditioner leave it  moisturized and nourished but not weighed down all the way root to tip.  </li>
            <li> And from what I understand, neither the shampoo or conditioner contains silicone, which can weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> And from what I understand, neither the shampoo or conditioner contains silicone, which can weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I once ran out of conditioner (impossible to believe but true) and used this alone its all i needed..</li>
            <li> My hair usually gets extremely dry when I shampoo but</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend this product, way to expensive for little pay off</li>
            <li> She has much less tangles.</li>
            <li> And paired with the conditioner, my curls have picked up quite a bit, and it&#x27;s much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair does not smell odd today.</li>
            <li> I have black, relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed significantly less breakage when combing my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> , so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s conditioning properties, but it did not strip my previously conditioned hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Thai</li>
            <li> and I so surprised that for some, this product was a big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had less breakage, but my hairdresser has instructed me to cycle between this brand and another brand that will moisturize the hair.  </li>
            <li> FINALLY a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> I use to pile on tons of hair lotions and moisturizers hoping to get my hair how I wanted and would just end up with a greasy mess on my head.</li>
            <li> I used it again today and rinsed my hair longer then normal &amp; that weird texture didnt happen.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s anything negative about the shampoo its that its too moisturizing for some not so dry hair types.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the shampoo or conditioner, but it left my hair with the worst static electricity after blow drying.</li>
            <li> Its a little pricey for the price</li>
            <li> If you just use a little bit it will still do the job.</li>
            <li> I always have a bottle on hand; a little goes</li>
            <li> i recently went natural and i was confused as to what products to use on my hair .my hair as always been dry and lifeless due to bad products and chemical use</li>
            <li> I was later told by a friend who makes goat milk soaps that raw shea butter smells terrible when it&#x27;s not refined which is why they use strong perfumes to cover it up</li>
            <li> I stopped shampooing my hair a few months ago, realizing that it was stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to waste it but had to give up.</li>
            <li> Dried out</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not meant to be used everyday.</li>
            <li> I used to straighten my hair everyday because I didn&#x27;t know how to control my frizz, but this shampoo along with the conditioner I believe has truly changed my hairs texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried several that claimed to be sufalte-free, but they seemed to make the problem worse.</li>
            <li> However I stopped cleaning with it everyday used a clarifying shampoo and started this again</li>
            <li> For anyone buying it just know cleaning it everyday</li>
            <li> I limit the amount of harsh chemicals I allow in my products, and that is why I chose this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I steam my hair everyday for 15 mins in my gym&#x27;s steam room.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair everyday otherwise</li>
            <li> I also work out almost everyday.</li>
            <li> People around me tended to like the results as well, and I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments</li>
            <li> Also, being natural I have a difficult time managing my 4a/4b hair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not drinking enough water and have unhealthy eating habits, guess what...</li>
            <li> NOTE-Read the reviews on Wen before purchasing;  I used it only my hairand my locs started to become thin.  </li>
            <li> Also when I blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Even the dead ends of my hair look</li>
            <li> I just use it as a pre-poo, because I don&#x27;t  want to let the product go to waste under the cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what sea kelp smells like, so it could be the mixture of the two making it smell odd.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos can leave blisters on my scalp and it&#x27;s hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> If you use it like you do other shampoos, you will likely not like it because you think something is wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> I always thought that online shopping was suppose to cheaper but the fact that these sellers are raising up the price probably due to not wanting to pay for shipping or just to make an extra profit is sad.</li>
            <li> I tried every shampoo, conditioner, and styling product I could get my hands on - regardless of price - and became addicted to my flat iron -</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so stiff that i cant even put my fingers thru it</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair with individually thin strands but lots of it.  </li>
            <li> I cut my hair down to the nub and it grew at least 6 inches in a year</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $10.49 for the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Restorative Shampoo.</li>
            <li> $10.49 for the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner.</li>
            <li> The Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Extra-Moisture detangler, prices vary from store to store</li>
            <li> I like the product because it&#x27;s raw and a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> On a website that reviewed shampoos, I happened across a review of the SM Raw Shea Butter formula.  </li>
            <li> raw shea butter and the 10 in 1 formula.  </li>
            <li> I tried bakings soda, vinegars, muds, egg yolks, raw honey, coconut oil, argan oil, avocado oil...</li>
            <li> I had really dry damaged hair, and silicones were making it worse.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning and my hair tangles very little usually.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to repair this damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done just about everything to my hair; expensive salon shampoo and conditioner, the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method with baking soda and apple cider vinegar, and now finally I have found my hair savior!</li>
            <li> I usually wear it on the straighter side</li>
            <li> The bootle is already small as it is and this seller has the nerve to charge 30 bucks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer, so not sure what the results would be with one.  </li>
            <li> On a whim, I used the shampoo and conditioner myself when I ran out of my usual brand.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair about 3 times a week</li>
            <li> I usually just use acv or clay to wash, but wanted something when Im lazy or rushing.</li>
            <li> i almost cried when my hair dried after using both!</li>
            <li> I usually go on a mini beauty products shopping spree.</li>
            <li> perhaps my newfound white hairs (I&#x27;m 37) are messing up my chemistry, but needless to say, my hair sucked.</li>
            <li> no more straw.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair sooner that usual just to get the smell out.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients list seems to feature a lot of natural sounding ingredients, but the fragrance is clearly artificial.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also $10 for a really small container</li>
            <li> Sadly, I will have to use this as some sort of moisture-rich body wash because returning it is such a hassle.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair that is thin, but I have a very very thick amount of it.</li>
            <li> and I am almost certain, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was frizzy and dirty looking and for some odd reason took longer to air dry.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair is extremely dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> 14-20 dollars is NOT right and NoT fair for one piece of the set!</li>
            <li> my hair was hard and felt like straw.</li>
            <li> considering I have hard water and no filter installed in the shower head.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to get that stank out of your hair.</li>
            <li> The product hardly lathers but it still cleans.</li>
            <li> I stopped using those terrible dandruff shampoos because they made things worse and this helps a lot better.</li>
            <li> I want to try the Coconut-Hibiscus shampoo next; just was afraid too because of the silk protein in it</li>
            <li> but i have one complaint.</li>
            <li> My mom even asked me if my hair was dirty the same day I washed it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst shampoo I have ever used in my entire life.</li>
            <li> I threw out this shampoo after I forced myself using it half-through.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it leaves my hair with this sticky extremely thick texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be giving it to my sister with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly, thick, mediterranean hair.</li>
            <li> My hair had grown out a lot and got thick since I stop using a relaxer.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing, worked.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t mean the product doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It has a bit of suds to make me feel like I am cleaning my hair (even though I know suds dont mean a thing).</li>
            <li> That was hard for me to grasp because I was so accustomed to seeing small, broken hairs all over the place after washing.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive shampoos and treatments and nothing helped slow down the shedding.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount every day in the shower</li>
            <li> (seriously read labels alot of products that say &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; just means it doesn&#x27;t contain sodium laureth sulfate but contains some derivitave of it.)  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re iffy about the price ($10.99 at Sally Beauty Supply), seriously, don&#x27;t fret.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s $9.99 at Target/ Walmart/ Walgreens.</li>
            <li> For whatever the reason, this particular product dried my hair out terribly.</li>
            <li> personally did not notice the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; - cant  smell as bad as a relaxer or dye -</li>
            <li> One I&#x27;ve got in CVS had totally different quality, this one makes my hair look bad.</li>
            <li> I was extremely shocked at how tangled and  coarse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where this went wrong.</li>
            <li> I have also used the accompanying conditioner, and it&#x27;s just not successful at smoothing the hair after the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick!</li>
            <li> had very thick hair but after 2 uses was making my hair fall out in clumps in the shower.</li>
            <li> I did not need to use a lot of the shampoo, which was a surprise to me because my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> The hard plastic packaging makes it difficult to squeeze the lotion out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I tried a keratin treatment, which worked for about 3 weeks; afterwards, my hair looked worse than before.    </li>
            <li> I have thin hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Moisture Retention Shampoo for approximately three months</li>
            <li> It causes my frizz to be much worse.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is that I can&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair because it&#x27;s now so snarly.</li>
            <li> and if it goes rancid it smells even worse.</li>
            <li> the shedding was worse when i wash my hair; my hair clogged up my drain 3 times, so</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo from Walgreens for approximately $8</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair and used to wear extensions.  </li>
            <li> I have highlighted hair, but I can&#x27;t think of any other shampoo that stripped my hair so badly.</li>
            <li> It gave me dirty, greasy, tangly, frizzy, coarse, ugly hair.</li>
            <li> and you have to squeeze real hard to get even a bit of shampoo out</li>
            <li> I was not only shocked but totally angry!   </li>
            <li> A year and a half after having a baby, it turned into a horrible, bird&#x27;s nest-y mess.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because my dandruff went away but this along with the conditioner DRIED out my hair so badly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that didn&#x27;t work because the smell lasted through another washing.  </li>
            <li> I do everything wrong a person and do with hair.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product because it was expensive...</li>
            <li> I think ill stick with it but add something else to my routine and change it up a bit .</li>
            <li> I gave this stuff a whirl and immediately noticed it was incredibly difficult to rinse out.</li>
            <li> It felt like there was some sort of coating over my hair that made it difficult to pull a comb through.</li>
            <li> The supermarket shampoo and conditioners that I use to buy because they were \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; would leave my hair dry and really painful to comb through and thats one thing I hated.</li>
            <li> Left a nasty residue over time, that made my hair dull and dirty looking and especially dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> out with COLD water</li>
            <li> My scalp itches like crazy after using this shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> it was dangerous.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go to crazy with the amount to cover everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re like me and were intrigued by reviews about the no-poo method, tried that method, and realized you were horribly wrong, get this shampoo and hair masque!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try this for a while but was skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money!</li>
            <li> but boy was i wrong!</li>
            <li> but I was wrong!</li>
            <li> , (ingredients that are bad for the hair).</li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad review but buy this at target (about $10) and it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a problem, no one has told me that my hair smells bad.</li>
            <li> A product should not get bad reviews because of a Seller on Amazon or for Amazon, as this is an injustice to the brand.</li>
            <li> It tangled my hair so badly that I literally had to pull out clumps of my hair to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> My husband said it smelled like really bad onions.</li>
            <li> So bad that I had to give it away.</li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so shocked and horrified and wish I never bought this.</li>
            <li> I ended up feeling sick with a headache.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely disappointed to be out</li>
            <li> This product, along with the hair mask and conditioner &#x3D; TERRIBLE, USELESS, INEFFECTIVE.    </li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> and I HATE the smell.</li>
            <li> I am cleaning it with no synthetic crap.</li>
            <li> but im very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> They are DANGEROUS!!</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is disgusting too.</li>
            <li> smell is not that awful to me, you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It also had a terrible smell like after you get a perm done.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible stuff</li>
            <li> It is horrible.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> Oily, acne prone skin and shea butter seem to be a terrible combination.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Kidding aside, this stuff is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product works well. However,  the bottle had a green tint to it and looked different from how the shampoo looks when I buy it at target .</li>
            <li> my to-go shampoo........4c natural</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and I have difficulty getting this product to lather throughout my entire head - even though I try to focus on mainly the scalp area.  I also dislike the &amp;#34;mud-like&amp;#34; smell of this product.  After I wash, my hair feels like there&#x27;s a film on it and my hair tangles significantly, I have to use conditioners to soften, de-tangle and prevent further tangling after washing and drying.</li>
            <li> They make the best products for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this as it&#x27;s so hard to find shampoo/conditioners truly free of harmful chemicals that actually work.  It did work in that it lathered well and seemed to get my hair clean, however, the scent was SO STRONG I could not handle it. I have a chemical sensitivity and this bottle says it&#x27;s free of synthetic fragrance so I thought I&#x27;d be okay, but it bothered me enough to have to re-shampoo my hair again with another unscented brand I use to get the smell out.  Unfortunately, that didn&#x27;t work because the smell lasted through another washing.  I ended up feeling sick with a headache.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the shampoo or conditioner, but it left my hair with the worst static electricity after blow drying. My hair was sticking out, up and to my face.  Once I re-washed it with another unscented brand, the static went away, but as I mentioned above, the smell seemed to last forever.  If this company ever comes out with a truly fragrant free product, I may try again if I can figure out the static issue.</li>
            <li> I have used this in my child hair which is natural and it leaves her hair soft. Other people hair that i know is natural it works the same. But when i used it in my hair (transitioning from relaxed to natural) my hair was hard and felt like straw. Why??? It did soften up once i put the conditioner in it. I guess its geared more toward totally natural hair. Fyi....idont like the smell. Will continue to use it in child hair. She has much less tangles.</li>
            <li> I have type \\&quot;2C\\&quot; highly porous, frizzy hair which is now thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last few years I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair with Keratin. This year I decided to go \\&quot;natural\\&quot; - and I couldn&#x27;t get used to styling it again. I&#x27;ve researched a lot of products and I&#x27;m happy to share what I&#x27;ve learned. One thing I discovered is this shampoo! I bought it at Walgreens ($9.99).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S ALL GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the fact that&#x27;s the ingredients are ALL natural. I decided to try it because the ingredients are so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LADIES - as soon as I shampooed with this - I SWEAR my hair felt thicker. RIGHT THERE IN THE SHOWER AFTER RINSING! In addition - although there are no sulfates it lathered up beautifully! Most people rave about the scent - but I thought nothing special - AND THEN I went out and got several compliments on how good my hair smelled LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the conditioner and hair milk I AM IN LOVE with this. My hair spirals like it hasn&#x27;t done in years! Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the &#x27;poo or conditioner, but I&#x27;m not changin&#x27; a thing LOL.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and God bless :)</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry curly hair and this dies a great job on her hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product strictly based on 2 things: 1) it&#x27;s a \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; cleansing agent and 2) I read a description saying that it would not strip color from hair and was actually good for colored hair.  Lies.  I used this twice after coloring my hair. It stripped the color almost completely out. The first time I used it and saw all the color in the rinse water, I was surprised but thought that maybe I hadn&#x27;t rinsed my hair well enough after coloring it. But on the second application, 3 days later when it stripped even more color from my hair I was not only shocked but totally angry!   I&#x27;m completely disappointed to be out 10 bucks but more disappointed that my hair is stripped. I could have been okay with that if it had moisturized my hair at all but it didn&#x27;t even do that! And on top of all that.... it REEKS!   I will not be using the rest of this SHAMpoo. I will go back to my regular co wash and try to find something else in the mean time.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo I have ever used in my 23 years of having hair. LOL!I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo that you can think of with an attempt to moisturize my very dry hair. All of them seemed to have stripped my hair of even more moisture. I went on with a loss hope of having \\&quot;nice\\&quot; hair and ended up just thinking I had \\&quot;bad\\&quot; hair. But, ever since trying the Shea Moisture shampoo, my hair has remained soft for weeks without me even using a moisturizer!! I use to pile on tons of hair lotions and moisturizers hoping to get my hair how I wanted and would just end up with a greasy mess on my head. This product line is definitely a keeper and will remain in my hair regimen for life!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. So much so that I don&#x27;t even want to use my other shampoos, though I did just buy some of this line&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner for fine hair. I am a white woman with curly-wavy hair that tends to get a major frizz halo with some breakage, and decided to try sulfate free. I managed to get this for $8 at Walgreens with a $2 off coupon. It makes my hair feel more moist and nourished and much healthier. Shampooing, it feels like a squishy, gel-like cleanser as opposed to all the drying lather a sulfate cleanser generates. And paired with the conditioner, my curls have picked up quite a bit, and it&#x27;s much less frizzy. The scent is nice, too, mildly floral, and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I just recently starting using this shampoo and I love it! I stopped shampooing my hair a few months ago, realizing that it was stripping my hair. Even just wetting and co-washing wasn&#x27;t having the desired effect; my hair was frizzy with no defined curls and felt dry and crispy, despite the fact that I stopped brushing it and was strictly air-drying. In a few washes this has not only made my crispy ends disappear from my 4a/4b-ish type hair, I no longer have any problems with dry scalp or any spots of flaking (which always confused me considering I was only using conditioner and wasn&#x27;t heat drying). I bypassed the regular Shea Moisture conditioner and picked up the Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Mask instead. A little goes a long way and it does wonders for me. Although, I find that I can \\&quot;seal\\&quot; in the moisture using my Garnier Sleek and Shine conditioner (which is great, &#x27;cause I need to use it up!).&lt;br /&gt;The Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie is a new purchase and the jury is still out on it. Otherwise, I&#x27;m loving this product line!</li>
            <li> I have natural type 4 hair and have been in search of a shampoo that thoroughly cleanses my hair and scalp, without stripping it. This shampoo is good, BUT it still strips my hair. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times now and my hair is always a bit dryer than normal after I wash it. I think it could be more moisturizing. However, it is a better shampoo than some of the other ones that I have tried. It lathers well, and I like the scent, plus a little goes a very long way. Still in search of a better shampoo though.</li>
            <li> Until I had a baby, my hair was beautiful - like Jennifer Aniston hair beautiful: thick, naturally straight, and it withstood regular highlighting quite well, even though it was extremely fine. A year and a half after having a baby, it turned into a horrible, bird&#x27;s nest-y mess. My hair went from 100% straight to 95% corkscrew-curly and 5% straight, with all the straight hair in the front. The top layer of my hair looked incredibly dry and damaged. I tried every shampoo, conditioner, and styling product I could get my hands on - regardless of price - and became addicted to my flat iron - which I&#x27;m sure just damaged my hair more. I tried a keratin treatment, which worked for about 3 weeks; afterwards, my hair looked worse than before.    Just over a month ago, I tried this shampoo and the Raw Shea Restorative Conditioner because I couldn&#x27;t think of a good reason not to. It was cheap - about $8.50 (the conditioner is the same price), I liked the list of ingredients (esp. shea butter and argan oil), and the reviews were extremely positive.    After using it for a month, I notice my hair looks significantly healthier. It&#x27;s shiny and 95% smoother. Most days I don&#x27;t use any styling products at all, and on the one or two times when I&#x27;ve used my flat iron it took much less time (and consequently, less heat) to make my hair look smooth. I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer, but I wasn&#x27;t using a hair dryer before, either. I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s the shampoo or the conditioner that&#x27;s made such  difference - perhaps it&#x27;s the combination. But I plan to keep using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different shampoos from many different product lines over the years, and this shampoo is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  It is a non-sulfate shampoo, yet cleanses the hair and scalp in such a way leaving both feeling moisturized.  I get a good lather with this shampoo, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair and dry out my scalp.  Both my hair and scalp feel well-nourished after I use this product.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t particularly like it that the shampoo has, at least to me, a rather strong scent, which is why I gave it four stars.  But, it doesn&#x27;t make the product unbearable for me.  Unfortunately, not all Target department stores carry the Shea Moisture line - at least, the one near where I reside doesn&#x27;t.  I would much prefer purchasing this product on-the-ground, but I am glad that I can purchase it through amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this shampoo from Amazon.com, but I will not be accepting the package. Beware!!! It states that shipping will be five dollars and some change but they&#x27;re charging twenty dollars instead. I will not be ordering from Target again.</li>
            <li> I literally never write reviews on products but I feel like I need to warn anybody who is considering purchasing this. When I saw the natural ingredient list I was in love, and shocked that such an organic product could be this affordable. I loved the smell and after my first use I was shocked by how soft my hair felt. Fast forward to my third or fourth time using it and I realized that my hair was muuuch thinner and less full. It&#x27;s to the point that my scalp is now somewhat visible when I tie my hair back. I&#x27;m so shocked and horrified and wish I never bought this. Not sure how to repair this damage. I hope this experience only happens to me but I just wanted to share this as a warning.</li>
            <li> i love this shampoo!! it makes my hair feel very soft but not stripped. this product works so much better then the Mizani moisturefusion shampoo i brought last month...smh i wished i would have just saved m money and got this instead. the smell is nice.     i&#x27;m growing out my perm, and this shampoo works for both my permed and natural hair. this will be a staple for me.</li>
            <li> I have very thick dry natural 3c/4a/4b hair and I am always on the look out for natural moisturizing products. My search is over! This is undoubtedly the BEST shampoo I have ever used in my life. Since my hair is so thick I am used to having to overflow my hand with products in order to cover my whole head, not the case with this. Luckily I started with a small amount just to be on the safe side, a little goes a long way with this and all of the Shea Moisture products it seems. As soon as I applied the shampoo, IMMEDIATELY my hair felt super soft, not exaggerating at all. I have never had my hair and scalp feel so clean and so soft just from shampoo! And it has all natural ingredients which is a definite plus with me.  This is definitely a new staple in my house! ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several products from the Shea Moisture line and love them all. My hair is dry from straightening procedures, and all other shampoos, even those claiming to be \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot;, left it feeling stripped when I used them. Not Shea Moisture. The difference was amazing. I use it with both the Restorative and Volumizing conditioners (I switch off), and follow with an argan oil leave-in.   Not only do their products smell great due to the real essential oils, but they&#x27;re all organic. And at $10 each, a much better value than high-end salon brands. Now, because they are truly without sulfates, they barely lather at all when you wash with them - so don&#x27;t be surprised at that. If you read the ingredients of other shampoos, you&#x27;ll find they virtually ALL have some kind of sulfate in them, even expensive stuff like Wen. A clue: if it lathers profusely, it has sulfates! No matter what they tell you.  I&#x27;ve also used the Shea Anti-Breakage Masque a couple times and like it. And strange as it may sound, I even use their African Black Soap cleansing shampoo on my dogs who have itchy skin. Being natural and mild, it is safe for them and less drying on their skin and coat.   Like others on here, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products. I really haven&#x27;t found anything close to Shea Moisture at this price point. Highly recommend giving them a whirl, so to speak. Read the labels because they have at least 4 different lines, for different hair types/issues.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the ingredients are natural and sound like they would be good for my moisture-starved, straight hair and for my husband&#x27;s curly hair. It lathered up well and smelled nice, but after I rinsed it out, it left so much oil in my hair that I had to wash it out with my old shampoo. I bought the conditioner too, but didn&#x27;t bother to try it at all. Although I managed to wash out the oil, my hair did have a lingering smell from the shampoo, which was actually quite pleasant. I ended up returning both the shampoo and conditioner because my husband didn&#x27;t want to use it after hearing about my experience.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great with it&#x27;s counterpart conditioner! Leaves hair feeling healthy, soft, shiny, and manageable which is a feat when you have thick coarse long hair like mine! Definitely recommend this with the conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a\b\c hair that is very dry.  Granted my hair is a bit porous so that could be the problem.  I tried doing the conditioner washes but honestly doing that leaves my scalp loaded with buildup.  So I picked this up at Target and looked at the ingredients and it looked good to me.      I poured out a dime sized amount and emulsified it in my hand and applied it to my scalp.  I noticed for me that a dime size amount is enough for half of my head.  So I applied another dime sized amount for the other side.  It does have the distinct smell that can be overpowering at times but I pressed on.  It rinsed pretty well considering I have hard water and no filter installed in the shower head.  My hair and scalp was clean but still had moisture, not stripped.  My hair also seemed not so tangled so that is a plus.     I liked that a little amount goes a long way and I loved the results this shampoo provided.  Not wild about the smell but I will get used to it or rinse my hair with apple cider vinegar to counter it.  I will purchase again once I run out.</li>
            <li> A little about my hair before I leave a review (because everyone&#x27;s hair will react differently): I&#x27;m not African-American, I&#x27;m Middle Eastern. I have thin hair, but a lot of it. I only wash my hair twice or thrice a week. I&#x27;ve done just about everything to my hair; expensive salon shampoo and conditioner, the &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; method with baking soda and apple cider vinegar, and now finally I have found my hair savior! This product is fabulous, and I paired it with the anti-breakage and volumizing biotin hair masque from this company. I&#x27;ve only been using these products for three weeks and my hair feels absolutely amazing. My hair is the softest its ever been, smells great, and completely repaired my hair after frying it with the no-poo method. STAY AWAY FROM THE NO-POO METHOD! But if you&#x27;re like me and were intrigued by reviews about the no-poo method, tried that method, and realized you were horribly wrong, get this shampoo and hair masque! I love the smell and the natural ingredients. I cut 2 inches off my hair three weeks ago, and my hair has already grown an inch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation for having perfectly soft, LONG, and amazing hair (if you have similar hair to me) is buying extra-virgin cold pressed coconut oil, this shampoo, this hair masque, biotin 5,000 mcg, shower caps, and &amp;#34;its a 10&amp;#34; leave in spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Take your biotin daily!&lt;br /&gt;-Once a week put coconut oil in from your scalp to your ends (make sure you massage your scalp for a few minutes) then cover your hair with the shower cap for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse out with this shampoo (twice to get the oil out)&lt;br /&gt;-Use the associated hair masque after shampooing ONLY ON YOUR ENDS, cover your hair with the shower cap&lt;br /&gt;-Wash your body, shave, wash your face while your hair is up&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse out with COLD water&lt;br /&gt;-When hair is damp, spray &amp;#34;its a 10 miracle leave-in spray&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will do wonders to your hair</li>
            <li> I threw out this shampoo after I forced myself using it half-through. Didn&#x27;t want to waste it but had to give up. It leaves my hair looking greasy and unwashed.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 4a/b type hair, wish it came in a larger quantity but im content with this especially for the price. it doesnt dry out my hair which is great as i am able to retain my natural oils as well. cleans well and moistuizes at the same time, would definitely recommned :)</li>
            <li> I have Asian hair, but naturally a little wavy and not very greasy... I&#x27;d say my hair has always been a little drier than most Asian women&#x27;s hair. So this shampoo is great for moisture... but I can&#x27;t really get much of a lather without using a lot more shampoo than usual. It seem like there&#x27;s plenty of whatever it is that softens hair, but not enough actual shampoo!</li>
            <li> I saw this shampoo on the regular shampoo isle in cvs and bought it because it was sulphate-free. This was possibly one of the worst shampoo&#x27;s i&#x27;ve used ever and nothing like the other sulphate free shampoo&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used like loreal evercream, aveeno pure renewal, redken etc. It did not clean my hair and left it feeling more coarse and greasy than before washing. What kind of shampoo doesn&#x27;t even clean your hair? For the record I have medium wavy hair (asian) which is pretty soft to begin with. This shampoo makes my hair feel worse than it originally is. Did some research and turns out its for african hair or something. Should be labelled so. I can&#x27;t even finish the bottle. In no way was this moisturizing for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product, along with the hair mask and conditioner &#x3D; TERRIBLE, USELESS, INEFFECTIVE.    Dried out my mixed afro textured hair completely. It gave me TONS of tangles and not even the conditioner helped to make my hair soft and less tangled. The smell of this product is disgusting too. It smells like seaweed, kelp, and rancid oils. I DO NOT recommend this garbage. I&#x27;m shocked by how many good reviews this ineffective product has. Try Aubrey Organics, it&#x27;s 100% better than this.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and organic for your hair which is so much more healthier without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I found this product in the ethnic section of Walgreens for $8. MUCH  cheaper.  I have very fine blonde hair and let&#x27;s be honest I do everything wrong a person and do with hair. My hair is also curly. I usually wear it on the straighter side so I blow dry it every day. Shea butter in itself is very moisturizing and a great product. In a shampoo i was worried it would weigh my hair down or be sticky. Nope.  GREAT product.  My hair is moisturized and behaves really well in spite of myself and wrong doings. :-) No flat hair or weighed down hair, no goo. Rinses out well.  I do still use a cream rinse and conditioner more out of habit and my &#x27;bad habits with hair&#x27;  but this alone works good. The best part.. it is natural with NO SLS.  I have sensitive skin and I have to be very careful.  I have no problem with this shampoo.  Who wants to have junk in their shampoo anyway!  Two thumbs up on this one.</li>
            <li> You know, I was expecting this shampoo to really help but it just weighed my hair down and left it coated and greasy. It was definitely not what I expected would happen!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a must have. It leaves hair moisturized and very soft</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel so soft and silky. It feels so moisturizing and I noticed it makes it easier to detangling after use. Love it! I don&#x27;t love the masque but this great.</li>
            <li> This is the best gentle shampoo I&#x27;ve found.  It lathers well, you only need a little, and my hair looks so much better when I use it.  I don&#x27;t conditioner wash anymore, I use this - it gets my hair clean without stripping any moisture.  At $10 it&#x27;s pricier than regular shampoo, cheaper than many high end shampoos that aren&#x27;t nearly as good.  I bought Deva Low Poo and I gave it away.  Shea moisture leaves my white girl 3B hair very soft.  I generally use silicone free products (looking for a new conditioner though due to a formula change in my absolute favorite conditioner, Garnier Nutrisse triple condition, which now has amodimethicone - any recs are appreciated!)</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo, I have ever used.  You can feel the moisture, in your hair, as you wash it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to buy this product for some time now. Everytime I would go to Target I would stop and glance at it but never took the time to actually pick it up and read what it&#x27;s about. I&#x27;m looking for a new conditoner and came across this product on amazon. I&#x27;m thinking hmmmm ok doesn&#x27;t sound bad but the price stopped me. This product has good reviews however you must look at why they were given one star ratings. This seller is overpricing customers. This product line sells for 9.99 at Target and Walgreens. If you don&#x27;t have time to go run there you can still order it online for the same price. What a rip off!!!!!!!! The bootle is already small as it is and this seller has the nerve to charge 30 bucks. I will not be purchasing this item from Amazon.</li>
            <li> very creamy i love this product, really great on your natural hair, love it!!!!!! i really recommend this product to any with dry to brittle hair!!!</li>
            <li> You can pay 9.99, if you get it from Walgreens.  It is great for your hair, leaves it soft and makes it easy to detangle.  Definitely a must have! (I have shoulder length natural hair).</li>
            <li> i am not going to talk about what the product did for my hair specifically because everybody does not have the same hair so we will not get the same results. its a great product (for me) but amazon is selling this product for 26 dollars when you can go to your local beauty supply store or target.com and get it for 10. with that other 16 you have left you can buy the restorative conditioner to go with it.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product at Target and I am not totally convinced that their ingredient list is accurate. The results of this product are somewhat decent (which is why I gave it a 2 star instead of 1), but feels and smells like there is more to it than \\&quot;natural ingredients\\&quot;. My scalp itches like crazy after using this shampoo and the conditioner. That usually only happens when there is synthetic fragrances or chemicals in the product. Makes me wonder....</li>
            <li> I am full Hungarian with very thick, coarse and wavy hair and nothing has worked for me like this. In My late 30&#x27;s now, I have tried from the bottom to top end hair products and this is fabulous. The shampoo alone has so much moisture that many times I go without conditioner. Since starting this product only a little over a month ago, I&#x27;m hooked. The smell is wonderful but its what the hair feels like and how it acts afterward that makes it worth every penny. I don&#x27;t even use styling products now; shampoo, condition, let is sit for 5 minutes while I wash and then rinse for about 1 minute (not loner so some stays in). Thats it, then my hair looks fabulous for the rest of the day. I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer, so not sure what the results would be with one.  I have used numerous hair products for Black women and nothing has come this close.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for itchiness. I stopped using those terrible dandruff shampoos because they made things worse and this helps a lot better. Its a little pricey for the price but as a guy I dont need a lot and sometimes you can find buy one get one free deals in certain stores.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, my hair smells good all day.  However, this leaves my hair feeling almost gummy.  I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.  I have fine hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so gentle and smells great!</li>
            <li> #1 Yes, you can find this at Walgreens, Rite Aid or Target for about $10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, ever since I discovered it, shea butter changed my entire skin care routine and I&#x27;d been looking for something similar for my hair.  At last I found it.  I&#x27;d noticed a different shea moisutre product that didn&#x27;t lather as well but nonetheless left my hair smelling nice and well-hydrated.  8/10.  This product is pretty much perfect.  I have long, wavy hair with individually thin strands but lots of it.  I don&#x27;t dye or blowdry but it gets brittle and thin near the ends.  The combination of this shampoo and matching conditioner leave it  moisturized and nourished but not weighed down all the way root to tip.  The scent is very pleasant, not overpowering and I love the all-natural list of ingredients.  I anticipate a long and happy relationship with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am African- American and I have relaxed, color-treated hair. Needless to say, my hair is extremely dry and brittle. I tried this product because some of my Natural friends absolutely raved about it. After trying it, I definitely agree, this shampoo is the best i&#x27;ve ever tried. My hair is soft, moisturized, and clean after using it. It feels like I just got a  deep conditioner, before I even condition my hair. I love it. I also like the fact that it&#x27;s truly free of any harsh cleansing agents; many products claiming to be gentle and all-natural are full of irritating, drying chemicals. You can tell because those products get really sudsy. Shea moisture doesn&#x27;t get very sudsy, but it still does the job.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! I tried this shampoo after hearing about it on [...]. It is a very good shampoo as it does moisturize the hair. My hair and scalp didn&#x27;t feel stripped of it&#x27;s natural oils after washing with it. I will be trying their whole line of products. Another plus is that it is a shampoo that contains natural ingredients and no sulfates, etc., (ingredients that are bad for the hair). I also have bouts of eczema on my hands and this shampoo doesn&#x27;t irritate me or cause me to have eczema flair ups. Love this one!</li>
            <li> It is a great shampoo that lather and giving moisturze depending on different hair condition. Or what you put there. A lot ppl complain it doesn&#x27;t moist. but it will if you put oil or something else there. It also depend on your hair condition. It may not clarify for a  lot ppl, but it lather that seem enough to clarify. If you use a lot amount and massage through , it might be deep cleanse. I can&#x27;t guarteen but it still great shampoo with moistursing better than other organic and commerical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice and I like the way it cleanses, but the fragrance is overwhelming and cloying -- my husband could smell it all the way downstairs when I was showering upstairs and it clung to me for the next two days. I don&#x27;t think I can continue using it because I don&#x27;t want to be the person with the strong perfume in crowded places.</li>
            <li> I used to suffer from dry, frizzy hair until I found this product and its coinciding conditioner at my local drugstore. Shea Moisture products are always cheaper at Target or your local drugstores so be sure to look there before buying on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo immediately makes my hair feel so soft and I love the way I can control my hair after using. The smell is very easy to get used to and the shampoo does add a little bit of volume to my hair. I highly recommend this product along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was soooo nervous about buying this shampoo. I tried the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Shampoo and wasn&#x27;t thrilled about how it made my hair feel. I did not want to get my hopes up too high, but the reviews on Amazon and Walgreens had me excited. I used it and fell in love. My hair was so moisturized that I felt it was a dual shampoo/condit. My hair is 4a/4b (more so 4b). After applying this, my curls were more defined and luscious. Although the shampoo smells good, the smell is like a strong perfume (which I don&#x27;t love, but don&#x27;t hate either)so be mindful of that. I would recommend you guys give it a try. I hope you Natural Hair ladies enjoy as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!!  I am nine mos. Post relaxer and this shampoo  is most certainly for those who are in a state of transition. My hair type is 4b and this shampoo leaves my hair well moisturized and feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PAY MOORE THEN $9.99 FOR THIS PRODUCT WALMART TARGET AND WALGREENS SELL THIS SHAMPOO AND MOST OF THE OTHER SHEA MOISTURE PRODUCTS FOR $9.99</li>
            <li> Strips hair too much!  After using it, my hair and my daughters hair felt so dry!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and the hair mask from Target and i almost cried after washing it out of my hair. I am transitioning and my hair tangles very little usually. This left my hair a dry, tangled, brillo pad MESS! I had to wash my hair over 3 times to get normal feeling back into it. I&#x27;m not sure where this went wrong. I use the Thickening Mist and the Dandruff Mist and I love them both. This shampoo and the Hair Masque are a definite NO! I will definitely be returning them back to target for a refund, and sticking to Herbal Essence Hydralicious.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally coarse (but relaxed) hair, and switching to this shampoo (and discontinuing use of sulfate shampoos in general) is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my hair. I decided to search for a natural shampoo after finally coming to the conclusion that the sulfates in my cheap shampoos were causing major dryness, tangles, and breakage. I absolutely dreaded wash days because I couldn&#x27;t detangle my hair after washing without lots of hair breaking off, no matter how well I deep conditioned. I was doing everything else right and I had read about how damaging sulfates could be, so I knew it was the shampoo.  I bought this shampoo from Target after coming across it while browsing the site and reading all the great reviews about it. I was not disappointed when I tried it. Firstly, the smell is amazing. It&#x27;s nice to be able to use a good product that smells good without the use of chemicals, described only as \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; in the ingredients list of many products. Secondly, the moment you put this shampoo on your hair, you can feel how gentle and moisturizing it is. It doesn&#x27;t lather well, but that&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t contain the harsh chemicals (sulfates) found in most shampoos that produce that lather. When rinsed out, if feels like you&#x27;re rinsing out conditioner, rather than shampoo. It gave my hair so much \\&quot;slip\\&quot;, as people say. Once I finished washing and my hair was airdrying, I began detangling and immediately noticed how soft and easy-to-detangle my hair was. As a result, I had almost NO breakage. That was hard for me to grasp because I was so accustomed to seeing small, broken hairs all over the place after washing. My hair was no longer a dry, tangled, breaking, unmanageable mess after washing.  EDIT: Please do not buy this product or any other Shea Moisture hair product for more than $9.99! I&#x27;m baffled that they&#x27;re being sold for so much more than this! This shampoo and all other Shea Moisture products normally retail for $9.99, which is the manufacturer&#x27;s price. You can find them at Walgreeens and Target for $9.99.</li>
            <li> Since I have gone natural I spent so much money on products that did not stand by what it was required to do. Shea Moisture products are the TRUTH. It does what it says. I have been using the Moisture Retention Shampoo for approximately three months and I love it. It leaves my hair very soft with no breakage. I am very pleased with Shea Moisture and will defintely support this product.</li>
            <li> My hair felt SO brittle.  I used this with the conditioner for about two to three weeks.  I noticed my hair was pretty much &amp;#34;snapping&amp;#34; or breaking anytime I really touched it.  I&#x27;m not even exaggerating here.  My hair was so dry.  My hair felt even more brittle than a henna or keratin treatment has made it feel.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great sulfate free, organic shampoo...this is it.  The first time I tried it, I loved the way my hair felt while using it.  It makes your hair feel very moisturized during the shampoo process and after.  It will leave your hair clean and super soft.</li>
            <li> I have been transitioning from relaxed to natural hair for 3 weeks now and have used this shampoo &amp; conditioner as part of my regime. It works like magic! Smell great, leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized. I believe these bottle will last for almost 2 months, and Target is actually the cheapest place locally I&#x27;ve seen it.</li>
            <li> Bad experience, more than once.  At first I thought that it was just me, but after more than one try and a handful of tangles and hair shred, I then knew!  It made my hair EXTREMELY clean to the point of sticky, squeaky, fall out.  Most reviews are positive, but I guess some people just aren&#x27;t fit for it.  :(</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! I have afro textured hair and am transitioning from relaxed to natural. This shampoo works very well in my hair! It detangles and moisturizes very well and most importantly my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped after I rinse it out unlike with other shampoos. It is sulfate-free which also helps with my dry/itchy scalp because again, it&#x27;s not a stripping shampoo. I would recommend this for women with curly to kinky hair that needs moisture.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo and conditioner.  I originally bought it for my 4 year old bi-racial son&#x27;s curly hair.  I wanted something that was natural without all the sulfates and chemicals that would still be moisturizing for him without stripping the oils out.  Most kiddie shampoos make his beautiful curls feel dry and straw-like after a few uses, however, with the Shea Butter version, his curls were so soft and silky.  They actually had a glossy sheen to them.    On a whim, I used the shampoo and conditioner myself when I ran out of my usual brand.  I was skeptical to use it on my very long, straight, caucasian hair which tends to get very oily in the scalp.  I thought for sure all the moisturizing properties would make me look like a greasy mop, but I was so pleasantly surprised to see that not only did it not make my hair greasy, I had the softest, silkiest head of hair that I&#x27;ve seen in recent years since pregnancy.  I switched for a moment to the Coconut version and it doesn&#x27;t come close to the Shea Butter.  I haven&#x27;t found anything yet to compare to this for either of us.  Will definitely purchase again online since Target seems to run out of this too often.  Only reason I give it 4 stars is that it seems to take more effort to get the product out of the bottles... like the bottles are made of denser plastic and you have to squeeze real hard to get even a bit of shampoo out, otherwise, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> For whatever the reason, this particular product dried my hair out terribly. It definitely wasn&#x27;t a good match for me.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but great things to say about this product.  After I used the expensive wen for 4 months I came across with this product and I love it. BETTER THAN WEN. It makes my hair soft but helps it to hold body and shine. Before my hair was dry and  I always keeps it short. Now is very healthy. Looks and smell divine! It does everything it said it does....and more! !!!!&lt;br /&gt;WALGREENS $9.99</li>
            <li> I JUST WENT OUT AND PURCHASED THE SAME EXACT PRODUCT FROM WALGREENS DRUGSTORE FOR ONLY 9.99! THEY CARRY THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF SHEA MOISTURE PROUCTS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT AMAZON!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of bad review but buy this at target (about $10) and it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;1 - it&#x27;s shampoo for really dry hair, if you have a normal hair this product likely make it oily&lt;br /&gt;2 - I can&#x27;t use conditioner after this for keep my hair clean longer and i can save money&lt;br /&gt;3 - it&#x27;s smell gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The raw Shea butter restorative line works really well on my hair. It leaves my hair feeling strong and soft!</li>
            <li> I recently made the big chop, going natural and my hair is usually really dry with a lot of breakage. I was hesitant to buy this product because it was expensive...$9 a bottle..highway robbery! I&#x27;m glad I did because it is an amazing product. It cleans my hair without leaving it rubbery feeling and dry...and the smell..omg its all I notice all day, it smells so good, I&#x27;ve had compliments about it</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It cleaned my scalp very thoroughly while keeping my hair moisturized, so there was no stripping. Of course, no stripping, its a moisturizing shampoo. I used it as a clarifier for 2 reasons, #1 I have extremely dry hair (4b afro-american, very porous). #2 I don&#x27;t use unnatural products in my hair, my leave-ins, gels and conditioners are all homemade, so all I need is a delicate cleanser (decyl glucoside) which is the 2nd ingredient. Exactly what I was looking for. Just one gentle cleansing agent besides water and the remainder of the ingredients to be moisturizers. Shea Moisture is AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> smells like chemically altered graham crackers and good for your hair :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo at Kroger about a month and a half ago and it COMPLETELY changed the way I style my hair. This shampoo is not meant to be used everyday. I usually wash my hair about 3 times a week (I have 3a long curly hair, very dry and coarse) I use it mostly on my roots and just a little bit on my ends. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the no lather effect, it doesn&#x27;t mean you have to use more. If you just use a little bit it will still do the job. Anyway, regardless of what shampoo or conditioner I used, my hair was very tangly BUT this shampoo helped with the dryness and over time helped with the tangles. The first week I used it I didn&#x27;t like it because I was so used to using shampoos with silicones and glycerine and crappy stuff like that, but after a week my hair started to retain its curls better and eventually became easier to comb. I also use the conditioner that goes with the shampoo. It&#x27;s not a creamy conditioner because the ingredients are basically oils so I don&#x27;t use it so much on my roots as I do on my ends. But if you use a clarifying shampoo once a week in place of the shampoo and then a silicone- glycerine free hair mask your hair will stay nice and volumeous. Anyway I started reading more about my hair type and went more toward the natural route which changed my whole styling routine and has left my hair in the best condition its ever been in. I used to straighten my hair everyday because I didn&#x27;t know how to control my frizz, but this shampoo along with the conditioner I believe has truly changed my hairs texture. Just remember to NOT OVER USE. Hope this review helped! The picture below is my hair 3 days after washing it with Shea moisture shampoo and conditioner! A tiny bit frizzy but my curls are still defined!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Amy</li>
            <li> The same exact product (12 oz/same size) is only $10 at Target, Meijer, and Walgreens. I love the Shampoo. Our entire family uses it. I love how it makes my hair feel and how it makes my children smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best!! AND after you wash your hair, it feels very moisturizers. Love it. Brought it today at CVS and they had the whole line buy one get one free. Will go back and get more!</li>
            <li> THE BEST SULFATE FREE SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li> Good product build hair strong but does dry out with daily use</li>
            <li> Hey ladies!!! My hair absolutely loves LOVES LOVESSSSS this shampoo.  It literally feels like my hair drinks it up and it keeps my hair moisturuzed and full.  I have no complaints. Great products.  Hear me rave about this and some other shea moisture products i purchased on my youtube beauty channel search me on youtube @diamondrosaaye&lt;br /&gt;Or go to youtube.com/c/diamondrosaaye Make sure u guys subscribe too ! Ive got lots to talk about in hair and beauty!(:</li>
            <li> I have dealt with hair troubles for as long as I can remember. I have long, red wavy hair that turns into a frizz ball as soon as any slight amount of humidity touches it. I&#x27;ve tried shampoos from the high end to low end and many inbetween. I&#x27;ve even tried several that claimed to be sufalte-free, but they seemed to make the problem worse. That was because they weren&#x27;t really sulfate-free. They just basically used a different form of it to be able to call it that. I searched online for a real sulfate-free shampoo, and found this. I bought it at Walgreen&#x27;s. This has made my hair so much softer than it was before. The lather it makes is so smooth it&#x27;s really indescribable. The smell is kind of an earthy scent that is very natural which is what I would hope for from a natural product. Combined with the matching conditioner, my hair has become much healthier and shinier. I highly recommend this to those who have trouble with humidity, dry, or damaged hair. This is drastically helped my hair fight humidity and really restored it. My natural red color seems to be a little more vibrant as well.</li>
            <li> Dries out my frequently colored hair. Not a fan. May work better for others.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair bald 3 months ago. The normal store brands like Tresemme and Clariol. I felt were drying my hair out even when it was wet it did not seem right. I started using this product and on the first wash I could see and feel a difference. My curls were formed and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one advice when using this shampoo is a little goes a long way!!! Which is great cause it will last longer!</li>
            <li> Since I started using this about 6 months ago, I havent let any other shampoo touch my hair.  I have 3b, fine, caucasian curly hair with frizz, porosity, and damage from past bleaching and straightening endeavors.  After I wash, my hair still feels soft and never stripped.  I follow up with a SM conditioner and SM styling milk. My hair has gotten so much healthier since I started using this shampoo and overall product line.  I can&#x27;t help but think that some of the more negative reviews have been made by people who might not have given sulfate free/natural products a chance before.  It takes a little time to balance the oils on your scalp and transition from traditional shampoos to natural.  I know that some products might not work for everyone, but if you have dry, curly hair, I would absolutely recommend you to try it.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the thinner side but I have A LOT of it so it makes my whole head of hair pretty thick. I have mixed hair so sometimes it&#x27;s straight-ish and other times it&#x27;s a wavy/curly mix. Haven&#x27;t found shampoo that actually makes a huge noticeable difference on my hair before, but this one did! Just after a few uses my hair was definitely shinier and smoother. Even had someone comment on how shiny my hair is last weekend. Would recommend to not use for every shampoo but sporadically for a &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34; for your hair. (And it smells great!)</li>
            <li> It cleared up my dandruff/seborrheic dermatitis. I have baby fine straight as an arrow hair, and it did not leave an oil slick like some other reviewers report. Reduced break outs and head sores which I attribute to sulfate free/ gluten free. Best natural shampoo I have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very natural shampoo and it does it&#x27;s job. When I first used it I was blown away by my results leaving my hair soft and shiny. However I started using it daily and it doesnt do the same but leave it greasy and looking unclean or some days very dry. However I stopped cleaning with it everyday used a clarifying shampoo and started this again and it looks a little better already. For anyone buying it just know cleaning it everyday strips your hair can make it dry or even unclean looking because it&#x27;s taking away all its natural chemicals. I think ill stick with it but add something else to my routine and change it up a bit .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised there are so many positive reviews for this product, because this shampoo left my hair DRY and feeling STRIPPED; that too \\&quot;squeaky-clean\\&quot; feeling someone else alluded to. I&#x27;ve had such success with their Curl Enhancing Smoothie that I thought this would work just as good too...not even. And wet combing with this was just like forget it; the hair got tangled too easy. I absolutely cannot use this without saturating my hair with coconut oil and/or using Yes To Cucumbers conditioner along with it. i have natural hair btw (4b by that Andre scale).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing about is that it will LAST YOU, so it&#x27;s a good investment (about $10/bottle in store, and it will be MONTHS before i&#x27;m finished with it for my medium length hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes I saw the note about a possible formula change circa May 2011; I bought the product sometime in the winter of 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH and I HATE the smell. It is so hard to get that stank out of your hair. I want to try the Coconut-Hibiscus shampoo next; just was afraid too because of the silk protein in it (I think my hair might be protein sensitive).</li>
            <li> natural, gentle, and safe for color treated hair</li>
            <li> I have this shampoo but i have one complaint. It doesnt happen every time i use it but sometimes it leaves my hair with this sticky extremely thick texture. It makes my hair so stiff that i cant even put my fingers thru it BUT i think it might be because it didnt get rinsed out good enough. Even though i thought it was. I used it again today and rinsed my hair longer then normal &amp; that weird texture didnt happen. I really hope it was just takes longer to rinse out cause other then that i love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because my dandruff went away but this along with the conditioner DRIED out my hair so badly. I couldnt believe how dry it was and no moisturizer in the world could help. Im switching back to Suave Almond and Shea Butter Conditioner for co-washing (use the shampoo every now and then). At least thats more moisturizing to my hair, I only wanted to try a natural shampoo and conditioner. This is just not for me, so will NEVER repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I have dry, fine hair, and this shampoo makes it feel silky. I limit the amount of harsh chemicals I allow in my products, and that is why I chose this shampoo. It is made of plant extracts and actually foams when you wash your hair without any sulfates. I also recommend using the conditioning mask with the shampoo, as it bumps up the benefits.</li>
            <li> For starters, I have Caucasian, dark brown curly/wavy hair that is past bra strap length (in the back). I used this for the first time last night and went to sleep with my hair wet, which I normally don&#x27;t do. It causes my frizz to be much worse. Today my hair is very shiny, silky, and much less frizzy than I normally get. The curls are also more defined. I had no trouble getting it to rinse out.  I used this as well as the matching conditioner. I just let the conditioner sit for a minute or two, then rinsed it out. I also used an apple cider vinegar rinse right after this and then rinsed again with cool water. Nothing too fancy, but the results were good.  I will say it does have an odd smell, but many people that comment on it don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s not a chemical smell, it&#x27;s the extracts in it. Rosemary has a naturally strong scent. I&#x27;m not sure what sea kelp smells like, so it could be the mixture of the two making it smell odd. My hair does not smell odd today. The aloe and rosemary help with dandruff and itching, so any comments on itch being caused by this from other raters is probably just an allergy to something in it. I bought this at Walgreens, so no comment on getting it from Amazon, but this is worth trying out.  Update: I have used this and the condish twice now and have great results. I straightened my hair after showering with this and got crazy good results. My hair has always been frizzy and wild. To straighten I normally used 3 or 4 products on top of the protenctant to get it to lay decently flat and be shiny. This time, all I used was the protectant and my hair was more sleek than it&#x27;s ever been and shiny like no tomorrow. This is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Oh yes! After one use my hair feels more amazing than amy shampoo has ever made it feel! It&#x27;s got volume, natural curl and shine and it feels so clean! I was a little concerned because it didn&#x27;t lather much in the shower but it rinsed away clean. After air drying, I just love the results! I got the recommendation for this from almostexactlyblog.com and I have tried other &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; methods for hair cleansing before but I like to feel a little more clean that I do with ACW and baking soda. So this is Alex&#x27;s suggestion for a &amp;#34;low-poo&amp;#34; alternative that&#x27;s free of chemicals. Please try it (although I bought it cheaper from Walgreens).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I am not a fan of cowashing because I feel my hair isn&#x27;t properly being cleansed of dirt, oil, product build up, etc. This sulfate free shampoo is a nice balance. It is both cleansing and gentle, so it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> Cleans hair well.  Using this shampoo and any of their conditioners I don&#x27;t need any styling products for drying and straightening my hair.  My hair has never felt or looked better.  No more frizz, tons of shine, no oily roots at the end of the day and my hair color doesn&#x27;t fade the way it does even with other sulfate free shampoos.  I like this company&#x27;s products so much that my bathroom is filled with them.</li>
            <li> had very thick hair but after 2 uses was making my hair fall out in clumps in the shower. hair is falling out just running my fingers through it</li>
            <li> I love this brand. I have the Shea Moisture body wash for this collection, which I love and have been using for around a year straight now. Leaves the sking incredibly soft and smells great. However, I would recommend this shampoo and contitioner only if you have very dry hair. It is too much for my hair and makes it heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Love your products.  Have a host of skin allergies and this product is something I can use.  The only problem I have is trying to get the rich, thick lotion out of the bottle.  The hard plastic packaging makes it difficult to squeeze the lotion out of the bottle. If not for the packaging I would give your products a five (5). Love them  Love them but not much use if I can&#x27;t get them out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51, have thick, fine, fairly long hair, that is colored auburn 2 to 3x yearly, cleanse my hair 2 to sometimes 3x weekly, and I do use a blow dryer and blow brush.  Up until about a year ago, I was a WEN girl... the problem was that I could only really afford it when it was offered at a super price on the shopping channel.  Since those specials are incredibly few and far between anymore, and it is not offered anywhere nearby, I had to change.  I had eventually found Carole&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Oil line, and used it about 3 months, and found it drying (even after an intense Ojon oil treatment), especially coming into the fall and winter months.  I had almost convinced myself to buy the $30 Ojon Rare oils shampoo, when I found Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner at WalMart.  The ingredients were exactly what I was looking for, and the price was right, $9.95 for each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was incredibly impressed with the initial use.  I love the scent of these wonderful ingredients, and my hair did not mat at all (which I do have slight problems with in using the Carole&#x27;s Daughter line, and also when I had tried the Yes to Cucumbers shampoo this spring).  The lather was incredible for a non-sulfate/all natural shampoo!  It rinsed out very nicely, and still, there was no matting; my hair felt clean and smooth and moisturized - almost as if I had used WEN.  I almost opted to forgo the conditioner, but thought a bit on the ends would be good.  In relation to the shampoo, the conditioner, to me, really has no scent.  It also didn&#x27;t really seem to moisturize my hair - I could start feeling the \\&quot;dry\\&quot; ends of my hair, so next time I won&#x27;t use it so I can compare.  My hair did comb out easily with my wide toothed comb, and I blew it out as I normally do on the warm setting, then used my hot air brush.  I love how my hair feels; not over conditioned or greasy/oily at all.. my scalp is not dry or flaky, and the fragrance in my hair is light and heavenly.  One thing to remember, rinse,rinse, and rinse some more.  You cannot over rinse your shampoo or co-wash out of your hair, but you can definitely under rinse, and end up with greasy/oily hair.  I am really looking forward to seeing how my hair responds after prolonged use!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this shampoo on and off for 2 years now. Ever since having kids my scalp gets flakey and does not like most shampoos at all. With this shampoo I rarely have to condition my hair, it feels clean and moisturized and healthy all the time(and pretty much the ONLY shampoo that keeps the itchy flakey scalp at bay).  I also feel like it helps my hair feel thicker and seem to have more volume ,but that is probably because it doesnt strip it of all natural moisture. - if you like the stripped &#x27;clean&#x27; feeling some other shampoos give you may not like this, It cleans... just not in the &#x27;stripping all natural oils from your hair&#x27; kinda way that people tend to perceive  as clean.</li>
            <li> I love this shea moisture line and this is my shampoo, but it will leave your hair dry. YOU MUST PRE POO FIRST, EVEN WITH A PREE POO YOUR HAIR MIGHT BE ALITTLE DRY, the good thing is I only shampoo once a month and I steam my hair everyday for 15 mins in my gym&#x27;s steam room. but if you don&#x27;t have a steam room to use afterwards I wouldn&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> Found this shampoo about 6 months ago, absolutely fantastic. Makes my hair feel very thick, healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out or get itchy. It doesn&#x27;t lather like other &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo&#x27;s but it really feels great while washing. Love it, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ever since I went natural in 2009, I have been struggling to find products that my hair agrees with, especially shampoos. I went from using an all natural $25 a bottle shampoo from a company called JustNatural, to using an Aloe shampoo from Organics, to using Garnier Fructis Hydra Recharge (huge HUGE mistake) and I finally broke down and decided to do some research. I learned that it was best to stay away from shampoos that strip the natural oils from your hair, and even heard that I shouldn&#x27;t be shampooing at all! I heard a lot of things about &#x27;co-washing&#x27; and decided to give it a try. To keep it short and sweet, not everything works for everybody. After co-washing my hair (with many different conditioners) my hair was still dirty and did nothing for retaining moisture into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I googled &#x27;all natural shampoos&#x27; and came across Shea Moisture&#x27;s Raw Shea Retention shampoo. I&#x27;ll admit that I ignored this product for awhile because I once tried Shea Moisture&#x27;s Coconut and Hibiscus line, and it did absolutely nothing for my hair besides leaving it dry. I finally decided to try it after reading all of the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not that awful to me, you get used to it. I did not need to use a lot of the shampoo, which was a surprise to me because my hair is very thick. After massaging the shampoo into my hair and scalp and rinsing, my hair felt amazing. It was very soft and clean. In fact, my hair was left feeling so soft that I assumed this was because I had not washed all of the product out of my hair. I spent about 5 extra minutes rinsing my hair under warm water. After I dried my hair with a t-shirt and let it air dry for a while, my hair felt even softer! I then followed up with the conditioner, and then I deep conditioned with the Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque, and my hair absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this shampoo to naturals who have tried co-washing but would like to use an all natural shampoo instead.shampoo instead.</li>
            <li> best shampoo i have used in my life. leaves hair silky. great smell. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</li>
            <li> Best product for natural and relaxes hair. No stripping chemicals such as sulfates which give lots of suds but can potentially strip hair of vital oils. Leaves hair soft and shiny. Less shampoo needed than other shampooes.</li>
            <li> I have 4b natural hair and bought this shampoo after hearing lots of great reviews from other natural African American users. I was extremely shocked at how tangled and  coarse it made my hair feel after using the product.  Not even protein treatments leave my hair feeling as dry as this shampoo did.</li>
            <li> When it comes to a gentle alternative to standard shampoos, I have trouble finding a product that beats this one!  Shea Moisture really thought out their ingredient list, no sulfates, gentle cleansers, no alcohols, and lots of moisture!  I never have problems with dandruff or greasy hair using this product any more.  Sometimes I add a little bit of peppermint oil to the mix when I shampoo and that really helps clean my scalp.  I don&#x27;t buy this on amazon either.  It&#x27;s much cheaper at either walgreens or walmart.</li>
            <li> Great product! I will agree with you ladies that say this product is not for everyone. I would recommend first finding the porosity of your hair so that you can find the best products for your hair. I&#x27;m a curly girl and have been natural for about two months now. I have disliked my hair pretty much my entire life. Until my last hair cut I did everything I could to hide my curls. My entire life my hair has been very frizzy and dry. Little did I know I have low porosity hair (in a nutshell this means that my hair has trouble absorbing moisture). Another tip for you ladies who have tried co washing (washing hair with conditioner only) and don&#x27;t like it, try reverse pooing (condition first  and shampoo second). After a lot of trial and error and years of running from what the Good Lord gave me I can honestly say I love my hair! A bit of rambling but I hope this review is helpful.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing shampoo.  It has no sulfates in it and it does not dry my hair or strip the color out of it.  I love the scent it has in it as well.</li>
            <li> I really love this product as it really cleans and adds moisture. I really like how it helps in hair growth also.</li>
            <li> I always have a bottle on hand; a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love the rich texture and lovely fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will love the  pampering.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of shampoos and love this one.  I have a girlfriend also with curly hair and she does not even use conditioner with this shampoo.  I use the Shea Moisture conditioner along with this shampoo for excellent results.  This is non-toxic and lasts a long time even with my long hair.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I love what this product is about - no animal testing, &amp; using natural products, no sulfates....but... It is so strongly perfumed and dried the heck out of my hair. I have highlighted hair, but I can&#x27;t think of any other shampoo that stripped my hair so badly. It completely stripped Redken Shades EQ toner right out of my hair. This could be bad or good, depending on whether you toned your hair correctly or not ;). If you didn&#x27;t tone well, this shampoo will pull it right out. I have also used the accompanying conditioner, and it&#x27;s just not successful at smoothing the hair after the shampoo.  I have tried this brands Manuka Honey Treatment Mask, hoping it would moisturize - No, it didn&#x27;t PLUS it made my shower floor so slippery &amp; slimy- it was dangerous.  My daughters both use shampoos and conditioners in the company&#x27;s other hair lines and they like them.  They both have natural hair.  So, it really depends.  I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for color-treated hair at all.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The price is right, it smells very pleasant and after using it to shampoo my hair, it always feels silky and free of tangles.</li>
            <li> made my scalp really itchi for some reason and dryout my hair for some reason and it dint see much of getting my hair any longuer</li>
            <li> I have blonde super frizzy color treated over processed hair.  I change the color all the time and my hair is naturally a bit dry and damaged feeling and I have incredibly sensitive skin.  Most true sulfate free shampoos do not lather so I was surprised this one did.  (seriously read labels alot of products that say &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34; just means it doesn&#x27;t contain sodium laureth sulfate but contains some derivitave of it.)  This has all natural ingredients and makes my hair super soft, cleanses it well, does not strip my hair color and even gives my hair some body.  Other shampoos can leave blisters on my scalp and it&#x27;s hard to find something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp. This shampoo even seemed to soothe it.  I have also noticed my hair growing a bit faster probably because it is healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things I noticed about this shampoo... it does not take much to actually cleanse your hair and it does have kind of a strange slippery feel.  Since I am used to a non lathering cleanser this does not bother me but if you are used to tons of suds this doesn&#x27;t have it.  You don&#x27;t need the suds for your hair to be clean, just mentioning and as others have said you can find it cheaper in stores. I find it at CVS, Walgreens, and Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for about a year now. I had really dry damaged hair, and silicones were making it worse. I was thrilled to find it and usually buy it at Walgreens along with the conditioner. I&#x27;ve never had a problem and have always been pleased with how it made my hair look and feel. But the last bottle I purchased, the beginning of June, felt different when I was putting it on my hair, thinner, less rich and creamy somehow and my hair just looked flat and awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give it the benefit of the doubt, making sure it wasn&#x27;t just a bad hair day, I tried it again and the same thing happened. I actually still had my old bottle and I compared ingredients but they were the same. I don&#x27;t know what it is, maybe just different suppliers for the ingredients? But it&#x27;s different and not in a good way. I still have some conditioner left, and I&#x27;ll use that up, but I&#x27;ll have to find a different natural shampoo, and that is a shame, and and a pain.</li>
            <li> Soft,shiny,moisturized,thick hair yayy!! Awesome really cleans well but does not strip. Lathers well but I could not detangle my hair no slip. Looked at the ingredients and was like how is this going to clean my hair lol it surprised me. Give it a try...I have type 3 and 4 hair.</li>
            <li> very rich and moisturizing. no sulfates. excellent product</li>
            <li> I bought this originally because i was so excited about it being made 100% from all natural products and is chemical free. I had read such great things about it, but I feel like this was unfortunately a waste of money. It does smell nice - I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on that, but it left my thick, curly hair feeling even more bulky. It leaves this layer of gunk on my hair, which makes it take FOREVER to straighten. What&#x27;s worse is that I can&#x27;t even run my fingers through my hair because it&#x27;s now so snarly. I tried to calm it down with some Argan Oil, but that didn&#x27;t help. I was hoping to stick it out and finish off the bottle because it was more expensive than what I normally pay for shampoo, but I just don&#x27;t think I can. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!! This product  leaves my hair moistened and healthy. The black soap formulas are wonderful for dandruff and ezema.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for myself because I color my hair red regularly, and I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t strip the color out as quickly. It&#x27;s just absolutely amazing! The color has lasted an entire 5 weeks vs 3 weeks using L&#x27;Oreal EverPure!... I also started using this on my 3 year old son. It works great on his hair too. We always use natural and cruelty free products. This one is by far the best shampoo we&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s definitely worth the extra money (I paid about $10.00 at WalMart). It lathers nicely, and leaves hair moisturized without weighing it down. Great for adults, children, and no harsh chemicals polluting the earth.</li>
            <li> I found this product at target and since we use all natural hair care in our house I was very excited about this brand and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I used the shampoo, conditioner and the leave in conditioner from this line for months. We have thick curly hair that dries very easily at the ends and is very oily at the scalp. It never really made my hair as soft as I wanted but it didn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it so we kept on using it. The scent was always a little strong and perfumey but it never stayed in your hair long after rinsing. One day we bought a bottle that smelled like someone had crushed garlic and some other terrible potent smell into it, we exchanged it and the second bottle was the same. We tried buying it from another store completely and sure enough it smelled awful. My daughter would not let me wash her hair with it and my husband threw it out and forbid me wasting our money on another bottle. I contacted the company by email with the lot numbers from the bottles and store addresses and dates where they were purchased, they said they had received no other complaints about this issue and said the would send me free shampoo to compensate me, they were super nice and replayed promptly at first however months have passed and I never did receive the shampoo nor did they respond to my follow up email. I was later told by a friend who makes goat milk soaps that raw shea butter smells terrible when it&#x27;s not refined which is why they use strong perfumes to cover it up and if it goes rancid it smells even worse. I really wanted to love this product, it&#x27;s company seems to value all the things I value in beauty and hygiene products, but it wasn&#x27;t really living up to my exceptions of moisture retention and it seemed to leave a filmy buildup in our hair no matter how much we rinsed or how little we used. It didn&#x27;t work for our family so we no longer buy it.I had hoped to maybe hear some reviews from others that might of had the strange smell issue as well.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a huge skeptic and read tons of reviews before buying products now. Bought too many products blindly and very rarely have I been amazed.  I started using this shampoo ~45 days ago and my hair has done a 180 with manageability and moisture by far. I am thrilled by the real price of $10, not $16.50 or any other marked up price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I originally bought this product with the Transitioning set for Shea Moisture. I was happy with the shampoo as my hair did not get dried out as usual. My hair was actually moisturized afterwards. I have black, relaxed hair. Normal texture is very course with a tight curl (Andre Scale 4B). My hair grows out quickly and sucks up all the moisture rapidly, making my hair feel dry most of the time otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally did not notice the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; - cant  smell as bad as a relaxer or dye - yet many of us do this regularly, so I did not notice the smell as it was so minor if it existed at all. Just so some people are aware, Argan Oil has a very strong smell naturally (I buy this too) so, for this shampoo to smell the way it is is pretty good. I don&#x27;t see a problem, no one has told me that my hair smells bad. My husband would say something if it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also started using the Shea Moisture Hair Masque Conditioner with this and this is great. I use the Shea Moisture leave-in conditioner only to pull my ends or crown in instead of using a gel. The spray - styling solution was not that helpful to me though. I would not buy the spray again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Normal Routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair with the Shea Moisture Shampoo, then I apply the masque conditioner and then sit under the dryer for 20-45 minutes once per week. Then I wash out the conditioner. Once per month, I will wash my hair first with a clarifying shampoo then wash again with Shea Moisture and then condition as mentioned. After washing out the condition,  I add a dime size of 100% jojoba oil to my hair along with another product: Mixed Chicks Straightening Serum, then I blow dry my hair using a roll brush blow dryer (limits the amount of heat that comes out) at an angle (starting with the crown first and working towards the middle and through the ends) on high initially until the hair gets moderately dry, then I turn it to low as to not overdry the hair. Once the hair is dry, you can feel the difference in how the hair sits on the head, it is very flat, not frizzed out. Then I will flat iron using a ceramic iron to liking. I do not flat iron heavily because with how the hair is dried at an angle, the hair looks straight before flat ironing, I use the flat iron more to style not to straighten. I do not wrap my hair at night, I only use a silk or satin pillowcase. I do not wet wrap or roller set my hair, I only blow dry. I also will run a little 100% organic argan oil through my hair about mid week to keep any frizz from forming. After doing this consistently over 45 days, my hair is so much easier to manage and looks way nicer with much less effort by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I bought pretty much every product available for this hair at Walmart and Target without success. Then I decided to buy higher end products where I also bought salon brands as well to include the Sebastian line, to which I was using before this and it was so so but easily 3 times more expensive, Mizani, Nexus, and others. I also used the Carols Daughter line, which was ok, but not great. Wen - seems designed more for people who have a softer and not as tight curl or for another hair type - not anything special in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one product is perfect for everyone, but overall this product is perfect for me. I was so pleased by this product, I also just started buying the lotions and soaps (today), so I will leave a review once I get a good feel for the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Shampoo and already recommended it to others including my family members, but I would never buy this for more than $10 because this is what it is sold for at stores such as Target and Walgreens- this seller needs to be aware of this. A product should not get bad reviews because of a Seller on Amazon or for Amazon, as this is an injustice to the brand.</li>
            <li> I have been going low poo and using conditioner only to shampoo sometimes. This product is my favorite. I love that it is natural.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have been getting very allergic lately with burns on my forehead from almost all shampoos with chemicals and sulfates. And all the organic, natural stuff out there usually makes my hair fall flat. But not this amazing shampoo! It doesn&#x27;t give me asn allergic reaction and it feels great, full of body and thickness! The conditioner was just as good, leaving my hair soft, yet full. I&#x27;ll be getting this product from now on!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Organic and all natural. In my opinion it is better than the Shea moisture conditioner, but they are both great if you want some natural. A bit in the pricey side, but great.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo after trying Shea Moisture&#x27;s Yucca Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner. I thought the Yucca was okay, but something wasn&#x27;t quite right about how my hair felt after washing and conditioning. So, my next go &#x27;round I picked up the Raw Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner..big difference. I have 4B/4C hair and it gets very dry.  The Shea Shampoo did not strip my hair of natural oils, which only made my hair feel even better once I applied the conditoner. I would definitely recommend and pick up the conditoner as well.</li>
            <li> Nice mild scent; cleans hair and scalp.  My hair usually feels dry after shampooing, but this shampoo leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture Moisture Retention Shampoo is awesome! It lathers well, cleanses without stripping, has awesome ingredients (no sulfates) and smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the way I use shampoo--once every 5-7 days; diluted and applied to scalp via a color applicator bottle--a bottle last for 5-6 months. This makes buying this shampoo extremely affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is a staple in my hair care routine--The only other shampoo I use is Shea Moisture Deep Cleansing Shampoo. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing for years to come. I buy it from Target or Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Decyl Glucoside, Shea Butter, Aloe Vera Juice, Argan Oil, Pro-Vitamin B5, Rosemary Extract, Sea Kelp Extract, Vitamin E, Honeysuckle Flower Extract, Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract</li>
            <li> Bought mine at WalGreens, 9.99 and it works wonderfully on my fine, thin, limp, blonde hair. Doesn&#x27;t strip my hair, the bleach out, nor dry it out. I have it bleached every three to six months, and it has made my hair more manageable. Try it out for yourself. I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Great for my dyed black hair.  I have medium fine hair and I have only used this once but already I can tell a difference.  My hair is softer, shinier, and in the shower it doesn&#x27;t feel stripped at all.  This was only $9 at walgreens and usually they have a BOGO sale or B2G1 so I suggest just going to walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not the most fruity but the ingredients are fantastic and you can&#x27;t have it all without adding synthetic fragrances.  Also, make sure to lather it.  The shampoo takes awhile but be patient and work it in and you will get some foam going.</li>
            <li> This leave-in or rinse out conditioner deeply moisturizes, detangles and repairs dry, damaged or over-processed hair.

By age 19, the widowed mother of four was selling Shea Butter, African Black Soap and her homemade hair and skin preparations all over the countryside. Sofi Tucker was our Grandmother and SheaMoisture is her legacy. With this purchase you help empower disadvantaged women to realize a brighter, healthier future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethically Traded Ingredients Sustainably Produced.&lt;br /&gt;Pioneering Community Commerce and Fair Trade Since 1912.&lt;br /&gt;Tested on our family for four generations.&lt;br /&gt;Never on animals.&lt;br /&gt;MADE IN THE USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake well, natural ingredients tend to settle.&lt;br /&gt;© 2011 Sundial Brands&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s cheaper at Walgreens.  It&#x27;s $10.49 for the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Restorative Shampoo. $10.49 for the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner. The Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Extra-Moisture detangler, prices vary from store to store however it&#x27;s still cheaper than the almost $40 bucks for the combo.  I rate it 5 stars due to it being cruelty free and all natural and being a small family owned business.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing! It smells heavenly and contains all natural ingredients which aren&#x27;t harsh on your natural hair. I highly recommend this shampoo to any women who are already natural or looking to go natural! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> Good product, but can find this at walmart for cheaper!</li>
            <li> Ok, I am truly a cheap person when it comes to buying products, I don&#x27;t believe in spending money on something that goes down the drain literally!!! :) For info purposes, I have natural 4c hair, 4d, 4e and etc.! My hair is desert dry and super thick, I never use shampoo normally but when I give them a try they are always super drying and mat my strands together. I usually just use acv or clay to wash, but wanted something when Im lazy or rushing. I have wanted to try this for a while but was skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money! But I finally gave in and I must admit &amp;#34;It Works&amp;#34;, it lathered beautifully and didn&#x27;t dry my hair one bit!! I do not care for the smell but oh well, you cant have everything! A little bit went a long way, even with my hair being thick as it is, after first use, couldn&#x27;t even tell I used it! So im shocked but happy bc now I have something I can just pick up at local store without ordering when needed!!&lt;br /&gt;Its has a wow factor definitely! Try it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use shampoo after sometime of no-poo for 6 months. It leathers very well at the beginning of the purchase. Use it several times before I stopped using for travel for long time overseas (6-7 months of not using the product). When I got back i tried to use it again but it stopped lathering. Tried to lather it as before several times but I couldn&#x27;t..I tried even to use as hand wash it does not lather at all. In overall the shampoo makes the wash little of a struggle free as it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair when it lather. I&#x27;ve seen better shampoos though.</li>
            <li> i just found this product online and i ordered it after the reviews on here and let me tell you this is a great product for my natural hair. i recently went natural and i was confused as to what products to use on my hair .my hair as always been dry and lifeless due to bad products and chemical use but this shampoo works wonders on my hair keeps my hair moisturized for days .love it love it hair feels so soft all you wanna do is keep touching it.with the use of the conditioner this all that i need.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY SCENTED even though there is no fragrance listed on the ingredients! had to return it due to STRONG SCENT.  it took me hours to clear that scent from my hands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;arrived in great condition and on time as well.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so good and it has a creamy consistency and makes my hair smell great days after shampooing. I&#x27;m falling in love with their products!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the hair mask treatment because it was all organic and natural i thought it would be good but boy was i wrong! i almost cried when my hair dried after using both! my hair was sooo dry and brittle it felt like it could just break off. its soft while its wet so it tricks you but im very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this in the store and I have used hair products for damaged hair in the past, so I gave it a try. While I love the smell, ingredient list and company ethics, this is not meant for my hair. It left my fine, straight blonde hair with a waxy coating and made it look stringy and unwashed. I&#x27;ll be giving it to my sister with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great. Great product</li>
            <li> This shampoo moisturizes my hair even better than some conditioners I have tried. I HAVE CURLY HAIR and moisturizing my hair is such a struggle because a majority of products I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t help at all.. This product is not only all natural, sulfate free, and cheap but it works wonders. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today.  I used a clarifying shampoo first (Paul Mitchell Shampoo One) because I had a lot of product build up and wasn&#x27;t sure this shampoo could remove it all and my hair general felt pretty soft afterwards--definitely softer than after the clarifying shampoo.  I guess I think this shampoo is just average-not really great but not bad either.  Followed up with the  Shea Moisture Conditioner which definitely left my hair very soft--reminded me of the old Cream of Nature softness from years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite brand of hair care product. Makes my daughters natural hair soft and very easy to manage. Will continue to buy this brand of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I bought it for what i read about it helping with dandruff and it has worked. My hair feels much softer and it smells great. I don&#x27;t even have to use that much! Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price. This product sells for around $10 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target ( stores and online) and a variety of drugstores. This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products. They make a fine product at a reasonable price. This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
            <li> have only purchased for $9.99 and sometimes 7.99 when on sale!! I once ran out of conditioner (impossible to believe but true) and used this alone its all i needed..FINALLY a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard and stiff. I can use this alone and my thick drenched in moister and easy to work through.</li>
            <li> I reacted to this product very soon after I began to use it.  Lots of itchy scalp and losing hair in the shower.  After it continued happening, I read the label more completely and it does say to discontinue use if irritation occurs.  I don&#x27;t recall ever reacting to a hair product before so it took me a while to accept this was the cause.  Once I went back to my old products my scalp started to recover.  It is slowly getting better (the itch and scale), but the hair loss stopped right away.  So I am glad that some people don&#x27;t react to it, but just a warning to others.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair everyday otherwise it looks really greasy. A lot of reviews for this product seemed like it was genuine but it left my hair feeling greasier then it normally is and almost slimy. It also had a terrible smell like after you get a perm done. I would not reeccomend this to anyone it&#x27;s terrible stuff</li>
            <li> My hair has always been dry and fizzy, and as I got older, it seemed to get worse. I had begun to despair at how unmanageable it was, especially in any kind of humidity. I tried everything: Diva, BedHead, B&amp;B, Loreal Sulfate Free, Goldwell, white vinegar, egg yolk, mayonnaise; I tried not blow drying it and blow drying it with an ion dryer but -- nothing, and I mean nothing, worked. Then I tried Shea Moisture Shampoo for Dry and Damaged Hair. I started with the shampoo, the conditioner and the deep conditioner. I just finished the first bottle of shampoo -- so I have been using it for about 3 weeks. My hair is amazing! People have commented on it. Shiny, soft and not frizzy even in the humidity! It is like a miracle. I don&#x27;t use either the conditioner or the deep conditioner very often at all any more -- mostly I just use the shampoo, and I wash my hair about every 3 days. I would say the change happened over about two weeks. I am just thrilled with the results. I have not found any other product that comes close. Yay!</li>
            <li> My husband is a huge fan.  He thinks this is the best shampoo he&#x27;s ever had.  His hair is very soft and full of body.  It even seems to accentuate his natural blonde highlights.  I love the way his hair smells afterwards</li>
            <li> Love this non sulfate shampoo. Just a dab does the job. Strong scent.</li>
            <li> I L.O.V.E. this product line!  This shampoo keeps my often dry 4c/b hair super moist.  I love that it is reasonably priced and readily available!  I have been using it for 2 years now without any issues.  It smells great, has no sulfates, and my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and leave-conditioner due to the \\&quot;positive\\&quot; reviews on YouTube. I must say, this stuff is good. I highly recommends it. The shampoo alone left my hair very soft. After a couple of washes, I decided to purchase the smoothie. Love, Love, Love!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, dry hair and my scalp tends to get irritated in the winter months. After just one use of this shampoo, my hair was suddenly very soft, looked much healthier, and my scalp was not irritated at all. And as an added perk - it smells wonderful. Easily the best shampoo I have ever tried. I have lent some to family and friends, and so far, every one of them has gotten hooked after one try.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair twice a week with this product.  It works wonders for my once dry brittle hair.  I use the full line of the Shea Moisture products and have noticed a big difference in the texture and growth of my hair.  I am so happy I found something that works for my hair.</li>
            <li> Having mixed hair(mulatto) I have bounced around with shampoos and conditioners since I stopped giving my hair relaxer treatments, during the summers and some of spring going natural and getting flat ironed straightening very now and then the rest of the year. I found this when I started using the Shea moisture line of lotion for my dry scalp. This is by far the BEST combination I have used. It smells lovely and light of course I have noticed but even my hair dresser has asked me what I changed because my hair is now so much thicker, healthy looking and feeling. It brushes better and knots so much less. Another thing I love is how far it can go, because of how much hair I have I tend to go through both quickly to get all to the scalp, some how with Shea Moisture I don&#x27;t have to go to crazy with the amount to cover everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only shame is the price online, when I can&#x27;t find it in stock in stores which never go over 10$. I ever see it online I&#x27;m sure to grab it.</li>
            <li> Might as well not have shampooed. My hair felt greasy even though I rinsed it all off. My mom even asked me if my hair was dirty the same day I washed it. I have normal/oily hair. Definitely not for that hair type.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product.  It leaves is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> When I go To CVS I usually go on a mini beauty products shopping spree. On that spree I walked into the hair aisle for a sulfate free shampoo. I have very curly Hispanic hair that is just really dry, probably cause I don&#x27;t take the best care of it and my curls are a lot tighter than most Hispanic women I know. This shampoo cause my eye because of the shea butter ingredient and all the other good stuff inside. I almost bought the one for the curly hair but this just seemed better in terms of what it could do and both were about 10 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used quite a bit of it for my hair but I think that&#x27;s just cause I have very dry hair.I loved the smell and I liked that it still created a bit of sud. I noticed that compared to regular moisturizing shampoo, Shea moisture made my hair a lot softer. It was easier to detangle in the shower. Second time I used it my hair felt even more soft and manageable. I love this shampoo and definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used this product today for the 1st time. I have curly, thick, mediterranean hair. I also work out almost everyday. As a result I have to wash my hair almost daily. Those of you with curly hair know how frequent washing strip the hair of all moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became interested in this type of product after seeing a commercial for Wen. Although the Wen stuff sounds good, they don&#x27;t mention the ingredients on their website. Unless I know what&#x27;s in the bottle, I am not buying it. Many products are branded as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but still contain a lot of toxic ingredients. Besides, the Wen stuff is probably overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I found SheaMoisture yesterday at my local CVS when I went to buy tissues. I read the ingredient list and was surprised to see a non-toxic product like this at CVS! I decided to give it a try. It only cost me $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it today after a High Intensity Interval Training Class in which I sweated a lot. I am very happy with the results! The product hardly lathers but it still cleans. I needed to apply less leave-in conditioner and my curly hair feels great, manageable, and most importantly, not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue using this product instead of regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because despite how moisturizing and nourishing it was for the hair, the fragrance is too overpowering. The honeysuckle smell is too strong. I wish they&#x27;d cut back on that and increase the Rosemary oil content instead. If they&#x27;d add some mint it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I have super long hair and this was recommended to me on the long hair forum. It is horrible. It left a coating on my hair. I read all of these good reviews and was hopeful it would be good but I was wrong! I had to get back in the shower and wash my hair again. Wasn&#x27;t happy!</li>
            <li> It did exactly what it said it would do. It was delivered in a very timely manner. I only used it once. Its strong scent is a little over powering, which is just my personal taste. For all you complaining about the price, I don&#x27;t know about Amazon, but websites that have vendors such as Ebay, charge a fee per sale. Plus to pay by credit card also costs each time a vendor uses that service. So the price might be higher than a retail store, but you get what you pay for. Which is having someone send it to your door. No one is forcing anyone to buy online...</li>
            <li> I am a Latina young woman with frizzy, curly hair. I bought this product at Target because it is 8 dollars instead of the 20 dollars advertised here. I first used this product about two days ago and I must admit it did leave my hair flat and my curls were undefined. I used it along with MillCreek&#x27;s Biotin Conditioner. After the first day and a half, my hair was super greasy. I saw this product reviewed by a \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; blog online so I emailed the woman in charge and she recommended I use a dime size amount next time and try rinsing the shampoo out using hot water then rinsing with cold water after conditioning. I did and I have to say my hair look amazing! It&#x27;s in the process of drying as I type this but already I can see the difference! I have a lot of volume and body and my curls are looking great. For my hair type, I have always been told to use the minimal amount of shampoo I possibly could. I never really understood why nor listened but this time I did and my hair looks GREAT! I&#x27;m going to wash my hair another few times or so and see if this shampoo still gives me great results. Currently, I am still conditioning with my Biotin Conditioner but if this shampoo keeps giving me great results, I might just try the corresponding conditioner. I&#x27;ll make sure to update soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s, this shampoo does not make my hair shed as much as other natural shampoos have had in the past. If you have the same problem, try this shampoo and you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> i have 4b/4c natural hair. for the past 1 year my hair has being shedding excessively that i developed bald spots! I have used expensive shampoos and treatments and nothing helped slow down the shedding. i even thought about shaving my hair and starting over. the shedding was worse when i wash my hair; my hair clogged up my drain 3 times, so yeah i had to buy drano...lol&lt;br /&gt;I bought the shea moisture shampoo years ago and never used it,,,,,,yeah i am a product junky. i decided to use it....OMG  the shedding dramatically stopped instantly. I have being using it ever since. Do not buy on Amazon go to CVS or walgreens or walmart or sally&amp;#34;s it is cheaper at those locations.  i am also using ORS mayonnaise conditioner.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair oily due to the coconut oil in it. Smells great, though.</li>
            <li> BEWARE: If you are paying $16 for this bottle of shampoo, you are getting ripped off unless the weight is greater than 13 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten my hair permed recently and needed a new shampoo/conditioner that didn&#x27;t cause any further damage in my hair. I used to use a $30 shampoo and $30 conditioner combo, which although better than the cheap $10 combos, contained sodium sulfate. My favorite affordable shampoo/conditioner so far: Herbal Essence Hydration (the blue bottle), Kiss My Face (green bottles), and now Shea Moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my CVS coupon (20% off) and bought Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner for $8 each. So it was quite affordable. I&#x27;ve used it a grand total of once so far, but I can already tell that this product will not strip my hair. It leaves it clean. I noticed significantly less breakage when combing my hair afterwards. I personally enjoy the smell, it&#x27;s not flowery, but more musky, shea butter-like. People around me tended to like the results as well, and I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it&#x27;s a great product and if you don&#x27;t mind spending $10 on a relatively small bottle of shampoo (the only downside), go for it!</li>
            <li> Thought I would finally get around to trying this one because of it&#x27;s popularity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is similar to the pink SM line shampoo in the sense that it barely has any lather, and you don&#x27;t need too much to get a decent clean. It is a gentle cleanser. I condition before I wash, so I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s conditioning properties, but it did not strip my previously conditioned hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, it made me itchy. The next day I kept scratching and it was annoying to the point I decided to clean a second time with my old faithful natural soap bar. I knew it was this shampoo since it was the only new product I introduced to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SM is generally a hit or miss for me, and this was a definite miss. I returned to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase SM products, do so in Target, Walmart, Sally Beauty. It retails 9.99, and is overpriced here.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo, and has a nice smell, not overpowering like some. Will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I bought this shampoo from Walgreens for approximately $8 and I don&#x27;t think that I will use a different moisturizing shampoo. My hair usually gets extremely dry when I shampoo but Shea Moisture&#x27;s Moisture Retention Shampoo does the complete opposite by restoring the moisture into my strands. Also, being natural I have a difficult time managing my 4a/4b hair but since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo I don&#x27;t have that problem. I&#x27;ve recommended it to everyone I know, natural and relaxed!</li>
            <li> I think some of you may be getting scammed because this product is defiantly not stripping.  Make sure u buy it online from drugstore.com, walgreens.com or target.com....I think some independent sellers may be filling bottle because its $10-$12. I love this brand their body products and hair. If there&#x27;s anything negative about the shampoo its that its too moisturizing for some not so dry hair types.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it&#x27;s raw and a moisturizer.  I wear my hair in locs so it&#x27;s important that I keep them moist.  Great product will buy again !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels great, at first. Left a nasty residue over time, that made my hair dull and dirty looking and especially dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> Beware of Shea moisture products they are not for every one.  It left my hair in a dry knotted country mess. My hair started falling out. It never got moisturized even after using the shampoo, conditioner and extra moisture transitioning cream.  The only thing shea moisture left me with was bald stops.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this product at a friends house and so glad I did. First I was attracted by the smell. It&#x27;s similar to Aveda&#x27;s shampure shampoo and then the natural ingredients. I&#x27;ve seen other&#x27;s complain about the smell, but all I know is my boyfriend loves the way it smells. I get more kisses on the head now while snuggling on the couch. In cold weather down in the single digits, I was tired of fly away frizzy hair. This product did the trick of keeping my hair from flyaway frizzy&#x27;s. I have pretty long hair and do not wash it everyday. On the 3rd day, my hair still looks good and most of all it looks and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li> Smells Good! It&#x27;s really thick! Also, I felt like a different person after washing my hair in this stuff. This is the first time I ever tried a Sulfate-Free Shampoo. It was exactly what I needed for my Coarse African-American Hair. Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells nice and is not full of chemicals. Leaves hair clean and moisturized. I use it with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Purchase for my granddaughter per her request as a Christmas gift last year. She loves this product.</li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy, fine hair. Not the type of hair to be envious of, basically. This shampoo not only makes my hair smell great, it gives it tons of body and texture, while still smoothing the frizz. I do alternate it every other time with a shampoo that cleans a bit deeper, as it causes buildup if I use it exclusively. It&#x27;s the only shampoo my husband will use, too.</li>
            <li> Good but doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I rarely buy the same bottle of shampoo twice because Im never truly satisfied with the result. I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THIS SHAMPOO FROM NOW ON. It does wonders for my hair.  I thought this product would leave too much sticky residue, but it does not! It truly moisturizes my hair and scalp, but also cleans my hair without stripping it.  My hair is smooth and not weighed down. I will be trying the conditioner due to this spectacular shampoo.  BUY AT WALMART OR DRUG STORE FOR ONLY $10!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. a little of this product goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have used so many high end products.  This beats them all.  I swear my hair is growing and happy this product. I have thin curly hair and used to wear extensions.  Never again.  I don&#x27;t need too.  The Shea Moisture line has been the best thing to happen to our family.  My 21yr old daughter loves it. My 23yr old son loves it (he is also a beautician). And my husband loves running his hands through my hair all the time.  My hair is growing&lt;br /&gt;again!  No sulfates, alcohol, or by products. I love love love this brand!</li>
            <li> Like the product&#x27;s quality and results, but not the scent too much. Shipping was excellent.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a solution with Shea butter in it for a severe dry scalp issue I had.  This worked wonders for my scalp.  It was the only thing that worked.  It was so good that my dry scalp issue is now completely gone.  It does feel a bit greasy when you first start to use it but I found it feels that way less the more you get used to it.  I no longer have to use it as often to maintain a healthy scalp so it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy when I do use it now.  Good product if you know why you are using it and manage the use of it wisely.  If you use it like you do other shampoos, you will likely not like it because you think something is wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo is the greatest thing since sliced bread!  In the drugstore, Shea Moisture products are in the section for African American hair so I had never given them a second look.  On a website that reviewed shampoos, I happened across a review of the SM Raw Shea Butter formula.  The reviewer raved about the shampoo, the conditioner and mask.  So I decided to try it.  Honestly, this shampoo lathers well, smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  It also protects my precious hair color.  It&#x27;s hard to find a sulfate free shampoo that lathers really well.  If it doesn&#x27;t, I just don&#x27;t feel my hair is clean, despite some claims that a low lather shampoo really does do the job.  It just doesn&#x27;t feel right unless I&#x27;m scrunching that wonderful soapy suds through my tresses.  Most importantly, my hair looks great when I use this shampoo and conditioner.  It feels light and has plenty of body and shine. I also love Shea Moisture&#x27;s Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which has apple cider vinegar (but smells really clean) which removes buildup but yet is color safe.  I buy Shea Moisture at Walgreens or Ulta for about $11.  Sometimes I even find them buy one get one free, which rocks!  I did some research and found out that raw shampoo is different from the regular stuff (even the sulfate free formulas) and it sometimes takes several uses before the benefits reveal themselves.  I found this to be true.  The first time I used it, my hair lacked body and I was tempted to return it.  However, I decided to try it a second time and then a third.  After that my hair seemed to adjust to it really well.  It was soft and shiny with plenty of body.  I also love the Shea Moisture masks.  I have two;  raw shea butter and the 10 in 1 formula.  Both are truly astounding! My hair is long so dryness is always a problem and these masks work well even if you only leave them on for 5 minutes in the shower.  They work even better if you use them with a heat cap for 45 minutes or so.  They soak right in and banish any static or dryness and leave my hair very supple but strong. And from what I understand, neither the shampoo or conditioner contains silicone, which can weigh hair down. It baffles me that some reviewers have stated that the shampoo left their hair tangled and/or matted.  I certainly haven&#x27;t found this to be true, far from it.  After using the conditioner, any tangles are easily combed out. The masks have a bit more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; for those who have fine, easily tangled hair. All in all, my hair loves this shampoo and  I highly recommend it and the other great Shea Moisture products.o.

            <li> This product made my hair feel like it had a wax coating on it and made it look very oily. I don&#x27;t recommended it.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with many of the other negative reviewers, this shampoo may not be for you. I bought this with the conditioner and while I love the short, easy to read product list, I did not reap any of the benefits. I&#x27;m half Thai and I have long 1C hair, I rarely use heat styling tools and I use Moroccan oil daily. In short, my hair is in pretty great shape. It&#x27;s got body and it&#x27;s pretty thick. I don&#x27;t have to do much to it and it has the boho look I&#x27;m going for with plenty of volume to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Shea Moisture. I gave this stuff a whirl and immediately noticed it was incredibly difficult to rinse out. I used a very small amount after noticing that Coconut oil was one of the main ingredients and coconut oil has always been a booger for me to rinse out of my hair. Now--I rinsed and rinsed and then conditioned, but my hair still felt heavy, coated with residue and to top it all off, incredibly dry. The dry feeling continued and my hair started to break off in mass amounts. I washed a second time about 4 days later (I wash about once a week) and huge clumps of hair were coming out in the shower. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo to anyone with hair like mine. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take to repair the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note--my finace loves this stuff for his beard. He says its an awesome beard wash...so there&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who has type 3b curly hair.  It makes big, chunky, defined curls on her hair.  I like that it is all natural, but I don&#x27;t like that the smell (though natural and not unpleaseant) is very strong and lingers for days after she washes.  I will try this on my curly hair when my hair grows out.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo, I&#x27;m natural 4C type hair and this shampoo is so moisturizing and makes my hair feel so great before a deep conditioning. Doesn&#x27;t feel stripping at all. I love it and the smell is beyond. This product is well recommended by YouTube naturalistas. Give it a try and I am almost certain, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and used it all the time, until I realized that one of their main ingredients is \\&quot;sugar beets\\&quot;, of which 95% of them are GMO in the U.S. I contacted the company twice to ask whether or not their sugar beets are GMO&#x27;d and they did not respond. I can only assume it means it is a GMO ingredient in their product, especially since the sugar beets or (decyl glucoside) are not organic. Please do not purchase this product. They are not being honest and making people believe they are buying an all natural product, when in fact, that is as unnatural and chemical as you can get. If people keep buying into products that contain GMO&#x27;s, then GMO&#x27;s will continue to take over our food/ingredient supply. They are DANGEROUS!!</li>
            <li> Awful! So disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have finally found my shampoo. I have course and long dreadlocks and I have used several products in the past, both sulfate and sulfate/ residue free and the outcomes were never great-either the product worked well but was cost prohibited (carol&#x27;s daughter) and / made it worse (Wen shampoo). (Read the bottom).&lt;br /&gt;So I looked at what my sister used (she also has dreadlocks) and did some research.  I was happy to know that Shea Moisture hair products were natural and that did not contain any chemical agents. I purchased a bottle at Ricky&#x27;s for $10. (Read ANOTHER SIDE NOTE)&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner and I was hooked.  My hair was clean and it didn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue.  Yes I do admit that it does leave your hair (to some degree) &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;, but it so without compromising of it of its natural elasticity and moisture. My hair didn&#x27;t feel dry and it felt very soft. My only qualms with this product is that it doesn&#x27;t provide the luster and shine that it advertises. Nevertheless, I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I read some of the reviews after using the shampoo and I so surprised that for some, this product was a big disappointment.  However, it doesn&#x27;t mean the product doesn&#x27;t work.  For some, sulfate / residue free products are too harsh and my not provide them with the softness and shine they need. For some products that may contain sulfates and other chemicals may work. (It worked when I has relaxed hair) and that&#x27;s fine. No hair texture is created equal.  After using so many different products, the best advice I can give is examine your hair, examine its texture and style. If you&#x27;ve gone to a salon, what do they use, look at the ingredients.  Also examine your diet. If you&#x27;re not drinking enough water and have unhealthy eating habits, guess what...no product in world is going to make your hair any better then it is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE-Read the reviews on Wen before purchasing;  I used it only my hairand my locs started to become thin.  My hair has never been the same. I had to dread some of my locks together to prevent them from falling out. There are You-Tube videos of ladies using this product and their hair falling out. There is a class action suite against that started this July although I am not sure if the court proceedings have started. I feel customers should be well informed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANOTHER SIDE NOTE - If you purchased it from Amazon (even if you are a prime member), you been overcharged. If you go to Shea Moisture website, they also charge $10 for their products (minus the shipping and handling). Just go to your local Target, Ricky, Walgreens, etc.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst shampoo I have ever used in my entire life. It tangled my hair so badly that I literally had to pull out clumps of my hair to get the tangles out. They were not small clumps, either. My hair is very noticably shorter and thinner thanks to this horrid shampoo. I implore anyone to think twice before using this shampoo. You will probably regret it.</li>
            <li> I saw this at target one day and HAD to try it. I have naturally curly hair but I still haven&#x27;t found the shampoo for me. When I first used it, it had a very strong cheap perfume smell. It was bothersome, but the shampoo and conditioner worked really well for my hair so I figured I could just ignore it. After a small number of uses, once I used about 25% of the bottle, the smell completely changed. Instead of smelling like my grandmothers house on card night, it smelled like rancid, rotting leafy greens. My husband said it smelled like really bad onions. I cant even breathe through my nose if i want to continue using this product because it makes me want to throw up. The accompanying conditioner also seemed to follow this same pattern. I understand it&#x27;s a natural product - that is what attracted me to it in the first place - but I cannot fathom why a shampoo would ever smell like this. The most unfortunate part is that this formula actually works well for my hair, but I can no longer use it because of the smell.</li>
            <li> If you have dandruff or scalp eczema, stay away from this. I have a dry scalp and a tendency to itch. I bought this hoping it was going to moisturize and did not check out amazon reviews. This is so drying and caused a severe itch that left my scalp sore.</li>
            <li> It is truly moisturizing.  It is a great shampoo.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This instantly zapped moisture back into my straw-like, flat winter hair. It is pretty heavy stuff though and the perfumed scent will last you until the second coming of Moses. However, for a once or twice weekly deep conditioning shampooing, this does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have since stopped using this stuff. It caused my skin to break out like a 13 year old girl&#x27;s face. Oily, acne prone skin and shea butter seem to be a terrible combination. It&#x27;s a shame because I have yet to find another shampoo that moisturizes my hair like this one did!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just average. I have blonde hair that is thin, but I have a very very thick amount of it. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t clean and leave as silky soft as I thought it would. It leaves a nice texture on your hair when blowdried however which is nice.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about using this shampoo because of the mixed reviews i found online (not just on amazon). I&#x27;m glad i got it anyway! Its the best sulfate free shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used! It left my hair soft, clean, and shiny! I love it! I could even comb it after i washed it! im transitioning my hair from relaxed to not relaxed and its tough to find products that make my hair look and feel good. This, as well as the mask and leave in conditioner are fantastic! I would just caution everyone that less is more! I thought since this was sulfate free, that i needed to use more in my hair. Not the case!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative feedback i have about the product on amazon is the price. I purchased this from CVS for $9.99, which is far cheaper. I suppose $22 would make sense if i were purchasing multiple bottles, but one bottle for double the cost at the store is kinda unacceptable. The product itself is amazing but not the price (online!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2017&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying other products, including Carol&#x27;s Daughter, Organix, As I Am, Curl Junkie, and Jane Carter, I found that this shampoo is still the best one. One thing to note: the Neem oil does a VERY good job with adding strength to your hair...it&#x27;s almost too good. It sort of leaves a film on your hair and seems to not moisturize your hair. I&#x27;ve had less breakage, but my hairdresser has instructed me to cycle between this brand and another brand that will moisturize the hair.  While I still think the product deserves 5 stars, I would encourage you to use a shampoo that moisturizes your hair (Carol&#x27;s daughter seems to work VERY well on my hair).</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo I have ever tried. It left my hair feeling goopy instead of clean. It just felt like there was a waxy buildup and my hair was extremely coarse and tangled. It gave me dirty, greasy, tangly, frizzy, coarse, ugly hair. If you want nice soft hair, do NOT buy this goop! It is the color of mucous, so it is quite possible that&#x27;s exactly what it is. Kidding aside, this stuff is horrible.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to work. Buy I cannot believe that **anyone** can stand the smell. It smells just like super pungent old lady perfume- the kind of perfume that you can taste because its so so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is absolutely horrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but it turns out I am allergic to it. This shampoo is loaded with flowers. So when I used it to scrub my daughter&#x27;s head, I have been sneezing and sneezing ever since. I don&#x27;t have any severe allergies but some flowers make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> One I&#x27;ve got in CVS had totally different quality, this one makes my hair look bad.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised to see so many 5 star reviews. This shampoo did not agree with my hair at all. I used it in conjunction with the Shea moisture conditioner. I read some other reviews that made reference to their hair being left too &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;. That is exactly what happend to my hair. It felt like there was some sort of coating over my hair that made it difficult to pull a comb through. Also when I blow dried my hair it was full of static electricity. I don&#x27;t know how so many people could like this shampoo. I paid I think $11 for it too and I&#x27;m throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel dry after use. Feels soft even before using conditioner. Love it!</li>
            <li> Is it just me or did they just pour bubble bath in a bottle and call it shampoo? This stuff sucks, and it doesnt smell so good either. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Its not even moisturizing either.</li>
            <li> I like their hair masque as a leave-in conditioner and decided to try this on my super dry, flaky scalp and hair.  While this made the ends of my hair soft, shiny, and not frizz up at all, my scalp was in worse shape than before.  I will see how the product works on my 8 year old&#x27;s super thick hair, but I will be on the hunt for another shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other people I depend on countless reviews before I even think about buying a product online! I can honestly say as a black women this is the first shampoo I have ever used that has been great to my hair. Matter a fact, I use the whole line of Shea Moisture: shampoo, condition, deep treatment, and oil! The supermarket shampoo and conditioners that I use to buy because they were \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; would leave my hair dry and really painful to comb through and thats one thing I hated. With Shea Moisture after the first wash with a quarter sized amount my hair feels so soft as if I was using conditioner. This product cleans my hair but doesn&#x27;t strip the good oils and it leaves my hair soft with a slight butterscotch smell! I also believe that sticking to a certain product in your hair for a certain time will help it grow or show you what works or wont work. This is so worth the money! There is no beating this product so kudos to the creator of this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, the ONLY reason I am not giving this a five star is because of the ridiculous price! I always thought that online shopping was suppose to cheaper but the fact that these sellers are raising up the price probably due to not wanting to pay for shipping or just to make an extra profit is sad. This product sells at CVS, Walgreens, and Target for about 10 bucks a piece! 14-20 dollars is NOT right and NoT fair for one piece of the set!</li>
            <li> This shampoos is fabulous and a rare recommended healthy shampoo on EWG&#x27;s ratings!</li>
            <li> I just came off of 4 weeks &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; hair care...which means not using any commercial shampoos or conditioners, to ultimately give you amazingly shiny, wavy, frizz free, soft, detangled hair...Well, not for me. I read that perhaps my hair is too damaged by highlights...perhaps my newfound white hairs (I&#x27;m 37) are messing up my chemistry, but needless to say, my hair sucked. I tried bakings soda, vinegars, muds, egg yolks, raw honey, coconut oil, argan oil, avocado oil...you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go the &amp;#34;low-poo&amp;#34; route---sort of as an in between step before going back to my old simply sulfate-free ways. After weeks of heading to the shower with bowls full of mud, egg yolks mixed with avocado, jars of raw honey, whisks, newfangled combs, etc, I realize that I am not the type of person who will enjoy concocting my own homemade and highly perishable shampoo cocktails every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need someone to do that for me, package it up nicely and let me buy it. And perhaps give it a fragrance, I miss that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some research, I discovered a few shampoos that are basically all natural, mostly organic, low or no sudsing. Since this brand is locally available to me, I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HALLELUJAH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. It has a bit of suds to make me feel like I am cleaning my hair (even though I know suds dont mean a thing). It has lots of the great oils and ingredients I tried on no-poo and a nice fragrance (perhaps a bit too musky but I&#x27;ll deal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, shiny, and manageable...no more straw. And I feel good knowing I am cleaning it with no synthetic crap.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like about 12 perfume factories all mixed together.  I just couldn&#x27;t stand the odor and it didn&#x27;t go away with time.  I washed my hair sooner that usual just to get the smell out.  The ingredients list seems to feature a lot of natural sounding ingredients, but the fragrance is clearly artificial.  I have wavy hair and thought this shampoo would be good for it, but I can&#x27;t make an evaluation of its cleansing abilities after only one wash.  I have already returned it.</li>
            <li> I used other shampoos and when I did my hair would shed a lot.  When I used this shampoo my hair didn&#x27;t shed (and it was the first time ON MY NATURAL HAIR - 3 C type).  I had used this shampoo before when my hair was RELAXED and didn&#x27;t work too well (not at all ladies). Since I went natural I decided to try it AGAIN (take my chances) because every other shampoo I used that claim to have Shea butter shed my hair. My hair had grown out a lot and got thick since I stop using a relaxer. I cut my hair down to the nub and it grew at least 6 inches in a year but it was shedding from other shampoos that claim they have Shea butter. I didn&#x27;t want to lose what I grew so  I knew that this was a natural product so I used it AGAIN for the first time today on my NATURAL hair and it work VERY, VERY well. I recommend this product for natural hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really leaves my hair greasy and flat. I wanted to love this product, I love the smell, the down to earth ingredients but it really isn&#x27;t great. My hair feels sticky and dirty after a fresh wash even when I don&#x27;t put conditioner at the root and make sure to rinse. I really don&#x27;t recommend this product, way to expensive for little pay off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay I guess.  I feel like it left my hair lifeless and not as moisturized as I would like.  I actually bought something cheaper called Organix with acai berry.  It&#x27;s cheaper and smells so much better.  This stuff was just....okay.</li>
            <li> I struggled with dandruff for years, which I attribute to living in a desert climate. After trying one ineffective dandruff shampoo after another, I accidentally came across shea butter shampoo. After the second shower, the dandruff was gone and I have been using the product for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the shampoo no longer controls my dandruff, but that was never its intended purpose anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I found the same shampoo at Walgreens for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO! my hair is VERY picky when it comes to certain natural oils, and by using trial and error i discovered she adores Shea oil. So when i found out about this shampoo i had to buy it. and now i will NEVER use another shampoo! I have 4c hair, and my coils are very tight and dry. thanks to this wonderful product, i can reach and scrub my scalp super easily and when i rinse, my coils are soft, looser, and much more manageable. even if you dont know for sure that your hair likes Shea oil, i highly recommend you try this shampoo</li>
            <li> After reviewing unfavorable reviews of Wen shampoo on the internet I began my search for a product that would comply with those claims. This is that product. I use this shampoo line and I love my hair. Here is the most amazing and shocking thing since I switched to this product line I have to remind myself to clean my hairbrush now because my hair does not break off in the hairbrush when I brush it. I am totally amazed by that because even though some hair products make that claim they have never worked that way for me.</li>
            <li> Low foaming but highly effective without stripping your hair of essential oils. Very close to Wen products! I will definitely stay with the Shea Moisture line of products.</li>
            <li> I like this product and I use this one alternating with others.  After using this once, I conditioned with my ION conditioner.  My hair was so soft and there was no frizz, I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  Tried repeating the combination again but haven&#x27;t been able to duplicate the result.  :(  With my curly hair, I&#x27;m a true hair product junkie!  Always trying new things to find the perfect products for my hair!  Aren&#x27;t all curly haired people like me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love Amazon shopping with the convenience it offers and price savings through my Prime Membership!</li>
            <li> I have short hair with soft curls, but between coloring it monthly in middle age and texture changes that come with age (dryer, coarser greys), I&#x27;ve been dependent on leave in conditioners and fixatives in order for my hair to look as healthy and attractive as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, which I initially found in the Afro hair section of a Target, appealed to me initially because it&#x27;s organic, free of sulfates and parabens and also fair traded and the brand is charitable.  The ingredients are what made me try it, the rest is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the shiniest, softest and prettiest my hair has looked in years of frequent coloring, feels great, and all I do is sort of shake it out and let it dry.  Very good shine, no greasiness, but it does feel very moist after rinsing anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highest recommendation from me.</li>
            <li> I reverted to my natural hair about three years ago.  Having had my hair chemically treated for over 20 years there was a learning curve on how to work with my natural hair texture.  One part of that learning was finding the right combination of products for both my texture and my environment.  I have dry hair and live in a  hard water area.  I am forever trying to infuse moisture in my hair without making it feel greasy or tacky.  I have tried so many shampoos I can&#x27;t even begin to count them all.  I discovered this one after a friend said she&#x27;d had good results. From the moment I put it on my wet hair I felt an immediate difference.  Even with other sulfate free shampoos I have always felt my hair felt somewhat stripped.  So I tended to overcompensate with conditioner.  Not so here.  It just made my hair feel softer, more pliable and easier to manage.  For the first time I can remember I did not have to use a detangler.  After drying and styling,  my hair felt more in balance with necessary moisture.  I have finally!  found the shampoo that works for my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product (plus conditioner) at my local grocery store for $10.99 each bottle so that alone, I would bypass Amazon and head straight to the store! But the product itself? Amazing. I did not know this was marketed towards ethnic hair types until researching it the next day after use because it did such a phenomenal job! To be honest, I would have missed out on a great hair product given that label because my hair is your typical European hair and I wouldn&#x27;t have even thought to look. I am caucasian with fine hair (though a lot of it!), over-processed and shoulder length. In reality, if your hair is dry, brittle or you just prefer an all natural approach, this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind it won&#x27;t lather like typical hair shampoos since it is natural and sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for natural kinky hair and locs.</li>
            <li> Is it godo for african america hair?</li>
            <li> I have 2A type natural hair and I absolutely love this product and the conditioner pairing! I have been using both of these products for about 3 weeks and have noticed a great difference in the health and shine of my hair! My hair, which used to be dry and unhealthy looking, is now soft and full of shine. I would recommend this product to anyone with damaged hair...it has been a life saver!</li>
            <li> Not that this product needs anymore amazing reviews, but: I have extremely fine, pin straight hair that is very fragile and easily damaged. Having said that, after dying my hair for years at least once a month and perming my hair almost a year ago, my hair is completely fried and breaks constantly. For the past few months I have been an absolute product junkie; trying anything and everything that I could for my hair. With my hair being so fine, I have to wash it every day. Otherwise it looks like I dumped a puddle of grease atop my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this shampoo in my local Sally Beauty Supply store. It appealed to me originally because of the small amount of ingredients. No unnecessary chemicals. I have used this shampoo every day since purchasing! It has completely changed my hair. I use a very small amount every day in the shower and I haven&#x27;t used conditioner once since I&#x27;ve used it! I have never gone a day in my life without putting half a container full of conditioner on my head after shampooing! I am so pleased with the results. It has completely eliminated my frizz, made my hair extremely moisturized and soft and silky. It&#x27;s gotten so strong that the breakage is almost completely gone. Even the dead ends of my hair look better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re iffy about the price ($10.99 at Sally Beauty Supply), seriously, don&#x27;t fret. You will not regret it. I&#x27;m not sure how it will be for anyone else, but you won&#x27;t need to be spending extra money on conditioner, so this price is totally worth it! I&#x27;ve used it every day for about two months and I&#x27;m not even halfway through the bottle! Also, it smells amazing! It keeps my hair smelling good all day long. And it&#x27;s so shiny! I haven&#x27;t used anything else from this line, but this stuff is awesome! I will use this shampoo for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to Wen and it doesn&#x27;t even compare. Both have the same ingredients but Wen is just better. The consistency is very slimy/oily in comparison to Wen which is much more rich and creamy. In terms of performance Wen is still better. This shampoo left my hair with a greasy/waxy residue. Even when I ran my fingers through my hair my hands were left feeling waxy and my hair was just a tangled mess! It was frizzy and dirty looking and for some odd reason took longer to air dry. As for the smell, it&#x27;s very old lady like to me. Not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Wow!!! I have been extremely happy with this shampoo along with the conditioner. I suffer from extreme frizz due to the humidity in my city. Overall, an awesome product to have. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I chose it due to its excellent EWG rating. It lathers well and my hair feels very soft afterwards. The only problem is the smell. It has a very strong odor. So bad that I had to give it away. This is strange given that there are no parfums in it.</li>
            <li> This formula is great and it only contains around four ingredients! It made my hair really soft and maneageable. My hair gets pretty frizzy but this helped a lot! In fact, it completely changed the texture of my hair, amazing! I love the smell too because it really stays, which is great because I wash my hair every-other-day. Its concentrated and rich consistency makes is so that you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. I was worried I&#x27;d run out since the bottle is kind of small but I think it&#x27;s going to last me. Overall, really pleased! I only wish that it was priced a little more cheaply.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair frizzy, un-combable, oily and gunky all at the same time. My hair looks like a homeless person&#x27;s every time I try to give this product another chance. It smells beautifully, but it&#x27;s the absolute worst shampoo I have ever tried. It&#x27;s also $10 for a really small container and I have to use 1/4 cup of it for my only shoulder-length hair. It doesn&#x27;t react (foam or suds) at all really, it just needs to be smeared around the head, I guess. Sadly, I will have to use this as some sort of moisture-rich body wash because returning it is such a hassle. I really wanted to like this one but it just doesn&#x27;t work as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! My hair is relaxed. That means I definitely NEED moisture. This shampoo is wonderful. It almost feels like a conditioner. I can always feel an immediate difference when I rinse the product out of my hair. My hair LOVES this stuff. I cannot say enough good things about this Shampoo. So far, it&#x27;s my favorite hair product. I will purchase this over and over again. Not on Amazon though. Seriously, it&#x27;s $9.99 at Target/ Walmart/ Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Smells bad. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walmart instead of Amazon. I have used this about 3 times, and don&#x27;t understand what the rave is about?! I do like the fact that they don&#x27;t have ingredients such as parabens, etc. &amp; try to provide natural ingredients, but the shampoo does make your hair hard like it does have some form of sulfates in it. Actually, my clarifying shampoos don&#x27;t make my hair hard like this shampoo. The hair masque that goes with the shampoo doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel all that moisturized either. I just use it as a pre-poo, because I don&#x27;t  want to let the product go to waste under the cabinet. Anyway, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product line. I do appreciate what they are trying to do with healthy ingredients, but there are better natural hair lines out there that make your hair soft and makes it feel moisturized.</li>
