            <li>great product for your hair!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>These hair clips are great!  </li>
            <li>excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Best hair pins ever!</li>
            <li>The design of these hairpins make them the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Ladies, these are awesome.</li>
            <li>A great product for the price, and they hold well.&lt;br /&gt;A must have for your hair stash for a variety of styles at any length!.</li>
            <li>They are of excellent quality; I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>These are great hair pins.</li>
            <li>and they worked great.  </li>
            <li>I was happy I didn&#x27;t pay the prices listed here</li>
            <li>Awesome product :)</li>
            <li>so I looked for them on Amazone and was so glad that I found them - they work perfect for me when doing my hair...</li>
            <li>so I put another one in just for good measure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need as many!</li>
            <li>If you have a LOT of hair, as I do, these are an amazing addition to your tool box.</li>
            <li>The pins work, look nice and serve their purpose.  </li>
            <li>They do not hold fine hair at all!</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable to wear all day and they do not pull the hair.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to remove with fingers, but will not slip out on their own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are fantastic pins!  </li>
            <li>Love these...use them every day...</li>
            <li>and so many more</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to put a bun in with just one pin, I wanted to ensure it would stay</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I LOVED them and was very excited to find these (much cheaper at sallys beauty supply!).</li>
            <li>These are perfect for securing a messy bun or any kind of updo.</li>
            <li>Go lightly go across top grabbing top layer of hair.</li>
            <li>These hairpins are good and work well, but I frankly much prefer the metal ones - the metal ones are easier for my fingers to maneuver and stay in better than the plastic ones.</li>
            <li>On top of that, they are comfortable, and don&#x27;t dig into my scalp or leave me with any soreness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very fine plastic but have no sharp edges which was good.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length fine hair and these hairpins just fall out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these to secure some chignons and updos.</li>
            <li>With these hairpins, I don&#x27;t need hairspray at all, which keeps my hair feeling soft and nice.    </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t think I need to explain a whole lot more about that.)</li>
            <li>Will admit the price was great compared to other places I shopped.</li>
            <li>I will continue using these until I lose them all - being clear is very easy to lose.</li>
            <li>all I am very surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>some of these and my old ones look much better.</li>
            <li>The pins are very nice, couldn&#x27;t really say I loved them that would be silly.  </li>
            <li>These are hard to find and I was happy to see them here.</li>
            <li>They held pretty well until they broke..........</li>
            <li>They work well the first 1-3 times, but not after that.</li>
            <li>My second order, I just love them and they hold well.  </li>
            <li>They are great for holding thick hair in place.  </li>
            <li>Really are magic and stay in place - but you can rest back on a pillow they are so flush to the scalp</li>
            <li>Product good but a little to big for my hair which is baby fine.</li>
            <li>Large, ineffective, JUNK</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I bought similar ones before and they were fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They really do hold.</li>
            <li>I finally gave up and now use metal bobby pins which I securely tuck into the hair bun.</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>no matter how much you got.</li>
            <li>I really like these hairpins.  </li>
            <li>You only get 10 in a package, but that would be plenty for most people, unless you just have SUPER long or thick hair or a very elaborate hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I wear my long hair pulled up a lot, and these do the trick, without pulling on my scalp or hurting, yet, they have fantastic hold.</li>
            <li>I love these so much, and hate losing them, although they stay in pretty good.</li>
            <li>love these to do a quick french twist/roll that stays all day even on thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got thin/fine hair and not every clip will stay in; however, this particular product stays in and does not snag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Ordinary large hairpins work much better.</li>
            <li>Even though they are clear, they seem to be very noticable in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I use them for multiple types of hairstyles, and so far I have been able to reuse them without them bending beyond repair.</li>
            <li>Get them only if you have really big hair because these pins are HUGE.</li>
            <li>These magic little things stay put!  </li>
            <li>Works fine for a messy look.</li>
            <li>These lose their shape quickly and they have a sharp plastic barb protruding from one side which damages my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The clear plastic for me is gray because I change my hair color all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clear clips for lighter hair &amp; brown clips for darker.</li>
            <li>I have short hair, the pins stay in, but stick out too much.</li>
            <li>In fact you have to really pull them to get them back out again.  </li>
            <li>If you do not have a Sally Beauty Supply near you, which also carries them, this is the place to find them.  </li>
            <li>They seem expensive compared to bobby pins, but they work so much better that they&#x27;re well worth the price.    </li>
            <li>I have some of my old ones left (theyre well over a year old) and</li>
            <li>I used plastic picks back when I was young</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be returning to use these plastic hairpins since these barely held my hair in place.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair, and these hold better than bobby pins</li>
            <li>They are versatile and work nicely with any hair type, from thin and straight to thick and curly.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at how well these plastic pins will hold my hair up in a buns and not get loose.  </li>
            <li>Due to my job, I cannot use metal hairpins so I usually use rubber band to secure ends into the bun</li>

            <li> Due to my job, I cannot use metal hairpins so I usually use rubber band to secure ends into the bun</li>
            <li> It seems impossible that such a simple looking little pin would do such a great job of keeping hair where it belongs, all day and all night.</li>
            <li> They are super flimsy weak plastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using the same few pins from my package for about six months, and there is no sign of wear and tear or of bending/loosening of these; they appear brand new and are still working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have thick, full, slightly curly mid back length hair).</li>
            <li> They only have one drawback:  theft by other long-haired family members, such as daughters or sisters.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not that thick, but it is long, past my waist, and fine.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get a bun in my long hair for some time.</li>
            <li> The loop at the end traps the hair and the curved plastic on the inner side of the two points make the pin much less likely to move.  </li>
            <li> &quot; long and 1&#x27; wide.  </li>
            <li> The transparency makes them much less noticeable, especially on lighter hair colors.  </li>
            <li> they do not grip tight enough.  </li>
            <li> alot of them break with minimal tension</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though they look the same, these are not rigid enough and stretch almost instantly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s difficult to hide the large circular end of the pins.  </li>
            <li> The current price that these are selling for is about twice what I paid for them at my local Sally&#x27;s store, so definitely be wary of the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The purpose of buying these hairpins we for them to be LESS damaging to the hair</li>
            <li> Or they fall half way out</li>
            <li> I purchased these for half the price listed here on another website.  </li>
            <li> I get headaches from too tight a bun or pony tail.</li>
            <li> I only had these one month before every one of them was broken.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Total waste of space, useless product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened</li>
            <li> Sadly these were not the same.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your hair firmly in place and being transparent, they are invisible!</li>
            <li> They are small at about 2-3\\</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I do not have thick hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is something wrong with how I use these or not, but they do not stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> once you reach other side of roll, reverse direction and bury into base of roll.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in these hairpins.  </li>
            <li> These are crap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate these.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>

            <li> The current price that these are selling for is about twice what I paid for them at my local Sally&#x27;s store, so definitely be wary of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are fantastic pins!  I have the brown ones, and they work to hold buns and twists in place all day.  On top of that, they are comfortable, and don&#x27;t dig into my scalp or leave me with any soreness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using the same few pins from my package for about six months, and there is no sign of wear and tear or of bending/loosening of these; they appear brand new and are still working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product for your hair!</li>
            <li> These are great hair pins. My hair is not that thick, but it is long, past my waist, and fine. These pins hold my hair, usually only need 3 for a regular bun, they don&#x27;t pull my hair out when I take them out, and my hair doesn&#x27;t sag or pull like it will do w/bobby pins. You only get 10 in a package, but that would be plenty for most people, unless you just have SUPER long or thick hair or a very elaborate hairstyle. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is something wrong with how I use these or not, but they do not stay in my hair. I have tried various ways of putting them in but they won&#x27;t stay put.   (I have thick, full, slightly curly mid back length hair).</li>
            <li> I have short hair, the pins stay in, but stick out too much. Works fine for a messy look. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Product good but a little to big for my hair which is baby fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these to secure some chignons and updos. I&#x27;ve got thin/fine hair and not every clip will stay in; however, this particular product stays in and does not snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an extra package just to have on hand, as I cannot find these in my local health and beauty aide stores.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed in these hairpins.  I bought similar ones before and they were fantastic.  These lose their shape quickly and they have a sharp plastic barb protruding from one side which damages my hair.  The purpose of buying these hairpins we for them to be LESS damaging to the hair and they are not delivering on that.  I believe it is the same brand I purchased years ago, but perhaps they went to a cheaper process to produce?  I&#x27;m not sure what happened but these are not quality damage-free hair clips.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so maybe that was the problem.  I used plastic picks back when I was young and they worked great.  Sadly these were not the same.  I gave them to my daughter who has thinner hair.  She hasn&#x27;t reported back as to if they work for her or not.</li>
            <li> Love these...use them every day...they are &amp;#34;very kind&amp;#34; to my hair and head.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find and I was happy to see them here. These are perfect for securing a messy bun or any kind of updo. They really do hold.</li>
            <li> It seems impossible that such a simple looking little pin would do such a great job of keeping hair where it belongs, all day and all night. I put my baby-fine hair in a french twist, a style which is notorious for falling out unless you add pounds of hairspray.  With these hairpins, I don&#x27;t need hairspray at all, which keeps my hair feeling soft and nice.    Even though I have blonde hair, I use the tortoise shell hairpins, because they hide inside a bun or twist so well.  They never seem to break, and don&#x27;t come out until I remove it at night.  Even in rain, wind or humidity, these hairpins just don&#x27;t let go. They seem expensive compared to bobby pins, but they work so much better that they&#x27;re well worth the price.    They only have one drawback:  theft by other long-haired family members, such as daughters or sisters.  (I don&#x27;t think I need to explain a whole lot more about that.) I suggest you buy an extra package and hide it for later.</li>
            <li> Bobby pins never stick in my hair.  Or they fall half way out and I&#x27;m constantly pressing them back in.  These magic little things stay put!  In fact you have to really pull them to get them back out again.  They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> These hair clips are great!  I have been trying to get a bun in my long hair for some time. I get headaches from too tight a bun or pony tail. I&#x27;ve tried regular hair pins as well as Bobby pins and socks and so many more things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to put a bun in with just one pin, I wanted to ensure it would stay so I put another one in just for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear plastic for me is gray because I change my hair color all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am very surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Keeps your hair firmly in place and being transparent, they are invisible!</li>
            <li> I bought these to use hairpins keeping my bun in tact. Due to my job, I cannot use metal hairpins so I usually use rubber band to secure ends into the bun but I do not like the look of bands around my bun. I&#x27;ve tried these hairpins but these slide out of bun and I noticed these bend after a while. I will continue using these until I lose them all - being clear is very easy to lose. UPDATE: I finally gave up and now use metal bobby pins which I securely tuck into the hair bun. I don&#x27;t think I will be returning to use these plastic hairpins since these barely held my hair in place.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> they do not grip tight enough.  They fall out of my hair and do not hold my hair when I  put it up.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I had found a solution, but no luck. I have medium length fine hair and these hairpins just fall out. Guess I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how well these plastic pins will hold my hair up in a buns and not get loose.  Love them.</li>
            <li> These hair pins have no equal. I wear my long hair pulled up a lot, and these do the trick, without pulling on my scalp or hurting, yet, they have fantastic hold. They are ingenius design. I love these so much, and hate losing them, although they stay in pretty good. I highly recommend them. In fact, I&#x27;m about to reorder them.</li>
            <li> I thought these clips would help me fasten my hair into a chignon, but they didn&#x27;t work.  Ordinary large hairpins work much better.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for half the price listed here on another website.  They are small at about 2-3\\&quot; long and 1&#x27; wide.  They are very fine plastic but have no sharp edges which was good.  I also got the tortoise color which I like. They held pretty well until they broke.......... I only had these one month before every one of them was broken.  They would literally break into pieces while they were in my hair.  I do not have thick hair...at all.  I was happy I didn&#x27;t pay the prices listed here and I wont buy them again.</li>
            <li> They snap in a heartbeat, and then you have to find the sharp-edged scraps and fish them out of your hair, bathmat and so forth.  Total waste of space, useless product.</li>
            <li> love these to do a quick french twist/roll that stays all day even on thin, fine hair. After twisting &amp; tucking &amp; rolling hair, take one of these &amp; start on 1 side of roll. Go lightly go across top grabbing top layer of hair. once you reach other side of roll, reverse direction and bury into base of roll. Won&#x27;t budge all day &amp; can&#x27;t see clips. clear clips for lighter hair &amp; brown clips for darker.</li>
            <li> I found these while searching for the holy grail of hair pins...pins i used to use constantly and are now nonexistant. They looked JUST like this but were either goody or scunci brand. I LOVED them and was very excited to find these (much cheaper at sallys beauty supply!). Unfortunately, though they look the same, these are not rigid enough and stretch almost instantly. They work well the first 1-3 times, but not after that. I have some of my old ones left (theyre well over a year old) and some of these and my old ones look much better. Only buy these if you plan on wearing them once!! I&#x27;ll keep looking</li>
            <li> Best hair pins ever! I have long, thick hair, and these hold better than bobby pins and you don&#x27;t need as many! Awesome product :)</li>
            <li> Way over priced! I think this was an impulse buy. Get them only if you have really big hair because these pins are HUGE. But still you only get 10.</li>
            <li> The pins are very nice, couldn&#x27;t really say I loved them that would be silly.  The pins work, look nice and serve their purpose.  Will admit the price was great compared to other places I shopped.</li>
            <li> These hairpins are good and work well, but I frankly much prefer the metal ones - the metal ones are easier for my fingers to maneuver and stay in better than the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE. WASTE OF MONEY. Does absolutely nothing. Does not hold hair in place. Large, ineffective, JUNK</li>
            <li> alot of them break with minimal tension</li>
            <li> My second order, I just love them and they hold well.  I like the fact that they&lt;br /&gt;are colorless and just blend in so well.</li>
            <li> These are crap. They are super flimsy weak plastic.</li>
            <li> Absolutely hate these. I use Bobby pins and wanted to switch to plastic. Does not stAy in your hair no matter how much you got. They went in the trash this morning</li>
            <li> The design of these hairpins make them the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  The loop at the end traps the hair and the curved plastic on the inner side of the two points make the pin much less likely to move.  They are very comfortable to wear all day and they do not pull the hair.  The transparency makes them much less noticeable, especially on lighter hair colors.  They are versatile and work nicely with any hair type, from thin and straight to thick and curly.  They work well with hair extensions, also.  They are easy to remove with fingers, but will not slip out on their own.  If you do not have a Sally Beauty Supply near you, which also carries them, this is the place to find them.  They also arrived in a timely manner.  They are of excellent quality; I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I really like these hairpins.  They are great for holding thick hair in place.  My only complaint would be that it&#x27;s difficult to hide the large circular end of the pins.  Even though they are clear, they seem to be very noticable in my hair.  I will probably order the darker color to see if that helps at all.  Overall, I use them for multiple types of hairstyles, and so far I have been able to reuse them without them bending beyond repair.</li>
            <li> Ladies, these are awesome. The learning curve is removing them -- remember that they are curved! If you have a LOT of hair, as I do, these are an amazing addition to your tool box.</li>
            <li> A great product for the price, and they hold well.&lt;br /&gt;A must have for your hair stash for a variety of styles at any length!.</li>
            <li> I bought these to hold buns in my daughter&#x27;s hair for dance competitions.  They do not hold fine hair at all!</li>
            <li> Really are magic and stay in place - but you can rest back on a pillow they are so flush to the scalp</li>
            <li> Had been looking for these in Wallgreens and CVS where I used to get them - but not anymore so I looked for them on Amazone and was so glad that I found them - they work perfect for me when doing my hair...</li>
