            <li>I was so excited to get this product.....</li>
            <li>Not too foamy, and a great after feel, no residue or drag.  </li>
            <li>but as soon as I started using it.my face got really dry..not sure if it is because of the face wash or the anti aging cream...</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I have used it about one month, twice daily, and I love it.  </li>

            <li>super, low suds, non-stripping cleanser.</li>
            <li>it has a funky smell unlike the exact same product I got directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was really old???</li>
            <li>I finally have found a product that makes my skin soft and refreshed.</li>

            <li> Not good for winter as it tends to dry up the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 years old and have used many expenisve products to stay looking young.  The Lifecell product is the best I have ever used.  I don&#x27;t have dead skin on my face that many older people can get from age along with flakes from dry and dead skin.  After using LifeCell Facial Wash even my nose shines and my skin looks young and healthy</li>
            <li> I love this product! I finally have found a product that makes my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, thank you so much!</li>
            <li> There is a big hyper surrounding the LifeCell products.  Frankly, I found the cleanser to be just a normal, average cleanser.  Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received the product as expected.  I have used it about one month, twice daily, and I love it.  I paired it with the LifeCell lotion and I can see a noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> Works great with my sonic facial brush! Not too foamy, and a great after feel, no residue or drag.  Purchased this as a companion to my Lifecell anti-aging cream.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel very good</li>
            <li> I can see it&#x27;s starting to work.</li>
            <li> If you buy anything from LifeCell, they will repeatedly charge your credit card hundreds of dollars.  DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS LIFECELL.</li>
            <li> it has a funky smell unlike the exact same product I got directly from the manufacturer. Perhaps it was really old???</li>
            <li> Just a coverup product. Does not SOLVE the problem</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product.....but as soon as I started using it.my face got really dry..not sure if it is because of the face wash or the anti aging cream...but I am not sure if this product is for me.</li>
            <li> Really amazing results.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted it and she loved it.  It was exactly what she ordered at a fraction of the price that she found anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Life cell anti-aging PHis a wonderful product. It cleans the face without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> oh what a treat! super, low suds, non-stripping cleanser. combined with the other product, you can throw all the others away. except for nutrimetics, that is truly the best.</li>
