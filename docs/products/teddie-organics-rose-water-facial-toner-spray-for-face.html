            <li>My first bottle of Rose water from this company was delightful.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is the best deal I&#x27;ve found for trying out rose water here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and leaves my face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>has a very nice scent not to strong</li>
            <li>This product is really amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I do this once a week and my skin looks amazing</li>
            <li>But on the bright side I love it and use it 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I recieved my bottle of rose water about a week ago, its a wonderful toner, tightens skin instantly and smells great.</li>
            <li>This spray smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I just got this rose water 2 days ago</li>
            <li>I received my Teddie&#x27;s Rose Water as ordered, on time and in a sealed bottle.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled at the quickness in response</li>
            <li>This rose water helps to maintain your skins PH Balance and soothes redness and irritation.</li>
            <li>How did I make it almost 40 years through life never having tried Rose Water before?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will never be without this Rose Water again.</li>
            <li>Nicely scented.</li>
            <li>TEDDIE ORGRNICS ROSE WATER is excellant!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray is also a good mist for refreshing my makeup during the day.</li>
            <li>the pump spray works nicely.</li>
            <li>I needed a good toner one tha wasn&#x27;t not harsh and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I like that it is 100% organic rose water.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>This Rose water from Teddie Organics is all organic and USA certified.</li>
            <li>I keep my rose water in the fridge and spray it on my face after cleansing my face in the morning.</li>
            <li>but it feels nice when I spray it on.</li>

            <li>Such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I love this rosewater.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and feels nice.</li>
            <li>I also use the hydrosol at night before I slather on my oils (serum/moisturizer) -- I do feel it helps my skin absorb my oils better.  </li>
            <li>But, I admit I go spray-crazy jst because I just love the aroma of Rosa damascena.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  </li>
            <li>I love roses and anything</li>
            <li>First this smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Love this toner.</li>
            <li>I love that it is 100% organic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to give it more time.</li>

            <li>I chose Teddie Organics Rose Water mainly because of the good reviews and of the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>Rose water is flavourful and the the process of distillation it went through says all about its rich effervescence.</li>
            <li>So far, I am loving this rose water!</li>
            <li>It has an amazing scent and leaves my skin super nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Price?&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my previous rose water, this is a great price since it is ORGANIC!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good quantity</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice the smell of roses, to me it honestly kind of smelled like marijuana!</li>
            <li>the smell is truly rose and it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent is so pleasant and gently dissipates.</li>
            <li>Good for every kind of skin, even the sensitive one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is similar to the Moroccan rose water I had, but this one is more pleasant.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my face &amp; chest with the clean fresh smell of roses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, slightly moisturizing and best of all no breakouts!</li>
            <li>The smell is light and lovely.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent and refreshing application is has given my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, natural addition to my skincare routine.</li>

            <li>The scent is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it take my skin feel .</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>Before Teddie Organics Rose Water, I was using a different brand of rose water, which was Moroccan rose water and was NOT organic (I will not mention the name of the brand).</li>
            <li>I decided to try this item because I got a nice discount coupon, and I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gives a nice even mist in one pump and the scent of fresh cut roses</li>
            <li>Strong large good quality spritzer.</li>
            <li>The rose smell is just the right potency, not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Very nice natural scent.</li>
            <li>Amazing, pure quality product!  </li>
            <li>I would give more stars for the overall great product.</li>
            <li>order arrived very quickly and well wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;i will definately order again from TEDDIE and recommend them to family &amp; friends!&lt;br /&gt;deborah</li>
            <li>After I use this product my face isn&#x27;t dry or oily and more, it absorbs it and makes my face look great and healthy.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a spray which makes it so easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>The bottle allows for a gentle mist of the most fragrant rose petals.</li>
            <li>hopefully the smell won&#x27;t be as strong.</li>
            <li>Loving this so far, it&#x27;s light and hydrating and of course I love the smell!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using rose water spray.</li>
            <li>I am in full love with this product.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Rose water</li>
            <li>However thus far Teddie organics Rose Water is the best for numerous reasons.</li>
            <li>It is cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It smells beautiful, and leaves my face fresh and soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spray is a fine mist and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The nozzle sprays a fine mist (hold it about six inches away from your face).</li>
            <li>and I use it as a toner after washing my faceâ€¦or as a quick refreshing mist whenever.</li>
            <li>I was quick in ordering more.</li>
            <li>It helps with the tight skin feeling on my face, and the smell is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the product because I wanted organic, pure rose water to treat rosacea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much for strong fragrances, and this is perfect, smells nice and natural.</li>
            <li>It is pure rose water and it comes at a fantastic price, compared to the &amp;#34;big brand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this particular brand of rosewater!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth as a baby!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, instantly saw results! !</li>
            <li>This rose water has helped my hair and scalp so much.</li>
            <li>But as of now, I really like this rose water.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know too much about fancy creams and potions, but I know that rose water has been used for centuries (millennia?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has the relaxing effect I been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Not as much as a cup of rose tea but its effective.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>but I also spritz myself with it as a light perfume.</li>
            <li>Perfectly light and fragrant.  </li>
            <li>I really like this rose water, I use it to refresh my face through out the day.</li>
            <li>,and the wonderful thing it&#x27;s a spray bottle..more reason not to waste ..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not overbearing, But has a light airy scent.</li>
            <li>Aside from the smell, I do enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>I use it to set my makeup by lightly spritzing the product over my face.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to fly out next week and use this in the cabin to stay hydrated.  </li>

            <li>Original review:</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>100% organic, which is great because you aren&#x27;t putting any strange chemicals on your face.</li>
            <li>The company has been so gracious reaching out to make sure everything has been shipped properly, and that I&#x27;m enjoying the product!</li>
            <li>so I was excited that I was given the opportunity to receive this product during the promotional period to test for quality.  </li>
            <li>I take it on long flights-its great for the trips.</li>
            <li>I was excited to order this during a product promotion.  </li>
            <li>I consider my skin to be in the sensitive category and have been very satisfied with Teddie Organics.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing and works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited to be able to purchase this facial toner of Organic Rose water at a promotion.</li>
            <li>just saw how many exclamation points that I have used for far in this review, can you tell I love</li>
            <li>I notice that when I wake up the next day after using the rose water, my skin looks brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li>I use it before applying makeup and as a setting spray afterward and not only does it make my makeup look flawless and natural, it softens my skin as well.  </li>
            <li>I saw in a post where a friend of my friend told her to use the rose water from the same company to get her skin to look even better.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful facial toner that I recommend if you like natural products.  </li>
            <li>I was lookin for a natural and organic toner for face (alcohol free), so decided to try this rose water.</li>
            <li>In the short time I have been using  the Teddy Organics rose water my skin feels more hydrated and toned.</li>
            <li>Really nice and refreshing facial mist.</li>
            <li>The toner leaves our skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>Not only is it refreshing, I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone and it has a nice scent, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I use this as a toner after I clean my face in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to get away from using my Acne-specific toner with the Rose Water Facial Toner, and no cystic acne has occurred</li>
            <li>I use it as a toner and as a spray between light layers of primer, makeup, and powder, which leads to a finish so natural, it&#x27;s like your own skin but perfected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m usually not to keep on florally scented things either, but this rose water is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The owners are so friendly and very prompt on questions and the email response was phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>did some research and decided to give Bulgarian rose water a try instead, not expecting much in light of my previous experience with rose water.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural mild rose scent.  </li>
            <li>It really soften skin and leaves with beautiful aroma of roses, it is not too strong smell at all just a pinch of roses and goes away after air dry.</li>
            <li>, you have a new loyal customer! :)</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>+.. no artificial smell and perfectly light on my skin</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic because I am very picky about the products I use.  </li>
            <li>Teddie Organics was very communicative to ensure I received product and was satisfied with it as well.</li>
            <li>Plus the fragrance from the natural rose is calming to the senses.</li>
            <li>it smells ok, but I cannot say you feel like you smell the real roses.</li>
            <li>Very cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Smells excellent and I like the emails explaining common uses for it</li>
            <li>Not a bad price either</li>
            <li>And, being a guy, my skin is even more sensitive to most things on days that I shave (not just right after, but for hours after shaving).</li>
            <li>Very clean and pure.  </li>
            <li>I love it so far, easy to use</li>
            <li>Super glad it was in a spray bottle, makes it much easier to use instead of putting it on a cotton ball or pad.</li>
            <li>This one smells SO amazing and sweet and the bottle sprays such a fine mist</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly without issue</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and Teddie Organics is a family run business so they communicate with their customers by following up on your order and make sure you&#x27;re satisfied with everything</li>
            <li>I have not experienced dryness or film over my skin, plus, the light fragrance is wonderful!</li>
            <li>product arrived quickly and  Teddie Organics was a pleasure.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell wonderful, it has definitely cleared my skin up.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice pick-me-up and a nice toner that&#x27;s not too harsh.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, packaged well</li>
            <li>I use it as toner and also soak paper mask with it for a quick calming mask.</li>
            <li>I also used it during the day for a quick pick me up.</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is just enough moisture for my oily/combo skin that I don&#x27;t need to use extra moisturizer in the AM, and my BB cream stays perfect with no flakey or oily spots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend for people who prefer natural and gentle product on their skin.its non- greasy unlike otherchemical toners but not dry too.its really refreshing ,lifting up the mood awesome!!!</li>
            <li>I have been looking to get products that would enhance my face as I am getting older and my skin is not as tight and flawless as it once was...</li>
            <li>I was curious to see indigridients and amazed it&#x27;s just distilled rose water!</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve tried almost every type of hydrating mist and facial out there, including popular brands carried by Sephora, but none come close to the natural feeling and effectiveness of Teddie Organics Rose Water.</li>
            <li>overall pleased but probably won&#x27;t be buying this (or really any rose water) again.</li>
            <li>I like this product for its clean, refreshing sensation, leaving my skin appearing toned and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>have been using many new, organic  products on my skin and my kids; now that they are of age where skin cleaning truly matters, I have been using these products alongside my tweenage daughter.</li>
            <li>This product feels amazing on your skin, it makes my face and neck feel clean and clear ready for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>From the first day I used this rose water, I noticed how soft and moisturized my hair felt.</li>
            <li>but I normally get greedy to apply more as the fragrance of fresh roses is so soothing..</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely; not too strong but much better smelling than typical toners laden with alcohol.</li>
            <li>Another plus is the genuinely thoughtful owners of Teddie - amazing customer service and they are passionate about their products.</li>
            <li>I want to feel refreshed and have healthy looking skin without smelling like a old ladies closet!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order some more soon!</li>
            <li>I love when natural products are the ones that work!</li>
            <li>I love the natural fragrance!</li>
            <li>refresh in a very hot day  because it feels pretty cool in the skin</li>
            <li>DEAL, first of all, it arrived super quick.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, obviously.</li>
            <li>Second, the company is amazing.</li>
            <li>The quality of the spray is fantastic, once you spray, it evenly spreads to your whole face.</li>
            <li>But overall expectations is ok, not what I expected reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I love the way my face felt immediately after, just refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>Rose scent has such a calming effect too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>spraying Rose Water is a definite pick me up and stress reliever.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice pick me up when I need cooling down!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>rose water works quite well with my current products.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would irritate it, but it hasn&#x27;t at all.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use Rose water as toner.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the product so far.</li>
            <li>Truly as if you&#x27;re standing in the middle of a rose garden.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really refreshing and soft.</li>
            <li>It is not a artificial scent by any means which adds to it&#x27;s presence.</li>
            <li>and I must say that feel of the rose water is back..</li>
            <li>I love the results so far</li>
            <li>Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; moderately visible pores on cheek area near nose.</li>
            <li>I will be buying Teddie Organics Rose Water until my final days!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it</li>
            <li>Defenitly worth the price</li>

            <li>This rose water has helped my issues immensely.</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh cut roses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not an artificial perfumey scent by any means.</li>
            <li>I started using the rose water as soon as it came in the mail last week.</li>
            <li>The only ingredient is rose water.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel reinvigorated and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Well an offer was extended to me to finally try this rose water.</li>

            <li>It is somewhat sticky when first applied but the sticky feeling quickly goes away leaving my face refreshed.</li>
            <li>Therefore I expected it to be a product that, although may be effective, would look pretty cheap..</li>
            <li>I hope I spelled that right, anyhow I thought something has got to work</li>
            <li>Priced just right, I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
            <li>I use it before I go to bed and right after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Dries/absorbs right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Used it only once, so can&#x27;t tell much about toning effect, but overall happy with this rose water  so far.</li>

            <li>This is my first time using teddie organic product.</li>
            <li>Feels wonderful on your tired skin!</li>
            <li>Also, I like supporting family-run businesses.</li>
            <li>Thanks for creating this product!</li>
            <li>The first bottle I received came frozen and the glass was shattered.</li>
            <li>I love using this before putting makeup on to help add some extra moisture to my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks Teddie Organics!</li>
            <li>The smell is quite delicate and non-invasive and I&#x27;m quite happy to have found this.</li>
            <li>The first impression of the product:  </li>
            <li>My first product with this company</li>
            <li>I also use it after a hot yoga class.  </li>
            <li>I do love urban decay b6</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>The scent comes from real roses, not artificial</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really heard of rose water</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying this product.)</li>
            <li>Most recently, it has turned into acne rosacea.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that after only using one day the redness decrease by about 40%.</li>
            <li>Thank You soooo so much!</li>
            <li>It is a lovely sensory experience, but not at all necessary.</li>
            <li>the fine mist spritzer dispenses the product so evenly -- better than my other hydrosols/toner with similar fine mist spritzer.</li>
            <li>Rose water is known for fighting acne, healing scars, cuts, and other skin issues.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t break me out like other popular brands sold here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only been using it for 3 days, but seems to work good since my skin usually sensitive to new products.</li>
            <li>Now I only wish they could get into Whole Foods :)</li>
            <li>After lots of research, I came up with a routine of all natural products, obviously including this rose water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched all my makeup to more organic and natural products now that I know that whatever you put on your skin goes directly into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li>The only ingredient here is rose water - 100% organic and natural.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a staple for me; Will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, in fact, this is my first one!</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and recently been looking around for certified organic products on Amazon to help my skin feel better and look better........</li>
            <li>I do believe if I keep using this, my results will remain positive.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very refreshing without being too heavy</li>
            <li>Wish it came in a bigger bottle, but other than it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and cool after using.</li>
            <li>It made my skin super soft after just one use of me spraying it onto a cotton ball and applying it that way.</li>
            <li>It works well to set make-up, freshen skin after cleansing and it makes your hair super soft and helps to reduce frizzing.</li>
            <li>Has a slight rose scent.</li>
            <li>The rose smell goes away after a few min, it was a bit over powering at first.</li>
            <li>it was strong similar to a perfume.</li>
            <li>I will certainly  look at Teddies</li>
            <li>Not suitable for the face, but good for spraying just for the scent</li>
            <li>The bottles smell fine when you open them and sniff the bottle, but spraying it on for some reason brings out a rancid/sour smell.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that growing older is for the birds!</li>
            <li>The main thing I like about this product is that it is certified organic and it comes with no additives!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days but it smells great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan and would recommend this to anyone who works in an office and would appreciate a daily pick-me-up!</li>
            <li>It feels very silky on my skin and nourishing.</li>
            <li>If you care about what you put on your skin, I would highly recommend Teddie products!</li>
            <li>I have very temperamental skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>you make sure everything is as expected and take care of you if it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Being very prone to anxiety and stress</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived really fast too.</li>
            <li>It has a gentle smell that doesn&#x27;t bother my nose.</li>
            <li>and it feels really calming on my face.</li>
            <li>This comes in a spray bottle so you can either wet a cotton ball and wipe your face, or indulge in a refreshing spritz before your moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li>I really like the Teddie Organic product like and will continue to use their products.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyes burn and very read.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.</li>
            <li>A girly treat for my whole body.</li>
            <li>It really helps tightening my pores and improving my breakouts a lot.</li>
            <li>I find myself needing to spray 3-4 times just to cover my whole face</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>and it just makes my skin really dewy.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
            <li>My skin feels very balanced and is much clearer after using this product.</li>
            <li>This has really helped balance my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>really like this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
            <li>It sprays allover you face instead of in one spot or in drops, it is really a mist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it&lt;</li>
            <li>REALLY SOFTENS THE SKIN...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I found this to be very cooling on the skin..</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>My husband really enjoys it sprayed on his pillow after stressful days.</li>
            <li>I think this spray method work really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this that much</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>My skin has a glow after I spray this on and feels very hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It has only been a week since I started using the rose water, so my opinion of it might change in the future.</li>
            <li>I work in an office with harsh climate control/air conditioning, so this rose water has been a life saver.</li>
            <li>Anywho, I really have enjoyed using this, but I can&#x27;t really say that I see a big wow factor.</li>
            <li>I was told to try rose water without all those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I am at a 60% improvement in redness and acne is almost completely gone!!!</li>
            <li>The ingredient is 100% distilled rose water and there are not many products that are 100% pure and/or organic.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me and had a bad experience with rose water but doesn&#x27;t want to give up on this natural remedy, give Teddie Organics Rose Water a try!</li>
            <li>Originally I had another company in my shopping cart, however; I am currently deployed and that company did not ship to deployed loctions.  </li>
            <li>I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have such a great appreciation for small businesses to thrive.</li>
            <li>but since I only used it once, I cannot give a full review since I haven&#x27;t given the product time to work.</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel like a brand spankin new person!</li>
            <li>Helps my makeup look less cakey and more dewy.</li>
            <li>older</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;d like to have an extra bottle in my purse during the summer for the occasional refreshing spritz in the heat.</li>
            <li>Definitely coming back for more.</li>
            <li>Next time I will buy a big one with more quantity</li>
            <li>It gives such quick results.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed as I used it on my naked skin as a toner my skin is in a overall better condition.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s older stock or</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a technique called &amp;#34;baby face,&amp;#34; and works wonders on older skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure rose water, not tested on animals and the fragrance is soft and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had a friend who had experienced the same thing, and sent me some &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; face wash, that actually helped, but was more expensive than I can afford for myself.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend based on quality and performance.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone suffering with Rosacea.</li>
            <li>and it has a pretty cool mist unlike other.</li>
            <li>Pure, fragrant (but not TOO fragrant), and natural.  </li>
            <li>and while it does have a very strong scent it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>Wow !!</li>
            <li>It is truly one of those products that actually performs exactly as promised!</li>
            <li>The scent is not strong, very light.</li>
            <li>It also seems to calm my skin when I get hormone related blemishes.</li>
            <li>I recommend using this as a part of everyday skin routine to keep your skin looking fantastic!</li>
            <li>Will possibly try a few others just for the fun of it but doubt any will top this will post if so.</li>
            <li>I use it several times a day so it is going pretty fast, I will have to stock up</li>
            <li>However, I see myself using this rose water religiously on a daily basis, so next time I am buying the larger 4 fl oz.  </li>
            <li>usually purchase my hydrosols and toner in 4oz sizes, but I purchased the smaller size of Teddie Organics&#x27; rose water to sample the product first.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and I quickly appreciated how convenient the small size is to take along everywhere for all-day spritzing.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tried many time facial toners only to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Normally it can spray evenly, but this one comes with stream without spraying.</li>
            <li>After only a few weeks, I love the way it feels, what it does for my skin and pores an would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>live in Florida...</li>
            <li>I notified the company, and they shipped out a new bottle with lightening speed at no cost to me.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and had no problem using this.  </li>
            <li>It feels very natural.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li>I first had to spritz this on my face over several days before I posted a review.</li>
            <li>and my cheeks were SOFT after using this!</li>
            <li>It is the first one of the Teddie Organics line I have tried but it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li>The cup lid s totally different from the first time.</li>
            <li>What I like the most right now is its very subtle scent (compared to another brand I tried before).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become a big fan of rose water and its beauty benefits over the past year.</li>
            <li>I love this product, the only downside is the sprayer which doesn&#x27;t seem to do a very broad spray like other toners I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I got the travel size because I want to take it on an airplane trip, even though the smaller size is less cost effective than the bigger size.</li>
            <li>Every other toner I have used has increased my rosacea, this calms my face down and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It was truly a pleasure to receive such a fine product even before the date I expected it.</li>
            <li>Its scent is a little stronger than I expected but smell nice.</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old and began getting Roseacia.</li>
            <li>I use it after Dermarolling my skin and it makes it so hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>My husband would tell me is it smells like old ladies (no offense,</li>
            <li>I wish I had a gallon of this because I go thru it fast because I am constantly spritzing myself with it.  </li>
            <li>Oh wow.</li>
            <li>The benefits for this product go far and beyond what you could imagine.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a gentle toner for my face and this product has definitely exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>it has not caused any irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin and have been searching for a product that will leave my skin refreshed, balanced, and glowing.</li>
            <li>But, I had decided I needed to start using natural products.</li>
            <li>FINALLY this product has been what I&#x27;ve needed my whole life.</li>
            <li>and WOW...</li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling soft and is an effect toner.</li>
            <li>I have TERRIBLY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and now I just directly spray my face.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>My face is ultra sensitive and EVERYTHING causes inflammation.</li>
            <li>So far I already see my skin clearling up a bit</li>
            <li>I am addicted to this rose water.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can support a small business !</li>
            <li>Quality and smell, small portable size fits easily in purse or gym bag.</li>
            <li>I shocked when when this product showed up in a GORGEOUS amber glass bottle!</li>
            <li>bought this discounted which made me Leary at first, you know, low price low qualityðŸ‘Œ.</li>
            <li>I spray it on my face throughout the day: first after washing my face, next after setting my makeup, then finally, whenever my face looks and feels fatigued.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several toners over the years and they usually feel like nothing more than water.</li>
            <li>I will buy from them again and can only recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>The two large bottles will have to be returned, and the smaller bottle is completely ruined by refilling it from one of the bigger bottles</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my skin -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate because one bottle smelled so very lovely.</li>
            <li>Weary travelers take note: I use it on long haul flights - spritz it on my face and it is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>have most definitely seen a few improvements in my skin over the last week.</li>
            <li>have very dry, sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m really cautious about what I put on it.</li>
            <li>I follow a daily skin care regimen for my face and am always looking for something new</li>
            <li>In summer days, it is very cooling to spray my face with cold rose water.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have ordered from them and will be trying other items from their line.</li>
            <li>No other chemicals or ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have had the bottle for less than a week and have used more than half on my face alone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on here, if they don&#x27;t sell the large bottles as fast</li>
            <li>Instead of using water, I used rose water with 100% natural calcium bentonite clay, which Imixed with organic, ceremonial grade matcha green tea; raw, organic honey; and occasionally organic aloe vera and/or coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Upon noticing the difference, the latter (drug store version, to be clear) went into the trash.</li>
            <li>I like using only natural products.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and have no issues with irritation even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have only used twice so far</li>
            <li>Their service is so personal and professional.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it a week, but so far it seems to be helping the redness and breakouts on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>That non-organic, Moroccan rose water was $18 for 4 oz, which was expensive for something that wasn&#x27;t organic.</li>
            <li>Its either loaded with sulfites-chemicals that cause migraines or it is the wrong species of rose.</li>
            <li>and this was the only thing that worked to calm it down.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product over other natural or organic toners.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only familiar with RoseWater as a delicate, natural perfume.</li>
            <li>but only thing it was not easy to store those homemade stuff for long and neither was easy to make it every now and then.later after couple years I started using a brand which was said to be homemade</li>
            <li>This is a light spray with a faint smell of real roses.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes yet but its only been a week</li>
            <li>A hydrating mist or facial toner is, no less, an essential, as it maintains moisture balance in the skin, and should be a part of every woman&#x27;s beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>I tried several commercial products that didn&#x27;t work at all, or worse, made me break out even more.</li>
            <li>I really like that the seller sent an email asking how I&#x27;m liking the product, if everything arrived as specified, and also left me with some tips for other possible uses for this spray!</li>
            <li>So I thought why not especially since I live in such dry climate.  </li>

            <li> There are three things I like most about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this rosewater.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and feels nice.</li>
            <li> I also use the hydrosol at night before I slather on my oils (serum/moisturizer) -- I do feel it helps my skin absorb my oils better.  </li>
            <li> But, I admit I go spray-crazy jst because I just love the aroma of Rosa damascena.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  </li>
            <li> I love roses and anything</li>
            <li> First this smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this toner.</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% organic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I then decided to try this brand and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> I understand that Teddie Organics is a family-run business that works tirelessly to provide the highest quality product coupled with the very best service possible for every one of its customers.  </li>

            <li> Love the smell, and love how refreshed my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Rather than having to use my hands to apply the toner I love the spray bottle instead, it allows me to apply an even layer of the toner.</li>

            <li> Lovely clean rose scent.</li>
            <li> I chose Teddie Organics Rose Water mainly because of the good reviews and of the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Rose water is flavourful and the the process of distillation it went through says all about its rich effervescence.</li>
            <li> So far, I am loving this rose water!</li>
            <li> It has an amazing scent and leaves my skin super nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Price?&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my previous rose water, this is a great price since it is ORGANIC!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good quantity</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice the smell of roses, to me it honestly kind of smelled like marijuana!</li>
            <li> the smell is truly rose and it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> The scent is so pleasant and gently dissipates.</li>
            <li> Good for every kind of skin, even the sensitive one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is similar to the Moroccan rose water I had, but this one is more pleasant.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my face &amp; chest with the clean fresh smell of roses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent, slightly moisturizing and best of all no breakouts!</li>
            <li> The smell is light and lovely.</li>
            <li> I like the light scent and refreshing application is has given my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, natural addition to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for 2 weeks and the results have been incredible.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it take my skin feel .</li>
            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> Before Teddie Organics Rose Water, I was using a different brand of rose water, which was Moroccan rose water and was NOT organic (I will not mention the name of the brand).</li>
            <li> I decided to try this item because I got a nice discount coupon, and I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gives a nice even mist in one pump and the scent of fresh cut roses</li>
            <li> Strong large good quality spritzer.</li>
            <li> The rose smell is just the right potency, not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Very nice natural scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing, pure quality product!  </li>
            <li> I would give more stars for the overall great product.</li>
            <li> order arrived very quickly and well wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;i will definately order again from TEDDIE and recommend them to family &amp; friends!&lt;br /&gt;deborah</li>
            <li> After I use this product my face isn&#x27;t dry or oily and more, it absorbs it and makes my face look great and healthy.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a spray which makes it so easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> The bottle allows for a gentle mist of the most fragrant rose petals.</li>
            <li> hopefully the smell won&#x27;t be as strong.</li>
            <li> Loving this so far, it&#x27;s light and hydrating and of course I love the smell!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using rose water spray.</li>
            <li> I am in full love with this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Rose water</li>
            <li> However thus far Teddie organics Rose Water is the best for numerous reasons.</li>
            <li> It is cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It smells beautiful, and leaves my face fresh and soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spray is a fine mist and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The nozzle sprays a fine mist (hold it about six inches away from your face).</li>
            <li> and I use it as a toner after washing my faceâ€¦or as a quick refreshing mist whenever.</li>
            <li> I was quick in ordering more.</li>
            <li> It helps with the tight skin feeling on my face, and the smell is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the product because I wanted organic, pure rose water to treat rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for strong fragrances, and this is perfect, smells nice and natural.</li>

            <li> This rose water has helped my hair and scalp so much.</li>
            <li> But as of now, I really like this rose water.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know too much about fancy creams and potions, but I know that rose water has been used for centuries (millennia?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has the relaxing effect I been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Not as much as a cup of rose tea but its effective.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> but I also spritz myself with it as a light perfume.</li>
            <li> Perfectly light and fragrant.  </li>
            <li> I really like this rose water, I use it to refresh my face through out the day.</li>
            <li> ,and the wonderful thing it&#x27;s a spray bottle..more reason not to waste ..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not overbearing, But has a light airy scent.</li>
            <li> Aside from the smell, I do enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> I use it to set my makeup by lightly spritzing the product over my face.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to fly out next week and use this in the cabin to stay hydrated.  </li>
            <li> (who also lose the light scent).</li>
            <li> I truly cannot say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the feel and consistency of it.</li>
            <li> It feels so fresh and refreshing to put on my face.</li>
            <li> Oh, the scent is light and dissipates after product dries.</li>
            <li> I also love how fresh my skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li> This toner hydrates my face without causing acne or any rash, it allows me to apply my make up smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel as a toner for several months but decided to try this rose water because it was a nice travel size.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft, and smells so good.</li>
            <li> And I love that its 100% natural rose water.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the rose water for about a week and starting to notice my skin is hydrated and looking very clean!  </li>
            <li> It has a pretty strong rose smell about it (not artificial smelling, though).</li>
            <li> Bottle is right size for fitting in purse</li>

            <li> Original review:</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> 100% organic, which is great because you aren&#x27;t putting any strange chemicals on your face.</li>
            <li> The company has been so gracious reaching out to make sure everything has been shipped properly, and that I&#x27;m enjoying the product!</li>
            <li> so I was excited that I was given the opportunity to receive this product during the promotional period to test for quality.  </li>
            <li> I take it on long flights-its great for the trips.</li>
            <li> I was excited to order this during a product promotion.  </li>
            <li> I consider my skin to be in the sensitive category and have been very satisfied with Teddie Organics.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing and works well for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to be able to purchase this facial toner of Organic Rose water at a promotion.</li>
            <li> just saw how many exclamation points that I have used for far in this review, can you tell I love</li>
            <li> I notice that when I wake up the next day after using the rose water, my skin looks brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li> I use it before applying makeup and as a setting spray afterward and not only does it make my makeup look flawless and natural, it softens my skin as well.  </li>
            <li> I saw in a post where a friend of my friend told her to use the rose water from the same company to get her skin to look even better.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial toner that I recommend if you like natural products.  </li>
            <li> I was lookin for a natural and organic toner for face (alcohol free), so decided to try this rose water.</li>
            <li> In the short time I have been using  the Teddy Organics rose water my skin feels more hydrated and toned.</li>
            <li> Really nice and refreshing facial mist.</li>
            <li> The toner leaves our skin feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Not only is it refreshing, I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone and it has a nice scent, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner after I clean my face in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to get away from using my Acne-specific toner with the Rose Water Facial Toner, and no cystic acne has occurred</li>
            <li> I use it as a toner and as a spray between light layers of primer, makeup, and powder, which leads to a finish so natural, it&#x27;s like your own skin but perfected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m usually not to keep on florally scented things either, but this rose water is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The owners are so friendly and very prompt on questions and the email response was phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> did some research and decided to give Bulgarian rose water a try instead, not expecting much in light of my previous experience with rose water.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural mild rose scent.  </li>
            <li> It really soften skin and leaves with beautiful aroma of roses, it is not too strong smell at all just a pinch of roses and goes away after air dry.</li>
            <li> , you have a new loyal customer! :)</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> +.. no artificial smell and perfectly light on my skin</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic because I am very picky about the products I use.  </li>
            <li> Teddie Organics was very communicative to ensure I received product and was satisfied with it as well.</li>
            <li> Plus the fragrance from the natural rose is calming to the senses.</li>
            <li> it smells ok, but I cannot say you feel like you smell the real roses.</li>
            <li> Very cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Smells excellent and I like the emails explaining common uses for it</li>
            <li> Not a bad price either</li>
            <li> And, being a guy, my skin is even more sensitive to most things on days that I shave (not just right after, but for hours after shaving).</li>
            <li> Very clean and pure.  </li>
            <li> I love it so far, easy to use</li>
            <li> Super glad it was in a spray bottle, makes it much easier to use instead of putting it on a cotton ball or pad.</li>
            <li> This one smells SO amazing and sweet and the bottle sprays such a fine mist</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly without issue</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and Teddie Organics is a family run business so they communicate with their customers by following up on your order and make sure you&#x27;re satisfied with everything</li>
            <li> I have not experienced dryness or film over my skin, plus, the light fragrance is wonderful!</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and  Teddie Organics was a pleasure.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it smell wonderful, it has definitely cleared my skin up.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice pick-me-up and a nice toner that&#x27;s not too harsh.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, packaged well</li>
            <li> I use it as toner and also soak paper mask with it for a quick calming mask.</li>
            <li> I also used it during the day for a quick pick me up.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is just enough moisture for my oily/combo skin that I don&#x27;t need to use extra moisturizer in the AM, and my BB cream stays perfect with no flakey or oily spots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend for people who prefer natural and gentle product on their skin.its non- greasy unlike otherchemical toners but not dry too.its really refreshing ,lifting up the mood awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking to get products that would enhance my face as I am getting older and my skin is not as tight and flawless as it once was...</li>
            <li> I was curious to see indigridients and amazed it&#x27;s just distilled rose water!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve tried almost every type of hydrating mist and facial out there, including popular brands carried by Sephora, but none come close to the natural feeling and effectiveness of Teddie Organics Rose Water.</li>
            <li> overall pleased but probably won&#x27;t be buying this (or really any rose water) again.</li>
            <li> I like this product for its clean, refreshing sensation, leaving my skin appearing toned and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> have been using many new, organic  products on my skin and my kids; now that they are of age where skin cleaning truly matters, I have been using these products alongside my tweenage daughter.</li>
            <li> This product feels amazing on your skin, it makes my face and neck feel clean and clear ready for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> From the first day I used this rose water, I noticed how soft and moisturized my hair felt.</li>
            <li> but I normally get greedy to apply more as the fragrance of fresh roses is so soothing..</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely; not too strong but much better smelling than typical toners laden with alcohol.</li>
            <li> Another plus is the genuinely thoughtful owners of Teddie - amazing customer service and they are passionate about their products.</li>
            <li> I want to feel refreshed and have healthy looking skin without smelling like a old ladies closet!</li>

            <li> The quality of the spray is fantastic, once you spray, it evenly spreads to your whole face.</li>
            <li> But overall expectations is ok, not what I expected reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face felt immediately after, just refreshed and soft.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would irritate it, but it hasn&#x27;t at all.  </li>
            <li> I regularly use Rose water as toner.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product so far.</li>
            <li> Truly as if you&#x27;re standing in the middle of a rose garden.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really refreshing and soft.</li>
            <li> It is not a artificial scent by any means which adds to it&#x27;s presence.</li>
            <li> and I must say that feel of the rose water is back..</li>
            <li> I love the results so far</li>
            <li> Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; moderately visible pores on cheek area near nose.</li>

            <li> This rose water has helped my issues immensely.</li>
            <li> It smells like fresh cut roses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not an artificial perfumey scent by any means.</li>
            <li> I started using the rose water as soon as it came in the mail last week.</li>
            <li> The only ingredient is rose water.  </li>
            <li> My face feels so fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel reinvigorated and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Well an offer was extended to me to finally try this rose water.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and really look forward to trying more from this company in the future!</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling fresh and my skin feels smoothe.</li>
            <li> Teddie Organics Rose Water Facial Toner is a marvel for the face.</li>
            <li> It has astringent properties that are nourishing and kind to facial skin.  </li>

            <li> I use it before I go to bed and right after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Dries/absorbs right into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Used it only once, so can&#x27;t tell much about toning effect, but overall happy with this rose water  so far.</li>

            <li> Exactly what I wanted ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t help but feel pretty when you use it.</li>
            <li> It arrived as specified (fast!)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using teddie organic product.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on your tired skin!</li>
            <li> Also, I like supporting family-run businesses.</li>
            <li> Thanks for creating this product!</li>
            <li> The first bottle I received came frozen and the glass was shattered.</li>
            <li> I love using this before putting makeup on to help add some extra moisture to my face.</li>
            <li> Thanks Teddie Organics!</li>
            <li> The smell is quite delicate and non-invasive and I&#x27;m quite happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> The first impression of the product:  </li>
            <li> My first product with this company</li>
            <li> I also use it after a hot yoga class.  </li>
            <li> I do love urban decay b6</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> The scent comes from real roses, not artificial</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really heard of rose water</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying this product.)</li>
            <li> Most recently, it has turned into acne rosacea.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that after only using one day the redness decrease by about 40%.</li>
            <li> Thank You soooo so much!</li>
            <li> It is a lovely sensory experience, but not at all necessary.</li>
            <li> the fine mist spritzer dispenses the product so evenly -- better than my other hydrosols/toner with similar fine mist spritzer.</li>
            <li> Rose water is known for fighting acne, healing scars, cuts, and other skin issues.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t break me out like other popular brands sold here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only been using it for 3 days, but seems to work good since my skin usually sensitive to new products.</li>
            <li> Now I only wish they could get into Whole Foods :)</li>
            <li> After lots of research, I came up with a routine of all natural products, obviously including this rose water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched all my makeup to more organic and natural products now that I know that whatever you put on your skin goes directly into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> The only ingredient here is rose water - 100% organic and natural.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a staple for me; Will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, in fact, this is my first one!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and recently been looking around for certified organic products on Amazon to help my skin feel better and look better........</li>
            <li> I do believe if I keep using this, my results will remain positive.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is very refreshing without being too heavy</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a bigger bottle, but other than it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and cool after using.</li>
            <li> It made my skin super soft after just one use of me spraying it onto a cotton ball and applying it that way.</li>
            <li> It works well to set make-up, freshen skin after cleansing and it makes your hair super soft and helps to reduce frizzing.</li>
            <li> Has a slight rose scent.</li>
            <li> The rose smell goes away after a few min, it was a bit over powering at first.</li>
            <li> it was strong similar to a perfume.</li>
            <li> I will certainly  look at Teddies</li>
            <li> Not suitable for the face, but good for spraying just for the scent</li>
            <li> The bottles smell fine when you open them and sniff the bottle, but spraying it on for some reason brings out a rancid/sour smell.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that growing older is for the birds!</li>
            <li> The main thing I like about this product is that it is certified organic and it comes with no additives!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days but it smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan and would recommend this to anyone who works in an office and would appreciate a daily pick-me-up!</li>
            <li> It feels very silky on my skin and nourishing.</li>
            <li> If you care about what you put on your skin, I would highly recommend Teddie products!</li>
            <li> I have very temperamental skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> you make sure everything is as expected and take care of you if it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Being very prone to anxiety and stress</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived really fast too.</li>
            <li> It has a gentle smell that doesn&#x27;t bother my nose.</li>
            <li> and it feels really calming on my face.</li>
            <li> This comes in a spray bottle so you can either wet a cotton ball and wipe your face, or indulge in a refreshing spritz before your moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I really like the Teddie Organic product like and will continue to use their products.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes burn and very read.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.</li>
            <li> A girly treat for my whole body.</li>
            <li> It really helps tightening my pores and improving my breakouts a lot.</li>
            <li> I find myself needing to spray 3-4 times just to cover my whole face</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> and it just makes my skin really dewy.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
            <li> My skin feels very balanced and is much clearer after using this product.</li>
            <li> This has really helped balance my skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> really like this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
            <li> It sprays allover you face instead of in one spot or in drops, it is really a mist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it&lt;</li>
            <li> REALLY SOFTENS THE SKIN...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I found this to be very cooling on the skin..</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys it sprayed on his pillow after stressful days.</li>
            <li> I think this spray method work really well for me.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this that much</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> My skin has a glow after I spray this on and feels very hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It has only been a week since I started using the rose water, so my opinion of it might change in the future.</li>
            <li> I work in an office with harsh climate control/air conditioning, so this rose water has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> Anywho, I really have enjoyed using this, but I can&#x27;t really say that I see a big wow factor.</li>
            <li> I was told to try rose water without all those harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> and I am at a 60% improvement in redness and acne is almost completely gone!!!</li>
            <li> The ingredient is 100% distilled rose water and there are not many products that are 100% pure and/or organic.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me and had a bad experience with rose water but doesn&#x27;t want to give up on this natural remedy, give Teddie Organics Rose Water a try!</li>
            <li> Originally I had another company in my shopping cart, however; I am currently deployed and that company did not ship to deployed loctions.  </li>
            <li> I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have such a great appreciation for small businesses to thrive.</li>
            <li> but since I only used it once, I cannot give a full review since I haven&#x27;t given the product time to work.</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel like a brand spankin new person!</li>
            <li> Helps my makeup look less cakey and more dewy.</li>
            <li> older</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;d like to have an extra bottle in my purse during the summer for the occasional refreshing spritz in the heat.</li>
            <li> Definitely coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Next time I will buy a big one with more quantity</li>
            <li> It gives such quick results.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed as I used it on my naked skin as a toner my skin is in a overall better condition.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s older stock or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a technique called &amp;#34;baby face,&amp;#34; and works wonders on older skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure rose water, not tested on animals and the fragrance is soft and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had a friend who had experienced the same thing, and sent me some &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; face wash, that actually helped, but was more expensive than I can afford for myself.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend based on quality and performance.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone suffering with Rosacea.</li>
            <li> and it has a pretty cool mist unlike other.</li>
            <li> Pure, fragrant (but not TOO fragrant), and natural.  </li>
            <li> and while it does have a very strong scent it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Wow !!</li>
            <li> It is truly one of those products that actually performs exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong, very light.</li>
            <li> It also seems to calm my skin when I get hormone related blemishes.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this as a part of everyday skin routine to keep your skin looking fantastic!</li>
            <li> Will possibly try a few others just for the fun of it but doubt any will top this will post if so.</li>
            <li> I use it several times a day so it is going pretty fast, I will have to stock up</li>
            <li> However, I see myself using this rose water religiously on a daily basis, so next time I am buying the larger 4 fl oz.  </li>
            <li> usually purchase my hydrosols and toner in 4oz sizes, but I purchased the smaller size of Teddie Organics&#x27; rose water to sample the product first.  </li>
            <li> I love it, and I quickly appreciated how convenient the small size is to take along everywhere for all-day spritzing.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tried many time facial toners only to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Normally it can spray evenly, but this one comes with stream without spraying.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks, I love the way it feels, what it does for my skin and pores an would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> live in Florida...</li>
            <li> I notified the company, and they shipped out a new bottle with lightening speed at no cost to me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and had no problem using this.  </li>
            <li> It feels very natural.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li> I first had to spritz this on my face over several days before I posted a review.</li>
            <li> and my cheeks were SOFT after using this!</li>
            <li> It is the first one of the Teddie Organics line I have tried but it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> The cup lid s totally different from the first time.</li>
            <li> What I like the most right now is its very subtle scent (compared to another brand I tried before).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a big fan of rose water and its beauty benefits over the past year.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the only downside is the sprayer which doesn&#x27;t seem to do a very broad spray like other toners I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I got the travel size because I want to take it on an airplane trip, even though the smaller size is less cost effective than the bigger size.</li>
            <li> Every other toner I have used has increased my rosacea, this calms my face down and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It was truly a pleasure to receive such a fine product even before the date I expected it.</li>
            <li> Its scent is a little stronger than I expected but smell nice.</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old and began getting Roseacia.</li>
            <li> I use it after Dermarolling my skin and it makes it so hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> My husband would tell me is it smells like old ladies (no offense,</li>
            <li> I wish I had a gallon of this because I go thru it fast because I am constantly spritzing myself with it.  </li>
            <li> Oh wow.</li>
            <li> The benefits for this product go far and beyond what you could imagine.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a gentle toner for my face and this product has definitely exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> it has not caused any irritation to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and have been searching for a product that will leave my skin refreshed, balanced, and glowing.</li>
            <li> But, I had decided I needed to start using natural products.</li>
            <li> FINALLY this product has been what I&#x27;ve needed my whole life.</li>
            <li> and WOW...</li>
            <li> It leaves skin feeling soft and is an effect toner.</li>
            <li> I have TERRIBLY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and now I just directly spray my face.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> My face is ultra sensitive and EVERYTHING causes inflammation.</li>
            <li> So far I already see my skin clearling up a bit</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this rose water.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can support a small business !</li>
            <li> Quality and smell, small portable size fits easily in purse or gym bag.</li>
            <li> I shocked when when this product showed up in a GORGEOUS amber glass bottle!</li>
            <li> bought this discounted which made me Leary at first, you know, low price low qualityðŸ‘Œ.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my face throughout the day: first after washing my face, next after setting my makeup, then finally, whenever my face looks and feels fatigued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several toners over the years and they usually feel like nothing more than water.</li>
            <li> I will buy from them again and can only recommend them highly.</li>
            <li> The two large bottles will have to be returned, and the smaller bottle is completely ruined by refilling it from one of the bigger bottles</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my skin -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because one bottle smelled so very lovely.</li>
            <li> Weary travelers take note: I use it on long haul flights - spritz it on my face and it is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> have most definitely seen a few improvements in my skin over the last week.</li>
            <li> have very dry, sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m really cautious about what I put on it.</li>
            <li> I follow a daily skin care regimen for my face and am always looking for something new</li>
            <li> In summer days, it is very cooling to spray my face with cold rose water.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ordered from them and will be trying other items from their line.</li>
            <li> No other chemicals or ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have had the bottle for less than a week and have used more than half on my face alone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on here, if they don&#x27;t sell the large bottles as fast</li>
            <li> Instead of using water, I used rose water with 100% natural calcium bentonite clay, which Imixed with organic, ceremonial grade matcha green tea; raw, organic honey; and occasionally organic aloe vera and/or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Upon noticing the difference, the latter (drug store version, to be clear) went into the trash.</li>
            <li> I like using only natural products.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and have no issues with irritation even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used twice so far</li>
            <li> Their service is so personal and professional.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a week, but so far it seems to be helping the redness and breakouts on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> That non-organic, Moroccan rose water was $18 for 4 oz, which was expensive for something that wasn&#x27;t organic.</li>
            <li> Its either loaded with sulfites-chemicals that cause migraines or it is the wrong species of rose.</li>
            <li> and this was the only thing that worked to calm it down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product over other natural or organic toners.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only familiar with RoseWater as a delicate, natural perfume.</li>
            <li> but only thing it was not easy to store those homemade stuff for long and neither was easy to make it every now and then.later after couple years I started using a brand which was said to be homemade</li>
            <li> This is a light spray with a faint smell of real roses.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes yet but its only been a week</li>
            <li> A hydrating mist or facial toner is, no less, an essential, as it maintains moisture balance in the skin, and should be a part of every woman&#x27;s beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I tried several commercial products that didn&#x27;t work at all, or worse, made me break out even more.</li>
            <li> I really like that the seller sent an email asking how I&#x27;m liking the product, if everything arrived as specified, and also left me with some tips for other possible uses for this spray!</li>
            <li> So I thought why not especially since I live in such dry climate.  </li>
            <li> Have tried a few before heritage, Dabur from India and home health are we good except not impressed with home health.</li>
            <li> I have tried other expensive brands and so called 100% organic rose toners</li>
            <li> I have some problem oil areas on my face and after using this for only a few days, I believe they are starting to calm down.</li>
            <li> It provides an excellent base for makeup, and I&#x27;ve even used it as a makeup setting spray a few times when my skin was looking too dry.  </li>
            <li> my skin is clear and my dark circles are reduced.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for letting me try this out because it is part of my everyday regiment!</li>
            <li> I have never experienced true roses and water doing this.</li>
            <li> You can use it with a cotton ball as well, but I prefer to directly spray on may face and then pat down with my hands.</li>
            <li> I was searching for something to use during a very long flight that I have coming up next week.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizing?&lt;br /&gt;Since I have dry skin, this alone is not enough to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> It actually helps in my climate where my skin sometimes is so dry</li>
            <li> Unlike body sprays, it&#x27;s not aerosol or chemical-filled, and it doesn&#x27;t have some strong, fake smell that would make people gag in an elevator.</li>
            <li> I filled up my smaller bottle from one of the larger bottles and took it to work, unfortunately it took me a couple of days to realize that the sour, dirty laundry smell I was smelling was coming form me because of this rose water.</li>
            <li> But so many of these facial products are rather expensive!</li>
            <li> I spray this directly on my face after cleansing and I usually find one or two sprays to be sufficient, so it does last awhile.</li>
            <li> And I was careful to only spray the water on the skin or clothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*oh, and one minor thing I like:  </li>
            <li> that last enough number of days a little bit does its job.</li>
            <li> I have several other products from Teddie Organics-</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t been very long.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my dry itchy scalp and it was SO soothing.  </li>
            <li> And if you have dry skin, just pack on moisturizer</li>
            <li> It takes away the redness and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li> It was kept inside out of any type of sunlight in a dry place...</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, with a lot of oil production in my T-zone and moderately dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> skin tends to run on the dry side and on &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; days, when the weather isn&#x27;t too dry, or in the evening, I can get away with not applying a moisturizer to my face after I use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting it on my hands and it seems to be staying hydrated and not as dry.</li>
            <li> only problem zone; a couple active breakouts at the moment)</li>
            <li> , I simply had the misfortune of receiving 2 sour bottles which may be the fault of storage at Amazon as opposed to the companies error.</li>
            <li> and my poors are not so loose looking.</li>
            <li> The acne began to dry up, but my skin did not!</li>
            <li> It has a profound smell of roses not a watery smell as the others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have very very dry hair and a very dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my face for a little extra &#x27;oomph&#x27; for my skin throughout the day.</li>
            <li> but my skin is starting to gain a little bit of aging.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out as other toners which contain alcohol do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY, a brand new person</li>
            <li> I keep the bottle on my desk and spritz my face a few times a day to balance my pH and feel refreshed, especially after walking to work in the morning or around lunchtime.</li>
            <li> I spritz it on every day after I wash my face and apply lotion a few minutes later.</li>
            <li> Ive only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s an organic product, which is essential for me when it comes to scents made from flowers that I&#x27;m applying to my skin that could otherwise be heavily sprayed with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> and i have noticed a big difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Using harsh chemicals only causes problems and never really help resolve the problem I was trying to treat.</li>
            <li> My face is glowing and there is no more red blotches or bumps.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, this one smells quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of rosewater</li>
            <li> Basically iam not interested in toners due tons of chemicals in it</li>
            <li> but recently due to the winter I feel like using a moisturizing toner,so that my sunscreen will go smooth.i</li>
            <li> I only just received it, so I&#x27;m not able to report on the benefits of the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to waken up my dead face after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> When it is time to reorder or look for other  products  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other products</li>
            <li> I have a weird skin type that is very dry in the winter,  but still very acne prone.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 days or so, and so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my crazy sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have never liked anything that was rose scented as it was overbearing and sickly smelling to me.</li>
            <li> I am restoring my 5 star rating because the company sent me a free bottle of their rosewater to make up for my bad experience.</li>
            <li> We can even carry this everywhere we want,whenever we feel like having a boost of moisture and refreshment just spray the mist all day long on your face and neck,you won&#x27;t stopping spraying !!!!!</li>
            <li> It calms down the irritated skin.</li>
            <li> , I mean back in the day,</li>
            <li> The last couple of years I have been having THE most horrible acne.</li>
            <li> The redness around my nose has slightly lessened and it seems to take the redness out of the pimples I have been getting.</li>
            <li> the bottle was not full, even though there was a seal on it and plus there was no expiration date on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I know how beneficial a toner is,  but had a hard time finding one that wouldn&#x27;t over dry my skin or make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I use it mid-day, if I need a little refresher, and I use it at night just for the smell.</li>
            <li> I use it if I feel I need a little pick me up.</li>
            <li> After a horrible flare up that was requiring me to cover my face in green makeup to mask the redness, I decided to try rose water.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> Ive been using everyday a couple times a day.</li>
            <li> 4- star for product, I will update this review after few uses to say how this products work as toner.</li>
            <li> and I use it a few times a day to just refreshen a bit.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a stark contrast between the quality or purity, if you will, between this product and a drug store version of rosewater-glycerin blend that I had on hand.</li>
            <li> I spray a few times and let my face &amp;#34;air dry&amp;#34; before applying make up.</li>
            <li> I am now a firm believer in using organic beauty products.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this time, this is the second times I bought.</li>
            <li> So not sure what went down</li>
            <li> but I almost use half of the bottle already lol&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t be disapointed with this product!</li>
            <li> The worst part was that it dried out my skin most of the time.</li>
            <li> Large and painful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesomee but the quantity is very little for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if its doing anything for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Just a few squirted and feels like the skin is energized and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I like that these bottles are small and I can carry them with me even on an air plane for my vacations.</li>
            <li> versions which are sold at excessive prices.</li>
            <li> No more big ugly zits so far, for me, even around the time a woman&#x27;s skin usually gets worse.</li>
            <li> This company is small and family-owned, so you know you&#x27;re receiving a quality product.</li>
            <li> I got too lazy for that</li>
            <li> I usually use this to spritz on my face during the afternoon at work for a pick me up/refresher or after a workout.  </li>
            <li> I got Teddie only because I have tried other products from Teddie and never was disappointed.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to this product.  </li>
            <li> So my doctor prescribed another medication that supposed to be slow release</li>
            <li> As a customer, it does mean a lot.</li>
            <li> I mean come on,</li>
            <li> I tried another brand first because it was a little cheaper,  but the quality was terrible!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s utterly ridiculous, the metro gel was going to cost me$300.00 out of pocket.  </li>
            <li> so the bottle is about half empty two weeks in :(  </li>
            <li> and I now have big ugly scars.</li>
            <li> Which is probably not good for the wallet..</li>
            <li> The Moroccan one had a sharp smell that seemed artificial to me.</li>
            <li> It was worse than what I had as a teenager.</li>
            <li> but beware the rancid sour smell of bad rosewater.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, and I deal with horrible, hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kinda weird,  not really happy.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of synthetic fragrances, this doesn&#x27;t have that cloying heavy-handed fake smell that ends up giving you a headache.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of toners before</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted now!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have tried oral antibiotics, prescription creams, over the counter creams, etc.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no type of bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I purchased it after being frustrated with the cost of medication.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m obsessed with the product!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Quick shipment and packaged very well - no leaks!  I use this product as a facial mist and it works wonders to hydrate my face throughout the day.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it along with the Rosehip oil. I purchased it after being frustrated with the cost of medication. I went to a dermatologist and the antibiotics were not working. So my doctor prescribed another medication that supposed to be slow release but my insurance would not cover it.  The price was literally $1000.00 for a 30 day supply. That&#x27;s utterly ridiculous, the metro gel was going to cost me$300.00 out of pocket.  I am 38 years old and began getting Roseacia. I hope I spelled that right, anyhow I thought something has got to work that is not going to cost me a fortune, I mean back in the day, what did our ancestors do???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I searched online and found some reviews and YouTube videos about the benefits of Rosehip oil. I found this brand on Amazon and based on the reviews I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I wish I took pictures! My face is glowing and there is no more red blotches or bumps. It&#x27;s smooth as a baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owners are so friendly and very prompt on questions and the email response was phenomenal.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using rose water spray.This product is really amazing I love it so much I spray it on my face whenever I need a refreshing.It feels so good! I even told my husband to try it too:) I just got this rose water 2 days ago but I almost use half of the bottle already lol&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t be disapointed with this product!</li>
            <li> I received my Teddie&#x27;s Rose Water as ordered, on time and in a sealed bottle. It has a light fragrance, not heavy, which is exactly what I wanted. It feels very silky on my skin and nourishing. I received an email from Teddie&#x27;s asking if I was happy with the product and the way it arrived which tells me there is a lot to customer attention, detail to the product and very importantly, they care! This is the first product I have ordered from them and will be trying other items from their line. If you care about what you put on your skin, I would highly recommend Teddie products!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and very nice product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel as a toner for several months but decided to try this rose water because it was a nice travel size. It was shipped quickly without issue and I absolutely love it. The smell is so fresh, especially first thing in the morning, and it makes my skin feel great. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder. I was also impressed that the company followed up personally to make sure I was happy.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with rose water. I bought this a gift for my mother and gave it a try too! I love that it is organic! The bottle allows for a gentle mist of the most fragrant rose petals. I love the way my face felt immediately after, just refreshed and soft. Rose scent has such a calming effect too.&lt;br /&gt;I love that the company is from Santa Monica as well! I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have such a great appreciation for small businesses to thrive. This company takes customer service to the next level with  efficiency and communication. I was thrilled at the quickness in response I got.&lt;br /&gt; I would give more stars for the overall great product. I recommend using this as a part of everyday skin routine to keep your skin looking fantastic!</li>
            <li> It is amazing productâ€¦â€¦..:)</li>
            <li> Oh...I JUST LOVE THIS !!! SPRITZ N SPRAY RIGHT OUT OF FRIDGE ON TO MY FACE !!! LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Adore this. i finish a bottle every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rose water.  Very clean and pure.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product with great customer service. I have very temperamental skin and this was the only thing that worked to calm it down.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful! My face feels so soft, and smells so good. Definitely will be the only rose water I will use! Highly recommended! Beyond expectations! (This product was purchased by my wife for her, she is the one reviewing thisðŸ˜Š)</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel like a brand spankin new person! I just got it yesterday and love it! The customer service is great. They check up on you make sure everything is as expected and take care of you if it isn&#x27;t. I put it on after I wash my face and before I throw my moisturizer and make up on. SERIOUSLY, a brand new person</li>
            <li> Lovely for my skin and hair~smells wonderful and it&#x27;s nice to not have to make my own organic rose water for change, this smells better too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I use it after Dermarolling my skin and it makes it so hydrated and soft.  It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I had tried Teddie Organics&#x27; Rosehip Oil and Argan Oil and was thoroughly impressed so itâ€™s no surprise the Rose Water was just as great! I love the spray bottle it comes in for a perfect amount of mist. Being very prone to anxiety and stress Iâ€™ve also found  spraying Rose Water is a definite pick me up and stress reliever. Smells really great too!</li>
            <li> This smells so good and you can smell before you open the bottle. You can spray it all over your skin as a sprits and as a toner on your face to tighten pores. This rose water helps to maintain your skins PH Balance and soothes redness and irritation. The ingredient is 100% distilled rose water and there are not many products that are 100% pure and/or organic.  Great product company!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s heaven in a bottle.  I use it in the morning after showering.  It helps with the tight skin feeling on my face, and the smell is wonderful.  I use it mid-day, if I need a little refresher, and I use it at night just for the smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, instantly saw results! !</li>
            <li> Amazing product and great customer service!</li>
            <li> Great combination to use with the rose oil.</li>
            <li> Just love this product! Actually better than the Rose Water sprays I have seen for $30+.. no artificial smell and perfectly light on my skin</li>
            <li> How did I make it almost 40 years through life never having tried Rose Water before?&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time, Teddie Organics and I just love your product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually not to keep on florally scented things either, but this rose water is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been spraying myself in the face a bit obsessively since I got it :) I love the scent and it&#x27;s so refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even been spraying my kids while saying, &amp;#34;Come here, you have to smell this!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Florida... one can actually melt here in the heat. This is such a nice pick me up when I need cooling down!&lt;br /&gt;I just saw how many exclamation points that I have used for far in this review, can you tell I love it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without this Rose Water again. Ever. And I&#x27;m going to buy it for gifts --look out family and friends, you know what you are getting for your birthdays and Christmas now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount on this item in exchange for my honest review, and I honestly love it.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and hydrating.  Nicely scented. This is a good toner and pick-me-up which leaves my skin looking good.</li>
            <li> I like this spray a lot. I wanted a spray for at work so that I could give myself a mid-afternoon perk up spray. This fits the bill. It has a pretty strong rose smell about it (not artificial smelling, though). My husband would tell me is it smells like old ladies (no offense, older ladies)- I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell. I use it most afternoons, and I like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent vendor, great follow up.  Nice product, smells good and is hydrating and uplifting</li>
            <li> Amazing better than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of the rose water.  I&#x27;m not sure yet if its doing anything for my skin.  I can feel my skin tighten after I spray it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure rose water, not tested on animals and the fragrance is soft and not overwhelming. Very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived really fast too. Thank you.</li>
            <li> LOVE this rose toner!  I have tried other expensive brands and so called 100% organic rose toners but none compare.  This one smells SO amazing and sweet and the bottle sprays such a fine mist it&#x27;s great as a refresher or works really well for setting mineral powder makeup.  I&#x27;m ordering my second LARGER bottle now.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best beauty products I have ever purchased in my entire life. I don&#x27;t use it as a facial toner but I do use it for my hair. I have very very dry hair and a very dry itchy scalp. From the first day I used this rose water, I noticed how soft and moisturized my hair felt. I sprayed it on my dry itchy scalp and it was SO soothing.  It moisturizes my hair and scalp better than anything I have ever used before.  And I love that its 100% natural rose water. No chemicals, preservatives or additives. I like using only natural products. This rose water has helped my hair and scalp so much. It&#x27;s been a miracle product for me. The smell is heavenly.  I love that it&#x27;s organic because I am very picky about the products I use.  I trust Teddie Organics 100%. I spray this liberally on my arms and neck sometimes and it&#x27;s so refreshing.  I am addicted to this rose water.  I carry a bottle with me everywhere I go.  I wish I had a gallon of this because I go thru it fast because I am constantly spritzing myself with it.  It&#x27;s so refreshing and soothing! By the way, their customer service is AWESOME! They actually care about customer satisfaction.  Andy is a total rock star!! : ) I purchased this rose water with my own money and was given nothing in exchange for this glowing review.  This rose water is the best. I will never be without it. Thank you Teddie Organics!  Thank you Andy!! :)</li>
            <li> Before Teddie Organics Rose Water, I was using a different brand of rose water, which was Moroccan rose water and was NOT organic (I will not mention the name of the brand). That non-organic, Moroccan rose water was $18 for 4 oz, which was expensive for something that wasn&#x27;t organic. The worst part was that it dried out my skin most of the time. I am also not a big fan of the smell. After using the entire bottle, I saw no improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and decided to give Bulgarian rose water a try instead, not expecting much in light of my previous experience with rose water. I chose Teddie Organics Rose Water mainly because of the good reviews and of the fact that it&#x27;s organic. So far, I am loving this rose water! It has only been a week since I started using the rose water, so my opinion of it might change in the future. But as of now, I really like this rose water. Here&#x27;s the breakdown of what I think so far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Price?&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my previous rose water, this is a great price since it is ORGANIC! Please, Teddie Organics, continue to keep it at this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Smell?&lt;br /&gt;The smell is similar to the Moroccan rose water I had, but this one is more pleasant. It has a gentle smell that doesn&#x27;t bother my nose. The Moroccan one had a sharp smell that seemed artificial to me. On the other hand, this one smells quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Moisturizing?&lt;br /&gt;Since I have dry skin, this alone is not enough to moisturize my skin. However, I do think that for someone with oily skin, it could work as a stand alone moisturizer. And if you have dry skin, just pack on moisturizer afterward!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Overall Experience?&lt;br /&gt;This rose water works quite well with my current products. I notice that when I wake up the next day after using the rose water, my skin looks brighter and more radiant. Also, it&#x27;s amazing in my homemade clay mask! Instead of using water, I used rose water with 100% natural calcium bentonite clay, which Imixed with organic, ceremonial grade matcha green tea; raw, organic honey; and occasionally organic aloe vera and/or coconut oil. I do this once a week and my skin looks amazing afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and had a bad experience with rose water but doesn&#x27;t want to give up on this natural remedy, give Teddie Organics Rose Water a try! And if it doesn&#x27;t work out for your skin, put it in your face mask. It works so well in place of water that I can&#x27;t see it not work out!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product that smells so good and makes my face feel fresh and clean. I Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> TEDDIE ORGRNICS ROSE WATER is excellant!&lt;br /&gt;i use it a toner morning &amp; night, also as a mist during the hot, sweaty summer days ...sooo refreshing!!!&lt;br /&gt;i discovered TEDDIE on AMAZON SMILE.COM.&lt;br /&gt;my order arrived very quickly and well wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;i will definately order again from TEDDIE and recommend them to family &amp; friends!&lt;br /&gt;deborah</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few days but it smells great and I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement with my oily skin. I use it morning and night and it feels really calming on my face. Shipping was quick and Teddie Organics is a family run business so they communicate with their customers by following up on your order and make sure you&#x27;re satisfied with everything and I am very happy with my purchase. I will definitely be purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li> The rose smell goes away after a few min, it was a bit over powering at first. Overall, not bad.</li>
            <li> This spray works as a great toner. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks better after using it for a week. The spray is also a good mist for refreshing my makeup during the day.</li>
            <li> Oh wow. Refreshingly great! Just a few squirted and feels like the skin is energized and hydrated! Smells lovely. Use it as a toner.</li>
            <li> I love this rose water. I&#x27;m not much for strong fragrances, and this is perfect, smells nice and natural. Came in a glass bottle and the pump spray works nicely. Priced just right, I&#x27;ll be ordering again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this item because I got a nice discount coupon, and I figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only familiar with RoseWater as a delicate, natural perfume. This comes in a spray bottle so you can either wet a cotton ball and wipe your face, or indulge in a refreshing spritz before your moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry, sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m really cautious about what I put on it. Besides smelling nice and not making me sneeze or overpowering  with scent, it feels really, really nice and seems to tighten up my pores nicely (without drying!) and help my moisturizer work better.  When I use it on the cotton ball, it seems to wipe away extra makeup &amp; dirt that I couldn&#x27;t even see, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of its oils like some toners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know too much about fancy creams and potions, but I know that rose water has been used for centuries (millennia?) and now that I use this, I can see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;d like to have an extra bottle in my purse during the summer for the occasional refreshing spritz in the heat. Unlike body sprays, it&#x27;s not aerosol or chemical-filled, and it doesn&#x27;t have some strong, fake smell that would make people gag in an elevator.</li>
            <li> i am very impressed with this product and happy I made the purchase. I needed a good toner one tha wasn&#x27;t not harsh and this is perfect. Spraying it on rather than applying with a cotton ball is better for your skin. The fragrance is very refreshing without being too heavy and I love that it is multi purpose.</li>
            <li> Love the rose water...good toner and pore reducer.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells amazing, feels wonderful. I have very sensitive skin and I use it as a toner after washing my faceâ€¦or as a quick refreshing mist whenever. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again once it&#x27;s gone!!</li>
            <li> Where is the 6th Star? I am in full love with this product. The benefits for this product go far and beyond what you could imagine. Rose water is known for fighting acne, healing scars, cuts, and other skin issues.  Calms the senses which is great for anxiety and/or stress. This product is added to my facial because after using a mask or even a scrub, I need something cooling. This gives a nice even mist in one pump and the scent of fresh cut roses lingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this product was purchased using a coupon and this is my opinion and experienced using this product*</li>
            <li> Smells great and fast shipping</li>
            <li> What can I say? I don&#x27;t think I could brag more about a product than this. This is the best rose water on the marketðŸ’– its light,cooling,refreshing mist makes me feel like I&#x27;m in a bed of roses. I&#x27;ve used this every morning when I wake up to cleanse/tone my face. I use it if I feel I need a little pick me up. And I use it every night in my facial routine and in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this discounted which made me Leary at first, you know, low price low qualityðŸ‘Œ. So not true.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t be dðŸ˜Šssapointed for sure! This will a staple in my house</li>
            <li> I like every thing about it</li>
            <li> I love this rose water!  I have sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would irritate it, but it hasn&#x27;t at all.  I use it before applying makeup and as a setting spray afterward and not only does it make my makeup look flawless and natural, it softens my skin as well.  I also love that there is only one ingredient and their customer service is outstanding. Will be repurchasing over and over!</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot. My face is try in some spots and oily in others. After I use this product my face isn&#x27;t dry or oily and more, it absorbs it and makes my face look great and healthy. I like that it is 100% organic rose water. I like that it has a spray which makes it so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t any chemicals, preservatives and artificial fragrances in their rose water. I like that it&#x27;s great for all skin types so I can let my friends and family try this out to and see how they like it. I like that it has a lifetime guarantee. I like that these bottles are small and I can carry them with me even on an air plane for my vacations. I will continue to use this to make my skin nice and healthy. I really like the Teddie Organic product like and will continue to use their products. I recommend this for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Bottle is right size for fitting in purse</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Been using for about a week. It&#x27;s very refreshing!</li>
            <li> feels great and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, and it feels really good</li>
            <li> Really nice, quality product and wonderful service. The smell is light and lovely.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product to keep your face refreshed during the day or while on the road. Its scent is a little stronger than I expected but smell nice. The spray bottle provides very fine mist so your face is not soaked. I have used it several times and have no issues with irritation even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to be able to purchase this facial toner of Organic Rose water at a promotion. I have been looking to get products that would enhance my face as I am getting older and my skin is not as tight and flawless as it once was... The smell of Roses will help me to put me in a better mood, It smells wonderful!  Now I will be be able to use a product that will help me to get that restorative look back and maybe help my sagging jowls. I can tell you that growing older is for the birds! I am going to fight it every step I can. Thank you for this opportunity to try a product that I haven&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> I regularly use Rose water as toner. This Rose water from Teddie Organics is all organic and USA certified. I keep my rose water in the fridge and spray it on my face after cleansing my face in the morning. It is so refreshing and the best toner I have used. It calms down the irritated skin. Good for every kind of skin, even the sensitive one. I often do home peels and this toner, right out of the refrigerator is the best thing to use after a peel. It takes away the redness and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. You can use it with a cotton ball as well, but I prefer to directly spray on may face and then pat down with my hands. In summer days, it is very cooling to spray my face with cold rose water. If you use foundation and sometime get the cakey look, just spray some on your hands and pat your face. You&#x27;ll have a glowing complexion, no cakey feeling. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s made a huge difference in my skin - but it feels nice when I spray it on. Using it mostly as a toner after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I used to use Evian mist but after reading about the benefits of rose water I wanted to try something else.  It smells incredible and helps even out my combination skin.  I use it before I go to bed and right after a shower.  So far I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday. It smells nice, like roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has the relaxing effect I been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Not as much as a cup of rose tea but its effective.&lt;br /&gt;Been searching for rose tea with no chemicals for years but I never get what I order. I can&#x27;t drink it. Its either loaded with sulfites-chemicals that cause migraines or it is the wrong species of rose. I have no place to plant roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am trying it this way, on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT get in eyes. UPDATE; Sept 2015; I been using this for 3rd time, and for the 3rd time it stings, burns my skin. It makes my eyes burn and very read. And I was careful to only spray the water on the skin or clothing. 3X now very red eyes and face,, eyes bringing after spray this on my sweater and arms. I have never experienced true roses and water doing this. Definitely something in here not listed on bottle. Bottle says ingredient is rose water. Does not say roses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell and relaxing feel, but cant use it. Face burning now after just touching the bottle and then touching my cheek.  Eye is red since yesterday.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for the redness in my skin, but it smells wonderful and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Rose water and I have already noticed a difference in my skin. It is smoother and feels rejuvenated. It has a wonderful smell and feel. I love that I can support a small business !</li>
            <li> Love the water, so refreshing for my face ! I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing toner, love the cooling sensation live the smell ;) love the fact that is pure with no added ingredients.</li>
            <li> Ive been using everyday a couple times a day. It smells beautiful, and leaves my face fresh and soft</li>
            <li> Love it! Leaves my skin feeling very refreshed.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a gentle toner for my face and this product has definitely exceeded my expectations.  The toner has a great and fresh rosey fragrance,  it has not caused any irritation to my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this product.  As a bonus,  the customer service provided by Teddie Organics is impeccable!</li>
            <li> Worked great at first but started to smell like mildew? Seemed like the rose water started to ferment. It was kept inside out of any type of sunlight in a dry place... So not sure what went down but I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have started to use this sooner. Every other toner I have used has increased my rosacea, this calms my face down and smells amazing. I will definitely be repurchasing this and one extra!</li>
            <li> very refreshing and great scent.</li>
            <li> Just purchased Teddies organic facial rose water toner and so far I am happy with the product. The delivery was very quick. The product itself is very refreshing once it is spayed on. The smell is breathtaking.  I love the smell of this rose water tonner. Can&#x27;t comment on the results yet,  because I just started using it and so far very happy. Will Definitely Continue using this product and reorder it again, once I am out.</li>
            <li> Loving this so far, it&#x27;s light and hydrating and of course I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Amazing water! Smells wonderful and leaves your skin refreshed!</li>
            <li> I have used rose water before and am very impressed with the Teddie Organics brand. I will be purchasing again in the future. It refreshes my skin and is a light, but effective toner. I have some problem oil areas on my face and after using this for only a few days, I believe they are starting to calm down. I highly recommend this product over other natural or organic toners. I have not experienced dryness or film over my skin, plus, the light fragrance is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product with a refreshing fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. I got the travel size because I want to take it on an airplane trip, even though the smaller size is less cost effective than the bigger size. It&#x27;s lovely rose water, there are plenty of lovely rose waters out there. For the price, this is nice. The spray bottle is good -- it sprays a nice, even, calming mist.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try rose water for quite some time. Found this to be very refreshing and glad to add it to my routine.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face after showering. It smells so good and leaves my face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product because I wanted organic, pure rose water to treat rosacea. I have used the product daily since it arrived and I have already noticed a remarkable difference in the look and feel of my skin. The owners of the company have also reached out to me regarding the product. It&#x27;s obvious they care about their customers!! I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Hydrating and refreshing AND smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Smells great and softens my skin!  A girly treat for my whole body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week, giving it a shot but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.  It feels refreshing and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product so far. Using it as a toner and my skin feels good. Pretty packaging and great customer service.</li>
            <li> The rose water smells very nice. It really helps tightening my pores and improving my breakouts a lot. Love Teddie Organics rose water. I&#x27;m thinking about trying their Rosehip oil for my acne scar.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin and have been searching for a product that will leave my skin refreshed, balanced, and glowing. My search is over! Wonderful product. Thank you Teddie Organics.</li>
            <li> I love this Rose Water, it has a beautiful fragrance and feels good on my skin. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this company&#x27;s rose hip oil and thought I&#x27;d try this out too. Mmmm...it smells so delicious! Truly as if you&#x27;re standing in the middle of a rose garden. I use this on my face as a toner but I also spritz myself with it as a light perfume. It&#x27;s really refreshing and soft. Unlike a lot of synthetic fragrances, this doesn&#x27;t have that cloying heavy-handed fake smell that ends up giving you a headache. This stuff is addictive!</li>
            <li> I love this product, the only downside is the sprayer which doesn&#x27;t seem to do a very broad spray like other toners I&#x27;ve used.  I find myself needing to spray 3-4 times just to cover my whole face so the bottle is about half empty two weeks in :(  But on the bright side I love it and use it 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Love this! I use it after washing my face, then again after my foundation and finally to set my makeup. It smells so good and is so refreshing. I&#x27;m thinking of getting another to have in my purse to help with this Miami heat.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. The seller is also great as they really care that you are happy with their product! That says something to me!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this Rose water.  It feels good on my face &amp; chest with the clean fresh smell of roses.&lt;br /&gt;My product arrived quickly and  Teddie Organics was a pleasure.  Will definitely buy again from this&lt;br /&gt;company ;)</li>
            <li> The only time I have left feedback on Amazon. 5 stars for a wonderful product and an amazing seller.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that is both refreshing and fragrant. AMAZING, PERSONALIZED customer service! I would buy from this lovely company again and again because I truly feel they wanted to ensure my satisfaction with the item. Kudos to Teddie Organics on being an outstanding seller!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutly LOVE this product. It is a must have for your daily skin care routine. The supplier was great staying in contact and they followed up after to make sure I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I first had to spritz this on my face over several days before I posted a review. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of rosewater and I must honestly say, Teddy Organics is the best one by far. It has a profound smell of roses not a watery smell as the others I&#x27;ve used in the past. Good stuff.. :)</li>
            <li> Love his product! I work in an office with harsh climate control/air conditioning, so this rose water has been a life saver. I keep the bottle on my desk and spritz my face a few times a day to balance my pH and feel refreshed, especially after walking to work in the morning or around lunchtime. The smell is so lovely and the bottle design is both beautiful and discrete. I&#x27;m a huge fan and would recommend this to anyone who works in an office and would appreciate a daily pick-me-up!</li>
            <li> great product and fragrance is divine :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim.  I knew that I wanted to try Rose Water... but did not know a brand to buy or anything.  Originally I had another company in my shopping cart, however; I am currently deployed and that company did not ship to deployed loctions.  Luckily, I gave it another try and decided to buy this particular product.  I am sooo Thankful that I did!  I fell in love immidiatly!  I went around my shop spraying all the females face to give them a pick me up!  The scent is so fresh and feminine!  I feel so revilatized after I spritz my face!  Thanks for the awsome product!</li>
            <li> Best rose facial spray I have ever used. It calms your skin and tightens your pore instantly</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is a great mist for summer time!</li>
            <li> Have tried a few before heritage, Dabur from India and home health are we good except not impressed with home health. However thus far Teddie organics Rose Water is the best for numerous reasons. Quality and smell, small portable size fits easily in purse or gym bag. Strong large good quality spritzer. Fast delivery and excellent customer service. Will possibly try a few others just for the fun of it but doubt any will top this will post if so.</li>
            <li> I love this! So refreshing. I spritz it on every day after I wash my face and apply lotion a few minutes later. It is also a great pick-me-up in the middle of a long day. I would definitely recommend! Not a bad price either</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly - and smells awesome!  I&#x27;m using it as a facial toner, as well as in lotions.</li>
            <li> Amazing, pure quality product!  Great as a toner and refresher!</li>
            <li> I use it as a setting spray for make-up.  Leaves my face feeling and looking dewy.&lt;br /&gt;Spray is a fine mist and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions to this product.  I don&#x27;t like to use &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; products, as they often clog my pores, so this was a perfect buy for me.</li>
            <li> Lovely toner and the rose smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have only used a coupke of times I really like the smell will keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Smells great and the effects of using it are definitely positive! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This rose water is very good, I like the spray bottle because it sprays and I just spray it on my face and it feels so good. Wish the bottle was bigger</li>
            <li> Abosoltely LOVE this product. I have tried several &amp;#34;like this&amp;#34; and this is the number one. Everything from the smell to the bottle is perfect!! Definitely coming back for more. Now I only wish they could get into Whole Foods :)</li>
            <li> Just what I was hoping for, Lovely ! I will buy again;</li>
            <li> Love the rose water.  It has a great smell</li>
            <li> Perfectly light and fragrant.  Exactly what I wanted ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Next time I will buy a big one with more quantity</li>
            <li> This rose water spray smells really nice.  I spritz it on my face after I do my makeup and it just makes my skin really dewy.</li>
            <li> I really like this rose water, I use it to refresh my face through out the day. The scent is not strong, very light. I use it several times a day so it is going pretty fast, I will have to stock up</li>
            <li> I have been hearing the hype about Rose water and wanted to jump on the bandwagon. But so many of these facial products are rather expensive! I want to feel refreshed and have healthy looking skin without smelling like a old ladies closet! This is a light spray with a faint smell of real roses. It is not a artificial scent by any means which adds to it&#x27;s presence. I like the light scent and refreshing application is has given my skin. Thank you so much for letting me try this out because it is part of my everyday regiment!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not I have been using rosewater for my face since I was a child ..when I was 10 my mom use to make homemade rosewater...but only thing it was not easy to store those homemade stuff for long and neither was easy to make it every now and then.later after couple years I started using a brand which was said to be homemade .which surely sounds like one but didn&#x27;t feel like one.then I moved to USA and here I was with thousands of variety of anything I wanted to buy.i could not trust just anything...heard about this brand TEDDIE...and I must say that feel of the rose water is back..it cleanses,it definetly refreshes .i use it every night before I sleep...as I am aging ...I am very happy to find this..it tightens the pores ..I ordered a 60 ml bottle it&#x27;s pretty good quantity that last enough number of days a little bit does its job.,and the wonderful thing it&#x27;s a spray bottle..more reason not to waste ..coz overdoing will not be harmful but I normally get greedy to apply more as the fragrance of fresh roses is so soothing..,u feel like you have baby skin again..I will definetly recommend this TEDDY ORGANICS rose water and will order more stuff from this company..very happy.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and smells great!</li>
            <li> refreshing and nice smell.</li>
            <li> So refreshing to your skin!  I will be ordering more so that I will have a bottle at home, in my purse, and in my car.  It smells so wonderful, and my skin loves it!</li>
            <li> Ive only been using it for a few days and I love it! It smells amazing and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. ..feels refreshing. ..use it 3 to 4 times a day</li>
            <li> I like this product for its clean, refreshing sensation, leaving my skin appearing toned and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!  Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this and I have to say it&#x27;s EXTREMELY REFRESHING and has such a pretty smell! It made my skin super soft after just one use of me spraying it onto a cotton ball and applying it that way. I love the results so far but since I only used it once, I cannot give a full review since I haven&#x27;t given the product time to work. I will try to remember to post an updated review in 3 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:  oily, acne prone skin (cheeks &#x3D; only problem zone; a couple active breakouts at the moment) and my cheeks were SOFT after using this! Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; moderately visible pores on cheek area near nose.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It is pure rose water and it comes at a fantastic price, compared to the &amp;#34;big brand&amp;#34; versions which are sold at excessive prices. I spray it on my face throughout the day and it is very refreshing. I have been using it a week and I already see an improvement on my skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. The quality is very good.</li>
            <li> Great refreshing product.</li>
            <li> I am super impressed by this product. It gives such quick results. This is my week 1 and my pores are already smaller than ever before. The main thing I like about this product is that it is certified organic and it comes with no additives! I also like the follow up mail sent by the company. As a customer, it does mean a lot.</li>
            <li> The last couple of years I have been having THE most horrible acne. It was worse than what I had as a teenager. Large and painful and I now have big ugly scars. I was eventually told it was cystic acne. I tried several commercial products that didn&#x27;t work at all, or worse, made me break out even more. I had a friend who had experienced the same thing, and sent me some &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; face wash, that actually helped, but was more expensive than I can afford for myself. I saw in a post where a friend of my friend told her to use the rose water from the same company to get her skin to look even better. Again, more than I could afford. But, I had decided I needed to start using natural products. After lots of research, I came up with a routine of all natural products, obviously including this rose water. It has one, just one ingredient-rose water. I have never liked anything that was rose scented as it was overbearing and sickly smelling to me. Having MCS , makes heavy scents even more unbearable for me, This stuff smells awesome, like REAL roses and it&#x27;s not overbearing, But has a light airy scent. Also, my skin looks amazing! No more big ugly zits so far, for me, even around the time a woman&#x27;s skin usually gets worse. I have gotten lots of compliments on how much better my skin looks. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> The most amazing rose water I have ever purchased. This company is small and family-owned, so you know you&#x27;re receiving a quality product. I have combination skin, with a lot of oil production in my T-zone and moderately dry cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried what feels like hundreds of moisturizers, but nothing seems to satisfy my skin. FINALLY this product has been what I&#x27;ve needed my whole life. Not only does it smell wonderful, it has definitely cleared my skin up. I tend to get a lot of black-heads, so this has been perfect for keeping my pores clean. I will be buying Teddie Organics Rose Water until my final days!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t changed my life or the clarity of my skin yet but it&#x27;s a nice pick-me-up and a nice toner that&#x27;s not too harsh. Smells amazing, obviously.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, packaged well so nothing broke, and the rose water is so refreshing and smells great! Love the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell. It may smell nice to a lot of people however to me it was strong similar to a perfume. Maybe I got a bad batch. Aside from the smell, I do enjoy the product. I use it to set my makeup by lightly spritzing the product over my face. It gives my makeup a more glowing look instead of it looking powdery. I have also noticed as I used it on my naked skin as a toner my skin is in a overall better condition. It is somewhat sticky when first applied but the sticky feeling quickly goes away leaving my face refreshed. I also have some itchy red patches on each side of my face from leaving my makeup up for an extended period of time. The rose water almost immediately reduces redness when applied. Definitely worth it I will buy again hopefully the smell won&#x27;t be as strong.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, refreshing rose water spray that I use on my face. I have very sensitive skin and this does not cause a flare up. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have only used twice so far so I really don&#x27;t know if it works</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had hoped it would be. Smells wonderful, light and not oily at all. Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> An amazing product! My skin has improved a lot since using it as a toner. Everyone should definitely try it.</li>
            <li> Perfect mist action, lovely light smell. Teddie Organics was very communicative to ensure I received product and was satisfied with it as well. And it&#x27;s an organic product, which is essential for me when it comes to scents made from flowers that I&#x27;m applying to my skin that could otherwise be heavily sprayed with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Basically iam not interested in toners due tons of chemicals in it but recently due to the winter I feel like using a moisturizing toner,so that my sunscreen will go smooth.i did a great search finally I decided to go organic ,something very gentle on skin,iam very glad that I found this!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Teddy organics rosewater toner smells divine !!! Wow !! Defenitly worth the price and I highly recommend for people who prefer natural and gentle product on their skin.its non- greasy unlike otherchemical toners but not dry too.its really refreshing ,lifting up the mood awesome!!! We can even carry this everywhere we want,whenever we feel like having a boost of moisture and refreshment just spray the mist all day long on your face and neck,you won&#x27;t stopping spraying !!!!!Pls don&#x27;t stop making this product,and we are expecting more awesome product like this from teddy organics!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and stellar customer service!!</li>
            <li> First of all, this is an EXCELLENT product, better than any rose waters I have tried. Second, the company is amazing. Their service is so personal and professional. I experienced a problem that was not their fault, and their sincere approach to addressing this issue truly made me feel like a valued customer. I will buy from them again and can only recommend them highly. Very refreshing product and company - pun intended :).</li>
            <li> This rose water is refreshing and smells beautiful.  I use it at work on my lunch break to stay fresh.  The scent is not too over powering and has such a feminine quality about it.  You can&#x27;t help but feel pretty when you use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, in fact, this is my first one! But I had to take the time to write one for this product....I was searching for something to use during a very long flight that I have coming up next week.  I came upon the Amazon listing for Teddie Organics Rose Water Spray and the reviews convinced me to try it.  The price was on point with what I was looking for as well.  It arrived as specified (fast!) and I tested it immediately and WOW... what a refreshing hit to the face!  Smells AMAZING.  Dries/absorbs right into the skin.  Leaves no residue.  It&#x27;s been humid and it definitely not only lifted the dullness off of my face but it lifted my mood/spirit as well! I can&#x27;t wait to fly out next week and use this in the cabin to stay hydrated.  I really like that the seller sent an email asking how I&#x27;m liking the product, if everything arrived as specified, and also left me with some tips for other possible uses for this spray! I didn&#x27;t even think to spray my linens or add to my bath! Thank you Andy! Great tips! I LOVE this product! Will use the 2oz for travel and order the 4oz soon for use on the ground!</li>
            <li> Really love the way it smells. It feels great on the face, too. The smell of roses only last a short while, which means it won&#x27;t interfere with any perfumes/colognes. I only just received it, so I&#x27;m not able to report on the benefits of the product. I&#x27;ll update when I have more time with the product.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using teddie organic product. I love it so far, easy to use and it is a great toner.  I intend to buy rose water from teddie organic for many coming years.</li>
            <li> Very good rose water.Awesome hydrating!</li>
            <li> Love this for my oily, acne prone skin. A midday spritz helps freshen my makeup in this humid climate. Refreshing, and smells great. Excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial toner that I recommend if you like natural products.  Works great, smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I use it as toner and also soak paper mask with it for a quick calming mask. Their customer service is superb which I don&#x27;t usually say.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. Feels great on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing! I&#x27;m loving my rose water. It&#x27;s refreshing and has so many health benefits.</li>
            <li> I am restoring my 5 star rating because the company sent me a free bottle of their rosewater to make up for my bad experience. This *is* good rosewater, I simply had the misfortune of receiving 2 sour bottles which may be the fault of storage at Amazon as opposed to the companies error. Either way, I was delighted by the companies proactive response to my issue.  Original review: My first bottle of Rose water from this company was delightful. I used it happily for a week and then I ordered two of the larger bottles (one for work and one for home). I filled up my smaller bottle from one of the larger bottles and took it to work, unfortunately it took me a couple of days to realize that the sour, dirty laundry smell I was smelling was coming form me because of this rose water. The bottles smell fine when you open them and sniff the bottle, but spraying it on for some reason brings out a rancid/sour smell. The two large bottles will have to be returned, and the smaller bottle is completely ruined by refilling it from one of the bigger bottles but I&#x27;ll eat that cost since I refilled it myself. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on here, if they don&#x27;t sell the large bottles as fast and it&#x27;s older stock or what - but beware the rancid sour smell of bad rosewater. It&#x27;s unfortunate because one bottle smelled so very lovely.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for the face, but good for spraying just for the scent</li>
            <li> Love the smell and great hydration. The quality of the spray is fantastic, once you spray, it evenly spreads to your whole face. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to friends and my family. The plus to all this is it&#x27;s organic skincare!</li>
            <li> Very nice natural scent. Doesnt smell like chemical roses. Helps my makeup look less cakey and more dewy. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a week, but so far it seems to be helping the redness and breakouts on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Light with an amazing fragrance. I want to spritz this on all day! I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very balanced and is much clearer after using this product. The seller contacts you to make sure the product is satisfactory and shipping is very fast. I was skeptical of toners before but now I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> This rose water smells amazing! This water is so refreshing, I use it in the morning before applying makeup and at night before bed. Wish it came in a bigger bottle, but other than it&#x27;s great. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this rose water to set my makeup and spritz throughout the day. It works perfectly and I love that what I&#x27;m putting on my face is a pure and organic product. I&#x27;ve switched all my makeup to more organic and natural products now that I know that whatever you put on your skin goes directly into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> I recieved my bottle of rose water about a week ago, its a wonderful toner, tightens skin instantly and smells great. Haven&#x27;t noticed any major changes yet but its only been a week and my skin does feel great</li>
            <li> I was not sure how this would work when I first purchased it. However, it works great and I love it! It leaves skin feeling soft and is an effect toner. I will definitely purchase these product again.</li>
            <li> The BEST rose water toner out there! Pure, fragrant (but not TOO fragrant), and natural.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and recently been looking around for certified organic products on Amazon to help my skin feel better and look better........I gave Teddie Organic Rose Water a try....... I Use it throughout the day..........and I love it ! Makes my skin feel so refreshed ..........Will definitely be buying it again .</li>
            <li> It seems a great product,  love the smell of it!</li>
            <li> like this product a lot</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product! It works well to set make-up, freshen skin after cleansing and it makes your hair super soft and helps to reduce frizzing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in search of the most effective beauty products to care for the skin. A hydrating mist or facial toner is, no less, an essential, as it maintains moisture balance in the skin, and should be a part of every woman&#x27;s beauty regimen. Well, I&#x27;ve tried almost every type of hydrating mist and facial out there, including popular brands carried by Sephora, but none come close to the natural feeling and effectiveness of Teddie Organics Rose Water. I spray it on my face throughout the day: first after washing my face, next after setting my makeup, then finally, whenever my face looks and feels fatigued. The effects of this rose water is a lightly moisturized finish that never leaves my face feeling sticky. Plus the fragrance from the natural rose is calming to the senses. It&#x27;s organic and contains simple ingredients that I don&#x27;t have to question or look up to understand.  I usually prefer to try before I buy, so as a first time purchase, I bought the 2 fl oz. However, I see myself using this rose water religiously on a daily basis, so next time I am buying the larger 4 fl oz.  Thank you, Teddie Organics, you have a new loyal customer! :)</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed using this! I bought the Mario D. Rose water from ulta and this this one is better to me. Will Try again soon</li>
            <li> I was lookin for a natural and organic toner for face (alcohol free), so decided to try this rose water. Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. It smells amazing but not strong smelling at all, which makes me like it even more. Used it only once, so can&#x27;t tell much about toning effect, but overall happy with this rose water  so far. 5-star for service and delivery, 4- star for product, I will update this review after few uses to say how this products work as toner.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I was a bit nervous about the scent being overpowering but quite the contrary. I use the rose water on myself and my children  (who also lose the light scent). In the short time I have been using  the Teddy Organics rose water my skin feels more hydrated and toned.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful! A very light not overpowering at all! Feels wonderful on your tired skin!</li>
            <li> This has really helped balance my skin.  My skin is very sensitive, and I deal with horrible, hormonal acne.  This rose water has helped my issues immensely.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful difference I am experiencing with this rose water facial toner. Teddie Organics is a name I shall trust in the future. Also, I like supporting family-run businesses. Thanks for creating this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it!the best water rose ever!thank you! it helps a lot for my pimples...I am from Italy and my mom told me to use it that&#x27;s what we use the most over there and after I told her how good this one is and that is actually pure water rose my mom asked me to bring some for her too when I will go back in Italy for my vacation.so I will definitely order some more soon!</li>
            <li> Great scent, felt wonderful sprayed on my face after returning from working out in the yard</li>
            <li> Really nice and refreshing facial mist. Smells so good!!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> wonderful product, my wife uses this and can&#x27;t stop talking about how much she loves it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! Well worth the money! I can&#x27;t stop spraying it,So i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll be ordering more very soon. It smells like fresh cut roses. It feels very refreshing on the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great!!! Feels nice on my skin!!! Very rejuvinating!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several toners over the years and they usually feel like nothing more than water. This toner actually has some substance to it and leaves my face feeling quite refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tends to run on the dry side and on &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; days, when the weather isn&#x27;t too dry, or in the evening, I can get away with not applying a moisturizer to my face after I use this. It also seems to calm my skin when I get hormone related blemishes. I spray this directly on my face after cleansing and I usually find one or two sprays to be sufficient, so it does last awhile. The rose scent will fade, so you won&#x27;t smell rosy all day.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> After I used this toner my face felt well hydrated, I noticed if I use it before I use my moisturizer it seems to go a lot farther and I don&#x27;t need as much. I also used it during the day for a quick pick me up. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> TEDDIE ORGANICS gets 5 stars from me!  I have several other products from Teddie Organics- this one  does not disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;Let me begin with this wonderful company. The first bottle I received came frozen and the glass was shattered. I notified the company, and they shipped out a new bottle with lightening speed at no cost to me. THAT is customer satisfaction!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using many new, organic  products on my skin and my kids; now that they are of age where skin cleaning truly matters, I have been using these products alongside my tweenage daughter. We both give this Rose Water Toner 2 thumbs up!! The smell is lovely; not too strong but much better smelling than typical toners laden with alcohol. The only ingredient here is rose water - 100% organic and natural.  Even my teenage son will use this on his skin.&lt;br /&gt;To use we have been spraying the rose water onto a cotton pad &amp; applying the toner after washing. The toner leaves our skin feeling refreshed and clean. The only problem is all three of us sharing one bottle!! I was given the opportunity to test and try this product. Highly recommend based on quality and performance.  This is a wonderful company with wonderful products to offer its clients.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is very refreshing and it has a pretty cool mist unlike other. It sprays allover you face instead of in one spot or in drops, it is really a mist.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice scent not to strong but you do fell a smell that eventually disappear once you use it so it not over worming si I really like it&lt;br /&gt;It s the perfect mist to lightly hydrated and  refresh in a very hot day  because it feels pretty cool in the skin</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and a couple of spritzes are just the perfect amount of refreshment I need from time to time.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Happy customer!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is everything I hoped for and more. I use this as a toner, after washing and before moisturizing my face. It feels wonderful and smells even better. I have TERRIBLY sensitive skin. And, being a guy, my skin is even more sensitive to most things on days that I shave (not just right after, but for hours after shaving). I use this as a toner and throughout the day to keep my skin moist, without looking shiny or oily. It&#x27;s a great, natural addition to my skincare routine. I really do love it.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that I have to fight the urge to constantly spritz my face, knowing I&#x27;m running low! Also, the company is excellent. Within hours of having this delivered to my house, they sent an email, asking how I liked the product. I replied and got a speedy response. I&#x27;ll be ordering this in a larger size ASAP.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a big fan of rose water and its beauty benefits over the past year. I use this as a facial toner and a facial mist whenever I need to &amp;#34;freshen up.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not overpowering and smells wonderful and calming. It also doesn&#x27;t break me out like other popular brands sold here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> I really like this rose water facial toner and i wll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love using this before putting makeup on to help add some extra moisture to my face. It is also nice to use for a refreshed feeling anytime of the day/night. It has a very nice, light rose smell. 100% organic, which is great because you aren&#x27;t putting any strange chemicals on your face. This is a must have!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. I purchased this to use on my face for a little extra &#x27;oomph&#x27; for my skin throughout the day. It feels and smells wonderful and has seemed to help with dryness and redness. I spritzed my husbands face and a minute later he asked me what it was. I thought he was asking because it smelled girly.... He has a severe eye allergy where his eyes are constantly itching him... He was asking because after I sprayed his face, his eyes stopped itching for awhile!! So now he uses it throughout the day as well. The only thing I would&#x27;ve changed was for me to have bought the larger size. And maybe a separate one for my husband. Thanks Teddie Organics!</li>
            <li> Great product. Great service.</li>
            <li> I truly cannot say enough great things about this product. I have only been using it for 2 weeks and the results have been incredible. I love when natural products are the ones that work!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  After only a few weeks, I love the way it feels, what it does for my skin and pores an would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Really great!!! Smells amazing and feels great. The spray bottle has the perfect mist.I use this as a toner at night and to set my make up during the day. Very authentic and a must try!</li>
            <li> This is a very fun and inexpensive pick-me-up.  I spend a lot of time at the computer and I use it a few times a day to just refreshen a bit. The smell is quite delicate and non-invasive and I&#x27;m quite happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> I have just got this product. The first impression of the product:  the bottle was not full, even though there was a seal on it and plus there was no expiration date on the bottle. Is it ok that the the water ends almost where bottle label ends? it smells ok, but I cannot say you feel like you smell the real roses. I cannot say anything about the quality of the water, because It takes time to verify. But overall expectations is ok, not what I expected reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> PACKAGED WELL, LOVE THIS REFRESHING SPRAY. REALLY SOFTENS THE SKIN...I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE FROM TEDDIE ORGANICS :o)</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly.  Received an email from seller immediately after ordering to ensure satisfaction.  I use this to set my makeup.  I love the smell.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Teddie Organics Rose Water toner smells so good! I was so worried that it was going to smell super strong of roses and while it does have a very strong scent it&#x27;s not overwhelming at all. It&#x27;s light, refreshing and feels great on my skin after washing my face. I&#x27;ve had no problems out of it since using the product and have used it several times during the day just to refresh my face. This is a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*sample provided for testing purpose*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told to use rose water when I&#x27;ve gotten facials and just never tried it. I found this organic brand and decided to based on the reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I did! Not only is it refreshing, I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin&#x27;s tone and it has a nice scent, not too overpowering. The company has been so gracious reaching out to make sure everything has been shipped properly, and that I&#x27;m enjoying the product! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My first product with this company and I love it.  I keep it at my bedside for when I wake during the night overheating.  I also use it after a hot yoga class.  Very cooling and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for 3 days, but seems to work good since my skin usually sensitive to new products. This doesn&#x27;t seems to bother it, It feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I just received my rose water and have been using it at night.  It has a lovely scent and has a calming effect. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> First of all, this is the best deal I&#x27;ve found for trying out rose water here on Amazon. Therefore I expected it to be a product that, although may be effective, would look pretty cheap.. Boy was I shocked when when this product showed up in a GORGEOUS amber glass bottle! This stuff smells so goooood.. I mean come on, what girl out there does not like the scent of a rose bouquet??  It&#x27;s certainly not an artificial perfumey scent by any means. I found this to be very cooling on the skin..I think I&#x27;m addicted now! Which is probably not good for the wallet..haha.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This spray smells amazing. It is cool and refreshing. I love it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I experienced any improvement in my skin but the product was refreshing and smelled nice-- overall pleased but probably won&#x27;t be buying this (or really any rose water) again.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and is great on my skin!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I started using the rose water as soon as it came in the mail last week. I started out using the rose water like a toner by spraying it onto a cotton ball and wiping it all over my face in the mornings. I got too lazy for that and now I just directly spray my face.  It is just enough moisture for my oily/combo skin that I don&#x27;t need to use extra moisturizer in the AM, and my BB cream stays perfect with no flakey or oily spots.&lt;br /&gt;I have most definitely seen a few improvements in my skin over the last week. The redness around my nose has slightly lessened and it seems to take the redness out of the pimples I have been getting. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my face will look like in a month! I&#x27;m so glad to have found this and I think this is going to be a forever product for me.</li>
            <li> Good productos nice sellers</li>
            <li> Just as the lady requested!</li>
            <li> This Rose Water is very refreshing to the face.  It smells wonderful.  I have very sensitive skin and had no problem using this.  Would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a face pick me up!</li>
            <li> Great. I love it. I wish I could toss it in my purse since I&#x27;m on the go. But I have a designer bag I don&#x27;t want ruined. The bottle is made of glass (which is actually nice. No plastic) so knowing me the bottle will break. But perfect for traveling.  I spray to give me a refreshing pick me up.  I do love urban decay b6 but it contains alcohol.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time! Refreshing! Good stuff!</li>
            <li> great! will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Arrived promptly! Definitely will repurchase the product.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and love the smell! I ordered this to waken up my dead face after a long day at work. Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> I use this to set my makeup in the morning. One spritz and it keeps things in place all day. My husband really enjoys it sprayed on his pillow after stressful days. The scent is light and refreshing. Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> This rose water is amazing! I absolutely love this product and can&#x27;t get enough of it. It smells divine. I love to put it in my bath water. I spray it on my face as a toner after washing. I spray it in my hair, to give it a healthy shine and lovely rose scent. I am happy to recieve this item to review. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it great moisturizer and freshens pillows at night</li>
            <li> This product feels amazing on your skin, it makes my face and neck feel clean and clear ready for my moisturizer. I really enjoy the feel and consistency of it.</li>
            <li> I follow a daily skin care regimen for my face and am always looking for something new so I was excited that I was given the opportunity to receive this product during the promotional period to test for quality.  There are three things I like most about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The only ingredient is rose water.  It is organic, no chemical or preservatives.  The scent comes from real roses, not artificial scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The scent is heavenly.  It smells like you are sitting in a rose garden.  It is not overpower, just fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  I love this makes my face feel.  After cleansing my face, I use this as a toner before applying my night cream.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out as other toners which contain alcohol do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very impressed with this product.  It is the first one of the Teddie Organics line I have tried but it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product! My face feels so fresh and hydrated. Im very happy. I payed attention to the reviews and based on that I got it. Try it out!</li>
            <li> I love this rosewater. It feels so fresh and refreshing to put on my face. And it smells great. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and feels nice. I take it on long flights-its great for the trips. Service was fast-Prime member</li>
            <li> Men can use this to I love it my skin looked better after two weeks great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesomee but the quantity is very little for the price. I have had the bottle for less than a week and have used more than half on my face alone.  It&#x27;s too pricey but excellent</li>
            <li> Smells as rose hydrosols should -- beautiful and calming -- and it is organic!&lt;br /&gt;I usually purchase my hydrosols and toner in 4oz sizes, but I purchased the smaller size of Teddie Organics&#x27; rose water to sample the product first.  I love it, and I quickly appreciated how convenient the small size is to take along everywhere for all-day spritzing.  I also use the hydrosol at night before I slather on my oils (serum/moisturizer) -- I do feel it helps my skin absorb my oils better.  But, I admit I go spray-crazy jst because I just love the aroma of Rosa damascena.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  great product; very responsive customer service -- the gentleman I was in touch with (I think the founder or co-founder) was very thorough at answering my questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*oh, and one minor thing I like:  the fine mist spritzer dispenses the product so evenly -- better than my other hydrosols/toner with similar fine mist spritzer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really heard of rose water but my skin is starting to gain a little bit of aging. So I thought why not especially since I live in such dry climate.  I&#x27;ve been using the rose water for about a week and starting to notice my skin is hydrated and looking very clean!  It actually helps in my climate where my skin sometimes is so dry the tip of my fingers crack. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my hands and it seems to be staying hydrated and not as dry.</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll like it. (I was not compensated in any way via discount or promotional offer to say this. Neither do I know the seller nor am I a relative. This is my first time buying this product.) There&#x27;s a stark contrast between the quality or purity, if you will, between this product and a drug store version of rosewater-glycerin blend that I had on hand. Upon noticing the difference, the latter (drug store version, to be clear) went into the trash.</li>
            <li> I love roses and anything rose scented.  This is a very natural mild rose scent.  I usually use this to spritz on my face during the afternoon at work for a pick me up/refresher or after a workout.  It makes me feel reinvigorated and fresh.  I was excited to order this during a product promotion.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> First this smells amazing! I love how smooth it take my skin feel . Its so hydrating and great on my skin. I also read to try it on your scalp and i have noticed a big difference in just a few days. Did i mention it makes my hair smell so good! I am deff hooked on this!</li>
            <li> Love this toner. My face felt great after first use.</li>
            <li> Smells excellent and I like the emails explaining common uses for it</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner after I clean my face in the morning and at night.  I like the way it feel on my skin.  I had always use the traditional toner where you damp it on a cotton ball.  I think this spray method work really well for me.  It smell really good. I think this is a very enjoyable product.</li>
            <li> Rose water, rose water, I just kept reading and hearing about rose water. Can&#x27;t lie, I wanted to try rose water. I&#x27;m always on the hunt, and in search of anything that could possibly help my skin. At 35 I still have breakouts, and my skin is scarred from acne, my pores suck, and it&#x27;s just like BLAH!!! Well an offer was extended to me to finally try this rose water. What&#x27;s the catch? Just that I share my opinion and experience using this brand of rose water. DEAL, first of all, it arrived super quick. YAY! I opened it immediately. Super glad it was in a spray bottle, makes it much easier to use instead of putting it on a cotton ball or pad. I really didn&#x27;t notice the smell of roses, to me it honestly kind of smelled like marijuana! Lol. But only when I sprayed it on my face. In the bottle I totally smell the roses. Anywho, I really have enjoyed using this, but I can&#x27;t really say that I see a big wow factor. I love that it is 100% organic. I&#x27;ve had no type of bad reaction. Now that I think of it, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since I started using this product. I do believe if I keep using this, my results will remain positive.  Am I blown away, no! Am I throwing in the towel on this product? No also. I&#x27;m just going to give it more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a fan of Teddie Organics! I have a weird skin type that is very dry in the winter,  but still very acne prone.  I know how beneficial a toner is,  but had a hard time finding one that wouldn&#x27;t over dry my skin or make me break out.  I had researched the benefits of rose water and decided to try it.  I tried another brand first because it was a little cheaper,  but the quality was terrible!  I then decided to try this brand and fell in love.  It is amazing on my skin,  doesn&#x27;t dry it or break me out at all and leaves my skin very soft and smooth.  It provides an excellent base for makeup, and I&#x27;ve even used it as a makeup setting spray a few times when my skin was looking too dry.  Love this stuff and really look forward to trying more from this company in the future!</li>
            <li> I understand that Teddie Organics is a family-run business that works tirelessly to provide the highest quality product coupled with the very best service possible for every one of its customers.  I love the rise water I received.  It is the perfect complement to hyaluronic acid and vitamin C therapy for skin.  It was truly a pleasure to receive such a fine product even before the date I expected it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this that much but the smell is wonderful and I can feel my pores tighten.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and very refreshing</li>
            <li> Well packed. Lovely clean rose scent. Plan to use with big surgery to refresh and heal</li>
            <li> I have suffered from Rosacea for about 2 years now. Most recently, it has turned into acne rosacea. Unfortunately, I have tried oral antibiotics, prescription creams, over the counter creams, etc. with no results. After a horrible flare up that was requiring me to cover my face in green makeup to mask the redness, I decided to try rose water. I like the fact that this product is 100% distilled rose water. No other chemicals or ingredients. My face is ultra sensitive and EVERYTHING causes inflammation. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I was going to react to this product. I am pleased to say that after only using one day the redness decrease by about 40%. The acne began to dry up, but my skin did not! Day two and I am at a 60% improvement in redness and acne is almost completely gone!!! I LOVE this product! My skin is soft and cool after using. I spray a few times and let my face &amp;#34;air dry&amp;#34; before applying make up. I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone suffering with Rosacea. Oh, the scent is light and dissipates after product dries.</li>
            <li> I have used ayurvedic rosewater products (Kama) from India and I find this almost the same.  The only difference is this one is a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Love the smell! Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my Teddie Organics Rose Water. I love the natural fragrance! It leaves me feeling fresh and my skin feels smoothe. I just wish it were MORE!! :) This is definitely a staple for me; Will be ordering more very soon. Thank You soooo so much! The shipping was effortless!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple days which I why I only gave 4 star b/c it hasn&#x27;t been very long. This is a great product! So far I already see my skin clearling up a bit and my poors are not so loose looking. I was hesitant to buy rose water b/c I&#x27;m not big on floral/rose scents. This is perfect though, b/c the smell is truly rose and it dissipates quickly. It does the job and smells lovely without being over powering. Will be re-ordering when I need a refill.</li>
            <li> Love the product!! I was curious to see indigridients and amazed it&#x27;s just distilled rose water! 100% pure! It really soften skin and leaves with beautiful aroma of roses, it is not too strong smell at all just a pinch of roses and goes away after air dry. I bought 2oz so I can take it to flight too.  I also use in the office too when I want to lift up my mood and refresh! :) It comes with nice glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product.  I also love how fresh my skin feels after using it.  I have been able to get away from using my Acne-specific toner with the Rose Water Facial Toner, and no cystic acne has occurred so I&#x27;m feeling very confident about this product.  Would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I like this product I have been using it for a couple of days now .It smells good and it is refreshing for my face .</li>
            <li> This is a miracle in a bottle, I have been seeing great changes in my face by using this and rosehip oil omg my skin is clear and my dark circles are reduced. Let me tell you how good of a mist this is for your makeup and it makes you look so dewy and nice . When using on top of makeup it gives me the perfect face for hours and I do not see any creasing . I will be buying more products from teddie organics .. Thankyou</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am a yoga teacher and an advocate of Ayurvedic health and beauty and this rose water is great! If you have fair, sensitive, red oe dry problem skin this rose water will become your go to!</li>
            <li> Thank you for your email. I appreciate  you wanting feed back about  your product. I love the rose water. When it is time to reorder or look for other  products  I will certainly  look at Teddies Organics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Kathy Cheramie</li>
            <li> This rose water comes in a spray bottle that makes it easy to apply on skin. It is organic and I would like to try for cooking too. Rose water is flavourful and the the process of distillation it went through says all about its rich effervescence.</li>
            <li> How nice to find a true organic product from an honest and sincere company! Teddie Organics Rose Water Facial Toner is a marvel for the face. It makes my skin feel refreshed and smooth. It has astringent properties that are nourishing and kind to facial skin.  I have been using it daily and can only attest to the benefits. The scent is so pleasant and gently dissipates. This product should find its way into your skin care routine. I consider my skin to be in the sensitive category and have been very satisfied with Teddie Organics. This is a toner I will happily purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product so far. Love the smell, and love how refreshed my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this particular brand of rosewater! It has a very light scent, slightly moisturizing and best of all no breakouts! I just spray my hand and press into skin after washing in the evening and in the morning I only use this to cleanse face.It is truly one of those products that actually performs exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> This is the best rose water tonic I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s lightweight, but doesn&#x27;t just feel like water. The nozzle sprays a fine mist (hold it about six inches away from your face). I use it as a toner and as a spray between light layers of primer, makeup, and powder, which leads to a finish so natural, it&#x27;s like your own skin but perfected. It&#x27;s a technique called &amp;#34;baby face,&amp;#34; and works wonders on older skin. Will definitely order this product again, next time in the larger size.</li>
            <li> I just started trying this and I really like it. What I like the most right now is its very subtle scent (compared to another brand I tried before). It feels very natural.</li>
            <li> There is so many use for rose water :-) I use mine for my skin to kept from drying out and also for my hair and scalp. It has an amazing scent and leaves my skin super nice and smooth. Rose water is a must for every woman and can be also used as gentle make up remover as well as many other things.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  This is the second e-mail for feed back I have received.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tried many time facial toners only to irritate my skin. I was told to try rose water without all those harsh chemicals. I got Teddie only because I have tried other products from Teddie and never was disappointed. This facial toner is what I needed! This toner hydrates my face without causing acne or any rash, it allows me to apply my make up smoothly. Rather than having to use my hands to apply the toner I love the spray bottle instead, it allows me to apply an even layer of the toner. After trying so many different beauty products, organic is the best product to use on your face. Using harsh chemicals only causes problems and never really help resolve the problem I was trying to treat. I am now a firm believer in using organic beauty products. If you need to hydrate your face or even give your hair a lift this rose water facial toner is the one.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! My skin feels so good after I use it.  The rose smell is just the right potency, not too overpowering.  My skin has a glow after I spray this on and feels very hydrated.  I have actually gotten comments on having glowing skin since using this product.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels refreshing on my skin</li>
            <li> Purchased this product once before and as soon as I ran out I was quick in ordering more. Great service and great product. I will never purchase this product anywhere else!!!! Love this brand and I&#x27;m obsessed with the product!!! Can&#x27;t wait to try other products</li>
            <li> Received the product on time.  Very satisfied with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I like this. It is refreshing. Has a slight rose scent.</li>
            <li> I had never used rose water before now . It can be used as a toner or just a refreshing spray through the day and the smell is amazing. It is very refreshing and works well for sensitive skin. Very happy with this product !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;provided by teddie organics</li>
            <li> feels good on my skin, I love it</li>
            <li> Not happy with this time, this is the second times I bought. The first one I bought was the 2oz size and that works great. The second time s the bigger size. The cup lid s totally different from the first time. Normally it can spray evenly, but this one comes with stream without spraying. That&#x27;s kinda weird,  not really happy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 days or so, and so far it hasn&#x27;t irritated my crazy sensitive skin. While it hasn&#x27;t created any additional redness, neither has it helped reduced what was already there. So far, for me, it like spraying a lovely scented water on my face. It is a lovely sensory experience, but not at all necessary.</li>
            <li> This organic Rose Water Toner is wonderful. I use it every day and night and what a lovely way to begin and end a day. It just makes me feel so good. Weary travelers take note: I use it on long haul flights - spritz it on my face and it is very hydrating. I look and feel refreshed even after a 12 hour flight. Another plus is the genuinely thoughtful owners of Teddie - amazing customer service and they are passionate about their products. Highly recommend!</li>
