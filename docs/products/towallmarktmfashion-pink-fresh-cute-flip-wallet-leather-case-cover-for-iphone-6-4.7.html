            <li>She liked it so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that I can slip my driver&#x27;s license in the slot in front (also ATM card, if needed), and take this instead of a big handbag to my exercise classes.  </li>
            <li>Really cheap looking</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; bow is a cheap piece of gold colored metal.</li>
            <li>Im even planning on repurchasing so that i have a backup lol great way to cover your phone and hold your cards (especially if going out-- no need to bring a big bag or a clutch!</li>
            <li>cheap and as described</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>And not expensive!!</li>
            <li>Very useful</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally find one that really fits!!</li>
            <li>I usually keep 5 cards and $100 worth of cash in my wallet and it fits perfect and still closes!</li>
            <li>was so happy that I recived this on 11/22 first time users of wallet cases you do not have to remove phone, just pull back flap and chat.</li>
            <li>The cell phone case is very feminine and stylish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool case now I&#x27;m just worried when will it start fading</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cool .</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this case, the gold bow looks cheap</li>
            <li>I like it and currently using my case, works great, shipped fast..</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Very pretty, protects my case.</li>
            <li>I like it, fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>The stitching is decent, the phone wallet is adorable and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>For the price, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li>At $3.97 + $1.00 shIpping it far surpasses any of the like items I&#x27;ve seen priced MANY dollars higher.  </li>
            <li>Pretty in pink I love it! üíó</li>
            <li>I got a lot of compliments from how pretty it is.</li>
            <li>I was pretty do as a pointed</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like it did on the photo and quality</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like what is advertised.</li>
            <li>CAME FAST!</li>
            <li>as pretty as the picture</li>
            <li>Cheap material, but it is soft.</li>
            <li>Pretty case and</li>
            <li>The pretty lace design is painted on, and it was supposed to have a chain attached to carry it</li>
            <li>pretty---</li>
            <li>When I received it, my first impression was, &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>Such a cute case yet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute and looks really new at first, but within a couple of days it starts to look old and the color wears out.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover the camera or flash in any way and the magnetic clasp is strong enough.</li>
            <li>Part of the case was a little yellow and the bow fell off after like the first hour of it being on my phone but for what I paid for it, it&#x27;s a pretty good case.</li>
            <li>My daughter didn&#x27;t like this at 1st but after a couple of days getting use to it she absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li>Really...</li>
            <li>it came in a reasonable amount of time as well</li>
            <li>Arrived in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li>It does protect the phone really well</li>
            <li>I was looking for something pink (my favorite color) and found this.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>I really do like this case.</li>
            <li>It really is feminine looking.</li>
            <li>But for the price I guess I should not complain much.</li>
            <li>btw I also bought it in black too cute</li>
            <li>Such a cute case especially for the price</li>
            <li>mine is fading fairly quick, I&#x27;ve only had it about a week.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and simple</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t have high expectations for it</li>
            <li>I have had it for a little bit more than a month and its still intact (bow and</li>
            <li>Scared to use it because the other one was so cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I looooveeee my new cover</li>
            <li>Inexpensive to keep buying new ones as the fall apart.</li>
            <li>I love this phone case, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when you take a picture at night with the flash on, the picture is pink, so the case must be getting in the way of the flash.  </li>
            <li>The pink is a bit lighter than the picture and the bow needed to be glued back on but its so cute and it has two slots for your card and ID ‚ò∫Ô∏è</li>
            <li>It came like a month later than I ordered but it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>It does take a long time for it to arrive but just be patient, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>Only thing that would have made this better is if my phone would go dark screen when closing it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool because my purse is no longer crowded with a wallet and my phone and other stuff.</li>
            <li>the outside jewelry arrived separated, so I haven&#x27;t really used it yet</li>
            <li>Very cute...got it 1week earlier from the estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li>I mean $4 is cheap!</li>
            <li>than a month later, I&#x27;m having to order a new new.</li>
            <li>Got it the exact day it was expected to be delivered.</li>
            <li>It is a little more &amp;#34;little girl&amp;#34; like than I expected.</li>
            <li>I will  buy a new same one.</li>
            <li>The only draw back is it takes a long time for it to get to you, but for me, it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It also comes on black, but o ordered the pink and its a nice shade of pink.</li>
            <li>she likes how it fits and looks while protecting the general condition of the phone kinda bulky</li>
            <li>Misunderstanding I&#x27;m sure, but not happy..</li>
            <li>Pretty but ripped after a few days.</li>
            <li>Now she wants a black one...</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s really cheap;y made and less</li>
            <li>its very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Two months, and there is little to be worn.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Such a sweet and wonderful case!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap and cute.</li>
            <li> Although I wish it had a bit more protection for my phone as an actual case, it is great for nights out whe.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;Tears easy</li>
            <li> I love it the magnet works great too my niece bought a different one for the 4s and it had a crappy magnet</li>
            <li> I thought I liked the design at first</li>
            <li> Beautiful case but not actual lace on case just design on it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it will be secure</li>
            <li> Said the case fit an iPhone 6</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth more than what I payed.</li>
            <li> She liked it so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that I can slip my driver&#x27;s license in the slot in front (also ATM card, if needed), and take this instead of a big handbag to my exercise classes.  </li>
            <li> Really cheap looking</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; bow is a cheap piece of gold colored metal.</li>
            <li> Im even planning on repurchasing so that i have a backup lol great way to cover your phone and hold your cards (especially if going out-- no need to bring a big bag or a clutch!</li>
            <li> cheap and as described</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> And not expensive!!</li>
            <li> Very useful</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to finally find one that really fits!!</li>
            <li> I usually keep 5 cards and $100 worth of cash in my wallet and it fits perfect and still closes!</li>
            <li> was so happy that I recived this on 11/22 first time users of wallet cases you do not have to remove phone, just pull back flap and chat.</li>
            <li> The cell phone case is very feminine and stylish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool case now I&#x27;m just worried when will it start fading</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool .</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this case, the gold bow looks cheap</li>
            <li> I like it and currently using my case, works great, shipped fast..</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Very pretty, protects my case.</li>
            <li> I like it, fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> The stitching is decent, the phone wallet is adorable and looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> For the price, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> At $3.97 + $1.00 shIpping it far surpasses any of the like items I&#x27;ve seen priced MANY dollars higher.  </li>
            <li> Pretty in pink I love it! üíó</li>
            <li> I got a lot of compliments from how pretty it is.</li>
            <li> I was pretty do as a pointed</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like it did on the photo and quality</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like what is advertised.</li>
            <li> CAME FAST!</li>
            <li> as pretty as the picture</li>
            <li> Cheap material, but it is soft.</li>
            <li> Pretty case and</li>
            <li> The pretty lace design is painted on, and it was supposed to have a chain attached to carry it</li>
            <li> pretty---</li>
            <li> When I received it, my first impression was, &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li> So pretty.</li>
            <li> Such a cute case yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute and looks really new at first, but within a couple of days it starts to look old and the color wears out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover the camera or flash in any way and the magnetic clasp is strong enough.</li>
            <li> Part of the case was a little yellow and the bow fell off after like the first hour of it being on my phone but for what I paid for it, it&#x27;s a pretty good case.</li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t like this at 1st but after a couple of days getting use to it she absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li> Really...</li>
            <li> it came in a reasonable amount of time as well</li>
            <li> Arrived in a reasonable time frame.</li>
            <li> It does protect the phone really well</li>
            <li> I was looking for something pink (my favorite color) and found this.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li> Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I really do like this case.</li>
            <li> It really is feminine looking.</li>
            <li> But for the price I guess I should not complain much.</li>
            <li> btw I also bought it in black too cute</li>
            <li> Such a cute case especially for the price</li>
            <li> mine is fading fairly quick, I&#x27;ve only had it about a week.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and simple</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t have high expectations for it</li>
            <li> I have had it for a little bit more than a month and its still intact (bow and</li>
            <li> Scared to use it because the other one was so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I looooveeee my new cover</li>
            <li> Inexpensive to keep buying new ones as the fall apart.</li>
            <li> I love this phone case, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when you take a picture at night with the flash on, the picture is pink, so the case must be getting in the way of the flash.  </li>
            <li> The pink is a bit lighter than the picture and the bow needed to be glued back on but its so cute and it has two slots for your card and ID ‚ò∫Ô∏è</li>
            <li> It came like a month later than I ordered but it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> It does take a long time for it to arrive but just be patient, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Only thing that would have made this better is if my phone would go dark screen when closing it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool because my purse is no longer crowded with a wallet and my phone and other stuff.</li>
            <li> the outside jewelry arrived separated, so I haven&#x27;t really used it yet</li>
            <li> Very cute...got it 1week earlier from the estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li> I mean $4 is cheap!</li>
            <li> than a month later, I&#x27;m having to order a new new.</li>
            <li> Got it the exact day it was expected to be delivered.</li>
            <li> It is a little more &amp;#34;little girl&amp;#34; like than I expected.</li>
            <li> I will  buy a new same one.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is it takes a long time for it to get to you, but for me, it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It also comes on black, but o ordered the pink and its a nice shade of pink.</li>
            <li> she likes how it fits and looks while protecting the general condition of the phone kinda bulky</li>
            <li> Misunderstanding I&#x27;m sure, but not happy..</li>
            <li> Pretty but ripped after a few days.</li>
            <li> Now she wants a black one...</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s really cheap;y made and less</li>
            <li> its very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Two months, and there is little to be worn.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and pale in color.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I dont like was how long it took to get, I waited almost a month.</li>
            <li> Did not last very long.</li>
            <li> Color faded the same day I got it and the pockets inside are loose</li>
            <li> I expected it to be white just like the design on the case.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to get to me!</li>
            <li> Very limited space</li>
            <li> Came in 2 1/2 weeks,  which is sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> so when you&#x27;re trying to take it off and switch cases be careful because it might rip on you.</li>
            <li> It came 6 days before I expected it to</li>
            <li> The magnetic latch is also a plus - no snapping or slipping into a loop.  </li>
            <li> (I ordered this one roughly three to four weeks ago and the estimated time of arrival was 1/29</li>
            <li> Quality not as expected.</li>
            <li> Shipped sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Received just as expected</li>
            <li> As expected from the picture.</li>
            <li> I thing the magnet to hold it closed</li>
            <li> Material is not strong enough to hold my lic and debit card</li>
            <li> My deliver date said around 12/23 so was a little dissapointed had to wait so long but</li>
            <li> Completely not for everyday use</li>
            <li> Pink is my color!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was thinking, but this was definitely too kiddy for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty but very poorly made, I have 2 cards in it and it won&#x27;t stay shut.</li>
            <li> Only thing is, is that it&#x27;s hard to take off</li>
            <li> Waited a whole month for the wrong case .</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slower than the other case I ordered, but was within the time specified.</li>
            <li> Started falling apart and looking dirty after the first week</li>
            <li> A little dissatisfied over it.</li>
            <li> When I didn&#x27;t get my package on time, I panicked a little and contacted the seller.</li>
            <li> it has little slots on the side to put your cards and little holes on the spine if you wanted to attach a chain there.</li>
            <li> Other than that, i would 100% buy a product from this company again!!</li>
            <li> I only kept my cards in the slots, but they&#x27;re very thin and loose</li>
            <li> Got one from another company, spent more and was very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> But; eventually in a few weeks the jewels started to call off.</li>
            <li> but now I think it&#x27;s plain.</li>
            <li> The pockets that hold credit cards and ID are a little lower then usually</li>
            <li> Cute but delivery time was horrible</li>
            <li> Will be buying the black one soon.!!</li>
            <li> but it still sucks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste ur money!!  </li>
            <li> A little sad it didn&#x27;t come with the chain for your wrist.</li>
            <li> Was too big for my phone :(</li>
            <li> Product is of poor quality I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> now it has been broken</li>
            <li> Over all, for $4.57 you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have just discovered I HATE the style.  </li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>
            <li> Very Very Disappointed!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> but the bow broke with in the week , started ripping, makes a nasty opening when you put in a credit card and money !</li>

            <li> This cell phone case is a gift, but it&#x27;s like one I already have myself.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and simple</li>
            <li> I love this phone case, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when you take a picture at night with the flash on, the picture is pink, so the case must be getting in the way of the flash.  Otherwise, it is perfect, and for the price, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> Just got my case today and I love it.!!!!!!  Will be buying the black one soon.!!</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t nothing like I thought I can&#x27;t even put my phone in it I don&#x27;t feel it will be secure and if I drop my phone sure it will crack so not even using it.</li>
            <li> Looks great and timing is perfect</li>
            <li> Very nice protect very good nice color too. It&#x27;s a very nice gift</li>
            <li> Awful!  Don&#x27;t waste ur money!!  Won&#x27;t even take a return!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice case. Not only it protects my phone but I can also keep my drivers license and ATM card handy and safe.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This was a really nice case. I got a lot of compliments from how pretty it is. The colors are great, and it fits well. But; eventually in a few weeks the jewels started to call off. I was pretty do as a pointed and it upset me. Other than that, i would 100% buy a product from this company again!!</li>
            <li> Omg! My daughter didn&#x27;t like this at 1st but after a couple of days getting use to it she absolutely loves it... Now she wants a black one... Really... Lol</li>
            <li> Love this case!! And not expensive!!</li>
            <li> i wanted to order this case but does it have that writing in the back of it? That makes it looks tacky</li>
            <li> This thing is so cute. And actually really nice material, I think.</li>
            <li> I looooveeee my new cover‚ù§Ô∏è Very useful</li>
            <li> Said the case fit an iPhone 6+, case was for an iPhone 6. Waited a whole month for the wrong case .</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what I needed!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. I ordered my mom one too</li>
            <li> I love it but it didn&#x27;t fix refund please.</li>
            <li> the outside jewelry arrived separated, so I haven&#x27;t really used it yet</li>
            <li> Cute case. Got it the exact day it was expected to be delivered. Only thing I dislike is..the strap part is a bit discolored. I expected it to be white just like the design on the case. A little dissatisfied over it. Ok case for the price.</li>
            <li> This phone case is the best!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice case. Shipping was a little slower than the other case I ordered, but was within the time specified. Very happy with everything.</li>
            <li> Have had this case for about a week or two. Already starting fall apart. Material is not strong enough to hold my lic and debit card but I can&#x27;t have high expectations for it sense it only cost $4.</li>
            <li> Honestly the cutest case ever and it fits phone so good! it came in a reasonable amount of time as well , I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> It came like a month later than I ordered but it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> This item broke the same day I got it!!!!</li>
            <li> Very cute! I love it!</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Tears easy</li>
            <li> Product is of poor quality I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great I love them</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. but I like it.</li>
            <li> Very Very Disappointed!!!!!!  I ordered it for my daughter. After waiting weeks and weeks for it to arrive. It Didn&#x27;t Fit Her Phone!!!</li>
            <li> I love my phone case which even has a credit card holder</li>
            <li> I love the case and the price! Looks exactly like it did on the photo and quality is good. Came in 2 1/2 weeks,  which is sooner than expected. Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It looks even better in person.</li>
            <li> This case is great and really cute. Only thing is, is that it&#x27;s hard to take off so when you&#x27;re trying to take it off and switch cases be careful because it might rip on you.</li>
            <li> Completely not for everyday use</li>
            <li> Works nice. It&#x27;s cool because my purse is no longer crowded with a wallet and my phone and other stuff. I love it because it&#x27;s all in 1. Very limited space though</li>
            <li> Such a sweet and wonderful case!!! I love it</li>
            <li> I like it, fast shipping!! Pleasure</li>
            <li> Dont Buy!&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the picture but the bow broke with in the week , started ripping, makes a nasty opening when you put in a credit card and money ! &amp; it also took more that the date</li>
            <li> Very cute...got it 1week earlier from the estimated delivery time. Great price!</li>
            <li> Beautiful case! Great price!</li>
            <li> now it has been broken</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute. But it&#x27;s peeling</li>
            <li> This case is so cute! It came 6 days before I expected it to and it looks just like the picture. The phone fits well inside of the case and there are card pockets inside as well. It doesn&#x27;t cover the camera or flash in any way and the magnetic clasp is strong enough. This was definitely worth more than what I payed.</li>
            <li> Love this phone case! So many compliments</li>
            <li> Love the case. It looks exactly like what is advertised. Got one from another company, spent more and was very disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> Cute but delivery time was horrible</li>
            <li> Arrived in a reasonable time frame. Packed beautifully, inexpensive, but works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> Color faded the same day I got it and the pockets inside are loose</li>
            <li> It has been 2 months since I bought this for my wife. She liked it so much. everything about it is nice except for the difficulty in removing the mobile from the case.. Highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Very cute case with affordable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it&#x27;s super adorable! Awesome price and good quality. Love how it holds all of my cards and money. Looks just like the picture...will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Cute. Just as described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute and looks really new at first, but within a couple of days it starts to look old and the color wears out. Once it gets bent/folded it will stay that way. It does protect the phone really well but it still sucks</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful case not a thick case a perfect fit! Well protective for your iPhone</li>
            <li> I love it. It holds my money and my cards. A little sad it didn&#x27;t come with the chain for your wrist.</li>
            <li> I was more than happy with the product&lt;br /&gt;Deliverd on time</li>
            <li> Perfect for my iPhone perfect pink color fit the dress I was wearing</li>
            <li> I like it and currently using my case, works great, shipped fast.. Durable... I can toss my phone in my purse and not worry it will get scratched etc.</li>
            <li> I love it the magnet works great too my niece bought a different one for the 4s and it had a crappy magnet so I can appreciate this case especially for the priceüòä btw I also bought it in black too cute</li>
            <li> my wife love it, can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Love the case very nice love the color</li>
            <li> This product is great......I have just discovered I HATE the style.  The side flap is always in the way!</li>
            <li> So cute and girly! I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a hand holder with my case</li>
            <li> So adorable!! I love this wallet</li>
            <li> I love it, looks just like the picture and is durable.</li>
            <li> Its baaad quality üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª</li>
            <li> I was looking for something pink (my favorite color) and found this.  I am very pleased with my iPhone flip wallet case.  At $3.97 + $1.00 shIpping it far surpasses any of the like items I&#x27;ve seen priced MANY dollars higher.  It&#x27;s great that I can slip my driver&#x27;s license in the slot in front (also ATM card, if needed), and take this instead of a big handbag to my exercise classes.  For the price, it seems to be very well made.  The magnetic latch is also a plus - no snapping or slipping into a loop.  Thank you Amazon, for offering this phone wallet case.  It more than met my requirements.</li>
            <li> CAME FAST! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> No it was suppose to be for a iPhone 4 but wasnt.</li>
            <li> for the price, this is a pretty good buy. The stitching is decent, the phone wallet is adorable and looks exactly like the picture. There is an impression of a crest and two card slots on the inside of the jacket . The material feels good to the touch. The wallet sports a magnetic flap making securing the phone a snap and it even allows for a strap of your choice to be added to the phone jacket via the two holes on its spine. A note on improvement: the metal accent on the flap could be classier if replaced by a ribbon for instance. Over all, for $4.57 you can&#x27;t go wrong. The only draw back is it takes a long time for it to get to you, but for me, it&#x27;s worth the wait. (I ordered this one roughly three to four weeks ago and the estimated time of arrival was 1/29 and it came yesterday, one week earlier than scheduled) My saving grace was my brother who gave me a brand-new IPhone 6 cover while I waited for this one to arrive.</li>
            <li> Pretty in pink I love it! üíó</li>
            <li> This fits my phone!! I&#x27;m so happy to finally find one that really fits!!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my case I love it</li>
            <li> as pretty as the picture</li>
            <li> Really cheap looking I threw it away</li>
            <li> I love the case üòç Thanks a lot. It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
            <li> Started falling apart and looking dirty after the first week however Amazon was great and reimbursed me</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly. Quality not as expected.</li>
            <li> Cute case. Shipped sooner than expected. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Flimsy.  Did not last very long.</li>
            <li> This case is so cute and compact. It was definitely worth the wait. You can&#x27;t beat the price. It arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> This one was the better make one</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my mother in law she&#x27;s very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and pale in color.  The &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34; bow is a cheap piece of gold colored metal.</li>
            <li> This case was exactly like the picture and friends and co workers loved it too</li>
            <li> Cheap material, but it is soft. I thought I liked the design at first but now I think it&#x27;s plain. Very great price tho, my case wore out in 2 months. I only kept my cards in the slots, but they&#x27;re very thin and loose so my cards would fall out all the time! Ended up ordering a different one from the same company</li>
            <li> I have gotten a lot of compliments on this case beautiful and the price was great and shipping was quick....</li>
            <li> Pink is my color! It&#x27;s perfect for my needs. Not only does it hold my iPhone, it holds my drivers license, credit cards, and cash. I don&#x27;t have to carry a purse every where I go.</li>
            <li> Pretty case and if you have a screen protector it&#x27;ll protect your Phone really good. Love the Rubber around the Phone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I needed</li>
            <li> I actually got it for my girl she likes how it fits and looks while protecting the general condition of the phone kinda bulky she says idk how good it is drop wise but my girl likes the product.</li>
            <li> I love this phone case!</li>
            <li> I love this case. Very pretty, protects my case.</li>
            <li> The cell phone case is very feminine and stylish. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this case. It also comes on black, but o ordered the pink and its a nice shade of pink. Provides excellent protection. I receive a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Love it so me so girly</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Love the case. Very nice</li>
            <li> Pretty but very poorly made, I have 2 cards in it and it won&#x27;t stay shut.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It protects my phone and has slots for my ID and my debit card.</li>
            <li> I love the iphone6 case</li>
            <li> Love this case. Flexible and well made. Worth every penny! Inexpensive to keep buying new ones as the fall apart. I mean $4 is cheap! Love love love this wallet case! I usually keep 5 cards and $100 worth of cash in my wallet and it fits perfect and still closes!</li>
            <li> Was too big for my phone :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap and cute. I love it and everyone compliments it.</li>
            <li> I really do like this case.</li>
            <li> Received just as expected</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Very cute but it doesn&#x27;t last. Got my on February and had to replace it on May.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was expecting. The pretty lace design is painted on, and it was supposed to have a chain attached to carry it and it did not. Misunderstanding I&#x27;m sure, but not happy..</li>
            <li> You have no idea how many compliments i have gotten on this case!! its is so cute and for the price-- there no reason why not to get it. I have had it for a little bit more than a month and its still intact (bow and everything)-- Im even planning on repurchasing so that i have a backup lol great way to cover your phone and hold your cards (especially if going out-- no need to bring a big bag or a clutch! lol). Only thing that would have made this better is if my phone would go dark screen when closing it but hey it only $3 so i cant complain! So cute and pretty--- you will have people complimenting on it and asking where you got it-- be sure of that!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool case now I&#x27;m just worried when will it start fading</li>
            <li> When I didn&#x27;t get my package on time, I panicked a little and contacted the seller. The person who assisted me was so nice and explained the situation and when I got the case I fell in love with it. This is definitely a adorable case for a great price.</li>
            <li> Love it fits great but took forever to arrive</li>
            <li> Got lots of compliments. Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> its very beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Two months, and there is little to be worn.&lt;br /&gt;But I will  buy a new same one.I like the style.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied! Is beautiful up close &amp; works well for my purposes üòÑ</li>
            <li> Very cute but the bow catches on things.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool . cheap and as described</li>
            <li> I like it but the only downside is that I can see the glue</li>
            <li> As expected from the picture. It is very handy and arrived sooner than I had anticipated</li>
            <li> perfect! I bought it for my mom and she loves it . it has little slots on the side to put your cards and little holes on the spine if you wanted to attach a chain there. very satisfied with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Part of the case was a little yellow and the bow fell off after like the first hour of it being on my phone but for what I paid for it, it&#x27;s a pretty good case.</li>
            <li> Beautiful case but not actual lace on case just design on it</li>
            <li> So cute put it up for summer</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife.  She loves it.  Well made at a good price.</li>
            <li> This waltet case is so cute !!!! It is just just like the picture with a good quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part I dislike: the cardholder is too lose , I put 3 cards in one spot and it still slide out . Not tie enough to hold ID</li>
            <li> It a good case and it arrived on time</li>
            <li> Nice phone case, love it!</li>
            <li> Such a cute case!!! Loveeeee! The pink is a bit lighter than the picture and the bow needed to be glued back on but its so cute and it has two slots for your card and ID ‚ò∫Ô∏è</li>
            <li> give as a birthday gift, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this item, she has everything she needs in one place. Excellent value!</li>
            <li> Love it! Get many compliments</li>
            <li> String doesn&#x27;t come with it.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and great quality!</li>
            <li> Love it...worth the wait</li>
            <li> I love this case üòÑüòÉüòÄüòä</li>
            <li> Such a cute case especially for the price and it fits my iPhone perfect!</li>
            <li> When I received it, my first impression was, &amp;#34;Oh how cute&amp;#34;. However, it&#x27;s really cheap;y made and less than a month later, I&#x27;m having to order a new new.</li>
            <li> Just received this unit but seems to be well made. I thing the magnet to hold it closed could be stronger but so far so good. It really is feminine looking. The pockets that hold credit cards and ID are a little lower then usually but that is a good thing. Don&#x27;t have to worry about cards coming out the top.</li>
            <li> So pretty. I love it so much. It does take a long time for it to arrive but just be patient, it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this iphone 6 case so adorable, I like the magnetic snap on this, phone fit in perfectly,  good quality made.I like how it protects both sides of phone. My deliver date said around 12/23 so was a little dissapointed had to wait so long but was so happy that I recived this on 11/22 first time users of wallet cases you do not have to remove phone, just pull back flap and chat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was thinking, but this was definitely too kiddy for me.</li>
            <li> The phone case is very beautiful, looks exactly as it does in the picture. Only thing I dont like was how long it took to get, I waited almost a month.</li>
            <li> Scared to use it because the other one was so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Pretty but ripped after a few days.</li>
            <li> Such a cute case yet mine is fading fairly quick, I&#x27;ve only had it about a week.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this case, the gold bow looks cheap</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my wife. The price was great an the item is really nice too. My wife loves this case, she uses it on and off with others and had lasted what we paid for.</li>
            <li> Great Idea works well for me.</li>
            <li> Okay but could be better built. But for the price I guess I should not complain much. Would be better with snap close</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect caseüòä‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would look like didnt like it</li>
