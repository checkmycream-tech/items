            <li> Smaller than I thought and only received 6 colors. All bright no pastel.</li>
            <li> I did not receive what is pictured and what is listed in the description. I received neon colored snap clips packages with only a 6 color variety. Very annoyed and disappointed. Trying to return.</li>
            <li> Did not receive all the colors. There were only 6 colors.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not as pictured.  I received all neon clips.</li>
            <li> works well in my baby&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected and are perfect for fine infant hair. Love the variety of colors!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought...perfect for baby hair. Good quality. Good colors. Prices not bad except when you figure shipping is almond $10...not a bargain. Fantastic for American Girl size dolls!</li>
            <li> Colors not as pictured and paint quality is very poor.  Sending these back.</li>
            <li> They perfect size for making doll accessories!</li>
            <li> Did not receive item pictured it described. Listing stated 18 assorted colors. Instead I received three packages of neon clips..only 6 colors.  Misleading and very disappointing. $9 is too much for ugly neon clips that I won&#x27;t even use.</li>
            <li> I have a 14-month-old daughter and these worked great for her nice and small for her head stay in nicely. Good snap clips for young toddlers or babies</li>
            <li> Not the variety of colors presented in picture. One package a completely different style. Gross misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> Got these for my 4 year old, who hates having her hair up, but doesn&#x27;t want her hair to be short either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were smaller than I expected, but they are great for toddler. Lots of colors (enough to go with everything she wears), all in pairs, with no repeats! My daughter was super happy there were 2 different shades of pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing how things tend to disappear in our house I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> Very cute but took a long time to arrive</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and not a lot of it.  These little clips are perfect to tuck back just a little bit of my hair or hold wild strands in place if I have a pony tail in.</li>
            <li> These are the right size but I feel like they were falsely advertised. In the picture they look like the colors go from dark to light and that is not the case but that is why I ordered them. Disappointed...</li>
            <li> These clips are the perfect size for little girl&#x27;s hair. Lots of colors and quick shipping, too.</li>
            <li> These are great little clips. Love all the color options to go with all my outfits!</li>
            <li> Obviouosly people are getting a different set as some say no repeats. Mine were three packages of hideous fluero. Each package is identical so I have 3 pairs of fluero yellow, green, pink, blue, etc. Annoyed I have to send them back but they are a waste of money. Don&#x27;t risk it, you don&#x27;t know what you will get.</li>
            <li> Super tiny! For infants.</li>
