            <li>Well Aquaphor is kind of like that;  diaper rash - use aquaphor; eczema - use aquaphor; a burn - use aquaphor.  </li>
            <li>when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;-Thick and sticky, it doesn&#x27;t leave a nice texture after it&#x27;s been applied</li>
            <li>recommended by my dermatologist for all kind skin use</li>
            <li>Have even looked for recipes to make my own face creams and body lotions.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is just a short-term effect or not, but I&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
            <li>This ointment is really effective.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>I used the kind of gloves that come with hair color.</li>
            <li>this size lasts me for a couple years, and really handy to keep in the house.</li>
            <li>how effective it is and if it will heel my cracked</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff with a whole slew of uses.  </li>
            <li>Also, great to mix 1:1 with maalox and zinc oxide to make a super diaper cream.</li>
            <li>I love it! :)</li>
            <li>I have a lot of tattoos, some of which I have won competitions with, and I have found that this stuff works the BEST BY FAR!</li>
            <li>I can say is WOW and AWESOME product!</li>
            <li>But the ointment absorbs and your skin will feel wonderful, soft, and not greasy.</li>
            <li>In the interim, this keeps the tootsies soft and happy!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product and my favorite eczema symptom-clearer.</li>
            <li>I do like Vaseline, but this is more effective.</li>
            <li>Very effective product in a jar of the right size, for use this winter season.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.</li>
            <li>but if you put it on immediately after shower/bath while skin is damp, it easily soaks into your skin and makes it feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice size jar for easy access.</li>
            <li>Great for people of all ages and great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>excellent stuff, shipping is super fast like always.</li>
            <li>This stuff cleared up some skin problems that I&#x27;ve had for months in just days, thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li>It is sucked into my skin :)  </li>
            <li>better than prescription medicine</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>A lot of our friends have used this too for many years but didn&#x27;t tell us about it.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor serves many purposes.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love this ointment.</li>
            <li>Love Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>it goes on nice and smooth</li>
            <li>After spending a fortune for specialized creams and lotions without being satisfied, I tried Aquaphor and it worked quite well.  </li>
            <li>My mom was a nurse in an oncologists office for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice under lipstick to help create a smooth finish and keep the lipstick from drying out your lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a great product for her to have on hand and the price was better than my local target and walmart, so it was a great buy with free shipping.</li>
            <li>This works so much better than Vaseline…and it works overnight.  </li>
            <li>so I heeded his advice about this product and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>My feet feel better than they have been in many years, they are healing quite will.  </li>
            <li>i always use it on my skin before i go to sleep :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are germs under and around my nails that are getting transferred to the rest of the lotion</li>
            <li>It was purchased on an impulse and like most impulse buys, it does not deliver as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love this ointment,  </li>
            <li>Most products don&#x27;t change my life and most products</li>
            <li>Better to be used for healing.</li>
            <li>Much better than the tube version.</li>
            <li>It has also help me to prevent any more cracked skin on my hands.</li>
            <li>MANY SO CALLED GUARANTEED TO WORK CREAMS</li>
            <li>He put this ointment on his hands and was able to fist his hands by morning.  </li>
            <li>We have been using it for more than 2 years now and it has worked well.</li>
            <li>but the reality is, you only get two hands, so why not give them the best.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care to be more elaborate about how well the product performs.</li>
            <li>I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be more like lotion.</li>
            <li>It is more like Petroleum Jelly than lotion.</li>
            <li>With the help of hydroxine, his skin has been doing so much better.</li>
            <li>Absorbs better than the creme.</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; will continue to use this stuff forever .</li>
            <li>His skin has gotten so much better.</li>
            <li>Overtime my feet look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li>We have tried many, many things</li>
            <li>The relief from itching is a blessing and his legs look much, much better.  </li>
            <li>The best daily, moisturizing treatment for feet...</li>
            <li>It is definitely more of a consistency of vaseline than a lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for three days and love it already.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff:  much better than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>I got turned on to Aquaphor by my doctor years ago and am in love with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Spreads well and protects better.  </li>
            <li>It is more costly, yes...</li>
            <li>Not 100% sure if it is this or just her since we haven&#x27;t used anything else.</li>
            <li>Never found better</li>
            <li>Better than petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite winter moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I worked in a tubing plant more than 25 years ago.</li>
            <li>But, since using Aquaphor, they have lightened, and my skin stays more moisturized.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a thinner Vaseline, and seems to work OK.</li>
            <li>then start rubbing, adding more as needed.</li>
            <li>I love its creamy texture.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I used this three times and... all better.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be safe to get in the shower with greasy slippery feet, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to sit in the tub with this stuff in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure I might be able to will this to my kids.  </li>
            <li>I will b ordering more.</li>
            <li>I have been using Aguaphor Ointment for many years.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Chapped lips, owies (our pediatrician recommended this over neosporin!) and most of all....butt cream for the baby.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to spend more time washing your hands than putting the stuff on.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Excellent for baby bottom, has helped stave off diaper rash several times!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>I would recommend AGAINST buying a tub if you use it for this purpose - if you need to grab more after you have already touched your tattoo</li>
            <li>My hands were cracking and bleeding and no lotion or oil could make it better.</li>
            <li>After 3 days, my hands were smooth again!</li>
            <li>It FEELS like petroleum jelly, SMELLS like petroleum jelly, but costs MUCH more than petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>If you use it, make sure to leave it on the feet for a bit (I sit in the recliner with a towel on the footrest) before putting on socks or walking.  </li>
            <li>If used correctly and often I have no scabbing and won&#x27;t need a touch up :)</li>
            <li>Vaseline seems to be more of a surface thing.  </li>
            <li>I think this cream is more of a ... not a placebo -</li>
            <li>My doc was okay with putting this on my baby any time.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>It works well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate them more, like some things can.</li>
            <li>Better than Vaseline; keeps my skin lubricated.</li>
            <li>been using it on my tattoos and love  </li>
            <li>the product will be ordering it again if i need any more</li>
            <li>Love love love it.  </li>
            <li>I just use it on lip and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This is magic.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied, feel good。</li>

            <li>/&gt;Vaseline, after all, is labeled as nothing more than what it really is, i.e. &amp;#34;petroleum jelly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>this creme is also good for deep anal penitration hehe</li>
            <li>The hospital used this and really raved about it like it&#x27;s some magic cure or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 5 star item, just SO large!!  </li>
            <li>The express is so quickly then others.</li>
            <li>It is a petroleum jelly-type product only a bit more moist so that it dissolves into your skin as well as protecting on top.  </li>
            <li>Last year, I got the mother of all heat rashes that became more and more inflamed as the days went on.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>any time my hand eczema flares up, I let this sit on my hands overnight, and it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>Helps alleviate a bit of the annoyance of mild eczema</li>
            <li>I find this to be a tremendous deal.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>All you need to do is just put on a nice amount of the ointment and put on a nice heavy pair of socks.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly from seller.</li>
            <li>Great for very dry feet &amp; elbows!!</li>
            <li>I love this product, its used mainly to maintain soft, smooth and callus free feet and to keep elbows and knees smooth and well moisturized (no ashy body parts allowed)</li>
            <li>Vaseline is not as good as it use to be but whereever you apply Aquaphor, it stays on for a long time and keep the area moist, relieves itching.</li>
            <li>love this cream, can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>Great deal at -40%, less greasy than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>The efficacy is just as good with dry skin as when you apply it after a shower when you skin is still damp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, excellent results and long lasting moisture retention.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Aquaphor for my lips and dry skin spots.</li>
            <li>It heals and protects dry skin and it makes your skin feel good.  </li>
            <li>Also good if you have dry patchy skin or elbows</li>
            <li>Lubriderm had worked for my dry skin condition for years but after hearing Dr Oz say that Aquapher was so good I had to try it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d probably be better off buying a jar of body butter, which is also less greasy and just overall more pleasant.</li>
            <li>My feet feel better after 2 days - wow!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other Eucerin products that I liked, but feel cheated by this one!</li>
            <li>Huge jar.. Think a blue magic hair grease jar.  </li>
            <li>I put it on my lips every night before bed and always rock soft non-dry lips - who doesn&#x27;t love that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best for spot treating or thin applications.</li>
            <li>You will look nuts but it will be so worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Stains the sheets a bit, but it&#x27;s worth the healing powers of this product.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I keep trying to find something more natural.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice size and will last a longer time than anything else that I have tried.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth mentioning that it will stain your clothes.  </li>
            <li>This is the top lotion for kids &amp; adult with eczema.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price, lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>; I have psoriasis and it&#x27;s great for this in addition to other things because it has eased some pain/bleeding/and softens the patches so much.</li>
            <li>This product did not resolve the problem but it works much better than most other things I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This is also good for other uses, like lips, knees and elbows...</li>
            <li>but the price is right.</li>
            <li>I guess the hospital was right</li>
            <li>so it does not absord into your skin right away.</li>
            <li>and she was so right.  </li>
            <li>We use it right out of the shower to lock in moisture.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>Before using Aquaphor, I like many others, I&#x27;m sure, read both the positive and negative reviews, but I took a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I contacted them and had a new lid very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great big tub for less on amazon gotta love it.</li>
            <li>I actually feel like a different person, a little more confident because of how great its made my skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, clears up dry and chapped skin in no time.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for dry skin.</li>
            <li>amazing for dry hands and feet</li>
            <li>good fast as expected</li>
            <li>It was more cost effective to purchase the large jars, than the small ones at the store.</li>
            <li>They would be even better if I was a little more consistent in applying this product.</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel so soft and healing the rough spots very nicely.</li>
            <li>works amazing for my dry skin !</li>
            <li>It might work overnight just fine, but I couldn&#x27;t even get that far with this product.</li>
            <li>Is much better than vasoline, serves the same purpose only better.</li>
            <li>This helps so much with my eczema!</li>
            <li>figured I just buy this big tub since it was more cost-effective.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is the best over the counter treatment I have found to help sooth the angry psoriasis patches.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost clear, a light off-white color to it.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely repeat.</li>
            <li>This is not a lotion or a cream, but an ointment, very similar to Vaseline in appearance and consistency, but much more healing and protective of your skin.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Great for pressure ulcers on my mom&#x27;s bottom and don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s too greasy for my hands, reminds me of a thick petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li>It really works and works well!</li>
            <li>and I really hope this helps!</li>
            <li>I first heard of Aquaphor when my grandmother was in the hospital.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this nightly on my hands and face, and my skin looks and feels younger and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wow, bring it on, even though it costs 50% more than a similar quantity of the pedestrian Vaseline brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nurses, who wash their hands a LOT, were the first to recommend this to me.</li>
            <li>I have recommended  it to several of my friends, they bought it and love it too.</li>
            <li>It only requires the tiniest dab on most anything and that does not lend itself to being greasy.</li>
            <li>was my first time using this product.  </li>
            <li>We first used this product for my son&#x27;s baby acne, and have been using it on him since then.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic for maintaining soft feet, with no cracks or callouses.</li>
            <li>I put it on my whole face before applying my laura mercier tinted moisturizer before going to work, my face looks dewy/healthy and not in a greasy way!</li>
            <li>Both my wife and myself are pleased with the results, it takes daily routines to get the callous to disappear though we are seeing improvement.,</li>
            <li>get duped by the label &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; for I believe it costs several dollars more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why or how it works so much better than vaseline, but the ingredients are different.  </li>
            <li>My cracked heels were gone and my hands are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I also have a jar that I use to keep my feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This ointment goes on smoothly and keeps your skin feeling soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working great for me lately for these reasons.  </li>
            <li>Works really well to keep psoriasis from flaring up!</li>
            <li>It is greasy at first</li>
            <li>This stuff heals very well!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;but need time to absorb through skin, i wouldnt touch her when she just first apply it within  1 hour.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to wash my feet immediately with soap first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>and it ribs in pretty well.</li>
            <li>She has to basically lather up with it every night after her bath, but her skin looks a lot better and is not nearly as red or itchy when she is applying it twice a day like she should be.  </li>
            <li>My hands are either in hot water or under a hot dryer all day.</li>
            <li>I slathered this on the soles, heels and toes one night, and the next morning they were smooth as, well you know, &#x27;a baby&#x27;s bottom&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper here!</li>
            <li>I use this as diaper rash cream, because I have found that it works 100 times better than the Desitin or generic brands, even the maximum strength.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Also good for lips in harsh weather.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is great stuff so this big bottle comes in handy, only con is that it&#x27;s messy like a vaseline jar</li>
            <li>My skin feel much better especially my legs and feet which seems to be more dry during the winter.</li>
            <li>I use as a lotion because it&#x27;s easy on the skin and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a special offer noting that it&#x27;s frequently purchased along with a rectal thermometer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I learned of your magical powers when I had my first child and you healed diaper rash....scrapes and boo boos, and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I got this ointment because of the positive reviews, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>but Aquaphor is the first ointment (including prescription ointments) that has really worked for him.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time without wearing off and I love how it has no smell or taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lazy or I&#x27;ve never come across a product that is this good.</li>
            <li>Normally, I treat a heat rash with any decent drugstore moisturizer and keep the area cool</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been a long time fan of aquaphor!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products for dry heels in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I love using this for when my skin is really dry</li>
            <li>My skin got more dry and scaly instead</li>
            <li>My dry splitting hands don&#x27;t any more.</li>
            <li>We love this for all our dry skin.</li>
            <li>We love this because we have dry skin</li>
            <li>But I believe when I finish with this large jar.</li>
            <li>I put a large amount on my hands then put the gloves on and sleep like that.</li>
            <li>It does contain some inactive ingredients that pure petroleum jelly does not, but I did not notice any added effectiveness in healing or preventing chapped skin.</li>
            <li>This is one large container, so be certain you need this much.</li>
            <li>Just discovered this and love how it helps my dry hands!</li>
            <li>I love it though for my very dry areas.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s nice that you can get to ALL the product without having to squeeze a little tube.</li>
            <li>Great for winter dry skin, on the hands and other spots.</li>
            <li>Actual doctor recommendation  for extreme winter dry skin &amp; great immediate results!  </li>
            <li>This is a huge jar and will last quite some time.</li>
            <li>I use this for my daughter because her face and hands get really chapped in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Product,  reasonable.</li>
            <li>and it really helps heal my hands fast</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and keeps you moisturized for days after.</li>
            <li>Use this it really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s also very embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>I use after getting out of the shower/bath; that way your skin can really absorb it.</li>
            <li>I was ready to claw my face off, they were so chapped.</li>
            <li>Perfect product to aid skin in this cold weather .</li>
            <li>It works really well on wind-chapped skin also.</li>
            <li>Really keep the moisture.</li>
            <li>can be very greasy too</li>
            <li>It really works miracles.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I found this Aquaphor does help my feet which have been very cracked and bleeding a lot.  </li>
            <li>Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oilly.</li>
            <li>Lotion doesn&#x27;t do much for you?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>(Much lower than in the pharmacy for that size).  </li>
            <li>and it has really helped.</li>
            <li>my whole family has yet to experience.</li>
            <li>For those that feel it is too greasy, how much are you using?</li>
            <li>I find that it absorbs very rapidly,&lt;br</li>
            <li>and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I found that it works really great to apply a thin coat to my face before going out on a windy day in the winter.</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>It really helps soothe dry/cracked/irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>Very cost-effective,Put on the skin is very moist.</li>
            <li>Really cleared up my excema.  </li>
            <li>My kids have eczema and Aquaphor helps so much.  </li>
            <li>I have found that it heals burns and cuts so much faster when you liberally use it.</li>
            <li>Works very well on kid&#x27;s scars and rashes</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>really drys them out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Says it really helps their skin.</li>
            <li>This product is really greasy</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even notice that much difference in my hands.  </li>
            <li>It is as advertised - very think.  </li>
            <li>This is the consistency of vaseline which she loves, but I don&#x27;t like so much.</li>
            <li>I much prefer another product by Eucerin which is their Intensive Repair lotion.</li>
            <li>but it is so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I was applying it for her over a weeks time and found I never had such smooth hands.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I was my hands way too much</li>
            <li>Really helps my psoriosis</li>
            <li>THis works very well and is healing for affected skin as well</li>
            <li>the kind that itch and sting especially in winter, look no further.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising, because it is so thick and oily.  </li>
            <li>but are not as good and thick</li>
            <li>I say to all my friends who want to use all natural products sometimes science does it right.  </li>
            <li>Not much to say other than this product is great.</li>
            <li>What can I say, keep the baby from becoming a dry leaf and keeps mommie and daddy&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li>A little dab of this and you can rub it in and spread it a long way - it is also water resistant,  so it lasts better than most lotions.  </li>
            <li>this one made a significant impact I only wish I had before and after pictures!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little greasy/oily, but works great and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might work out just fine in the long run.</li>
            <li>If there is a product that says I&#x27;m going to have clear skin (not this ultra oily acne prone skin) or beautiful Victoria Secret model</li>
            <li>This tub last a long time, so even though it seems kind of pricey</li>
            <li>I really like this &amp; highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I am so dry that I actually use my favorite body cream right after a shower</li>
            <li>This keeps my feet soft always, which isn&#x27;t easy in a dry, hot climate.</li>
            <li>This is a great ointment especially if you have had a facial peel or have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I got this because, I was told this was good for rough dry feet.</li>
            <li>Comes in handy when skin gets red and dry.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried multiple lotions and creams and this works quickly and very well.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it runs more expensive than I would like, I think I got a good deal on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>aware of the really frequent price changes on this item.</li>
            <li>All in all though its a great product, especially for those with extremely dry skin that other products tend to be less effective on.</li>
            <li>The economy packaging means it will last a long time (good for home use) and is much cheaper than tubes or smaller containers.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is good for itching and dry skin, among other uses.  </li>
            <li>However, it does as it claims; this is a fabulous treatment for dry winter hands.</li>
            <li>(This is the same exact stuff as the &amp;#34;Baby Aquaphor&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I first bought this when I got my first big tattoo.</li>
            <li>I also have a mild case of psoriasis and this ointment is the only thing that keeps it under control.</li>
            <li>and I was about to call and return and something told me to read the ingredients and compare the one I have at home and sure enough the ingredients are the same.</li>
            <li>Only thing I have been able to find that actually heals the cracks in my heels!</li>
            <li>We use this daily with our little children and it helps keep their skin strong and smooth.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE WITH THESE TYPES OF SORES.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Recommended highly.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>highly recommend this ointment.</li>
            <li>Will continue use &amp; highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The cost of Aquaphor was always high compared to Vaseline</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also highly recommend it for children&#x27;s diaper rashes because it clears that up in hours.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products, this IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>Same as any other kind of protreoleom jelly.</li>
            <li>Very good, my heels useless cracking a few days just fine.</li>
            <li>DOES-SO OK IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE GREASY</li>
            <li>Love this product for my lips, I put it in little gloss containers.</li>
            <li>skin is so incredibly soft!!</li>
            <li>it feels a bit greasy when first applied, so don&#x27;t plan any fine tasks for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry flaky skin that is sensitive and easily irritated.  </li>
            <li>My usually dry skin has stayed very soft and smooth using this strategy.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really make a difference, but it did make my hands soft</li>
            <li>We&#x27;d have a bunch of happy people walking around and how could you go wrong there?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is working very well to keep my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is something we will have to use daily on our sons face but its worth it to have normal looking skin.</li>
            <li>For this reason, many of my friends keep quiet about the strange births that they have had.</li>
            <li>Nice thick ..</li>
            <li>Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li>Recently I applied it to a crack near my finger nail and it helped to heal it quickly.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product and definitely recommend it to anyone who has dry, cracked, itchy skin issues.</li>
            <li>the next day, my hands are super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have dry and cracked lips constantly, I have tried so many chap sticks</li>
            <li>This one works much better than just plain aquaphor.  </li>
            <li>Right now I am greasy enough to slip through your fingers!</li>
            <li>my opinion, it&#x27;s great for fixing winter dryness or wind-chapped areas but it can&#x27;t be used frequently as an all-over deep conditioning moisture--what I was looking for--without serious trade-offs.</li>
            <li>After a week, her legs look like new and they feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this healing ointment.  </li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>its like a new layer of skin.</li>
            <li>I cant live without this for my son who have a skin problem.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>The babies usually live a day or two before they stop breathing.    </li>
            <li>I rub it on my feet, put on socks for a couple of hours, take them off and go to bed and have new feet in the morning.</li>
            <li>The only thing I have to be careful with is washing my hands after using this, before touching my face.</li>
            <li>my whole life, clear into adult hood.  </li>
            <li>Helps super dry skin without any irritation if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>As a healthcare professional who deals with a lot of skin consultations, I highly recommend Aquaphor for all kids of skin abrasions and problems.  </li>
            <li>No scent either which is great for me because I&#x27;m a little sensitive to heavy scents.</li>
            <li>It works on chapped lips, diaper rash, minor burns, cracked and dry skin, etc., like magic.  </li>
            <li>My skin and lips sometimes get chronically dry and aquaphor works like magic and keeps your skin moisturizer for so long (while it is on) and heals it after it is wiped off.</li>
            <li>My son has Eczema and no other cream worked as better as this.&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor is a wonder cream, its thick jelly-like texture stays on the skin for more time than any other cream I have tried.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>However, I only use it at night, because it is pretty greasy.</li>
            <li>Let me first start off by saying this is probably my 2nd review I ever wrote.</li>
            <li>the product I was getting would be yellow sticky paste, exactly the color, consistency and smell of vaseline.</li>
            <li>I finally bought this product and an hour after the first application I found relief.</li>
            <li>stuff definitely does work, and fast!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return it because it appears the ingredients are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was gross to use a tub instead of a tube</li>
            <li>The first time I tried for several days applying this but stopped after it made my hands itch to the point I was scratching off skin.</li>
            <li>i quickly noticed it results probably because i have very dry skin</li>
            <li>main complaint is the screw top design.</li>
            <li>This ointment really helps with the dry skin on my legs and feet (really all over my body).</li>
            <li>We use it right after baths and apply as needed when they get dry or itchy.</li>
            <li>One of the few more surprises that really handles my dry skin</li>
            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered such a large container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this product would work just as well for other areas of dry skin.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor helps soothe dry skin on my infant son better than any other product.  </li>
            <li>DERMATOLOGY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED FOR DRY SKIN, WORKS BETTER THAN OTHER PRODUCTS I&#x27;VE TRIED.</li>
            <li>This container will last me a very long time, and I want it to stay clean.</li>
            <li>tub is huge, especially since you only need a tiny bit of this.  </li>
            <li>The choice is clear...</li>
            <li>Just to clear things up.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one I can say really does what they say it does.</li>
            <li>wow, my wife and my dad like it.</li>
            <li>It keeps my feet so soft.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is apply frequently.</li>
            <li>I just put it on my Diabetic feet and than put socks on over it and by morning my feet are refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>I use this for my 3 year olds eczema, it is really the only thing that helps his skin not crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin in the winter, and I use it on cuts and burns too for the family.</li>
            <li>I have used Aquaphor since I was about 12 years old on my lips in the winter in WNY.  </li>
            <li>Because of the intense scratching, she was starting to bruise and scar her legs.  </li>
            <li>One application before bedtime and you&#x27;ll wake up with soft and itch-free skin.</li>
            <li>A big pot, very cost-effective</li>
            <li>Well Aquaphor made my skin soft and glowing like</li>
            <li>I had one of those 2 days ago and it is completely gone today after wearing Aquaphor on my face overnight.</li>
            <li>She always returns to this product because t&#x27;s stable for her sensitive face.  </li>
            <li>My 3 yr old son has eczema and he has a stubborn area on his face.</li>
            <li>Within 2 days it was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>the skin under my eyes hasn&#x27;t felt this plump since I was in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>We use this for our 4 year old kid.</li>
            <li>We knew that it would be, but were surprised at our hands cracking in places they never had before.</li>
            <li>Wow...  works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>BUT 5 times as much as the tube at only twice the cost.</li>
            <li>Our baby girl has really soft skin.  </li>
            <li>oh so soft.</li>
            <li>Also, products I&#x27;ve bought and used from Amazon, if they turned out to have a negative affect, I&#x27;ve been able to return for a refund.</li>
            <li>Keeps their skin clear eczema and soft.</li>
            <li>I let my 12 yrs old use it</li>
            <li>This is the only product that really works!&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 12 year old daughter who has eczema.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by my pediatrician for my 6 year old son.  </li>
            <li>In the morning my cracked/dry hands feel soft and healed.</li>
            <li>It really does work if used properly.</li>
            <li>and my hands are soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>Frequent hand washing and house chores do not help either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the WalMart knock-off: no where near the quality of Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li>The most common defects have been \\&quot;jelly fish babies\\&quot;, born with no bones and with transparent skin.</li>
            <li>Wow it works wonders and I will swear by it.</li>
            <li>(he is now 2 years old) at the suggestion of his physician.  </li>
            <li>Wake up in the morning with soft feet.</li>
            <li>I am now going back to \\&quot;Lubriderm Intense Skin Repair Lotion\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Does a great job and is not quite as thick or messy as this.</li>
            <li>I also use it whenever I, or anyone in my family shows the first sign of dry  or chapped skin.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of Aquaphor can be a little messy since it&#x27;s similar to petroleum jelly and doesn&#x27;t absorb right away, leaving you with a greasy coating on your hands that gets everywhere unless you let it &amp;#34;dry.&amp;#34; But the one thing that I love about Aquaphor over normal petroleum jelly is the fact that it heals the cracks in my skin almost overnight, and continues to treat it.</li>
            <li>The dry weather where I live really dries up my skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain water like other lotions, so you&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>yet there are other ingredients which make it extra rich for the skin.  </li>
            <li>recommended back in the 90&#x27;s for super deep conditioning face after medical peels etc.</li>
            <li>My wife is pretty picky when it comes to body lotion products, and this is one of the few that she really likes.</li>
            <li>its  very thick, good to put on at bedtime, but you need socks to keep it off the bed sheets, or gloves for dry hands.</li>
            <li>We live in a Morgellan world and it could get worse because of Fukushima i.e. more problems that can&#x27;t be solved.    </li>
            <li>If you are someone that has a cracked or dry skin issue then get this large tub.  </li>
            <li>Finally got the right product to use on calloused, dry feet.</li>
            <li>Woke up the next day with brand new hands.  </li>
            <li>It works great to help heal the red, cracked skin from the winter cold.  </li>
            <li>It really helps dry skin.</li>
            <li>really heals up those dry feet or hands over night.</li>
            <li>really help my sons dry skin</li>
            <li>and it really helps soothe his dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>Aquaphor really softens dry and cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter has dry skin and this product really helps.</li>
            <li>gets dry finger cracks in winter and this really helps</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it took a few days for this to arrive from Amazon, I was using a moisturizer on the burned areas, which wasn&#x27;t really doing much.  </li>
            <li>It makes my toes look so much smoother &amp; healthier (especially around the nail bed) when I am wearing open-toed shoes, and it definitely does repair the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is too much like Vaseline but more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I normally put it on before bed and mix in a little bit of my powerful prescription topical medication, and it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothes with oily residue.  </li>
            <li>I gave this only 3 stars because I don&#x27;t see any difference between this and regular generic pure petroleum jelly as far as function, texture, or results.</li>
            <li>No other ointment compares to this treatment.</li>
            <li>Heals diaper rash like no other.</li>
            <li>This ointment cleared him up when no other thing could, even prescriptions.  </li>
            <li>Two kids with eczema in beautiful, cold, dry Colorado.  </li>
            <li>really has changed the appearance and feel of my very dry legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>It covers his right cheek and travels above his lip on to the other cheek.</li>
            <li>I love this because the jar lasts a long time, and little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Clearly, its the second choice.</li>
            <li>but since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough cannot really tell as yet</li>
            <li>Definitely keeps your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I had a real problem with rough balls</li>
            <li>I barely see a difference</li>
            <li>I have heals that were so cracked I could barely walk.  </li>
            <li>Got rid of my sons cradle cap almost instantly at 5 months old.</li>
            <li>so far no improvement but used it only for a couple of months as yet.</li>
            <li>I tried every natural oil I have -- Emu, rosehip, tons of aloe from the actual plant etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but it seems to work.  </li>
            <li>Messy but worth it.</li>
            <li>Neither product cured the problem but both alleviated symptoms and decreased discomfort.</li>
            <li>Really helps with dry, chapped or cracked skin - especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>for locking in moisture, I use it in heavy amounts as chap stick right before bed</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why only Americans are blessed with the opportunity to get free supplies of this and other creams owned by the German company - I don&#x27;t  know if German or European ichthyosis sufferers are getting the same deal.    </li>
            <li>my faithful use of this product has brought positive remarks from my health providers about how well my skin is holding up compared to the average.  </li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and Aquaphor Ointment has really helped with the extreme dryness and itching.</li>
            <li>I may not use it as much in the summer heat but in the other season like fall and winter</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have the very medicinal smell that the other creams do.</li>
            <li>I occasionally use a little of this in my vagina, which is rare.</li>
            <li>I liked the moisturizing healing effect, but a little oily and slow dissolving.</li>
            <li>i have used everything from high end creams to home remedies for my very dry skin (cracked lips, eczema patches, inflamed/pus forming skin lesions) on my face, neck and arms.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert southwest and my feet are always really dry.  </li>
            <li>It was highly recommended by the doctors at the center.</li>
            <li>It is not absorbed by the skin readily and it leaves a greasy film on the skin for some time after.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, he doesn&#x27;t know much about how much women&#x27;s face products cost because this is a steal considering what it is capable of.  </li>
            <li>but also when I get a tattoo for the first few days after.</li>
            <li>I have used it for diaper rash, dry skin, and sores around my 6 year old&#x27;s mouth (from licking his lips).  </li>
            <li>It soothes and completely fixes my dry cracked lips.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my lips to keep them soft, and it heals dry &amp; cracked skin on your feet.  </li>
            <li>They stay soft and are no longer dry</li>
            <li>Mine were so dry and now are baby soft.</li>
            <li>It is very expensive to buy in the more convenient tubes -- this tub makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve tried that works to make my dry, cracked hands soft again.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s calmed my dry, cracked hand and bring my soft hand back</li>
            <li>Aquaphor is the only thing that works on my dry eyelids, though I am starting to try some natural alternatives to petroleum.</li>
            <li>A must have for very dry, sensitive skin and burns.</li>
            <li>My kids have sensitive skin that gets very dry.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and (in my opinion) it&#x27;s a little nicer feeling than Vasoline.  </li>
            <li>This helps to moisturize his skin so much, yes it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but it does the job</li>
            <li>You only need a little at a time or it is too greasy, but it has really helped with the cracking on our hands.</li>
            <li>It is the only ointment that really work for my severe dry skin due to my Psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>There have been some good ones some bad ones &amp; some smelly ones.</li>

            <li> Well Aquaphor is kind of like that;  diaper rash - use aquaphor; eczema - use aquaphor; a burn - use aquaphor.  </li>
            <li> when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;-Thick and sticky, it doesn&#x27;t leave a nice texture after it&#x27;s been applied</li>
            <li> recommended by my dermatologist for all kind skin use</li>
            <li> Have even looked for recipes to make my own face creams and body lotions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is just a short-term effect or not, but I&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
            <li> This ointment is really effective.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> I used the kind of gloves that come with hair color.</li>
            <li> this size lasts me for a couple years, and really handy to keep in the house.</li>
            <li> how effective it is and if it will heel my cracked</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff with a whole slew of uses.  </li>
            <li> Also, great to mix 1:1 with maalox and zinc oxide to make a super diaper cream.</li>
            <li> I love it! :)</li>
            <li> I have a lot of tattoos, some of which I have won competitions with, and I have found that this stuff works the BEST BY FAR!</li>
            <li> I can say is WOW and AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> But the ointment absorbs and your skin will feel wonderful, soft, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> In the interim, this keeps the tootsies soft and happy!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and my favorite eczema symptom-clearer.</li>
            <li> I do like Vaseline, but this is more effective.</li>
            <li> Very effective product in a jar of the right size, for use this winter season.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.</li>
            <li> but if you put it on immediately after shower/bath while skin is damp, it easily soaks into your skin and makes it feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice size jar for easy access.</li>
            <li> Great for people of all ages and great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> excellent stuff, shipping is super fast like always.</li>
            <li> This stuff cleared up some skin problems that I&#x27;ve had for months in just days, thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li> It is sucked into my skin :)  </li>
            <li> better than prescription medicine</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> A lot of our friends have used this too for many years but didn&#x27;t tell us about it.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor serves many purposes.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love this ointment.</li>
            <li> Love Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> it goes on nice and smooth</li>
            <li> After spending a fortune for specialized creams and lotions without being satisfied, I tried Aquaphor and it worked quite well.  </li>
            <li> My mom was a nurse in an oncologists office for more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice under lipstick to help create a smooth finish and keep the lipstick from drying out your lips.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a great product for her to have on hand and the price was better than my local target and walmart, so it was a great buy with free shipping.</li>
            <li> This works so much better than Vaseline…and it works overnight.  </li>
            <li> so I heeded his advice about this product and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My feet feel better than they have been in many years, they are healing quite will.  </li>
            <li> i always use it on my skin before i go to sleep :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are germs under and around my nails that are getting transferred to the rest of the lotion</li>
            <li> It was purchased on an impulse and like most impulse buys, it does not deliver as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this ointment,  </li>
            <li> Most products don&#x27;t change my life and most products</li>
            <li> Better to be used for healing.</li>
            <li> Much better than the tube version.</li>
            <li> It has also help me to prevent any more cracked skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> MANY SO CALLED GUARANTEED TO WORK CREAMS</li>
            <li> He put this ointment on his hands and was able to fist his hands by morning.  </li>
            <li> We have been using it for more than 2 years now and it has worked well.</li>
            <li> but the reality is, you only get two hands, so why not give them the best.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care to be more elaborate about how well the product performs.</li>
            <li> I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be more like lotion.</li>
            <li> It is more like Petroleum Jelly than lotion.</li>
            <li> With the help of hydroxine, his skin has been doing so much better.</li>
            <li> Absorbs better than the creme.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; will continue to use this stuff forever .</li>
            <li> His skin has gotten so much better.</li>
            <li> Overtime my feet look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> We have tried many, many things</li>
            <li> The relief from itching is a blessing and his legs look much, much better.  </li>
            <li> The best daily, moisturizing treatment for feet...</li>
            <li> It is definitely more of a consistency of vaseline than a lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for three days and love it already.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff:  much better than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> I got turned on to Aquaphor by my doctor years ago and am in love with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Spreads well and protects better.  </li>
            <li> It is more costly, yes...</li>
            <li> Not 100% sure if it is this or just her since we haven&#x27;t used anything else.</li>
            <li> Never found better</li>
            <li> Better than petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite winter moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I worked in a tubing plant more than 25 years ago.</li>
            <li> But, since using Aquaphor, they have lightened, and my skin stays more moisturized.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a thinner Vaseline, and seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> then start rubbing, adding more as needed.</li>
            <li> I love its creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I used this three times and... all better.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be safe to get in the shower with greasy slippery feet, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to sit in the tub with this stuff in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sure I might be able to will this to my kids.  </li>
            <li> I will b ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aguaphor Ointment for many years.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Chapped lips, owies (our pediatrician recommended this over neosporin!) and most of all....butt cream for the baby.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to spend more time washing your hands than putting the stuff on.</li>
            <li> and I am glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent for baby bottom, has helped stave off diaper rash several times!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Works like magic.</li>
            <li> I would recommend AGAINST buying a tub if you use it for this purpose - if you need to grab more after you have already touched your tattoo</li>
            <li> My hands were cracking and bleeding and no lotion or oil could make it better.</li>
            <li> After 3 days, my hands were smooth again!</li>
            <li> It FEELS like petroleum jelly, SMELLS like petroleum jelly, but costs MUCH more than petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> If you use it, make sure to leave it on the feet for a bit (I sit in the recliner with a towel on the footrest) before putting on socks or walking.  </li>
            <li> If used correctly and often I have no scabbing and won&#x27;t need a touch up :)</li>
            <li> Vaseline seems to be more of a surface thing.  </li>
            <li> I think this cream is more of a ... not a placebo -</li>
            <li> My doc was okay with putting this on my baby any time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> It works well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate them more, like some things can.</li>
            <li> Better than Vaseline; keeps my skin lubricated.</li>
            <li> been using it on my tattoos and love  </li>
            <li> the product will be ordering it again if i need any more</li>
            <li> Love love love it.  </li>
            <li> I just use it on lip and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This is magic.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied, feel good。</li>
            <li> okay</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound like one of those people on an infomercial</li>

            <li> Love Aquaphor, works very will with my skin.  </li>
            <li> The bomb for keeping feet nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Vaseline, after all, is labeled as nothing more than what it really is, i.e. &amp;#34;petroleum jelly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this creme is also good for deep anal penitration hehe</li>
            <li> The hospital used this and really raved about it like it&#x27;s some magic cure or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 5 star item, just SO large!!  </li>
            <li> The express is so quickly then others.</li>
            <li> It is a petroleum jelly-type product only a bit more moist so that it dissolves into your skin as well as protecting on top.  </li>
            <li> Last year, I got the mother of all heat rashes that became more and more inflamed as the days went on.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> any time my hand eczema flares up, I let this sit on my hands overnight, and it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> Helps alleviate a bit of the annoyance of mild eczema</li>
            <li> I find this to be a tremendous deal.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> All you need to do is just put on a nice amount of the ointment and put on a nice heavy pair of socks.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly from seller.</li>
            <li> Great for very dry feet &amp; elbows!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, its used mainly to maintain soft, smooth and callus free feet and to keep elbows and knees smooth and well moisturized (no ashy body parts allowed)</li>
            <li> Vaseline is not as good as it use to be but whereever you apply Aquaphor, it stays on for a long time and keep the area moist, relieves itching.</li>
            <li> love this cream, can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> Great deal at -40%, less greasy than Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> The efficacy is just as good with dry skin as when you apply it after a shower when you skin is still damp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, excellent results and long lasting moisture retention.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Aquaphor for my lips and dry skin spots.</li>
            <li> It heals and protects dry skin and it makes your skin feel good.  </li>
            <li> Also good if you have dry patchy skin or elbows</li>
            <li> Lubriderm had worked for my dry skin condition for years but after hearing Dr Oz say that Aquapher was so good I had to try it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d probably be better off buying a jar of body butter, which is also less greasy and just overall more pleasant.</li>
            <li> My feet feel better after 2 days - wow!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other Eucerin products that I liked, but feel cheated by this one!</li>
            <li> Huge jar.. Think a blue magic hair grease jar.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my lips every night before bed and always rock soft non-dry lips - who doesn&#x27;t love that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best for spot treating or thin applications.</li>
            <li> You will look nuts but it will be so worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Stains the sheets a bit, but it&#x27;s worth the healing powers of this product.</li>
            <li> it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I keep trying to find something more natural.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice size and will last a longer time than anything else that I have tried.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth mentioning that it will stain your clothes.  </li>
            <li> This is the top lotion for kids &amp; adult with eczema.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price, lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> ; I have psoriasis and it&#x27;s great for this in addition to other things because it has eased some pain/bleeding/and softens the patches so much.</li>
            <li> This product did not resolve the problem but it works much better than most other things I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This is also good for other uses, like lips, knees and elbows...</li>
            <li> but the price is right.</li>
            <li> I guess the hospital was right</li>
            <li> so it does not absord into your skin right away.</li>
            <li> and she was so right.  </li>
            <li> We use it right out of the shower to lock in moisture.</li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> Before using Aquaphor, I like many others, I&#x27;m sure, read both the positive and negative reviews, but I took a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I contacted them and had a new lid very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great big tub for less on amazon gotta love it.</li>
            <li> I actually feel like a different person, a little more confident because of how great its made my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, clears up dry and chapped skin in no time.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for dry skin.</li>
            <li> amazing for dry hands and feet</li>
            <li> good fast as expected</li>
            <li> It was more cost effective to purchase the large jars, than the small ones at the store.</li>
            <li> They would be even better if I was a little more consistent in applying this product.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel so soft and healing the rough spots very nicely.</li>
            <li> works amazing for my dry skin !</li>
            <li> It might work overnight just fine, but I couldn&#x27;t even get that far with this product.</li>
            <li> Is much better than vasoline, serves the same purpose only better.</li>
            <li> This helps so much with my eczema!</li>
            <li> figured I just buy this big tub since it was more cost-effective.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is the best over the counter treatment I have found to help sooth the angry psoriasis patches.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost clear, a light off-white color to it.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely repeat.</li>
            <li> This is not a lotion or a cream, but an ointment, very similar to Vaseline in appearance and consistency, but much more healing and protective of your skin.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Great for pressure ulcers on my mom&#x27;s bottom and don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s too greasy for my hands, reminds me of a thick petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> It really works and works well!</li>
            <li> and I really hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I first heard of Aquaphor when my grandmother was in the hospital.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly on my hands and face, and my skin looks and feels younger and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wow, bring it on, even though it costs 50% more than a similar quantity of the pedestrian Vaseline brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nurses, who wash their hands a LOT, were the first to recommend this to me.</li>
            <li> I have recommended  it to several of my friends, they bought it and love it too.</li>
            <li> It only requires the tiniest dab on most anything and that does not lend itself to being greasy.</li>
            <li> was my first time using this product.  </li>
            <li> We first used this product for my son&#x27;s baby acne, and have been using it on him since then.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for maintaining soft feet, with no cracks or callouses.</li>
            <li> I put it on my whole face before applying my laura mercier tinted moisturizer before going to work, my face looks dewy/healthy and not in a greasy way!</li>
            <li> Both my wife and myself are pleased with the results, it takes daily routines to get the callous to disappear though we are seeing improvement.,</li>
            <li> get duped by the label &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; for I believe it costs several dollars more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why or how it works so much better than vaseline, but the ingredients are different.  </li>
            <li> My cracked heels were gone and my hands are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I also have a jar that I use to keep my feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This ointment goes on smoothly and keeps your skin feeling soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great for me lately for these reasons.  </li>
            <li> Works really well to keep psoriasis from flaring up!</li>
            <li> It is greasy at first</li>
            <li> This stuff heals very well!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;but need time to absorb through skin, i wouldnt touch her when she just first apply it within  1 hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to wash my feet immediately with soap first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> and it ribs in pretty well.</li>
            <li> She has to basically lather up with it every night after her bath, but her skin looks a lot better and is not nearly as red or itchy when she is applying it twice a day like she should be.  </li>
            <li> My hands are either in hot water or under a hot dryer all day.</li>
            <li> I slathered this on the soles, heels and toes one night, and the next morning they were smooth as, well you know, &#x27;a baby&#x27;s bottom&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper here!</li>
            <li> I use this as diaper rash cream, because I have found that it works 100 times better than the Desitin or generic brands, even the maximum strength.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Also good for lips in harsh weather.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is great stuff so this big bottle comes in handy, only con is that it&#x27;s messy like a vaseline jar</li>
            <li> My skin feel much better especially my legs and feet which seems to be more dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> I use as a lotion because it&#x27;s easy on the skin and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a special offer noting that it&#x27;s frequently purchased along with a rectal thermometer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned of your magical powers when I had my first child and you healed diaper rash....scrapes and boo boos, and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I got this ointment because of the positive reviews, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> but Aquaphor is the first ointment (including prescription ointments) that has really worked for him.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time without wearing off and I love how it has no smell or taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy or I&#x27;ve never come across a product that is this good.</li>
            <li> Normally, I treat a heat rash with any decent drugstore moisturizer and keep the area cool</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been a long time fan of aquaphor!  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for dry heels in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I love using this for when my skin is really dry</li>
            <li> My skin got more dry and scaly instead</li>
            <li> My dry splitting hands don&#x27;t any more.</li>
            <li> We love this for all our dry skin.</li>
            <li> We love this because we have dry skin</li>
            <li> But I believe when I finish with this large jar.</li>
            <li> I put a large amount on my hands then put the gloves on and sleep like that.</li>
            <li> It does contain some inactive ingredients that pure petroleum jelly does not, but I did not notice any added effectiveness in healing or preventing chapped skin.</li>
            <li> This is one large container, so be certain you need this much.</li>
            <li> Just discovered this and love how it helps my dry hands!</li>
            <li> I love it though for my very dry areas.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s nice that you can get to ALL the product without having to squeeze a little tube.</li>
            <li> Great for winter dry skin, on the hands and other spots.</li>
            <li> Actual doctor recommendation  for extreme winter dry skin &amp; great immediate results!  </li>
            <li> This is a huge jar and will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> I use this for my daughter because her face and hands get really chapped in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Product,  reasonable.</li>
            <li> and it really helps heal my hands fast</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and keeps you moisturized for days after.</li>
            <li> Use this it really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s also very embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> I use after getting out of the shower/bath; that way your skin can really absorb it.</li>
            <li> I was ready to claw my face off, they were so chapped.</li>
            <li> Perfect product to aid skin in this cold weather .</li>
            <li> It works really well on wind-chapped skin also.</li>
            <li> Really keep the moisture.</li>

            <li> Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oilly.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> (Much lower than in the pharmacy for that size).  </li>
            <li> and it has really helped.</li>
            <li> my whole family has yet to experience.</li>
            <li> For those that feel it is too greasy, how much are you using?</li>
            <li> I find that it absorbs very rapidly,&lt;br</li>
            <li> and really like it.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t even notice that much difference in my hands.  </li>
            <li> It is as advertised - very think.  </li>
            <li> This is the consistency of vaseline which she loves, but I don&#x27;t like so much.</li>
            <li> I much prefer another product by Eucerin which is their Intensive Repair lotion.</li>
            <li> but it is so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I was applying it for her over a weeks time and found I never had such smooth hands.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I was my hands way too much</li>
            <li> Really helps my psoriosis</li>
            <li> THis works very well and is healing for affected skin as well</li>
            <li> the kind that itch and sting especially in winter, look no further.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprising, because it is so thick and oily.  </li>
            <li> but are not as good and thick</li>
            <li> I say to all my friends who want to use all natural products sometimes science does it right.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say other than this product is great.</li>
            <li> What can I say, keep the baby from becoming a dry leaf and keeps mommie and daddy&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li> A little dab of this and you can rub it in and spread it a long way - it is also water resistant,  so it lasts better than most lotions.  </li>
            <li> this one made a significant impact I only wish I had before and after pictures!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little greasy/oily, but works great and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might work out just fine in the long run.</li>
            <li> If there is a product that says I&#x27;m going to have clear skin (not this ultra oily acne prone skin) or beautiful Victoria Secret model</li>
            <li> This tub last a long time, so even though it seems kind of pricey</li>
            <li> I really like this &amp; highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I am so dry that I actually use my favorite body cream right after a shower</li>
            <li> This keeps my feet soft always, which isn&#x27;t easy in a dry, hot climate.</li>
            <li> This is a great ointment especially if you have had a facial peel or have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I got this because, I was told this was good for rough dry feet.</li>
            <li> Comes in handy when skin gets red and dry.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried multiple lotions and creams and this works quickly and very well.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it runs more expensive than I would like, I think I got a good deal on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> aware of the really frequent price changes on this item.</li>
            <li> All in all though its a great product, especially for those with extremely dry skin that other products tend to be less effective on.</li>
            <li> The economy packaging means it will last a long time (good for home use) and is much cheaper than tubes or smaller containers.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is good for itching and dry skin, among other uses.  </li>
            <li> However, it does as it claims; this is a fabulous treatment for dry winter hands.</li>
            <li> (This is the same exact stuff as the &amp;#34;Baby Aquaphor&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I first bought this when I got my first big tattoo.</li>
            <li> I also have a mild case of psoriasis and this ointment is the only thing that keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> and I was about to call and return and something told me to read the ingredients and compare the one I have at home and sure enough the ingredients are the same.</li>
            <li> Only thing I have been able to find that actually heals the cracks in my heels!</li>
            <li> We use this daily with our little children and it helps keep their skin strong and smooth.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE WITH THESE TYPES OF SORES.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Recommended highly.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> highly recommend this ointment.</li>
            <li> Will continue use &amp; highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The cost of Aquaphor was always high compared to Vaseline</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also highly recommend it for children&#x27;s diaper rashes because it clears that up in hours.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other products, this IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> Same as any other kind of protreoleom jelly.</li>
            <li> Very good, my heels useless cracking a few days just fine.</li>
            <li> DOES-SO OK IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE GREASY</li>
            <li> Love this product for my lips, I put it in little gloss containers.</li>
            <li> skin is so incredibly soft!!</li>
            <li> it feels a bit greasy when first applied, so don&#x27;t plan any fine tasks for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry flaky skin that is sensitive and easily irritated.  </li>
            <li> My usually dry skin has stayed very soft and smooth using this strategy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really make a difference, but it did make my hands soft</li>
            <li> We&#x27;d have a bunch of happy people walking around and how could you go wrong there?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is working very well to keep my skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is something we will have to use daily on our sons face but its worth it to have normal looking skin.</li>
            <li> For this reason, many of my friends keep quiet about the strange births that they have had.</li>
            <li> Nice thick ..</li>
            <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> Recently I applied it to a crack near my finger nail and it helped to heal it quickly.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product and definitely recommend it to anyone who has dry, cracked, itchy skin issues.</li>
            <li> the next day, my hands are super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have dry and cracked lips constantly, I have tried so many chap sticks</li>
            <li> This one works much better than just plain aquaphor.  </li>
            <li> Right now I am greasy enough to slip through your fingers!</li>
            <li> my opinion, it&#x27;s great for fixing winter dryness or wind-chapped areas but it can&#x27;t be used frequently as an all-over deep conditioning moisture--what I was looking for--without serious trade-offs.</li>
            <li> After a week, her legs look like new and they feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this healing ointment.  </li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> its like a new layer of skin.</li>
            <li> I cant live without this for my son who have a skin problem.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> The babies usually live a day or two before they stop breathing.    </li>
            <li> I rub it on my feet, put on socks for a couple of hours, take them off and go to bed and have new feet in the morning.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have to be careful with is washing my hands after using this, before touching my face.</li>
            <li> my whole life, clear into adult hood.  </li>
            <li> Helps super dry skin without any irritation if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> As a healthcare professional who deals with a lot of skin consultations, I highly recommend Aquaphor for all kids of skin abrasions and problems.  </li>
            <li> No scent either which is great for me because I&#x27;m a little sensitive to heavy scents.</li>
            <li> It works on chapped lips, diaper rash, minor burns, cracked and dry skin, etc., like magic.  </li>
            <li> My skin and lips sometimes get chronically dry and aquaphor works like magic and keeps your skin moisturizer for so long (while it is on) and heals it after it is wiped off.</li>
            <li> My son has Eczema and no other cream worked as better as this.&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor is a wonder cream, its thick jelly-like texture stays on the skin for more time than any other cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> However, I only use it at night, because it is pretty greasy.</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by saying this is probably my 2nd review I ever wrote.</li>
            <li> the product I was getting would be yellow sticky paste, exactly the color, consistency and smell of vaseline.</li>
            <li> I finally bought this product and an hour after the first application I found relief.</li>
            <li> stuff definitely does work, and fast!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it because it appears the ingredients are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was gross to use a tub instead of a tube</li>
            <li> The first time I tried for several days applying this but stopped after it made my hands itch to the point I was scratching off skin.</li>
            <li> i quickly noticed it results probably because i have very dry skin</li>
            <li> main complaint is the screw top design.</li>
            <li> This ointment really helps with the dry skin on my legs and feet (really all over my body).</li>
            <li> We use it right after baths and apply as needed when they get dry or itchy.</li>
            <li> One of the few more surprises that really handles my dry skin</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered such a large container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product would work just as well for other areas of dry skin.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor helps soothe dry skin on my infant son better than any other product.  </li>
            <li> DERMATOLOGY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED FOR DRY SKIN, WORKS BETTER THAN OTHER PRODUCTS I&#x27;VE TRIED.</li>
            <li> This container will last me a very long time, and I want it to stay clean.</li>
            <li> tub is huge, especially since you only need a tiny bit of this.  </li>
            <li> The choice is clear...</li>
            <li> Just to clear things up.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one I can say really does what they say it does.</li>
            <li> wow, my wife and my dad like it.</li>
            <li> It keeps my feet so soft.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is apply frequently.</li>
            <li> I just put it on my Diabetic feet and than put socks on over it and by morning my feet are refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> I use this for my 3 year olds eczema, it is really the only thing that helps his skin not crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin in the winter, and I use it on cuts and burns too for the family.</li>
            <li> I have used Aquaphor since I was about 12 years old on my lips in the winter in WNY.  </li>
            <li> Because of the intense scratching, she was starting to bruise and scar her legs.  </li>
            <li> One application before bedtime and you&#x27;ll wake up with soft and itch-free skin.</li>
            <li> A big pot, very cost-effective</li>
            <li> Well Aquaphor made my skin soft and glowing like</li>
            <li> I had one of those 2 days ago and it is completely gone today after wearing Aquaphor on my face overnight.</li>
            <li> She always returns to this product because t&#x27;s stable for her sensitive face.  </li>
            <li> My 3 yr old son has eczema and he has a stubborn area on his face.</li>
            <li> Within 2 days it was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> the skin under my eyes hasn&#x27;t felt this plump since I was in my early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> We use this for our 4 year old kid.</li>
            <li> We knew that it would be, but were surprised at our hands cracking in places they never had before.</li>
            <li> Wow...  works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> BUT 5 times as much as the tube at only twice the cost.</li>
            <li> Our baby girl has really soft skin.  </li>
            <li> oh so soft.</li>
            <li> Also, products I&#x27;ve bought and used from Amazon, if they turned out to have a negative affect, I&#x27;ve been able to return for a refund.</li>
            <li> Keeps their skin clear eczema and soft.</li>
            <li> I let my 12 yrs old use it</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really works!&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 12 year old daughter who has eczema.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my pediatrician for my 6 year old son.  </li>
            <li> In the morning my cracked/dry hands feel soft and healed.</li>
            <li> It really does work if used properly.</li>
            <li> and my hands are soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> Frequent hand washing and house chores do not help either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the WalMart knock-off: no where near the quality of Aquaphor.  </li>
            <li> The most common defects have been \\&quot;jelly fish babies\\&quot;, born with no bones and with transparent skin.</li>
            <li> Wow it works wonders and I will swear by it.</li>
            <li> (he is now 2 years old) at the suggestion of his physician.  </li>
            <li> Wake up in the morning with soft feet.</li>
            <li> I am now going back to \\&quot;Lubriderm Intense Skin Repair Lotion\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and is not quite as thick or messy as this.</li>
            <li> I also use it whenever I, or anyone in my family shows the first sign of dry  or chapped skin.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of Aquaphor can be a little messy since it&#x27;s similar to petroleum jelly and doesn&#x27;t absorb right away, leaving you with a greasy coating on your hands that gets everywhere unless you let it &amp;#34;dry.&amp;#34; But the one thing that I love about Aquaphor over normal petroleum jelly is the fact that it heals the cracks in my skin almost overnight, and continues to treat it.</li>
            <li> The dry weather where I live really dries up my skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain water like other lotions, so you&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> yet there are other ingredients which make it extra rich for the skin.  </li>
            <li> recommended back in the 90&#x27;s for super deep conditioning face after medical peels etc.</li>
            <li> My wife is pretty picky when it comes to body lotion products, and this is one of the few that she really likes.</li>
            <li> its  very thick, good to put on at bedtime, but you need socks to keep it off the bed sheets, or gloves for dry hands.</li>
            <li> We live in a Morgellan world and it could get worse because of Fukushima i.e. more problems that can&#x27;t be solved.    </li>
            <li> If you are someone that has a cracked or dry skin issue then get this large tub.  </li>
            <li> Finally got the right product to use on calloused, dry feet.</li>
            <li> Woke up the next day with brand new hands.  </li>
            <li> It works great to help heal the red, cracked skin from the winter cold.  </li>
            <li> It really helps dry skin.</li>
            <li> really heals up those dry feet or hands over night.</li>
            <li> really help my sons dry skin</li>
            <li> and it really helps soothe his dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor really softens dry and cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter has dry skin and this product really helps.</li>
            <li> gets dry finger cracks in winter and this really helps</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it took a few days for this to arrive from Amazon, I was using a moisturizer on the burned areas, which wasn&#x27;t really doing much.  </li>
            <li> It makes my toes look so much smoother &amp; healthier (especially around the nail bed) when I am wearing open-toed shoes, and it definitely does repair the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is too much like Vaseline but more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I normally put it on before bed and mix in a little bit of my powerful prescription topical medication, and it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothes with oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I gave this only 3 stars because I don&#x27;t see any difference between this and regular generic pure petroleum jelly as far as function, texture, or results.</li>
            <li> No other ointment compares to this treatment.</li>
            <li> Heals diaper rash like no other.</li>
            <li> This ointment cleared him up when no other thing could, even prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> Two kids with eczema in beautiful, cold, dry Colorado.  </li>
            <li> really has changed the appearance and feel of my very dry legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> It covers his right cheek and travels above his lip on to the other cheek.</li>
            <li> I love this because the jar lasts a long time, and little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Clearly, its the second choice.</li>
            <li> but since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough cannot really tell as yet</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I had a real problem with rough balls</li>
            <li> I barely see a difference</li>
            <li> I have heals that were so cracked I could barely walk.  </li>
            <li> Got rid of my sons cradle cap almost instantly at 5 months old.</li>
            <li> so far no improvement but used it only for a couple of months as yet.</li>
            <li> I tried every natural oil I have -- Emu, rosehip, tons of aloe from the actual plant etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but it seems to work.  </li>
            <li> Messy but worth it.</li>
            <li> Neither product cured the problem but both alleviated symptoms and decreased discomfort.</li>
            <li> Really helps with dry, chapped or cracked skin - especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> for locking in moisture, I use it in heavy amounts as chap stick right before bed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why only Americans are blessed with the opportunity to get free supplies of this and other creams owned by the German company - I don&#x27;t  know if German or European ichthyosis sufferers are getting the same deal.    </li>
            <li> my faithful use of this product has brought positive remarks from my health providers about how well my skin is holding up compared to the average.  </li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and Aquaphor Ointment has really helped with the extreme dryness and itching.</li>
            <li> I may not use it as much in the summer heat but in the other season like fall and winter</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have the very medicinal smell that the other creams do.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use a little of this in my vagina, which is rare.</li>
            <li> I liked the moisturizing healing effect, but a little oily and slow dissolving.</li>
            <li> i have used everything from high end creams to home remedies for my very dry skin (cracked lips, eczema patches, inflamed/pus forming skin lesions) on my face, neck and arms.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert southwest and my feet are always really dry.  </li>
            <li> It was highly recommended by the doctors at the center.</li>
            <li> It is not absorbed by the skin readily and it leaves a greasy film on the skin for some time after.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, he doesn&#x27;t know much about how much women&#x27;s face products cost because this is a steal considering what it is capable of.  </li>
            <li> but also when I get a tattoo for the first few days after.</li>
            <li> I have used it for diaper rash, dry skin, and sores around my 6 year old&#x27;s mouth (from licking his lips).  </li>
            <li> It soothes and completely fixes my dry cracked lips.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my lips to keep them soft, and it heals dry &amp; cracked skin on your feet.  </li>
            <li> They stay soft and are no longer dry</li>
            <li> Mine were so dry and now are baby soft.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive to buy in the more convenient tubes -- this tub makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve tried that works to make my dry, cracked hands soft again.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s calmed my dry, cracked hand and bring my soft hand back</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is the only thing that works on my dry eyelids, though I am starting to try some natural alternatives to petroleum.</li>
            <li> A must have for very dry, sensitive skin and burns.</li>
            <li> My kids have sensitive skin that gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and (in my opinion) it&#x27;s a little nicer feeling than Vasoline.  </li>
            <li> This helps to moisturize his skin so much, yes it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but it does the job</li>
            <li> You only need a little at a time or it is too greasy, but it has really helped with the cracking on our hands.</li>
            <li> It is the only ointment that really work for my severe dry skin due to my Psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> There have been some good ones some bad ones &amp; some smelly ones.</li>
            <li> It soothes eczema and dry skin like no other.  </li>
            <li> It goes on a little thick but warms and loosens up quickly for newly inked skin.</li>
            <li> all winter long, so far I&#x27;m please because he has dry skin.</li>
            <li> It works as promised but so does plain petroleum jelly, which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Its other key ingredients (see below) absorb the skin’s natural wound exudates, keeping the wound moist to help promote healing.[9]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this does not operate any differently/better than vaseline, and the only active ingredient in it is the same as in vaseline--</li>
            <li> gets totally messed up, cracked, cut and painful, and this aquaphor did nothing more than the normal vaseline</li>
            <li> Been using on face near the chin, where a spot tends to get itchy due to the drier and colder weather.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for face when taking winter hikes, for dry rough heels, as well as any dry skin on your entire body!</li>
            <li> Lotion is very greasy, heavy, and takes a long time to absorb in without leaving residue on everything you touch.</li>
            <li> My husband and I moved to North Central Arizona from Southern California several months ago and have found out that it is VERY dry here.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that will clear up both in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> So, this year, when my feet got extra dry and started cracking, I turned to the giant tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> lips were dry and the bottom lip split open last week.</li>
            <li> Living in an extreme cold area this product feels so good on all dry skin.  </li>
            <li> (I have a small tube that came with the jar when I bought it), I ordered it from Amazon which had it reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> If my lips were very red and bleeding (I have not experienced this since I was a child), I&#x27;d assume it would take at least a week, but again, for my own purposes, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> makes u feel like u put oil on body but absorbs fast and thn miracle no more oily feel and body stays moistured ..</li>
            <li> will last me a long time to use all this.</li>
            <li> I did a home chemical peel which apparently I left on my face too long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, for most tattoos I usually apply a very small amount of this 3-4 times a day and rub it into the skin well.</li>
            <li> I looked at several websites and found out that it was &amp;#34;hypopigmentation&amp;#34; that may or may not clear up in a year!  </li>
            <li> my face was half clear.  </li>
            <li> Definitely works for dry cracked lips, hands and even for diaper rash for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to have a ton of uses; I&#x27;ve been applying it not only on those patches on my hand, but also on dry areas on my face</li>
            <li> the only ointment that is non RX and stops eczema or dry skin type conditions.</li>
            <li> today they look less puffy and completely hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that they are bigger, I still use this for dry spots as well as for their lips.</li>
            <li> I apply this every morning to dry, cracked feet and cover with white cotton socks.  </li>
            <li> I use it only on my fingernail cuticles or extremely dry, cracked areas.</li>
            <li> His skin was so dry, it looked like he had a rash all over his chest and back.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is very greasy, like petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the only thing that has helped my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It got rid of his dry skin and keeps it moisturized daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a giant container, so you&#x27;ll have it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> I can come across a product that changes my outlook after only using it for 2 days - than I hope everyone tries it and can have those same results.</li>
            <li> By the next morning it was only lightly pink colored.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick and greasy and work extremely well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am confident that if I continue to use this as I have been, my psoriasis will be quite manageable and not something that is constantly making my life difficult!</li>
            <li> I usually use natural skin care products as much as possible, but two weeks ago my dermatologist burned off some pre-cancerous areas on my hand, and she recommended that I get the Aquaphor</li>
            <li> Seriously, as long as you&#x27;re not allergic to petrolatum or lanolin, you NEED to have this on hand.  </li>
            <li> so this jar lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Aquaphor</li>
            <li> Buy this one instead of the one marked baby to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> thank you for my purchase came in earlier than expected, and work well.</li>
            <li> can use for a long time</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is used and recommended for minor post-operative wounds or defects by health care professionals.</li>
            <li> NEVER leave a chemical peel on your face too long.  </li>
            <li> Have found nothing better than Aquaphor for healing dry lips, toddler owies, diaper rash and cold sores.</li>
            <li> Will clear up any skin problems of dry, cracked nature in a few days.</li>
            <li> the record I had previously tried Utter cream, Eucerin, baby oil, coconut oil and various lotions-</li>
            <li> We would use it on minor cuts, burns, dry skin, and our lips.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, acne prone, blackheads, white heads</li>
            <li> After trying every other product out there for my heals, this is the only one that works!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the same experience as other people.</li>
            <li> this is the only thing that worked so thankful for the other reviews which is the reason i tried it  must have for babies bottom</li>
            <li> This size tub lasts a long time as well!</li>
            <li> In privacy they give birth, not to children as we like to think of them, but to things we could only describe as &#x27;octopuses&#x27;, &#x27;apples&#x27;, &#x27;turtles&#x27; and other things in our experience.</li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive, but the jar lasts for months.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed a little slowly, but, eczema is no longer a problem.</li>
            <li> This is like petroleum jelly (I think) but even after I have put it on it doesn&#x27;t stay jelly like for very long.  </li>
            <li> Might as well just put vasoline on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles on diaper rash and for preventing it, works on cuts and dry skin.</li>

            <li> It works so well that I currently use for everyday lubrication.</li>
            <li> so being greasy is to be expected.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really not much else to say.  </li>
            <li> No real smell to it.</li>
            <li> This is basically petroleum jelly with a few extra ingredients added so it could entice people (like me) to buy it.  </li>

            <li> , my husband had very, very dry and calloused feet due to his illness.  </li>

            <li> I prefer Palmers Cocoa Butter as I think it works better and is less messy---and is less expensive!</li>
            <li> She had oxygen going through her nose and inside her nose was extremeIy raw, red, and irritated.  </li>
            <li> It stays on my skin long enough to help, and it slowly absorbs into it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> fantastic results for my husband who suffered through winters with cracked and painful hands due to dry weather.</li>
            <li> At first glance, I too thought this was like an expensive petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> Other products cause her to break out, despite their &amp;#34;cachet&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind that cuz when it DOES absorb, my skin feels softer than any other lotion</li>
            <li> has ever made it feel, and I am not shy about purchasing expensive morturizers.</li>
            <li> My husband has a chronic skin condition on his legs due to diabetes.  </li>
            <li> It arrived as expected, and packaged well!</li>
            <li> I had to wash them long and thoroughly with soap to get the heavy greasy glop off.</li>
            <li> Did not relieve extreme cracking of hands.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy any other products</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and it appears due to his food allergies.</li>
            <li> It does contain vaseline, but other products also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every other type of diaper cream and</li>
            <li> I will go back to plain Vaseline!</li>
            <li> I use a little of this on my face at night, when my face is very dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff contains much less chemicals than other brands.  </li>
            <li> My eyes also are always puffy and dark circles galore</li>
            <li> I apply it at least 3 times a day - big difference.  </li>
            <li> You use every day at least once a day especially after showering or bathing and apply all over the body</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve often spread on my face after chemical peels or when my skin is chapped from cold, or just when it is really dry, and I&#x27;ve never broken out from it.  </li>
            <li> It can actually make dry patches worse and aggravates acne and premature aging of the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically really expensive thick Vaseline full of petrochemicals and a goopy non moisturizing mess.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it and her dry skin is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks look less visible</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it caused me to break out especially on my face and upper shoulders</li>
            <li> Now, I use it in my nostrils to prevent bloody noses from yet another powerful medical treatment (Avastin).</li>
            <li> With a subscription I find the cost to be 25% less than what I can purchase it for at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> This cream is not for black skin at all.</li>
            <li> I use this along w/ gold bond lotion to make it less greasy and it leaves my skin well hydrated.  </li>
            <li> we tried just would not get rid of that mess.</li>
            <li> This past years my wife switched to Gold Bond and she regrets it:  </li>
            <li> It seem’s to have a coarsening effect and leaves hair a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my fault for not researching the ingredients first, but I&#x27;m disappointed that I spent money on this large jar of fairly useless product</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way because it&#x27;s a thick ointment.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely delicate and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a little concerned about the cleanliness of dipping into the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this works wonders to help heal their sore little hands.</li>
            <li> If lotions are failing your skin, or you find yourself applying lotion over and over with little to no relief of the dryness, Aquaphor is the answer.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky, but I can pick and choose when to use it.  </li>
            <li> me just tell you a little about my skin.</li>
            <li> This little step has helped me alot.  </li>
            <li> Its a little bit slippery,</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.  </li>
            <li> This has been my go to solution for all skin ailments since I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> It is a little greasy when you put it on but give it about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of this on my feet, and it is not greasy feeling (like vaseline).</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of this on my lips.</li>
            <li> If we have little scratches on our skin we apply this over night and within a few nights they heel up well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey though I skip a few weeks before I repurchase.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad product; just doesn&#x27;t seem worth the difference in price to me.</li>
            <li> It is obviously a heavy duty ointment....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily and heavy...</li>
            <li> In stores I can buy just a few ounces in a squeeze tube for $5.  </li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended this ointment 3 years ago, I have been using this everyday since.</li>
            <li> The imagery that&#x27;s conjured up is all about messy babies and diapers.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap even in the stores.</li>
            <li> I learned about Aquaphor when my kids were born and I used it heavily for chafing (diaper, face, etc) and for eczema.</li>
            <li> I use it on my son everyday &amp; just rub the rest into my hands when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday on my feet.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavy and greasy, but I suspect that if it wasn&#x27;t, it wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy</li>
            <li> If you want something heavy duty</li>
            <li> Slimy, gooey messy stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use this a few nights a week with some latex gloves.</li>
            <li> I use it faithfully at bedtime on hands and feet, but it&#x27;s just too messy for day use.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my chapped lips and this is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make them worse.</li>
            <li> It is heavy but it works.</li>
            <li> you will contaminate the tub with whatever dead skin is on your finger.</li>
            <li> A few applications a day</li>
            <li> It is sticky, and I hate using it for that reason however, when you are suffering with a skin issue like the intense heat rash I had, dealing with a sticky ointment was no big thing.</li>
            <li> Even the thick creamy ones that promise to heal and sooth are no match to some really extreme skin issues.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I prefer something a little less greasy and thick.</li>
            <li> It is much less expensive to buy online than in local stores.  </li>
            <li> Before I&#x27;d be cracking, flaking, and raw.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter who has very dry, chapped &amp; broken skin.  </li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer and after that I had no more cracked, dry, itchy tattoo!</li>
            <li> When I have a flare, I usually break out on my legs, stomach, arms, and sides.  </li>
            <li> It works on elbows, heels, cheeks, whatever, and usually it takes care of the problem overnight.  </li>
            <li> It is unbelievably well priced.</li>
            <li> My hands are usually cracked at this time of year.</li>
            <li> The only cream that prevents my skin from drying out uncomfortably after swimming.</li>
            <li> I usually have sore and cracked hands in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Start by rubbing a small amount into both hands and pat your hands all over your body without rubbing (arms, legs, feet, chest, butt......</li>
            <li> Usually that would take ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the small tubes for my lips, but bought the tub for smothering on him.  </li>
            <li> Within a few days, all his bumps were gone!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s tough to close the lid with this stuff on your hands, and the jar gets all greasy.</li>
            <li> Not good for black skin</li>
            <li> This is fabulous for really painful chapped lips, raw skin or any other painful skin condition</li>
            <li> The base ingredients may be different and it may go on a little creamer, but it does not work as well as petroleum jelly which cost a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> Do your hands pay the price for your hard work?  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and let me tell you</li>
            <li> A big disappointment .  </li>
            <li> too icky</li>
            <li> This stuff put on thickly at night on the lower portion of my legs</li>
            <li> Really thick and must try to not get on clothes and furniture.</li>
            <li> While the product is thick, and some may say slimy, I wouldn&#x27;t categorize it as being greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and that make you face oil shiny.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s greasy and absorbs slowly, but it works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> just dont spread it so thick and you wont even feel it.</li>
            <li> Too thick it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I bought cotton gloves to wear over this, but it&#x27;s so greasy and thick that it gets all over everything.  </li>
            <li> I put it on thick that day and night.  </li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT a more costly Vaseline!  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount helps stop the itching, scaling, spreading, dryness, soreness and overall ugly appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of minor surgeries lately and have been using this stuff like crazy to help all the stitches heal.  </li>
            <li> After a week of trying to tough it out, the heat rash became so dry that the skin on my neck became extremely cracked and made it painful to move my neck.</li>
            <li> A bit on the greasy side if you put it on your palms, but I learned to use for the palms a very small amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a must for those who get bloody noses at night due to dry weather or acutane</li>
            <li> A must have during cold dry winters</li>
            <li> Seriously, one night, rubbed it in and went to sleep.  </li>
            <li> Also, this tub is seriously a life time supply for a family of 4.</li>
            <li> I used this on my toddler who also suffers from dry skin in the winter and he improved in no time.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me that he uses Aquaphor for his daughter who suffers from dry skin and that I should try it.</li>
            <li> Seriously can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> This feels like glorified vaseline (which is much less expensive than Aquaphor).  </li>
            <li> I had a bad rash the next morning with blisters.  </li>
            <li> They just didn&#x27;t help, and left me frustrated and in pain with the itchiness and cracking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> After buying this I realized that it&#x27;s basically just petroleum jelly, which is not particularly good for the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and seriously moisturizes!</li>
            <li> I know someone who worked in cold harsh weather getting those thick deep painful cracks in the fingers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They should sell little gloves with this product to put on your hands so you don&#x27;t get everything you touch greasy!!!</li>
            <li> It gets horrible looking, rough, patchy, red skin about the size of a golf ball at times.</li>
            <li> Just to moisturize your body or the tough spots that can&#x27;t retain moisture.  </li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> Keeps her skin hydrated and it is very thick.  </li>
            <li> Using on Dr. order&#x27;s...this is like vaseline and works but have to use nightly so tired of it already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for years for something to protect them from water and the drying and flaking that makes it look so much worse than it</li>
            <li> and if I could pass on the secret I would do it in a second.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got my family addicted.</li>
            <li> The container is broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> When I received my jar the lid was broken but the seal wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use about once a week at night with a thin pair of socks.  </li>
            <li> Within two days of using the product at night I can see a dramatic difference (no cuts, hands are softer, etc).</li>
            <li> Our son, 18 months old, has always had the worst eczema and diaper rash.</li>
            <li> This is horrible ointment as far as how it reacts to my skin,, I&#x27;ve now thrown the container into the garbage can.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s just plain bad.</li>
            <li> Both jars were cracked along the seam on the bottom, I am unable to return them because there is a &amp;#34;return window&amp;#34;, even though I just started using these.</li>
            <li> The psoriasis patches aren&#x27;t quite as angry.  </li>
            <li> All it is, is expensive petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> Those irritating pimples that are like cysts that would otherwise be there for a month, went away over night!</li>
            <li> You can still faintly see the irritation of the skin but NOTHING like it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I tend to buy it when it is on sale in the pharmacy because it can be expensive and since the jar I had at home was finished</li>
            <li> Expensive, sticky but does the trick.</li>
            <li> My youngest son used to suffer terribly with dry and irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> I also apply it to my nose when I have a cold to help it heal.</li>
            <li> I have a patch of skin on my shin that was driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> My hands suffered from the cold wind and dryness in winter.</li>
            <li> Our culture and religion teach us that reproductive abnormalities are a sign that women have been unfaithful.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and hands before swimming and after my shower before going out into the cold.  </li>
            <li> Oh, how desperate I was.  </li>
            <li> Usually my hands look in terrible condition all winter and every summer.  </li>
            <li> Feets don&#x27;t Fail me now!</li>
            <li> Very expensive for a jar of hand creme</li>
            <li> I had terrible dry lips this winter after an allergic reaction to the flu shot, and just this terrible North Eastern winter we have had.  </li>
            <li> My husband has bad excema on his feet and ankles.  </li>
            <li> His feet do not look as bad as they did before trying this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema really bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am bad about faithfully using lotions and creams, but when I use this, it&#x27;s like it makes up for all of the time I wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then one site had a dermatologist who suggested Aquaphor for people if their bad peel was still in the healing stage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how this stuff worked.</li>
            <li> This product also practically instantaneously cured painful cracks on my fingers and heels during the winter.  </li>
            <li> But when your doctor says that&#x27;s the stuff for an ugly radiation rash, it must be the stuff.  </li>
            <li> A lot of women told me how burned and painful</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend it at all :(</li>
            <li> This year has been a very cold winter</li>
            <li> I hate that!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion is water base lotion (not alcohol base); therefore, it does not sting the skins when applied.  </li>
            <li> The product is horrible on my skin and made me itch so bad that I was itching my skin off!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed!</li>
            <li> I felt so horrible for him as it itched and hurt (he would often cry when we tried to put medicine on it).</li>
            <li> Horrible scam</li>
            <li> Bought this on advice of my radiation oncologist to keep my skin from drying, It was horrible.</li>
            <li> nothing else touched my sons horrible rash on his bum.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good for your skin!!</li>
            <li> A little dab of this and you can rub it in and spread it a long way - it is also water resistant,  so it lasts better than most lotions.  Great stuff</li>
            <li> I use this for my daughter because her face and hands get really chapped in the winter.  I put this on to keep her skin from getting windburn in the winter and fall.  It also heals her chapped skin overnight and she doesn&#x27;t cry that it hurts her skin, like with products that have fragrance, etc., in them.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product for helping with dry/chapped hands.... works well when using prescription(betamethasone)</li>
            <li> It is obviously a heavy duty ointment....works great takes forever to soak in..</li>
            <li> A must have for very dry, sensitive skin and burns.</li>
            <li> My youngest has eczema.  This product is our holy grail.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve tried that works to make my dry, cracked hands soft again.</li>
            <li> Might as well just put vasoline on my dry skin. Thought this was a non petroleum product.</li>
            <li> Great. Product,  reasonable. Priced.</li>
            <li> I really like this &amp; highly recommend it.  Better than the old Eucerin cream which was white &amp; also very good.</li>
            <li> A great find!  Is much better than vasoline, serves the same purpose only better.</li>
            <li> I saw Dr. Oz advertise this product on television and decided to try it.  I have not regretted it.  Definitely keeps your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about Aquaphor.  This is like petroleum jelly (I think) but even after I have put it on it doesn&#x27;t stay jelly like for very long.  It is sucked into my skin :)  It moisturizes so well after I shower; I have psoriasis and it&#x27;s great for this in addition to other things because it has eased some pain/bleeding/and softens the patches so much. It works so well.  With excema on my hands I put it on at night and put cotton gloves over and it really helps heal my hands fast (I hand wash a lot).  I know someone who worked in cold harsh weather getting those thick deep painful cracks in the fingers.  He uses this as I do (with gloves) and it has been such a great remedy for him.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR PEOPLE WITH THESE TYPES OF SORES.  The efficacy is just as good with dry skin as when you apply it after a shower when you skin is still damp.  My only issue is that it runs more expensive than I would like, I think I got a good deal on Amazon.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Both jars were cracked along the seam on the bottom, I am unable to return them because there is a &amp;#34;return window&amp;#34;, even though I just started using these.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly on my diabetic feet.  Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is awesome!!  There are so many uses for it!  I have used it for diaper rash, dry skin, and sores around my 6 year old&#x27;s mouth (from licking his lips).  It works great!  There is no smell and is good on sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles on diaper rash and for preventing it, works on cuts and dry skin. I swear by this stuff!! (This is the same exact stuff as the &amp;#34;Baby Aquaphor&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> Good to use as diaper rash cream. Also good to use as an overnight lip cream for severely chapped lips.</li>
            <li> It is the best ointment for even scars from surgery.</li>
            <li> it took a week to deliver. Product is recommended.</li>
            <li> My family loves Aquaphor. It&#x27;s especially great for your skin in the winter time.</li>
            <li> Great Item, As Described</li>
            <li> Great for very dry feet &amp; elbows!!</li>
            <li> better than prescription medicine</li>
            <li> Great buy at buy one get the second 50% off. I love the product. My son has severe dry skin and this product works great.</li>
            <li> WOW! This stuff really works and keeps you moisturized for days after. My wife and I have been trying all kinds of moisturizing products for our arms and legs. This is the only one I can say really does what they say it does. A lot of our friends have used this too for many years but didn&#x27;t tell us about it. I guess we never asked too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, excellent results and long lasting moisture retention.</li>
            <li> Using on Dr. order&#x27;s...this is like vaseline and works but have to use nightly so tired of it already.</li>
            <li> Speaking from the perspective of a lifetime of dry cracked skin, this is the best of all the OTC tratments, IMHO.</li>
            <li> Super easy transaction item as described.</li>
            <li> Have dry skin? Use this it really works. However, I only use it at night, because it is pretty greasy. I love it though for my very dry areas.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hands and arms</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> This is a good skin care cream.The express is so quickly then others.</li>
            <li> good for me，used twice and it works for my skin</li>
            <li> Very good super moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> My artist recommended I get this before we started my sleeve. It goes on a little thick but warms and loosens up quickly for newly inked skin. Dab don&#x27;t rub. Itch free heal in when used twice a day. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> wow, my wife and my dad like it. It helps heal the skins dramatically.</li>
            <li> This size with last me a few years.  LOL!  Definitely works for dry cracked lips, hands and even for diaper rash for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> We use this for everything from diaper ointment to lip moisturizer. Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel so smooth and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Great for tattoo healing!</li>
            <li> This helps so much with my eczema! The only thing I have to be careful with is washing my hands after using this, before touching my face. If I do not do this, I break out almost instantly where I touched my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, I do not recommend using this on your face.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin and I even use it for my bald head.</li>
            <li> Very good product for my father&#x27;s dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing deal. The price of this item for this size is really great! Aquaphor serves many purposes. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> love it. love it. great for all parts of body</li>
            <li> This works good for cracked feet.</li>
            <li> best stuff i have ever found for dry chapped hands</li>
            <li> This is one large container, so be certain you need this much. It&#x27;s great moisturizer for feet and toes, hands too. Very thick. It&#x27;s for ultra dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have severe itching on my legs, nothing else was working.  This is like vaseline, it stains my sheets and blankets, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Perfect for tattoo care and much cheaper then you can get in a store</li>
            <li> I usually use natural skin care products as much as possible, but two weeks ago my dermatologist burned off some pre-cancerous areas on my hand, and she recommended that I get the Aquaphor \\&quot;in a tub\\&quot; to heal them.  (I couldn&#x27;t find any explanation online as to whether or not the tub version was different than the tube version, but figured I just buy this big tub since it was more cost-effective.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it took a few days for this to arrive from Amazon, I was using a moisturizer on the burned areas, which wasn&#x27;t really doing much.  As soon as I started using the Aquaphor, I noticed a big difference in how my skin was healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tub is huge, especially since you only need a tiny bit of this.  I plan on divvying it up into smaller containers so I can keep them around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have a ton of uses; I&#x27;ve been applying it not only on those patches on my hand, but also on dry areas on my face (a result of using Carac cream to remove pre-cancerous patches also), on my lips, on my heels at night, and also on my cuticles.  It works so well to lock moisture in!</li>
            <li> I have moderately severe psoriasis.  When I have a flare, I usually break out on my legs, stomach, arms, and sides.  It&#x27;s painful.  It&#x27;s gross, because my skin peels off and cracks and bleeds.  So, it&#x27;s also very embarrassing.  Aquaphor is the best over the counter treatment I have found to help sooth the angry psoriasis patches.  I normally put it on before bed and mix in a little bit of my powerful prescription topical medication, and it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets or clothes with oily residue.  It stays on my skin long enough to help, and it slowly absorbs into it.  I wake up with the scaliness gone and the itching at a minimum.  The cracking has stopped.  The psoriasis patches aren&#x27;t quite as angry.  During the afternoon, I notice sometimes the itchiness starts returning, so I reapply without the prescription cream and it works until bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes lotions don&#x27;t work.  Even the thick creamy ones that promise to heal and sooth are no match to some really extreme skin issues.  I&#x27;ve used them all from Aveeno to Nivea to Eucerin cream lotion.  They just didn&#x27;t help, and left me frustrated and in pain with the itchiness and cracking.  If you are at your wit&#x27;s end, and you don&#x27;t know what else to try...try this.  I am confident that if I continue to use this as I have been, my psoriasis will be quite manageable and not something that is constantly making my life difficult!</li>
            <li> Always a great product!</li>
            <li> Really amazing product, can do beyond what I paid.</li>
            <li> I use after getting out of the shower/bath; that way your skin can really absorb it. It really helps dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love Aquaphor, works very will with my skin.  Non-greasy feeling.  Would recommend to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t have skin issues.</li>
            <li> I love this ointment. It keeps my feet so soft. It also works well on other severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> My go to every single night for my lips, hands, heels, etc. I have been using this product for years and it works fantastic. I put it on my lips every night before bed and always rock soft non-dry lips - who doesn&#x27;t love that?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind it&#x27;s like an ointment, so it&#x27;s not going to absorb the same as lotion. I came across it while working at a preschool and we used it on diaper rash - worked well there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a giant container, so you&#x27;ll have it for a long long time.</li>
            <li> It does help in healing eczema as well.  All you have to do is apply frequently.</li>
            <li> USED AS COMPOUNDING AGENT WITH TEA TREA OIL AND LOTRIMIN, WORKED WELL</li>
            <li> This stuff saved my lips last year when it was recommended to me. I was ready to claw my face off, they were so chapped. So, this year, when my feet got extra dry and started cracking, I turned to the giant tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, but I&#x27;m not quite sold on the delivery system. I suppose it&#x27;s nice that you can get to ALL the product without having to squeeze a little tube. On the other hand, it&#x27;s tough to close the lid with this stuff on your hands, and the jar gets all greasy. I&#x27;m also a little concerned about the cleanliness of dipping into the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, if you need a LOT of Aquaphor, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> This helps lock in moisture on my kids skin. I do find that my baby trends to overheat if I cover her head to toe in this, as it&#x27;s not very breathable. Best for spot treating or thin applications.</li>
            <li> this is excent product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> good for my daughter&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and I tend to pick my cuticles when they are that dry. This soften my skin so well that I could not pick the skin. It is a little greasy but it does absorb into the skin after a short time. It also worked wonders for my dry, cracked feet. Recommended highly.</li>
            <li> really heals up those dry feet or hands over night. I like t his product.  I just put it on my Diabetic feet and than put socks on over it and by morning my feet are refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> good fast as expected</li>
            <li> I use this for my 3 year olds eczema, it is really the only thing that helps his skin not crack and bleed.  I have tried everything, even prescription meds don&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li> Great for dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and very happy.  Thank you</li>
            <li> What I use now for years, instead of Vaseline Petroleum Jelly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I get really dry, cracked lips and this is what I use and it&#x27;s amazing! I use it on my hands, feet, cuts, anything that needs healing ointment.</li>
            <li> Perfect product to aid skin in this cold weather . Great product</li>
            <li> My hospital recommend this product for my radiation treatment. It works so well that I currently use for everyday lubrication.</li>
            <li> the only ointment that is non RX and stops eczema or dry skin type conditions. have been using for over 10 years and it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great for dry skin.  I always use it for my cracked heels.  It works really well on wind-chapped skin also. A little goes a long way because it&#x27;s a thick ointment.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for winter chapped hands.  It works great to help heal the red, cracked skin from the winter cold.  My grandchildren&#x27;s hands get so chapped in the winter months and this works wonders to help heal their sore little hands. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Best for baby&#x27;s protection!</li>
            <li> Love Aquaphor. It is a must have</li>
            <li> Good deal!  Great product</li>
            <li> My dermatologist strongly recommends Aquaphor for all skin healing. This is the only thing I use.</li>
            <li> A must have during cold dry winters</li>
            <li> Really keep the moisture.</li>
            <li> A great stable for prevention of bed sores.</li>
            <li> Best moisturiser for tattoos</li>
            <li> It does make my feet feel better but does not seem to be absorbed well.  It is 41% pentrolatum so being greasy is to be expected.</li>
            <li> This is the best ointment for every dry area. I put some in another jar for diaper ointment for my grandbabies.</li>
            <li> very nice for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquaphor for years. I use it on scabs and chapped lips it goes on nice and smooth can be very greasy too</li>
            <li> Heals tattoos in under 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY lotion I can use on my legs and not wind up with razor burn. I swear by the stuff. It&#x27;s oily and heavy... but it WORKS when nothing else would.</li>
            <li> Good product.  However, something in it causes my feet to itch.</li>
            <li> My balls are so smooth now. I had a real problem with rough balls but now they are as smooth as hell.</li>
            <li> Seriously, did you ever see &amp;#34;My big fat greek wedding&amp;#34;, you know how the dad used windex for everything. Well Aquaphor is kind of like that;  diaper rash - use aquaphor; eczema - use aquaphor; a burn - use aquaphor.  I use it on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin in the winter, and I use it on cuts and burns too for the family.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for dry heels in the winter.  After spending a fortune for specialized creams and lotions without being satisfied, I tried Aquaphor and it worked quite well.  It is very expensive to buy in the more convenient tubes -- this tub makes it very affordable.</li>
            <li> My mom was a nurse in an oncologists office for more than 20 years.  This is what the doctor she worked for recommended to his patients to treat skin damage caused by their treatment.  I have used Aquaphor since I was about 12 years old on my lips in the winter in WNY.  The last time I had chapped lips was when I was 12 (22 years ago), lol.  This stuff really works!  It&#x27;s nice under lipstick to help create a smooth finish and keep the lipstick from drying out your lips.  I also use it whenever I, or anyone in my family shows the first sign of dry  or chapped skin.  It works on elbows, heels, cheeks, whatever, and usually it takes care of the problem overnight.  It worked great to soothe my nipples when I was breastfeeding my daughter.  Seriously, as long as you&#x27;re not allergic to petrolatum or lanolin, you NEED to have this on hand.  It really works miracles.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema on her legs.  With the change in temperature to winter, her legs were extremely dry and cracked.  Because of the intense scratching, she was starting to bruise and scar her legs.  I applied Aquaphor day and night.  After a week, her legs look like new and they feel great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is actually cheaper than the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it on our legs and elbows.  I keep a tube in my purse for dry lips.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This ointment keeps my son&#x27;s eczema away and keeps him itch-free and happy. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this cream, works well in callused feet.</li>
            <li> The dry weather where I live really dries up my skin.  This product is great.  I use it on my kids during winter time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and seriously moisturizes! I like that it has lanolin in it. It&#x27;s almost clear, a light off-white color to it.</li>
            <li> MY PODIATRIST RECOMMENDED THIS.  I&#x27;VE HAD DRY SKIN ALL MY LIFE AND THIS IS THE BEST EVER.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using this product and am sold. I will most definitely repeat. It is unbelievably well priced.</li>
            <li> Perfect over the counter solution for excessively dry skin!</li>
            <li> Great for winter dry skin, on the hands and other spots.</li>
            <li> During those long winter months, when the air is very dry, if you develop dry, itchy, flaky skin, you need Aquaphor! This is not a lotion or a cream, but an ointment, very similar to Vaseline in appearance and consistency, but much more healing and protective of your skin. If lotions are failing your skin, or you find yourself applying lotion over and over with little to no relief of the dryness, Aquaphor is the answer. One application before bedtime and you&#x27;ll wake up with soft and itch-free skin. I recommend this to anyone who struggles with their skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Bought it on a recommendation .  All it is, is expensive petroleum jelly.  Check the ingredients.  My recommendation is...Go to a &#x27;dollar store&#x27; for Vaseline which is  petroleum jelly.  Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is an all around amazing ointment. Works wonders on dry, cracked, hands, feet, and lips. It soothes my daugter&#x27;s eczema, and helps with my newborn&#x27;s cradle cap.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says. Price was good, it&#x27;s the genuine article, and does everything Aquaphor is good for, healing dry, chapped, irritated, or cracked skin, be it on your baby&#x27;s bum or on your chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Got this for a care package for my mom before she started chemo. It&#x27;s been a great product for her to have on hand and the price was better than my local target and walmart, so it was a great buy with free shipping.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different lotions and moisturizers, I have become quite a cynic…but AQUAPHOR HEALING OINTMENT has made me a believer again!  It is a petroleum jelly-type product only a bit more moist so that it dissolves into your skin as well as protecting on top.  It works on chapped lips, diaper rash, minor burns, cracked and dry skin, etc., like magic.  This works so much better than Vaseline…and it works overnight.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Way to greasy - just like Vaseline!  Next time I will buy Vaseline at the cheaper price.</li>
            <li> A big pot, very cost-effective</li>
            <li> Been using on face near the chin, where a spot tends to get itchy due to the drier and colder weather. Works great in moisturizing and healing that area. Also, as a lip balm. The economy packaging means it will last a long time (good for home use) and is much cheaper than tubes or smaller containers. I have a tube when I am travelling. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> a must for those who get bloody noses at night due to dry weather or acutane</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and Aquaphor Ointment has really helped with the extreme dryness and itching. A little goes a long way so this jar lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist is the head of the dermatology department so I heeded his advice about this product and am so glad I did. I would recommend to anyone who has dry skin and/or psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Great for pressure ulcers on my mom&#x27;s bottom and don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s too greasy for my hands, reminds me of a thick petroleum jelly.  It all depends what your using it for, would be my recommendation</li>
            <li> I found this Aquaphor does help my feet which have been very cracked and bleeding a lot.  My feet feel better than they have been in many years, they are healing quite will.  I have tried many other products, this IS BY FAR THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> works amazing for my dry skin ! i always use it on my skin before i go to sleep :)&lt;br /&gt;its a must buy !</li>
            <li> This is the best healing ointment!</li>
            <li> Likes:&lt;br /&gt;-Great for locking in moisture, I use it in heavy amounts as chap stick right before bed and my lips are significantly improved over night. I also put it over CeraVe body lotion before bed. Put on sun burns and healing cuts just like you would with vaseline&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;-My main complaint is the screw top design. This container will last me a very long time, and I want it to stay clean. Even after I wash my hands I&#x27;m sure there are germs under and around my nails that are getting transferred to the rest of the lotion when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;-Thick and sticky, it doesn&#x27;t leave a nice texture after it&#x27;s been applied&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This product looks like, smells like, applies like simple vaseline. It is not absorbed by the skin readily and it leaves a greasy film on the skin for some time after. It was purchased on an impulse and like most impulse buys, it does not deliver as advertised.</li>
            <li> Hospital recommended ointment for radiation treatment burns.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I love this ointment,  I use it after every shower.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt of the packaging has been damaged items.</li>
            <li> Started using this several months ago and now couldn&#x27;t be without it.  Great on legs after shaving, heels of the feet, cuticles around the fingers, etc.  Almost no scent.  It is a little sticky, but I can pick and choose when to use it.  Really an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I use these to hydrate my tattoos after a recent inking.  In stores I can buy just a few ounces in a squeeze tube for $5.  This is an awesome value at this size!!!!</li>
            <li> really help my sons dry skin</li>
            <li> The absolutely best healing cream on the market.</li>
            <li> The skin looks greasy and leaves oily spots, so basically I cannot touch anything after applying this ointment. Don&#x27;t recommend it at all :(</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my hands caused by arthritis and inflammation.  I&#x27;ve looked for years for something to protect them from water and the drying and flaking that makes it look so much worse than it really is.&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY!!!! I found a sample of this in a magazine in my doctor&#x27;s office and it worked.  I use it daily, several times.  Just a small amount helps stop the itching, scaling, spreading, dryness, soreness and overall ugly appearance. I use it  before showering to keep shower gels and shampoo from penetrating the affected skin on my hands  and, before washing dishes. This helps healing as well as protecting your skin.  Recently I applied it to a crack near my finger nail and it helped to heal it quickly.  Usually my hands look in terrible condition all winter and every summer.  Now,they have never looked so good. If you have the same issues as I do or any type of skin condition that you need to protect from moisture, please try this.  It really works and works well!</li>
            <li> I liked the moisturizing healing effect, but a little oily and slow dissolving. Would prefer it to be easier dissolving.</li>
            <li> If you have cracked and dry legs.. the kind that itch and sting especially in winter, look no further. This stuff put on thickly at night on the lower portion of my legs really has changed the appearance and feel of my very dry legs. I am so relieved to have found something that works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record I had previously tried Utter cream, Eucerin, baby oil, coconut oil and various lotions- this one made a significant impact I only wish I had before and after pictures!</li>
            <li> best stuff ive found for quickly healing cuts and scrapes and dry skin.  Especially great for chapped lips</li>
            <li> Great product that works on my dry hands. Better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> Once or twice a year, due to the excessive dry heat outside, I get a heat rash on my neck. Last year, I got the mother of all heat rashes that became more and more inflamed as the days went on. Normally, I treat a heat rash with any decent drugstore moisturizer and keep the area cool but this time around that was simply not enough. After a week of trying to tough it out, the heat rash became so dry that the skin on my neck became extremely cracked and made it painful to move my neck. I visited a doctor who said she had never seen anything quite like my heat rash (which is not what you want to hear). Along with a prescription for a topical steroid, she recommended I get a jar of this Aquaphor healing ointment. Within 24 hours I finally felt relief. At first glance, I too thought this was like an expensive petroleum jelly but there is so much more in this ointment that was worth the money. It is sticky, and I hate using it for that reason however, when you are suffering with a skin issue like the intense heat rash I had, dealing with a sticky ointment was no big thing. In the months since, anytime I see a heat rash coming on, I put this on overnight and by morning it has cleared up. So grateful to have been steered in the direction of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Aquaphor for my lips and dry skin spots. When the baby had dry skin spots, maybe eczema, the doctor recommended using Aquaphor. It&#x27;s like magic! Now we use this exclusively instead of any other diaper rash cream, and use it on any of his dry spots.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it for my psoriasis... it does help</li>
            <li> As advertised, No complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my infants dry skin. Didn&#x27;t really make a difference, but it did make my hands soft</li>
            <li> Let me first start off by saying this is probably my 2nd review I ever wrote. I guess that says either 2 things about me - I&#x27;m lazy or I&#x27;ve never come across a product that is this good. Clearly, its the second choice. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and let me tell you I&#x27;m what you call a product junkie. If there is a product that says I&#x27;m going to have clear skin (not this ultra oily acne prone skin) or beautiful Victoria Secret model hair - I&#x27;m in! Most products don&#x27;t change my life and most products I barely see a difference so why write a review? Well Aquaphor made my skin soft and glowing like I&#x27;ve never seen before. Those irritating pimples that are like cysts that would otherwise be there for a month, went away over night! I don&#x27;t want to sound like one of those people on an infomercial but if you have to try any product please let it be this one. I actually feel like a different person, a little more confident because of how great its made my skin and if I could pass on the secret I would do it in a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just tell you a little about my skin. I have extremely oily skin, acne prone, blackheads, white heads and I can&#x27;t forget about those under the skin pimples that make my forehead look like theres a golf ball growing underneath it. I had one of those 2 days ago and it is completely gone today after wearing Aquaphor on my face overnight. You will look nuts but it will be so worth it. My eyes also are always puffy and dark circles galore (I didn&#x27;t really win in the genetic pool) today they look less puffy and completely hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can come across a product that changes my outlook after only using it for 2 days - than I hope everyone tries it and can have those same results. We&#x27;d have a bunch of happy people walking around and how could you go wrong there?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and I really hope this helps!</li>
            <li> She always returns to this product because t&#x27;s stable for her sensitive face.  Other products cause her to break out, despite their &amp;#34;cachet&amp;#34;.  Just look at that jar.  Doesn&#x27;t it scream &amp;#34;Use me every day!&amp;#34;&amp;#34;?  For me, I don&#x27;t use it but the price is right.</li>
            <li> This is anamazing oitment for healing everyh thing from dry cracked winter hands to sunbirns. But one of the best things is that it does not sting like some produs do.</li>
            <li> amazing, used the night before, the cracks are disappeared and my feet feel great, they are fully moisturized and hydrated</li>
            <li> recommended by my dermatologist for all kind skin use</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!  Used for my tattoos, no issues at all.  Keeps my skin moisturized deeply.</li>
            <li> It takes only two weeks to ship to China. It&#x27;s very oilly. Better to be used for healing. Not for daily use.</li>
            <li> One of the few more surprises that really handles my dry skin</li>
            <li> Much better than the tube version.</li>
            <li> we are using this every day and it is helping our dry skin.  it is a lot like vaseline but it seems to absorb into skin quicker.</li>
            <li> it is good,it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this healing ointment.  I have a dry skin, whenever I feel dry in lips, around eyes, hands, and body, this is a solution.  Dermatologist recommended this ointment 3 years ago, I have been using this everyday since.</li>
            <li> I had cracked opened skin along the tips of my fingers and Aquaphor Healing Ointment helped to heal them.  It has also help me to prevent any more cracked skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Nothing has kept my hands looking and feeling this good before.  So far so good. Will purchase in the future</li>
            <li> My son has Eczema and no other cream worked as better as this.&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor is a wonder cream, its thick jelly-like texture stays on the skin for more time than any other cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this ointment on the suggestion of my pediatrician. My 3 yr old son has eczema and he has a stubborn area on his face. It gets horrible looking, rough, patchy, red skin about the size of a golf ball at times. It covers his right cheek and travels above his lip on to the other cheek. EVERYTHING (including coconut oil) we tried just would not get rid of that mess. I felt so horrible for him as it itched and hurt (he would often cry when we tried to put medicine on it). Not to mention all the stares he would get out in public!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His pediatrician gave us some samples of this ointment and within hours (literally) the redness started to fade way! By the next morning it was only lightly pink colored. Within 2 days it was almost completely gone. I was shocked at how this stuff worked. You can still faintly see the irritation of the skin but NOTHING like it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is something we will have to use daily on our sons face but its worth it to have normal looking skin. I cant recommend this enough for skin irritations or eczema.....its just that good but don&#x27;t take my word for it.........try it for yourself and see the benefits of this product on your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is WOW and AWESOME product!</li>
            <li> I first heard of Aquaphor when my grandmother was in the hospital. She had oxygen going through her nose and inside her nose was extremeIy raw, red, and irritated.  I went to my pharmacy to find out what I could use to help her. My pharmacist recommended Aquaphor.  It helped her and I started using it afterward on my problem skin.  I have extremely dry flaky skin that is sensitive and easily irritated.  I have had good results from using this ointment. It does not irritate my skin and the moisture lasts for a good while. I am so dry that I actually use my favorite body cream right after a shower and then I apply a layer of Aquaphor on top after the cream has absorbed.  This little step has helped me alot.  This ointment really helps with the dry skin on my legs and feet (really all over my body).</li>
            <li> Great on my cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Dry or cracked feet?  This is the cure all...</li>
            <li> The bomb for keeping feet nice and soft.  I put it on after every shower, with a pair of fuzzy socks.  No cracks or calluses on these feet!  I also apply a bit to my knees and elbows.  Lookin&#x27; good!</li>
            <li> Great for my dry heels and feet.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for my kids eczema!</li>
            <li> WORKED MIRACLES FOR MY HUSBANDS DIABETIC-WOUND PRONE SKIN--WE&#x27;VE TRIED MANY SO CALLED GUARANTEED TO WORK CREAMS BUT THY DID NOT PENETRATE THE SKIN LIKE THIS DOES-SO OK IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE GREASY BUT IT DOES NOT STAIN CLOTHES AND DID I MENTION-IT WORKS-NO WOUNDS FOR 6 MONTHS!</li>
            <li> Works great, daughter had to use it while taking acne medicine. Can even use it as a lip ointment. This is a huge jar and will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> Helps my baby&#x27;s eczema and is the lowest price that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff for everything on your skin.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is my favorite goop!  It is great for dry lips, worn out feet, and all sorts of skin irritations.  I always keep a little tube in my purse and this big jar at home.</li>
            <li> Cracking skin?  Peeling fingers?  Do your hands pay the price for your hard work?  Lotion doesn&#x27;t do much for you?  YOU NEED THIS OINTMENT.  Seriously, one night, rubbed it in and went to sleep.  Woke up the next day with brand new hands.  No joke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nightly on my hands and face, and my skin looks and feels younger and more hydrated. This is great as an undereye treatment- the skin under my eyes hasn&#x27;t felt this plump since I was in my early 20&#x27;s. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> this ointment is great.</li>
            <li> The BEST hand and everything cream you can buy!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My husband has dry cracked hands.  He put this ointment on his hands and was able to fist his hands by morning.  Amazing results from this.</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on the Dr. Oz show.  I wish I knew about Aquaphor sooner.  Really helps with dry, chapped or cracked skin - especially in the winter.  I apply it at least 3 times a day - big difference.  No other ointment compares to this treatment.</li>
            <li> This product is something I order or purchase often. Great for people of all ages and great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Basically what this stuff is, is designer Vaseline. It&#x27;s virtually the same thing - petroleum jelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it comes in euro style packaging, identifies itself as &amp;#34;healing ointment&amp;#34;, and sports a label crowing about the fact that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Dermatologist Recommended&amp;#34;. It furthermore notes that it is &amp;#34;advanced therapy for dry, cracked, or irritated skin&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, bring it on, even though it costs 50% more than a similar quantity of the pedestrian Vaseline brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline, after all, is labeled as nothing more than what it really is, i.e. &amp;#34;petroleum jelly&amp;#34;. Its container looks utilitarian and a bit blue collar. The imagery that&#x27;s conjured up is all about messy babies and diapers. Amazon has a special offer noting that it&#x27;s frequently purchased along with a rectal thermometer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, which one am I going to apply to my aging baby boomer skin? The choice is clear...</li>
            <li> I first bought this when I got my first big tattoo. A little goes a long way..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in the food industry and am constantly washing my hands, dishes, etc.  So I keep this at work as an added layer of moisture/protection to keep my hands from cracking and peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little greasy/oily, but works great and lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> best stuff for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Only this that works for my child&#x27;s bum &amp; eczema.</li>
            <li> We use this for our 4 year old kid. We have been using it for more than 2 years now and it has worked well. The only problem I see is its very sticky and feels heavy skin for sometime. However it works best for rashes and eczema prevention for my kid.</li>
            <li> Great deal at -40%, less greasy than Vaseline.  But if you can accept Vaseline, then it would be way cheaper.</li>
            <li> I used this cream when i return from the beach, when your skin is too Dry and crackle from the sun and wind.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for a jar of hand creme but the reality is, you only get two hands, so why not give them the best. this creme is also good for deep anal penitration hehe</li>
            <li> My husband got it for his cracked hands from working outside all winter and it stopped them from splitting and bleeding.  Pretty greasy so best to use at night or put gloves on afterwards.  Otherwise, it did what we wanted it to!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Aquaphor and I tend to buy it when it is on sale in the pharmacy because it can be expensive and since the jar I had at home was finished (I have a small tube that came with the jar when I bought it), I ordered it from Amazon which had it reasonably priced. (Much lower than in the pharmacy for that size).  Aquaphor is good for itching and dry skin, among other uses.  Vaseline is not as good as it use to be but whereever you apply Aquaphor, it stays on for a long time and keep the area moist, relieves itching. It really is good therapy for the skin. I would highly recommend it and I hope they keep making it as good as it is now.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my lips, I put it in little gloss containers. Got my family addicted.</li>
            <li> This is too much like Vaseline but more expensive.  Really thick and must try to not get on clothes and furniture.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever found for very dry and even cracked skin.  I use it on my feet, primarily, but great for any skin areas.  Nurses, who wash their hands a LOT, were the first to recommend this to me.</li>
            <li> I think this product is the best on the market for skin care.  It heals and protects dry skin and it makes your skin feel good.  I used it after a tattoo and it worked great and I have been hooked on this product since.</li>
            <li> Works well and very similar feel to Vaseline, therefore it definitely leaves that greasy feeling on your skin. However, it does do the trick for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Just about any skin problem can be improved with regular use of Aquaphor. I swear by it! Ask your DR.</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on after I get out of the shower and before I put on my jammies.  It does take some time to absorb and can have a greasy feeling to it - but I don&#x27;t mind that cuz when it DOES absorb, my skin feels softer than any other lotion has ever made it feel, and I am not shy about purchasing expensive morturizers. This product also practically instantaneously cured painful cracks on my fingers and heels during the winter.  I will always have this product on hand.</li>
            <li> When I was going through  cancer treatments, the radiation  was burning my skin, my nurse gave me samples of this and it worked great! It definitely  heals red, cracked skin. I have recommended  it to several of my friends, they bought it and love it too.</li>
            <li> My husband and I moved to North Central Arizona from Southern California several months ago and have found out that it is VERY dry here. We knew that it would be, but were surprised at our hands cracking in places they never had before. I spoke to my doctor and she recommended the Aquaphor and it has really helped. You only need a little at a time or it is too greasy, but it has really helped with the cracking on our hands.</li>
            <li> My husband has bad excema on his feet and ankles.  This seems to be helping.  His feet do not look as bad as they did before trying this product.</li>
            <li> Feels great, works great.  I mean... there&#x27;s really not much else to say.  That and I don&#x27;t care to be more elaborate about how well the product performs.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry and scaly patches.</li>
            <li> I have sjogrens and suffer from very dry skin. Aquaphor works well for me.</li>
            <li> This is like putting grease on your hands. It might work out just fine in the long run. But I guess I thought it was something to put on and &amp;#34;go&amp;#34;... not put it on, put gloves on and go to bed. It might work overnight just fine, but I couldn&#x27;t even get that far with this product. Not at all for daily use.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous for really painful chapped lips, raw skin or any other painful skin condition my whole family has yet to experience. For those that feel it is too greasy, how much are you using? It only requires the tiniest dab on most anything and that does not lend itself to being greasy.</li>
            <li> A staple in our house.  We use this all the time.  Great for kids with eczema to keep the moisture locked in.  We use it right after baths and apply as needed when they get dry or itchy.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of this healing ointment.  I find that it absorbs very rapidly,&lt;br /&gt;gives my skin the moisture it needs and softens the skin.  I am very pleased with&lt;br /&gt;its performance.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this ointment.</li>
            <li> Wow...  works like a charm.  This has cleared up all sorts of skin issues in my family and we even use it in place of chap stick now.  Great product and does what is says.</li>
            <li> Just to clear things up.  This product is used as a moisture barrier.  It should not used as a moisturizer!  It is a petroleum based product.  If you use this as a skin softener, your skin will not be softer. it is 41% petroleum!  Petroleum (vaseline) clogs your pores.  Especially do not use on your face as a moisturizer, it will leave blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;I read all labels for moisturizer ingredients, trying to avoid petrol as an ingredient.  Have even looked for recipes to make my own face creams and body lotions.  Look for ingredients that will have lanolin or glycerin as ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I have heals that were so cracked I could barely walk.  Within 3 days of use they are almost healed.  Living in an extreme cold area this product feels so good on all dry skin.  After trying every other product out there for my heals, this is the only one that works!</li>
            <li> Dr Oz recommended th  is was my first time using this product.  I like it so far.  My skin is very, very dry and I need a good moisterizer</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer for kids with eczema. I won&#x27;t be using anything else for my child. I&#x27;ve tried wverything but this is the only one that works great.</li>
            <li> We first used this product for my son&#x27;s baby acne, and have been using it on him since then. The product is so good we even use it for severely chapped/chaffed skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps my skin a lot. I have a baby and stay at home. My hands are constantly dry due to household chores.  I also have a mild case of psoriasis and this ointment is the only thing that keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for a friend going thru radiation treatment. It was highly recommended by the doctors at the center.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my dry skin. Before I&#x27;d be cracking, flaking, and raw. Does get on cloths but does not stain and washes out fine. No real smell to it. This is a life save product.</li>
            <li> This is basically petroleum jelly with a few extra ingredients added so it could entice people (like me) to buy it.  It works as promised but so does plain petroleum jelly, which is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be more like lotion. It is more like Petroleum Jelly than lotion. Still really good to rub on elbows, lips, eyes, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t rub it all over or i&#x27;d be greasy.</li>
            <li> My youngest son used to suffer terribly with dry and irritated skin.  We came across this product when I was brousing around for aquaphor.  This one works much better than just plain aquaphor.  We use this on my son  whenever his skin gets dry.  With the help of hydroxine, his skin has been doing so much better.</li>
            <li> I love using this for when my skin is really dry but also when I get a tattoo for the first few days after. It works amazing and this size is a great value here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Why&#x27;d I buy this? It&#x27;s basically really expensive thick Vaseline full of petrochemicals and a goopy non moisturizing mess. It&#x27;s not a good product. I never use it.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin very smooth and removes dryness and cracks at best.&lt;br /&gt;Thick in nature and gives a good protective layer,.</li>
            <li> Happy, love the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent for baby ezema. Absorbs better than the creme.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor Healing Ointment didn&#x27;t work as well for me as Vaseline.  The base ingredients may be different and it may go on a little creamer, but it does not work as well as petroleum jelly which cost a lot less money.  This is my experience after using it for months.  Updated 3-6-15.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles truly . It works great &amp; will make your skin alot better . I love it &amp; will continue to use this stuff forever . Try it &amp; you will be amazed on how it works for you . It will soak into your skin &amp; not just stay on it also .</li>
            <li> My son is 5 and has eczema. Aquaphor is the only one I&#x27;ve been using since he was little. His skin has gotten so much better. I have dry skin and I use this all the time.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hands from drying out during the winter months... still looking for a perfect anything to do this without making my hands overly oily but this is the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve never seen anything work so well. My skin and lips sometimes get chronically dry and aquaphor works like magic and keeps your skin moisturizer for so long (while it is on) and heals it after it is wiped off. Also, this tub is seriously a life time supply for a family of 4.</li>
            <li> Is there anything that Aquaphor doesn&#x27;t fix? Baby bum rash, neck fold irritation, scratches, etc. I even use it on my cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I got this because, I was told this was good for rough dry feet. So I rubbed it into my feet at night before I go to bed, then put on cotton socks overnight and the next morning my feet are softer.. Overtime my feet look and feel so much better. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how well this aids healing!</li>
            <li> this was recommended by a dermatologist for extreme dry skin. He said get the tube and use a touch. Well this is not the tube BUT 5 times as much as the tube at only twice the cost.</li>
            <li> My husband has a chronic skin condition on his legs due to diabetes.  We have tried many, many things but Aquaphor is the first ointment (including prescription ointments) that has really worked for him.  The relief from itching is a blessing and his legs look much, much better.  I also use it on my hands now and then and really like it.  Warning - it feels a bit greasy when first applied, so don&#x27;t plan any fine tasks for a few minutes.  But the ointment absorbs and your skin will feel wonderful, soft, and not greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!! Cuts the healing time down at least 25% on my new tattoos and almost no itching!</li>
            <li> I use this size when getting out of the shower.  It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but it seems to work.  See the 1.75 oz size for further comments.</li>
            <li> The best daily, moisturizing treatment for feet...in summer, as well as year-round! I use this after bathing and exfoliating my feet, and follow it with Gold Bond Ultimate Softening Lotion with Shea Butter (so as not to leave too greasy a residue). This keeps my feet soft always, which isn&#x27;t easy in a dry, hot climate. This stuff is fantastic for maintaining soft feet, with no cracks or callouses. (Of course, I do get fairly-regular pedicures, too...about once every six weeks. In the interim, this keeps the tootsies soft and happy!)</li>
            <li> This works wonders if you have any area that is extremely dry.  It is definitely more of a consistency of vaseline than a lotion.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema really bad and this is the only product I’ve found, including prescription products, that has soothed the itchiness she gets from her breakouts. It also helps to reduce the redness. I just love this product and definitely recommend it to anyone who has dry, cracked, itchy skin issues. It works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and I am a big fan. I apply it to my feet, elbows, and face when I get out of the shower. I never have issues with dry hands or cheeks even in the winter. I found that it works really great to apply a thin coat to my face before going out on a windy day in the winter. No wind burn!</li>
            <li> Buy one; get second at half price. However, the second jar was damaged in shipment and product was a mess.</li>
            <li> Please buy this! i have used everything from high end creams to home remedies for my very dry skin (cracked lips, eczema patches, inflamed/pus forming skin lesions) on my face, neck and arms. This ointment works like magic!!! in a matter of 3 daysI had improved skin and almost no inflammation! I used this on my toddler who also suffers from dry skin in the winter and he improved in no time. price wise its perfect and the texture is not too sticky. I put it on my whole face before applying my laura mercier tinted moisturizer before going to work, my face looks dewy/healthy and not in a greasy way! LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Very good cream! I have been looking for hand creams now for the last 2 years. There have been some good ones some bad ones &amp; some smelly ones. This one works great, does not smell &amp; actually feels like its working right away. Its a little bit slippery, but I guess u cant have everything!</li>
            <li> My hands are usually cracked at this time of year. They are in good shape right now. They would be even better if I was a little more consistent in applying this product. Regardless, this is a great product. Dr. Oz knew what he was talking about.</li>
            <li> As a healthcare professional who deals with a lot of skin consultations, I highly recommend Aquaphor for all kids of skin abrasions and problems.  It is the best diaper rash cream.  Great for cracked skin.  Great for burns.  The lanolin really soothes and heals the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> We use this to protect our babies bottom from diaper rash (recommended by our pediatrician). It works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff cleared up some skin problems that I&#x27;ve had for months in just days, thank you very much!!!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my baby.  I use it daily to help prevent diaper rash.  It&#x27;s a little pricy, but worth it.  Buy this one instead of the one marked baby to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, clears up dry and chapped skin in no time.  Been using it for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> Amazing ointment!!! After tattoo removal care!</li>
            <li> It healed my cracked index finger. I applied the ointment and I wore a medium PROTECTIVE LATEX TISSUE FINGER COTS on my middle finger during the day. 3 days later, my finger was healed.</li>
            <li> I used it to prevent radiation burns.  I still had burns but not to the extent I was thinking</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.  This is a wonderful product to use on baby and dry hands.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS OINTMENT, BUT IS TOO GREASSY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brand for healing my cracked and irritated hand but it did not work and finally I found Aquaphor Healing ointment, it&#x27;s calmed my dry, cracked hand and bring my soft hand back</li>
            <li> I like the big tub instead of trying to squeeze out of a tube.  We use it for calloused feet and dry winter hands.  Also, great to mix 1:1 with maalox and zinc oxide to make a super diaper cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I put it on my lips at night to prevent chapping. I also apply it to my nose when I have a cold to help it heal. Basically, I put this stuff on anything that&#x27;s in need of healing. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...!!!! My stretch marks look less visible I&#x27;m very satisfied..within a month I started seen results...I&#x27;ve had 2 kids and have a lot of stretch marks in my abdominal area using it 3 times a day massaging it....it was one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve ever made..I recommend this to anyone with stretch marks it helps a lot...!</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely delicate and dry. I was using Vaseline on my face to keep my skin from cracking in the sub zero temperatures. A friend of mine told me that he uses Aquaphor for his daughter who suffers from dry skin and that I should try it. I&#x27;ve had it for three days and love it already. It is very light weight and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy. The Vaseline is back on the shelf and my daughter who has psoriasis says she will purchase it as well.</li>
            <li> Great price for a quality product. The only cream that prevents my skin from drying out uncomfortably after swimming. Bought 2.</li>
            <li> I saw a dermatologist talk about this on Oz and decided to try it. Both my wife and myself are pleased with the results, it takes daily routines to get the callous to disappear though we are seeing improvement.,</li>
            <li> Absolutelky the best; doctor recommended and doing the job!</li>
            <li> Great for dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I usually have sore and cracked hands in the winter.  After I stared using this on a regular basis my hands are no longer sore or cracked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquaphor to help mediate my eczema symptoms for years now, and it was great that Amazon sold the giant container! I slather it on my hands and massage it into my cuticles and I glove up before I go to sleep at night and the next day, my hands are super soft and moisturized. The consistency of Aquaphor can be a little messy since it&#x27;s similar to petroleum jelly and doesn&#x27;t absorb right away, leaving you with a greasy coating on your hands that gets everywhere unless you let it &amp;#34;dry.&amp;#34; But the one thing that I love about Aquaphor over normal petroleum jelly is the fact that it heals the cracks in my skin almost overnight, and continues to treat it. It&#x27;s an amazing product and my favorite eczema symptom-clearer.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than this product is great. I did not order the baby Aquaphor and I was about to call and return and something told me to read the ingredients and compare the one I have at home and sure enough the ingredients are the same. I never this at all so DON&amp;#34;T get duped by the label &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; for I believe it costs several dollars more. Horrible scam but wanted all to know out there they are both the same just different &amp;#34;selling&amp;#34; packaging. I may not use it as much in the summer heat but in the other season like fall and winter it is my go to jar for moisturizing my skin, not my face, but overall body. It is not cheap even in the stores. Some places have it for $18 and some for $14. I used to buy it for $12 at this store but they went out of business. I did not know where I could find it so I decided to look on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Be aware of the really frequent price changes on this item. It is now $18.38 as of 1/26. I ordered on 1/13 for $13.89.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> works great for very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have been having a lot of trouble with dry cracked hands and have tried numerous remedies, until I tried Aquaphor nothing worked. I like to put this on and then put on a pair of white cotton jewelers gloves (you can buy them on Ebay by the dozen for about $5.00) I do this before bedtime and it really helps.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment .  My skin got more dry and scaly instead</li>
            <li> I love this stuff:  much better than Vaseline.  This past years my wife switched to Gold Bond and she regrets it:  DOESN&#x27;T WORK as well as Aquaphor.  This stuff contains much less chemicals than other brands.  It doesn&#x27;t contain water like other lotions, so you&#x27;ll get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> excellent stuff, shipping is super fast like always. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I learned about Aquaphor when my kids were born and I used it heavily for chafing (diaper, face, etc) and for eczema. Now that they are bigger, I still use this for dry spots as well as for their lips. I use this for my cuticles as well, especially in the winter. I always have a jar around the house!</li>
            <li> Best ever!  A little goes along way.  You can use a dab with your body moisturizer, great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to solution for all skin ailments since I was a little girl.  My mom worked in a dermatologist&#x27;s office and always got free samples of this so I was spoiled growing up to not have to buy it.  We would use it on minor cuts, burns, dry skin, and our lips.  It&#x27;s a miracle worker.  I don&#x27;t know why or how it works so much better than vaseline, but the ingredients are different.  It&#x27;s only 50% or even less petroleum, and then mineral oil and some other things.  I have had acne prone skin my whole life, clear into adult hood.  This has never caused me breakouts.  It&#x27;s surprising, because it is so thick and oily.  However, I&#x27;ve often spread on my face after chemical peels or when my skin is chapped from cold, or just when it is really dry, and I&#x27;ve never broken out from it.  In fact, often the opposite occurs, and it leaves my skin supple and glowing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I got turned on to Aquaphor by my doctor years ago and am in love with this stuff.  It really helps soothe dry/cracked/irritated skin.  I also recently had a biopsy on a mole on my back and have been using this to help it heal.  This stuff can really be used in so many ways!!</li>
            <li> Great for preventing breakdown on bed bound patients bottom!</li>
            <li> A co-worker told me about it. Saw it at the store and refused to pay what they wanted for a much smaller jar.  It was more cost effective to purchase the large jars, than the small ones at the store.</li>
            <li> I really love it!  Spreads well and protects better.  It&#x27;s NOT a more costly Vaseline!  It is more costly, yes...but there is definitely a difference.  I do like Vaseline, but this is more effective.</li>
            <li> this is all i use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sometimes i sway and go use one of the other diaper rash creams - this really clears up the diaper rash so much quicker and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the other stuff</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this product to us and we use it every day.  Our baby girl has really soft skin.  Not 100% sure if it is this or just her since we haven&#x27;t used anything else.</li>
            <li> The container is broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I apply this every morning to dry, cracked feet and cover with white cotton socks.  It reminds me of Vaseline.  However, it is soothing and works well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for me and my daughter who are big tattoo enthusiasts! Perfect healing item and costs is great.</li>
            <li> Very cost-effective,Put on the skin is very moist.</li>
            <li> fantastic results for my husband who suffered through winters with cracked and painful hands due to dry weather. After about a week they&#x27;re mostly healed and smooth.  Can&#x27;t pry it away from him.</li>
            <li> I saw Dr. Oz recommend this product.  He said that doctors use it after all their surgical scrubbing in order to maintain smooth skin.  It does have petroleum jelly yet there are other ingredients which make it extra rich for the skin.  I put it on my feet generously and then wear socks to bed.  My cracked heels were gone and my hands are soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Is this vaseline in disguise. I had no idea the product I was getting would be yellow sticky paste, exactly the color, consistency and smell of vaseline. It is way too sticky to put on and leaves your skin shiny and sticky. Once that initial phase has worn off though, I guess it works. I use it only on my fingernail cuticles or extremely dry, cracked areas. Not for regular moisturizing...</li>
            <li> It worked immediately! Adding some heat with a heating pad makes the process work even faster. But do not get too close to hair! It seem’s to have a coarsening effect and leaves hair a greasy mess. At least its also non-staining on anything touched before its absorbed. Packaged well and easy to use immediately.</li>
            <li> We use this to protect our babies bottom from diaper rash (recommended by our pediatrician).  It works great.  I also have a jar that I use to keep my feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> For my purposes, which is moisturizing the lips, it is the perfect product.  Never found better and I have a lifetime supply by buying the tub.  It soothes and completely fixes my dry cracked lips.  If I put it on at night time, the problem is gone the next morning.  If my lips were very red and bleeding (I have not experienced this since I was a child), I&#x27;d assume it would take at least a week, but again, for my own purposes, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally dry skin and I use it on a daily bases.  Some may fine it to greasy but my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> Better than petroleum jelly. This ointment goes on smoothly and keeps your skin feeling soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Finally got the right product to use on calloused, dry feet. It actually dissolves and removes dried skin areas with daily use. It is greasy. That&#x27;s why it works as good as it does. But it does not stain my socks or feel greasy once it&#x27;s on and rubbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my doctor.  I used it on my skin daily when I was receiving radiation treatment for breast cancer.  It helped with my dry skin!</li>
            <li> What can I say, keep the baby from becoming a dry leaf and keeps mommie and daddy&#x27;s hands oh so soft. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> this is an great product. i use it for almost anything. dry cracked lips, callases, rashes, burns, ect. this product works great. its a protrolium jelly substence, kinda like vasaline.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite winter moisturizer.  It soothes eczema and dry skin like no other.  It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> great for your skin. best i have found. Md Anderson recommends it.</li>
            <li> Heard about this on Dr. Oz. Very good for extremely dry hands</li>
            <li> Best stuff available for dry skin</li>
            <li> Great for the heals!!! Massage your feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 5 star item, just SO large!!  It will last me the rest of my life!!</li>
            <li> recommended back in the 90&#x27;s for super deep conditioning face after medical peels etc. but functions as an insanely deep moisturizing lock in product. Works even on dry heels.</li>
            <li> I like this ointment, it serves my needs well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of minor surgeries lately and have been using this stuff like crazy to help all the stitches heal.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent and (in my opinion) it&#x27;s a little nicer feeling than Vasoline.  My dermatologist also recommended rubbing this on your feet at night, before you put on socks, or before you wear sandles in case you have dry/cracking feet.  It&#x27;s been working great for me lately for these reasons.  I&#x27;ve got really sensitive skin and have had absolutely NO problems using this stuff on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Works really well to keep psoriasis from flaring up!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff EVER for eczema, dry skin, etc. I have it in my house at all times. This size is great and lasts a good while. Great price, too. any time my hand eczema flares up, I let this sit on my hands overnight, and it helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> excellent for the price</li>
            <li> thank you for my purchase came in earlier than expected, and work well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aquaphor for over a month. I recently began to notice that some of my skin problems were clearing up. I worked in a tubing plant more than 25 years ago. The company used oil in their tubing to stop erosion. My skin became bumpy and pimply. But, since I have been using Aquaphor, my skin is smoother. Also, my elbows had become darker. But, since using Aquaphor, they have lightened, and my skin stays more moisturized. I don&#x27;t know if this is just a short-term effect or not, but I&#x27;m loving the results. While the product is thick, and some may say slimy, I wouldn&#x27;t categorize it as being greasy. Before using Aquaphor, I like many others, I&#x27;m sure, read both the positive and negative reviews, but I took a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did. A product that might not work for one person, might work for another.  Also, products I&#x27;ve bought and used from Amazon, if they turned out to have a negative affect, I&#x27;ve been able to return for a refund. I appreciate a company like that. If you have problem skin areas, maybe Aquaphor is for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been a long time fan of aquaphor!  It arrived as expected, and packaged well!</li>
            <li> 1. It&#x27;s SO greasy. It&#x27;s like smearing Vaseline or Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub all over your body...and it sitting there all day.&lt;br /&gt;2. Which means the skin doesn&#x27;t breathe. Unfortunately, it caused me to break out especially on my face and upper shoulders (my personal problem areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it&#x27;s great for fixing winter dryness or wind-chapped areas but it can&#x27;t be used frequently as an all-over deep conditioning moisture--what I was looking for--without serious trade-offs.</li>
            <li> For hands and feet is a great moisture protection, but not to face. It&#x27;s too thick and that make you face oil shiny. I prefer a lighter one.</li>
            <li> Someone said this ointment can cure eczema, so I&#x27;m trying~~~</li>
            <li> Very good. Excellent packaging.</li>
            <li> Actual doctor recommendation  for extreme winter dry skin &amp; great immediate results!  I have my purty skin back. Will continue use &amp; highly recommend.  Thank you! :0</li>
            <li> Best there is for new tattoos and dry, winter skin</li>
            <li> love this product. works wonders for really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Nice thick .. Like vaseline.. Keeps moistur trapped but very unconfortabld imdietly whn u put it on makes u feel like u put oil on body but absorbs fast and thn miracle no more oily feel and body stays moistured ..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my thighs so they don&#x27;t rub when I&#x27;m at work and it lasts all day</li>
            <li> great stuff,,, just thick as hell,,, in this contaner is a great buy,,, in tube much more</li>
            <li> Bought this on advice of my radiation oncologist to keep my skin from drying, It was horrible. Made my skin breakout and got grease all over my clothes and furniture! If you are getting radiation treatments please try something else or just buy petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s greasy and absorbs slowly, but it works.  I used it on my scalp after radiation for brain cancer based on the nurse&#x27;s advice.  Now, I use it in my nostrils to prevent bloody noses from yet another powerful medical treatment (Avastin).</li>
            <li> These  jars are much more economical than the 1.75 oz tubes we had been using.  We keep one in the car and one in the house.</li>
            <li> Really cleared up my excema.  Messy but worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my feet daily as I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome Disorder so I have to keep my feet moist.  I also use the travel size in my purse and at work.</li>
            <li> This is made from 40% petroleum Jelly.  It is greasy.  What else is in the jar the label doesn&#x27;t say. Maybe it does have healing powers. But I believe when I finish with this large jar. I will find another product.  Right now I am greasy enough to slip through your fingers! (Nah nah nah You can&#x27;t catch me!)  My daughter swears it helps her baby with his rashes and dry skin though.</li>
            <li> I have a patch of skin on my shin that was driving me crazy. I tried lotions but it didn&#x27;t stop the itch. I finally bought this product and an hour after the first application I found relief. I highly recommend this. It is greasy feeling as it&#x27;s 41% petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> My kids have eczema and Aquaphor helps so much.  If I religiously apply this on my kids&#x27; skin after bath each day, their eczema doesn&#x27;t appear.  If I stop applying it for a few weeks, I notice that their eczema comes back.  My kids don&#x27;t mind the feel of it.  It&#x27;s thick and sticky.  Keeps their skin clear eczema and soft.</li>
            <li> Perfect for baby with very dry skin, I&#x27;ve also used it in myself. We can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said that Aquaphor is the WD-40 of skin care.  I have found that it heals burns and cuts so much faster when you liberally use it.</li>
            <li> Perfect! 10/10 Great for Tattooing/Tattoo Care</li>
            <li> Huge jar.. Think a blue magic hair grease jar.  It works wonders on skin and best for tattoos in my opinion</li>
            <li> Order came via prime shipping. Can&#x27;t complain about the product.</li>
            <li> My husband like to use it for his foot.</li>
            <li> i quickly noticed it results probably because i have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I use this ointment for tattoo care. its the best product out there for tattoo care. Every artist I spoke with has recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well on kid&#x27;s scars and rashes</li>
            <li> Bought this to use with an acid peel. It&#x27;s like a thinner Vaseline, and seems to work OK. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised. Good item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years, ever since a dermatologist recommended it back in the 60&#x27;s when it was less that $5 for 16 oz! I have terribly  dry skin and this is the only product that works for me. It is greasy at first but if you put it on immediately after shower/bath while skin is damp, it easily soaks into your skin and makes it feel amazing. That&#x27;s the trick to using aquaphor, you have to put it on damp skin, otherwise you&#x27;ll be greasy for a looooonnnnnng time. Start by rubbing a small amount into both hands and pat your hands all over your body without rubbing (arms, legs, feet, chest, butt......everywhere) then start rubbing, adding more as needed. Not only are you moisturizing your skin, you&#x27;re invigorating it as well.</li>
            <li> I saw a dermatologist recommend this on Dr. Oz&#x27; show, so I decided to give it a try. Works great on my dry hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> very nice for dryed skin,</li>
            <li> great products thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle! This stuff heals very well!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.  A little bit of an after use greasy feeling but does not last long.</li>
            <li> No problems with this order.</li>
            <li> Only thing I have been able to find that actually heals the cracks in my heels!</li>
            <li> The ointment works quickly  on my dry skin .</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and heals extreme dry skin and cracks.</li>
            <li> This ointment is really effective. Treats dry chapped skin in just one application. I love its creamy texture.</li>
            <li> Best thing for baby eczema!!!! And dry skin period. I use it on my son everyday &amp; just rub the rest into my hands when I&#x27;m done. Works wonders! I love it! :)</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is the absolute best! I don&#x27;t use it as an all-over moisturizer, but to target my knees, elbows and feet. In the winter, I also use it for my lips and hands. It keeps my hands moisturized all day. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the best moisturizers according to the Skin Doctor Score...find the review at theskindoctor.com</li>
            <li> Really enjoy using this item</li>
            <li> I always have Aquaphor in my home.  I use it on my lips to keep them soft, and it heals dry &amp; cracked skin on your feet.  It makes my toes look so much smoother &amp; healthier (especially around the nail bed) when I am wearing open-toed shoes, and it definitely does repair the skin.  This also works great for removing eye makeup.  I always have racoon eyes after I get out of the shower in the morning, and this removes mascara with great ease.</li>
            <li> Heals diaper rash like no other.</li>
            <li> good quality cream  and i like the size......as i use it a lot......</li>
            <li> Healing, soothing.  Great for dry hands and neck area.</li>
            <li> I swear by this.  My dad battled prostrate cancer 20 years ago, and as his radiation sessions continued, began getting severe blisters on his skin.  This ointment cleared him up when no other thing could, even prescriptions.  I now have this in my house for whatever my family&#x27;s skin issues are.  Simply nothing else out there I will use.</li>
            <li> Just fine, no problems at all, will buy from again.</li>
            <li> This products is very good for my heels crack.</li>
            <li> Not as convenient to use as I had thought.</li>
            <li> We use this on our baby all over body and it really helps soothe his dry skin and eczema. It is also great for dry and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it everyday on my feet. They stay soft and are no longer dry</li>
            <li> Best ever made.  I use night and day on feet, hands and elbows.  Stains the sheets a bit, but it&#x27;s worth the healing powers of this product.</li>
            <li> Best dry skin ointment I&#x27;ve ever used that works and does not smell like medicine.</li>
            <li> best cream around! its not water based so it lasts way longer than lotion and leaves your skin literally baby smooth. its like a new layer of skin. just dont spread it so thick and you wont even feel it.</li>
            <li> Feets don&#x27;t Fail me now!</li>
            <li> Both of our children have eczema and this is the only prevention lotion we use. It&#x27;s super thick and greasy and work extremely well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavy and greasy, but I suspect that if it wasn&#x27;t, it wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am bad about faithfully using lotions and creams, but when I use this, it&#x27;s like it makes up for all of the time I wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips were dry and the bottom lip split open last week. It kept re-opening. I used this three times and... all better. Hasn&#x27;t happened again. Usually that would take ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff definitely does work, and fast!</li>
            <li> this stuff keep my gf skin smooth and silky...&lt;br /&gt;but need time to absorb through skin, i wouldnt touch her when she just first apply it within  1 hour. too icky</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for dry skin. It is a little greasy when you put it on but give it about 10 minutes and it disappears. For years I have used pricey boutique creams and lotions, so when my dermatologist laughed at me, gave me a sample of Aquaphor and told me this was all I would ever need, I gave it a try. Best decision ever!</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my doctor.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> I let my 12 yrs old use it all winter long, so far I&#x27;m please because he has dry skin.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz recommended Aquaphor so I ordered it. I received Aquaphor Baby which is not what I ordered. I didn&#x27;t return it because it appears the ingredients are exactly the same. So I slathered some on my hands, put plastic gloves on, and left it on overnight. I used the kind of gloves that come with hair color. Slithering the gloves over this greasy stuff was a trick in itself. In the morning I peeled the gloves off and my hands were so greasy I had to wash them long and thoroughly with soap to get the heavy greasy glop off. My hands didn&#x27;t seem any different than before. I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my elbows because the grease would come off on anything I touched. I&#x27;d try it on my feet overnite - put my feet in baggies with socks over them. I&#x27;d have to wash my feet immediately with soap first thing in the morning. It wouldn&#x27;t be safe to get in the shower with greasy slippery feet, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to sit in the tub with this stuff in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to stop watching Dr. Oz!</li>
            <li> Huge jar of Aquaphor.  I am sure I might be able to will this to my kids.  But I do recommend this product.  It is useful for many things.  If you are someone that has a cracked or dry skin issue then get this large tub.  But  for typical use you may find a smaller size.</li>
            <li> Did not relieve extreme cracking of hands. Really disappointed! So I use it as facial night treatment. Not bad at all!</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. OZ show and I knew I had to get this ointment, it works! My skin has made a 100% change since using this ointment! I will b ordering more. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Aguaphor Ointment for many years. It is the only ointment that really work for my severe dry skin due to my Psoriasis.  Don&#x27;t kid yourself!  Don&#x27;t buy any other products were they always say….  This is the only product that really works!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping! Great packaging! Great seller!</li>
            <li> My dry splitting hands don&#x27;t any more. When I received my jar the lid was broken but the seal wasn&#x27;t. I contacted them and had a new lid very quickly.</li>
            <li> You use every day at least once a day especially after showering or bathing and apply all over the body</li>
            <li> very good item . very good seller .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know, only been using for two weeks</li>
            <li> can use for a long time</li>
            <li> My son has eczema and it appears due to his food allergies. This helps to moisturize his skin so much, yes it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; but it does the job and it ribs in pretty well.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it for chapped skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 12 year old daughter who has eczema.  She has to basically lather up with it every night after her bath, but her skin looks a lot better and is not nearly as red or itchy when she is applying it twice a day like she should be.  This tub last a long time, so even though it seems kind of pricey it is worth the money.  Keeps her skin hydrated and it is very thick.  There is no smell to it, which is a bonus because eczema skin does not like anything with a fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my pediatrician for my 6 year old son.  His skin was so dry, it looked like he had a rash all over his chest and back.  She told me it was just allergy/excema-related and that I should put Aquaphor on him daily.  I use the small tubes for my lips, but bought the tub for smothering on him.  Within a few days, all his bumps were gone!</li>
            <li> Great ointment for dry skin or irritations. Helps alleviate a bit of the annoyance of mild eczema (of course, it does not heal that). Nice size jar for easy access.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor Healing Ointment - Dry, Cracked and Irritated Skin Protectant, 14 oz. - I&#x27;m glad I bought this. It serves the purpose. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for winter. Heavy but does wonders for dry skin.Great for people with eczema.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m using Aquaphor for healing and skin protection after a recent TCA peel.  It is working very well to keep my skin hydrated and soft. I will definitely purchase this product regularly and it will become a staple in my skin-care regimen.  I have recommended this item to others.</li>
            <li> We ran out....and heaven forbid!  Amazon to the rescue, and we&#x27;re happily using Aquaphor for everything under the sun. Chapped lips, owies (our pediatrician recommended this over neosporin!) and most of all....butt cream for the baby.</li>
            <li> I cant live without this for my son who have a skin problem. This helps him a lot.</li>
            <li> I use this now vs any lotions or ponds on my entire body after a shower or bath....skin is so incredibly soft!! USE IT!</li>
            <li> After buying this I realized that it&#x27;s basically just petroleum jelly, which is not particularly good for the skin. It&#x27;s very heavy and thick and temporarily makes your skin soft, which tricks people into thinking it works well, but over the long haul it can have damaging effects, especially if you use it on sensitive skin. If you want something heavy duty you&#x27;d probably be better off buying a jar of body butter, which is also less greasy and just overall more pleasant. Moisturizers and body butters that use plant based oils and ingredients provide nutrients for your skin, where petroleum jelly is a byproduct of oil production and is like covering your skin in plastic. It can be used to protect your skin, but if you want something that&#x27;s going to improve your skin I would not recommend this. It can actually make dry patches worse and aggravates acne and premature aging of the skin. It&#x27;s my fault for not researching the ingredients first, but I&#x27;m disappointed that I spent money on this large jar of fairly useless product</li>
            <li> Use it for my kids who have very dry skin and skin allergies.</li>
            <li> I have dry and cracked lips constantly, I have tried so many chap sticks but none have worked, but this ointment works GREAT!!! After one day of using this, I woke up with the softest and plumpest lips ever!! I put it on in the morning and before I go to bed. It lasts a long time without wearing off and I love how it has no smell or taste. I&#x27;m sure this product would work just as well for other areas of dry skin. VERY impressed!!!</li>
            <li> My feet feel better after 2 days - wow!  Used the minimum amount (1/4 teaspoon approx.) to cover the foot, put a sock over it, and leave overnight, or use just before a workout.  Simply excellent.</li>
            <li> Just discovered this and love how it helps my dry hands!</li>
            <li> Slimy, gooey messy stuff.  But when your doctor says that&#x27;s the stuff for an ugly radiation rash, it must be the stuff.  Be prepared to spend more time washing your hands than putting the stuff on.</li>
            <li> Works great on dry skin. Stopped crack from developing on my fingers in dry winter months. I had a problem with cracked skin on finger area before I used this product. Cleaning hands after painting or working on motors ect. really drys them out. Thank you Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dry cracked skin, especially hands &amp; feet, received  as promised at a good price.</li>
            <li> Love it it is great for me</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter who has very dry, chapped &amp; broken skin.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I keep trying to find something more natural.  But this just WORKS for my son&#x27;s cracking eczema skin...and mine.</li>
            <li> Got this to apply to an elderly bedridden lady&#x27;s Shingles.  Antiviral medication would be too toxic for her and this is the only thing that gives her any relief at all.</li>
            <li> I work in a dog salon. My hands are either in hot water or under a hot dryer all day. I suffer from severely dry and cracked hands in the winter. I use this a few nights a week with some latex gloves. I put a large amount on my hands then put the gloves on and sleep like that. In the morning my cracked/dry hands feel soft and healed. This stuff is like magic!!! And you cant beat the subscribe &amp; save price.</li>
            <li> I have used Aquaphor for over 50 years for a problem I have with eczema.  The cost of Aquaphor was always high compared to Vaseline but it always lasted longer.  With a subscription I find the cost to be 25% less than what I can purchase it for at the grocery store.  With Prime shipping there is no additional cost.  I find this to be a tremendous deal.</li>
            <li> use it daily to keep the skin moist.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who had rough cracked hands. This works great! I&#x27;m even using it! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this big jar from Amazon because I use this healing ointment a lot.  It&#x27;s the BEST.  This jar, shipped to your door, is dollars cheaper than going to the grocery store or pharmacy to get it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my feet every night to prevent my feet from cracking during the winter months. This year has been a very cold winter and I am glad that I purchased it. It is just like a light version of vaseline. It does contain vaseline, but other products also. It works great. It is a nice size and will last a longer time than anything else that I have tried. Love it. I have been using it for the last 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Elinor</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver.</li>
            <li> Lotion is very greasy, heavy, and takes a long time to absorb in without leaving residue on everything you touch.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is the only thing that works on my dry eyelids, though I am starting to try some natural alternatives to petroleum. Works well on chapped lips too.</li>
            <li> Used it after getting tattoos and it worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t live without it.  Two kids with eczema in beautiful, cold, dry Colorado.  I also use it as eye makeup remover.  This is another monthly item in our subscribe and save order.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my skin gets so dry in the winter.  It works well but it&#x27;s worth mentioning that it will stain your clothes.  That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor really softens dry and cracked skin.  The only negative is that it is very greasy, like petroleum jelly.  I use it faithfully at bedtime on hands and feet, but it&#x27;s just too messy for day use.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my chapped lips and this is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make them worse. It also works great for dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. She and my son use it regularly. Says it really helps their skin. Would purchase again. Great product.</li>
            <li> This cream is not for black skin at all. Too thick it&#x27;s just didn&#x27;t work at all. Not good for black skin</li>
            <li> Great product but this size will take years to use up.  Even if a family of 4 used it you&#x27;d need a lot of cracked skin.  Smaller tubs please wanted.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s a bit greasy, but it gets the job done. Huge jar but, you go through it; i noticed.</li>
            <li> Excellent for baby bottom, has helped stave off diaper rash several times! Happy family here!</li>
            <li> Very good, my heels useless cracking a few days just fine.</li>
            <li> Find it very useful to control dryness and resulting itch.  Also seem to work well with cracked skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great ointment especially if you have had a facial peel or have very dry skin. It is oily since it is a healing ointment.</li>
            <li> Very effective product in a jar of the right size, for use this winter season.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever! Got rid of my sons cradle cap almost instantly at 5 months old. It wasn&#x27;t going away on it&#x27;s on. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake, this is an ointment with a Vaseline-like quality.  You will not just put in on your hands and go.  However, it does as it claims; this is a fabulous treatment for dry winter hands.</li>
            <li> We love this for all our dry skin. Dry lips, heels, hands or even scrapes. It is heavy but it works.</li>
            <li> It would be cheaper to buy vaseline, because it leaves your hands greasy.  I hate that!!!!&lt;br /&gt;They should sell little gloves with this product to put on your hands so you don&#x27;t get everything you touch greasy!!!</li>
            <li> Saw this on the Doctor OZ TV program and ordered this from the reviews. It really does work if used properly.</li>
            <li> I am going under face and neck radiation therapy and one of my Nurse Practicioners recommented this product for the inevitable wear and tear on my skin.  I am halfway through treatment and my faithful use of this product has brought positive remarks from my health providers about how well my skin is holding up compared to the average.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I bought this to help with the healing process of my tattoo. After applying Aveeno over and over and over again, I was so happy to receive this in the mail! I applied a thin layer and after that I had no more cracked, dry, itchy tattoo! :) It didn&#x27;t fade the color and it healed perfectly. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use anything else! This is also good for other uses, like lips, knees and elbows...Good stuff!</li>
            <li> If the winter had ruined your hands this is a great product. I use it at night with plastic gloves on when I sleep and my hands are soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have had back surgery and use a heating pad daily. Aquaphor healed my burns after I stopped using the heating pad. It aso helps my cancer patients who have had radiation burns. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> It look like vaseline but it is not. Vaseline is petroleum jelly. I underline PETROLEUM. You draw your conclusions from there. This is a very good product and it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Yes, I think so!  My husband has been in the hospital for four months.  Along the line he had very, very dry skin.  The hospital used this and really raved about it like it&#x27;s some magic cure or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my husband had very, very dry and calloused feet due to his illness.  I slathered this on the soles, heels and toes one night, and the next morning they were smooth as, well you know, &#x27;a baby&#x27;s bottom&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess the hospital was right, this stuff is wonderful.  Works like magic. No scent either which is great for me because I&#x27;m a little sensitive to heavy scents.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of tattoos, some of which I have won competitions with, and I have found that this stuff works the BEST BY FAR! Be careful not to over-use the product, a little goes a long way and you do not want to suffocate the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, for most tattoos I usually apply a very small amount of this 3-4 times a day and rub it into the skin well. I would recommend AGAINST buying a tub if you use it for this purpose - if you need to grab more after you have already touched your tattoo you will contaminate the tub with whatever dead skin is on your finger. As always, your hands should be perfectly clean before cleaning your tattoo and then applying this product.</li>
            <li> This is the top lotion for kids &amp; adult with eczema.  This lotion is water base lotion (not alcohol base); therefore, it does not sting the skins when applied.  It is much less expensive to buy online than in local stores.  Good size for people who needs a lot of usage thru the day.  Recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. We love this because we have dry skin and it gives our skin great relief. My skin feel much better especially my legs and feet which seems to be more dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> I was receiving radiation for breast cancer.  A lot of women told me how burned and painful they were.&lt;br /&gt;I used Aquaphor and had NO problems.</li>
            <li> Got this as a recommended product from my dermatologist.  Comes in handy when skin gets red and dry.</li>
            <li> I like the product and will use it as needed but it is 41% petroleum jelly so it does not absord into your skin right away. So caution would be advised about what you touch after you apply it to your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Vaseline (100% petrolatum), which is occlusive, Aquaphor (41% petrolatum) forms a semi-occlusive barrier on the skin. This enables the transmission of water and oxygen, important in wound healing, and the formation of a protective moist healing environment.[8] Its other key ingredients (see below) absorb the skin’s natural wound exudates, keeping the wound moist to help promote healing.[9]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor is a non-comedogenic ointment and does not contain any fragrances, preservatives, or dyes.[9] Aquaphor is used and recommended for minor post-operative wounds or defects by health care professionals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and economic and it visibly improved the condition of the skin on my hands. A bit on the greasy side if you put it on your palms, but I learned to use for the palms a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, I am very pleased with this particular product.</li>
            <li> My hands suffered from the cold wind and dryness in winter. Frequent hand washing and house chores do not help either. My hands were cracking and bleeding and no lotion or oil could make it better. Finally a pharmacist recommended this to me and it stopped the cracking and bleeding in just 2 applications. After 3 days, my hands were smooth again! Definitely a must especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion daily as body lotion and during the winter on my hands AND face. It does not break me out. I&#x27;ve tried the WalMart knock-off: no where near the quality of Aquaphor.  This is a great value.  I&#x27;ve had this container for three months already and only used about 25% of it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the same experience as other people. As far as I can tell, this does not operate any differently/better than vaseline, and the only active ingredient in it is the same as in vaseline--petrolatum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work lawncare and my eczema on my middle fingers gets totally messed up, cracked, cut and painful, and this aquaphor did nothing more than the normal vaseline I&#x27;ve been using for a year. The best thing I found was surprisingly a non-oily lotion called Ambi.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient (half) is petroleum jelly, to which is added some mineral oil, glycerin, alcohol and something unpronounceable. I won&#x27;t buy this again. It FEELS like petroleum jelly, SMELLS like petroleum jelly, but costs MUCH more than petroleum jelly. I&#x27;ve bought other Eucerin products that I liked, but feel cheated by this one!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Helps super dry skin without any irritation if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product, its used mainly to maintain soft, smooth and callus free feet and to keep elbows and knees smooth and well moisturized (no ashy body parts allowed)</li>
            <li> my newborn had serve diaper rash  this is the only thing that worked so thankful for the other reviews which is the reason i tried it  must have for babies bottom</li>
            <li> Have found nothing better than Aquaphor for healing dry lips, toddler owies, diaper rash and cold sores. This size tub lasts a long time as well!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Will clear up any skin problems of dry, cracked nature in a few days.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has dry skin and this product really helps. A few applications a day and it keeps her from scratching at her dry skin and causing irritations.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of this product, I had to try it.  I live in the desert southwest and my feet are always really dry.  This feels like glorified vaseline (which is much less expensive than Aquaphor).  If you use it, make sure to leave it on the feet for a bit (I sit in the recliner with a towel on the footrest) before putting on socks or walking.  If you put on socks, all of the product rubs off....and if you walk without socks, the product is all over the floor (and if you put it on and get in bed, it smears all over the sheets).  I prefer Palmers Cocoa Butter as I think it works better and is less messy---and is less expensive!</li>
            <li> This product is really greasy but it&#x27;s the only thing that has helped my dry skin.  I will never be without it again.  A friend referred me to it and she was so right.  It really works! Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion for dry skin. We use it right out of the shower to lock in moisture. If we have little scratches on our skin we apply this over night and within a few nights they heel up well. And I will never purchase this is store. It&#x27;s so much cheaper here!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something strong to help my cracked knuckles this winter.  I bought cotton gloves to wear over this, but it&#x27;s so greasy and thick that it gets all over everything.  I didn&#x27;t even notice that much difference in my hands.  I&#x27;m going to back to cornhusker&#x27;s lotion!</li>
            <li> Great for healing tattoos! If used correctly and often I have no scabbing and won&#x27;t need a touch up :)</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  Works wonders</li>
            <li> This is so sticky and does not absorb well. It made me itch so much that I had to take a shower to wash it off a few times before the itching stopped. I got this ointment because of the positive reviews, but it did not work for me. I will go back to plain Vaseline!</li>
            <li> big tub, great to use.  will last me a long time to use all this. was great for newborn baby.</li>
            <li> I gave this only 3 stars because I don&#x27;t see any difference between this and regular generic pure petroleum jelly as far as function, texture, or results. It does contain some inactive ingredients that pure petroleum jelly does not, but I did not notice any added effectiveness in healing or preventing chapped skin. It isn&#x27;t a bad product; just doesn&#x27;t seem worth the difference in price to me.</li>
            <li> I use this after I get a tattoo and it&#x27;s great. Also good if you have dry patchy skin or elbows it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I use as a lotion because it&#x27;s easy on the skin and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth especially in the winter. It&#x27;s a little pricey though I skip a few weeks before I repurchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this is medicinal enough for our needs so I don&#x27;t use it.  Vaseline seems to be more of a surface thing.  I don&#x27;t know why only Americans are blessed with the opportunity to get free supplies of this and other creams owned by the German company - I don&#x27;t  know if German or European ichthyosis sufferers are getting the same deal.    I think this cream is more of a ... not a placebo - some sufferers insist on using it - but it doesn&#x27;t solve the underlying problem or even remedy the symptoms.    Hopefully, you will not get sent special test creams for research purposes unbeknownst to you.  We live in a Morgellan world and it could get worse because of Fukushima i.e. more problems that can&#x27;t be solved.    _________      Even today, half a century later, both people and animals on Rongelap and other nearby islands suffer from birth defects. The most common defects have been \\&quot;jelly fish babies\\&quot;, born with no bones and with transparent skin. Their brains and beating hearts can be seen. The babies usually live a day or two before they stop breathing.    A girl from Rongelap describes the situation in the following words: \\&quot;I cannot have children. I have had miscarriages on seven occasions... Our culture and religion teach us that reproductive abnormalities are a sign that women have been unfaithful. For this reason, many of my friends keep quiet about the strange births that they have had. In privacy they give birth, not to children as we like to think of them, but to things we could only describe as &#x27;octopuses&#x27;, &#x27;apples&#x27;, &#x27;turtles&#x27; and other things in our experience. We do not have Marshallese words for these kinds of babies, because they were never born before the radiation came.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this because the jar lasts a long time, and little bit goes a long way. I use a little bit of this on my feet, and it is not greasy feeling (like vaseline). I use a little of this on my face at night, when my face is very dry. I use a little bit of this on my lips. I occasionally use a little of this in my vagina, which is rare.</li>
            <li> Great big tub for less on amazon gotta love it. My doc was okay with putting this on my baby any time. This is the same as baby aquaphor!! They just put &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; on the tub so it can get shelved with with baby stuff and easier to find.. Basically another &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Whether it is dry skin or scrapes and bruises, this is a must have for parents.  We use this daily with our little children and it helps keep their skin strong and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have acne and use it on my face . . . Wow it works wonders and I will swear by it. I first saw it used for Eczema and heard it&#x27;s good for skin and doesn&#x27;t clog pores and for some reason my skin has never looked better. I put it on every night before bed. Too greeasy to wear during day but it&#x27;s okay, Night works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recommended this for my hands, which get chapped and irritated. It works well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate them more, like some things can. I like this product, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin that is affected by the Midwest winter season</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this to me.  I&#x27;ve recently had foot surgery and she said it would be good to put on my scars when the staples are removed.  It says on the container it&#x27;s good for irritations/itching.  I put some on an area above the bandages that was itching.  I had a bad rash the next morning with blisters.  I pulled up the side effects and they include itching, swelling, rash, etc.  This stuff is 50% Vaseline and I&#x27;m allergic to Vaseline.  Will NEVER buy this junk again.</li>
            <li> Works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Better than Vaseline; keeps my skin lubricated.</li>
            <li> It is as advertised - very think.  Almost like  petroleum jelly.  I use it for hands and feet at night..  I wish I hadn&#x27;t ordered such a large container.</li>
            <li> Great product for the kids.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for stubborn itching on my back in winter. Nothing else has worked: lotions, oils (like coconut), hydrocortisone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has finally taken the itch away.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  It was recommended by my dermatologist when I was struggling with hand and foot psoriasis.  i also have used it for rashes, scratches, itchy spots, etc.  Jar this size lasts me for a couple years, and really handy to keep in the house.</li>
            <li> Good for so many things, and all ages!</li>
            <li> Best thing to heal a tattoo</li>
            <li> been using it on my tattoos and love  the product will be ordering it again if i need any more</li>
            <li> Works fine....a big amount for the money!</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and i used aquaphor before but i stopped and tried regular lotion because of the price, but it she ended up having rashes all the time. So i am back using it again and i have to say it works very well, keeping her skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great for tattoo aftercare and many other skin needs. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My newborn son has Eczema and this is the only thing that has helped.  We&#x27;ve tried multiple lotions and creams and this works quickly and very well.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the product, we say it on DR OZ and it seems to help her out quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I have had a longstanding skin problem for 2 years.  This product did not resolve the problem but it works much better than most other things I have tried.  It even worked better than Triple Cream which is about twice as expensive.  I will continue to use both products because they each seem to treat eczema/psoriasis differently.  But I would use Aquaphor first or most often because it is so much more reasonably priced.  Neither product cured the problem but both alleviated symptoms and decreased discomfort.</li>
            <li> ICK. THIS IS UN-SCENTED VASOLINE. GREASY, STICKY, DOES NOT SOAK IN. YUCK.</li>
            <li> Aquaphor is great stuff so this big bottle comes in handy, only con is that it&#x27;s messy like a vaseline jar</li>
            <li> Oh Aquaphor.  I learned of your magical powers when I had my first child and you healed diaper rash....scrapes and boo boos, and dry skin.  Tentatively I slathered some on my cracked heels one night and woke up e next morning with the skin of a newborn.  This stuff is truly amazing.  Works great for a baby for diaper rash, preventative barrier for diaper rash, healing dry, cracked, burned, irritated skin.  I use it for everything.  Love love love it.  Worth the price, lasts forever.  Great product!</li>
            <li> amazing for dry hands and feet</li>
            <li> Recommended by our pediatrician for the baby, and for good reason.  Aquaphor helps soothe dry skin on my infant son better than any other product.  Scentless and dye-less as well.</li>
            <li> My wife is pretty picky when it comes to body lotion products, and this is one of the few that she really likes. I&#x27;ve even used it before when my hands get extremely dry and cracked during the winter and it produces great results. That being said, I prefer something a little less greasy and thick. This is the consistency of vaseline which she loves, but I don&#x27;t like so much. I much prefer another product by Eucerin which is their Intensive Repair lotion. Does a great job and is not quite as thick or messy as this. All in all though its a great product, especially for those with extremely dry skin that other products tend to be less effective on.</li>
            <li> I just use it on lip and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my son since he was born (he is now 2 years old) at the suggestion of his physician.  It got rid of his dry skin and keeps it moisturized daily. I haven&#x27;t had any dry skin issues after using this product. My husband started using it for his dry skin and it helped him as well. I am sold on this one!</li>
            <li> Much better than lotion!</li>
            <li> Works as expected and it does help with dry heels.  I use about once a week at night with a thin pair of socks.  Wake up in the morning with soft feet.</li>
            <li> Helps my feet and legs I am a diabetic</li>
            <li> I swim in the winter months  and this is a lifesaver.  I put it on my face and hands before swimming and after my shower before going out into the cold.  My usually dry skin has stayed very soft and smooth using this strategy.</li>
            <li> I use this as diaper rash cream, because I have found that it works 100 times better than the Desitin or generic brands, even the maximum strength. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t have the very medicinal smell that the other creams do. It works wonders and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product and price</li>
            <li> This is magic.  My kids have sensitive skin that gets very dry.  SInce I&#x27;ve been coating it in Aquaphor before bed, they have improved immeasurably. I use it on the backs of my hands, which are always terrible in the winter, and it is great for that too.  I bought a few tubes to have in each room in addition to this big jar!</li>
            <li> looks OK, useful to eliminate crack on finger tips.</li>
            <li> Satisfied, feel good。</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;very good</li>
            <li> I have been using this ointment for my dry feet, and it has been doing a great job on keeping my feet moist. All you need to do is just put on a nice amount of the ointment and put on a nice heavy pair of socks.</li>
            <li> Great treatment for my baby&#x27;s dry skin! Now her skin is becomimg so smooth and silky. Definitely - recommend!</li>
            <li> If you have eczema or just dry skin this is what you need. I use it on my sons eczema and it is great on my hands. Absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> We use this after a bath and it has eliminated eczema on my toddler (my pediatrician recommended this).  At first I thought it was gross to use a tub instead of a tube but it is so much cheaper.  Now I don&#x27;t even think about it.  It is absorbed a little slowly, but, eczema is no longer a problem.</li>
            <li> Best product for diaper rash there is!! I&#x27;ve tried every other type of diaper cream and nothing else touched my sons horrible rash on his bum. The generic versions work okay but are not as good and thick I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly from seller. This ointment is so wonderful. I came to know about it through my Mother-in-law. She uses it daily. I was applying it for her over a weeks time and found I never had such smooth hands. It does wonders for cracked heals and putting on both finger nails and toe nails. Mine were so dry and now are baby soft.</li>
            <li> WE LOVE Aquaphor. Our son, 18 months old, has always had the worst eczema and diaper rash. This is the only thing that will clear up both in less than 24 hours. We now use it on all skin ailments. Best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> I feel this is the best product on the market for severely dry skin.  Even if it isn&#x27;t so dry, it works wonders on all dry skin types.  Just to moisturize your body or the tough spots that can&#x27;t retain moisture.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Expensive, sticky but does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I really like it. I work with my hands at work, building projects, tearing down promotional displays and my hands are hurting and dry.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It is an essential item for your medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> great product for soothing very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my aquaphor. I was my hands way too much and so my hands are always dry. Within two days of using the product at night I can see a dramatic difference (no cuts, hands are softer, etc).</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t felt or seen any effects are using this product...not much better than Vasoline.</li>
            <li> I started putting this on my feet every morning before putting socks on.  It lasts all day and works better than Okeifs.  It is a little more expensive, but the jar lasts for months.  I can go through Okeifs in less than 2 weeks if I use it daily.  This product has been around since 1925 for a good reason.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Buy it...</li>
            <li> This item is good for the skin  and after getting a tatto</li>
            <li> Really helps my psoriosis</li>
            <li> DERMATOLOGY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED FOR DRY SKIN, WORKS BETTER THAN OTHER PRODUCTS I&#x27;VE TRIED.</li>
            <li> A mommy must to prevent and treat diaper rash!</li>
            <li> Great Price.  Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I have dry hands. I bought this as I heard about it on the Dr Oz show. The first time I tried for several days applying this but stopped after it made my hands itch to the point I was scratching off skin. I stopped using it for a week and my hands recovered. I then tried it for two days and it made my hands itch again. This is horrible ointment as far as how it reacts to my skin,, I&#x27;ve now thrown the container into the garbage can. I&#x27;m either allergic to it or it&#x27;s just plain bad. I am now going back to \\&quot;Lubriderm Intense Skin Repair Lotion\\&quot;. Lubriderm had worked for my dry skin condition for years but after hearing Dr Oz say that Aquapher was so good I had to try it. That show may be correct on some things but this one he&#x27;s not. The product is horrible on my skin and made me itch so bad that I was itching my skin off!</li>
            <li> Same as any other kind of protreoleom jelly.</li>
            <li> great for those with eczema</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper then buying in the tube, so why not.</li>
            <li> This is the only butt cream I buy for my baby now. Also good for lips in harsh weather.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my child&#x27;s eczema.  I slather it on both morning and night and it helps her with her dry and itchiness.</li>
            <li> Best emollient for wind burn or chapped skin!</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel so soft and healing the rough spots very nicely.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have ever used for dry, cracked heels. It literally softens overnight and is not greasy. I rub it on my feet, put on socks for a couple of hours, take them off and go to bed and have new feet in the morning. I have tried everything and this is the best plus very economical.</li>
            <li> Great product for eczema. I use it daily!</li>
            <li> I bought this item with doubts, once I used it on my husbands feet, it started to work fast.&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream, can&#x27;t live without it.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good because it really moisturizes the skin but since I haven&#x27;t used it long enough cannot really tell as yet how effective it is and if it will heel my cracked heels-- so far no improvement but used it only for a couple of months as yet. Will edit info here again if I see any improvement in the cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff with a whole slew of uses.  Note: the baby stuff is the same as the regular stuff.  Identical ingredients.  Great for repairing diaper rash and any kind of damaged skin.  Good alternative for healing cuts too like a 3 in 1 antibiotic.</li>
            <li> I goober my feet with this and the cracks feel better overnight.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist. I&#x27;ve been very pleased.</li>
            <li> its  very thick, good to put on at bedtime, but you need socks to keep it off the bed sheets, or gloves for dry hands.</li>
            <li> The perfect solution to dry, cracked skin. Highly recommend for face when taking winter hikes, for dry rough heels, as well as any dry skin on your entire body!</li>
            <li> I use this along w/ gold bond lotion to make it less greasy and it leaves my skin well hydrated.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The best product and very good price. I will be use this.product ever!! Thank you</li>
            <li> Very good, second purchase!</li>
            <li> wife uses this stuff and swears its the best --she gets dry finger cracks in winter and this really helps</li>
            <li> Great deal &amp; I absolutely swear by Aquaphor. I use it on my baby&#x27;s bottom &amp; see results in the next couple of diaper changes.</li>
            <li> Great quality product.</li>
            <li> THis works very well and is healing for affected skin as well</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look nice and smooth despice of fact that I have ictyosys</li>
            <li> I had terrible dry lips this winter after an allergic reaction to the flu shot, and just this terrible North Eastern winter we have had.  This stuff has made ALL the difference in the world!</li>
            <li> Came package well... works as described</li>
            <li> My skin doctor recommended this. She was right. My wife uses it and her dry skin is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I did a home chemical peel which apparently I left on my face too long.  I ended up with scaly, dark red skin around my cheeks and lips that were so embarrassing I stayed home.  I tried every natural oil I have -- Emu, rosehip, tons of aloe from the actual plant etc.  No change.  I looked at several websites and found out that it was &amp;#34;hypopigmentation&amp;#34; that may or may not clear up in a year!  MY FACE was a wreck. Oh, how desperate I was.  Then one site had a dermatologist who suggested Aquaphor for people if their bad peel was still in the healing stage.  I had my husband go out and buy some.  I put it on thick that day and night.  I woke up the next day -- my face was half clear.  Two more days and it was basically entirely healed.  It&#x27;s the waxiest, most unnatural feeling petroleum oil there is but my God, it works.  I say to all my friends who want to use all natural products sometimes science does it right.  This stuff is cheap and amazing.  One point, my husband bought it for about 10 bucks at Walgreen&#x27;s which was about 3 bucks cheaper than Amazon as I write this.  He complained about the &amp;#34;high price&amp;#34; but it fixed my FACE.  Needless to say, he doesn&#x27;t know much about how much women&#x27;s face products cost because this is a steal considering what it is capable of.  I&#x27;d also highly recommend it for children&#x27;s diaper rashes because it clears that up in hours.  -- Do yourself a favor ... NEVER leave a chemical peel on your face too long.  And for anyone I do think Aquaphor is a must have in your medicine cabinet.  I&#x27;m forever grateful to this company and glad that if I ever need to get it from Amazon Prime I can.</li>
