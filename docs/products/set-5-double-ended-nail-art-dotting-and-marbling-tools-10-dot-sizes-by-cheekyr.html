            <li>if you dont need it right away, very good price, too long to get it, but that is what they said</li>
            <li>If you do your own nails, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>They seem very sturdy and are very easy to use and clean.</li>

            <li>Package took forever to receive, but worth the wait!</li>

            <li>They are a lot of fun &amp; make things so easy.</li>
            <li>So when I seen these I ordered them right away!</li>
            <li>Great for dotting the middle of flowers, creating images of the sun and moon and great for creating images of eyse on little critters for your fingernails.</li>
            <li>4 of the ends were the exact same size, but they still work great.</li>
            <li>They were cheap enough and she really enjoys them and can make great designs using them.</li>
            <li>The tools have a cool design and look just like they do in the picture.  </li>
            <li>These dotting tools work fantastic and are WELL worth the  price.</li>
            <li>However, I saw these and couldn&#x27;t resist since they&#x27;re such a good deal.</li>
            <li>I love them so much.</li>
            <li>She researched all the cool tricks you can do with these.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>cool designs</li>
            <li>so I did not actually use it, but the recipient, my niece loved it.......</li>
            <li>cool design!&amp;#34; then it was &amp;#34;and</li>
            <li>Not a bad price.</li>
            <li>They fit easily in your hand, are comfortable to hold and use, and they are of high quality.</li>
            <li>It was a great buy that I would definately recommend to other cosmetologist and nail technicians.</li>
            <li>This set is super inexpensive, so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>love theese so much love the different sizes and the colors...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a super novice at nail designing.</li>
            <li>They are made very well and easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li>I love how each pen has a different color swirl, so I&#x27;ll be able to tell which one is which without having to pull them out to look at the tips.</li>
            <li>so I had to super glue it and</li>
            <li>Okay maybe &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; shouldn&#x27;t be first ;-) ...</li>
            <li>They shipped from China to the U.S. and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>A great little gift for someone who gets excited about nail art.</li>
            <li>, i just liked the way the other ones looked more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly know how to explain how a doting tool can be fantastic</li>
            <li>very pretty.</li>
            <li>I also noticed in the reviews everyone was complaining about them having different sized tips, mine did not, and if they did I still got them very cheap!</li>
            <li>Received them earlier than scheduled and I am very pleased with the look of them</li>

            <li>i do my own nails and these tools help alot with different designs that i do--also bought a set for my sister and she loves them also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple years and even bought my sister the same kind.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I can not wait to start using them to creat all kinds of fun art on my nails.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I chose these ones because I liked that they were different colors.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and worth the inexpensive price</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>You can also just dip any of these dotting tools into a clear top coat and use it to pick up rhinestones/jews if you wanted too.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind using them without being attached to the holders, you can still actually use the end pieces on their own.</li>
            <li>These tips are nice, a lot of different ones.  </li>
            <li>10 different sized tools along with a nice case.  </li>
            <li>I got these for my daughter and I and so far we love them.  </li>
            <li>they make perfect little circles in every size...the only thing that i have to say i that after every time you use them that you need to clean them with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>The only thing is the shipping probably took around 3 weeks, but other than that I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>These are great, just remember to clean off the nail polish, otherwise the size gets bigger and bigger each time!</li>
            <li>I got the item right on time.</li>
            <li>Right away I used it</li>
            <li>she started using them right away</li>
            <li>These come in a nice little package and are easily stored.</li>
            <li>makes it easy to make cute flowers and other fun designs.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean, and the different colors help you keep track of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best money I have ever spent on nail products!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>They are very nicely packaged and are double sided with all different sized balls.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them very much though.</li>
            <li>i dont like this service very much.</li>
            <li>The yellow box is cute storage.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that these come in different sizes.  </li>
            <li>I received my package on time exactly when the seller said I would.</li>
            <li>They do take some practice at first</li>
            <li>Unlike most reviews say there are all different sizes.</li>
            <li>but if you dont its pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>Her nails are pretty</li>
            <li>They have many different points on both sides so that gives you a lot of freedom to create many different designs you can come up with.  </li>
            <li>The tools are well made and pretty.  </li>
            <li>Sure, there are different ones, but not as varied as the pic.</li>
            <li>Really pretty tools at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My nail tech paid lots more for a different set and they have stared falling apart.  </li>
            <li>but the first time I used them and went to wash them off one of the ends broke off</li>
            <li>Product was neatly packaged and you receive exactly what you see advertised.</li>
            <li>I still though I should take a chance for the price because I saw others for just 5 sizes that was higher than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I received it exactly on the estimates date.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>The handles are actually a clear acrylic with the plastic swirls embedded into it, so they are rounded and smooth, not the way it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>Great for the price and would last you a long time.</li>
            <li>but it was my first thought when I saw it (&amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>you want to order this specifically because it has 10 different sides, go to &#x27;more buying options.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Product did exactly what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li>sturdy material, exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Very durable feeling and all the sizes you need!</li>
            <li>The variety of tip sizes to choose from means you can create many different nail art designs.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>All 5 tools are well crafted and look really pretty with their pastel hued handles.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty and the colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li>Other than that, these tools are really amazing for the price I got them at.</li>
            <li>Down side is they didn&#x27;t come in a cute box like pictured!</li>
            <li>But really, how many different sizes do you need?</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, the sizes are all different (as far as I can tell) but they are advertising one thing</li>
            <li>they each have different sizes and such good quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to pretty much anyone who is into nail art designs.</li>
            <li>But other than that its great especially the dotting tools.</li>
            <li>They are not only dotting Tools,but also are great for lots of other nail art.</li>
            <li>and I doubt any other seller is any better; many reviews claim that the product is different from the description and that is the case.</li>
            <li>so easy to make different designs with.</li>
            <li>Each side is a different size dot and cleans easy with polish remover.</li>
            <li>but I wouldnt suggest getting these if you want a large variety, because you wont get it.</li>
            <li>Comparing them to other offers I came by, these were hands down the best deal and pretty colors too.</li>
            <li>and I recommend them very highly.</li>
            <li>Which was a very high selling point for me.  </li>
            <li>The material is heavy and amazing.</li>
            <li>I love these dotting tools, they were everything i expected and arrived 10 days before the estimated arrival date, im very please with this.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>They make nail art so much easier.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of having them all together in one place ready for me to use.</li>
            <li>When I started looking for nail dotting tools, I really had no idea</li>
            <li>/&gt;They seem to be very well-made.</li>
            <li>very sturdy</li>
            <li>They sent me the missing one as soon as possible and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product and seller.</li>
            <li>it fast</li>
            <li>Also if you use too much polish it distorts the size of the dot.</li>
            <li>FAST</li>
            <li>but it really is.</li>
            <li>Really like these dotting tools.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend these tools for beginners and professionals .</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Is really to work with</li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dotting tools are very helpful.</li>
            <li>They work really well</li>
            <li>I do my nails very often</li>
            <li>what I wanted in terms of size or anything really.  </li>
            <li>But since they will serve the purpose I needed them for, and were so reasonably priced, I&#x27;ll cut my losses and save myself the trip to the post office to return them.</li>
            <li>Very excited☆</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Considering the price, I&#x27;m not too fussed about the whole thing.</li>
            <li>These nail tools are a lot of fun, and I was surprised by the quality.  </li>
            <li>the dots are really close in size</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li>These dotting pens are really durable and I can&#x27;t believe how well they work.</li>
            <li>They work really well when doing nail art.</li>
            <li>Not uses them much though</li>
            <li>These tools have really expanded my nail art.  </li>
            <li>thanks HP</li>
            <li>May daughter really likes these.</li>
            <li>different sized ends don&#x27;t help, either - and honestly, the sizes are very similar.</li>
            <li>They are fun to use and getting some really fun designs that would not be possible otherwise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooo much easier than using a tweezer and wasting more money for those other tools made just for \\&quot;picking up jews\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The only reason that i had a problem was the snaps that was attached to the case when i opened it after about 3 days later it came off, the leather inst very strong either.</li>
            <li>of course you can make more than dots with these things -- you can use them to help you create other shapes and lines depending on how you use it / apply the polish.</li>
            <li>What most people don&#x27;t see is that one tip on every tool is the same, so you are only really getting six tips.</li>
            <li>So many designs to create other than dots!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to get a straight line from them, but that is what you get with any dotting tool</li>
            <li>They vary in size from extra small to extra large and that&#x27;s a good thing!  </li>
            <li>absolutely love the fact that it is ten different size dotting tips.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this seller  and these items.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>so i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>would have liked them to be labeled in some way, because there is no logic to how the different sizes corresponds to the colored handles and some of the tip sizes are so similar that you can only tell a difference upon very close inspection, if at all.</li>
            <li>Some of the very small sizes may look the same, but they aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Totally pleased and would order again!!</li>
            <li>I got these ones because I really like that clear plastic look for my nail tools.</li>
            <li>They help her to do delicate nail art on her own.</li>
            <li>I have had so much fun playing with the different patterns.</li>
            <li>Totally not what I visioned and never worked right.</li>
            <li>They looked different than the picture (they were black and white instead of rainbow) but other than that they are awesome!!</li>
            <li>They did take weeks to ship to my PO Box, but I guess that&#x27;s due to the free shipping.</li>
            <li>New nails</li>
            <li>my daughter loves creating new designs.  </li>
            <li>Y&#x27;all should get them because they make hard designs very very very easy</li>
            <li>They even come in a cute little case!</li>
            <li>They all seem to be at least slightly different sizes and are cute and colorful.</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the picture, coming in the same colors.</li>
            <li>One side of all the dotters are the exact same size.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these on Tuesday and they arrived at my house first thing Friday morning, and that&#x27;s with standard shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I got them early!</li>
            <li>the is the exact same size.  </li>
            <li>This leaves the yellow tool as the only tool with two completely unique sides.  </li>
            <li>At a first glance, yes some of the sizes do look alike and some seem like they have the same ends.</li>
            <li>At first I was sceptical because of the reviews about there only being 5 sizes</li>
            <li>Love uses these, helps a lot with small designs.</li>
            <li>Not only are these functional but they are so pretty too.</li>
            <li>in the picture they flip some of the sticks to make it seem like there are 10 DIFFERENT tip when really there are 7!</li>
            <li>one side of all of them is EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li>and I wanted but did not receive the exact same product.</li>
            <li>The little leather case that they come in makes it easy for her to pack them up and take them with her where ever she goes.</li>
            <li>The packaging was a little different than the picture shown but other than that, the dotting tools are great.</li>
            <li>I first came upon this product when my young ten year pld cousin had ordered them.</li>
            <li>The pack I got came all in the same color, and true, there are only 6 sizes as opposed to 10.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re double sided which means you get more and it takes less space.</li>
            <li>The only problem I came across was that the metal pieces were not properly glued in but is easy to slide back into place!</li>
            <li>The biggest one is still a little too small for some of my designs, but it has many different small sizes, is easy to clean with acetone, and has pretty handles</li>
            <li>I love these little pens!!</li>
            <li>Didnt come with the pouch pictured just came in a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li>For the price of these tools, they came in a clear case which helps to keep them all together in my nailpolish bag.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit for my 11 years old.</li>
            <li>Also, the pink tool and the yellow tool had the same sized ends, it wasn&#x27;t a problem or anything I just thought it was interesting.</li>
            <li>Cheap price for five tools that create a total of ten different size</li>
            <li>I used to try to make dots with a qtip but having different sized dotting tools is alife saver for bubble themes and eyeballs haha</li>
            <li>Reccommend completely.</li>
            <li>so I needed these for the more complex designs.</li>
            <li>I use these quite a lot, they work very well for making different sized dots.  </li>
            <li>Professional looking dots await you.  </li>
            <li>The one I bought is the $6.99 one directly from cheeky that is prime eligible.</li>
            <li>I use these a lot to do simple polka dot details on my nails, simple and fun.</li>
            <li>I only liked the two sizes, the rest too big or small.</li>
            <li>but it wasnt a big deal because they do the same exact thing</li>
            <li>Now I do not have 10 different dotting sizes, I only have 6, but for the price I paid I&#x27;m willing to let that slide.  </li>
            <li>But 5 are the exact same size so you really only get 5 not 10.</li>
            <li>This is major quality!</li>
            <li>When i ordered these the colorful doting tools where supposed to arrive but instead the black and clear ones arrived.</li>
            <li>than i expected compared to my bobbypins but never the less I was able to get used to them.</li>
            <li>most dotting tools have five different ones on one side and all the same size on the other side of the dotting toll!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to the 10 different sizes for the dotting tools, which is why I ordered this set from this buyer instead of other sellers on Amazon... got &#x27;em, and while they are perfectly fine dotting tools - there are NOT 10 different sizes.</li>
            <li>Each tool is a different size, so you really get ten dotting tools instead of five.</li>
            <li>I got 10 of them, but I got 2 big ones, and the rest were very small and pretty much the exact same size.</li>
            <li>I got blue, light blue, white, purple, and pink not the colors pictured  </li>
            <li>Not sure how to rate these--They work fine, but the dots seem to all come out the same...</li>
            <li>Thus, there are only 7 different dotting sizes, not the 10 different dotting sizes as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first time using dotting tools, 7 different sizes is probably going to be plenty for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not actually 10 different sizes, you only get 6 different sizes, as 5 of the ends are exactly the same</li>
            <li>I did some nail art and was surprised I felt like there weren&#x27;t enough options for dot sizes.</li>
            <li>So in reality I only have 6 different sizes and not 10 was really looking forward to the bigger size in the picture that I did not receive.</li>
            <li>The case is kinda cheep (be careful when you open it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I actually thought they would have flat ends instead of round, but they work fine and do what I need them do.</li>
            <li>and I thought the little carrying case was perfect, too bad</li>
            <li>But really it&#x27;s not all that different from making dots with a toothpick or the fat end of a straight pin, which is what we used before.</li>
            <li>With these little pens I was able to create fun flashy nail designs.</li>
            <li>set(the main one pictured) had green, yellow, white, blue and pink and it is pretty clear that they are all the same side on one end.</li>
            <li>The only problem is when I got it, there are two blue of this, but there is no pink one.</li>
            <li>In addition, the other side of the pink pen is the exact same size as one of the ones on the blue pen.  </li>

            <li> if you dont need it right away, very good price, too long to get it, but that is what they said</li>
            <li> If you do your own nails, I highly recommend them.</li>

            <li> Package took forever to receive, but worth the wait!</li>

            <li> love theese so much love the different sizes and the colors...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a super novice at nail designing.</li>
            <li> They are made very well and easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li> I love how each pen has a different color swirl, so I&#x27;ll be able to tell which one is which without having to pull them out to look at the tips.</li>
            <li> so I had to super glue it and</li>
            <li> Okay maybe &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; shouldn&#x27;t be first ;-) ...</li>
            <li> They shipped from China to the U.S. and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> A great little gift for someone who gets excited about nail art.</li>
            <li> , i just liked the way the other ones looked more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly know how to explain how a doting tool can be fantastic</li>
            <li> very pretty.</li>
            <li> I also noticed in the reviews everyone was complaining about them having different sized tips, mine did not, and if they did I still got them very cheap!</li>

            <li> but anyways the product overall is amazing</li>
            <li> i do my own nails and these tools help alot with different designs that i do--also bought a set for my sister and she loves them also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple years and even bought my sister the same kind.</li>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind using them without being attached to the holders, you can still actually use the end pieces on their own.</li>
            <li> These tips are nice, a lot of different ones.  </li>
            <li> 10 different sized tools along with a nice case.  </li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter and I and so far we love them.  </li>
            <li> they make perfect little circles in every size...the only thing that i have to say i that after every time you use them that you need to clean them with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the shipping probably took around 3 weeks, but other than that I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are great, just remember to clean off the nail polish, otherwise the size gets bigger and bigger each time!</li>
            <li> I got the item right on time.</li>
            <li> Right away I used it</li>
            <li> she started using them right away</li>
            <li> These come in a nice little package and are easily stored.</li>
            <li> makes it easy to make cute flowers and other fun designs.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to clean, and the different colors help you keep track of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best money I have ever spent on nail products!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They are very nicely packaged and are double sided with all different sized balls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them very much though.</li>
            <li> i dont like this service very much.</li>
            <li> The yellow box is cute storage.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that these come in different sizes.  </li>
            <li> I received my package on time exactly when the seller said I would.</li>
            <li> They do take some practice at first</li>
            <li> Unlike most reviews say there are all different sizes.</li>
            <li> but if you dont its pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> Her nails are pretty</li>
            <li> They have many different points on both sides so that gives you a lot of freedom to create many different designs you can come up with.  </li>
            <li> The tools are well made and pretty.  </li>
            <li> Sure, there are different ones, but not as varied as the pic.</li>
            <li> Really pretty tools at an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My nail tech paid lots more for a different set and they have stared falling apart.  </li>
            <li> but the first time I used them and went to wash them off one of the ends broke off</li>
            <li> Product was neatly packaged and you receive exactly what you see advertised.</li>
            <li> I still though I should take a chance for the price because I saw others for just 5 sizes that was higher than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I received it exactly on the estimates date.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The handles are actually a clear acrylic with the plastic swirls embedded into it, so they are rounded and smooth, not the way it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> Great for the price and would last you a long time.</li>
            <li> but it was my first thought when I saw it (&amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li> you want to order this specifically because it has 10 different sides, go to &#x27;more buying options.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Product did exactly what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li> sturdy material, exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> Very durable feeling and all the sizes you need!</li>
            <li> The variety of tip sizes to choose from means you can create many different nail art designs.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> All 5 tools are well crafted and look really pretty with their pastel hued handles.</li>
            <li> They are very pretty and the colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li> Other than that, these tools are really amazing for the price I got them at.</li>
            <li> Down side is they didn&#x27;t come in a cute box like pictured!</li>
            <li> But really, how many different sizes do you need?</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, the sizes are all different (as far as I can tell) but they are advertising one thing</li>
            <li> they each have different sizes and such good quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to pretty much anyone who is into nail art designs.</li>
            <li> But other than that its great especially the dotting tools.</li>
            <li> They are not only dotting Tools,but also are great for lots of other nail art.</li>
            <li> and I doubt any other seller is any better; many reviews claim that the product is different from the description and that is the case.</li>
            <li> so easy to make different designs with.</li>
            <li> Each side is a different size dot and cleans easy with polish remover.</li>
            <li> but I wouldnt suggest getting these if you want a large variety, because you wont get it.</li>
            <li> Comparing them to other offers I came by, these were hands down the best deal and pretty colors too.</li>
            <li> and I recommend them very highly.</li>
            <li> Which was a very high selling point for me.  </li>
            <li> The material is heavy and amazing.</li>
            <li> I love these dotting tools, they were everything i expected and arrived 10 days before the estimated arrival date, im very please with this.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> They make nail art so much easier.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of having them all together in one place ready for me to use.</li>
            <li> When I started looking for nail dotting tools, I really had no idea</li>
            <li> /&gt;They seem to be very well-made.</li>
            <li> very sturdy</li>
            <li> They sent me the missing one as soon as possible and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> it fast</li>
            <li> Also if you use too much polish it distorts the size of the dot.</li>
            <li> FAST</li>
            <li> but it really is.</li>
            <li> Really like these dotting tools.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend these tools for beginners and professionals .</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> Is really to work with</li>
            <li> very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dotting tools are very helpful.</li>
            <li> They work really well</li>
            <li> I do my nails very often</li>
            <li> what I wanted in terms of size or anything really.  </li>
            <li> But since they will serve the purpose I needed them for, and were so reasonably priced, I&#x27;ll cut my losses and save myself the trip to the post office to return them.</li>
            <li> Very excited☆</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> Considering the price, I&#x27;m not too fussed about the whole thing.</li>
            <li> These nail tools are a lot of fun, and I was surprised by the quality.  </li>
            <li> the dots are really close in size</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> These dotting pens are really durable and I can&#x27;t believe how well they work.</li>
            <li> They work really well when doing nail art.</li>
            <li> Not uses them much though</li>
            <li> These tools have really expanded my nail art.  </li>
            <li> thanks HP</li>
            <li> May daughter really likes these.</li>
            <li> different sized ends don&#x27;t help, either - and honestly, the sizes are very similar.</li>
            <li> They are fun to use and getting some really fun designs that would not be possible otherwise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooo much easier than using a tweezer and wasting more money for those other tools made just for \\&quot;picking up jews\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The only reason that i had a problem was the snaps that was attached to the case when i opened it after about 3 days later it came off, the leather inst very strong either.</li>
            <li> of course you can make more than dots with these things -- you can use them to help you create other shapes and lines depending on how you use it / apply the polish.</li>
            <li> What most people don&#x27;t see is that one tip on every tool is the same, so you are only really getting six tips.</li>
            <li> So many designs to create other than dots!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to get a straight line from them, but that is what you get with any dotting tool</li>
            <li> They vary in size from extra small to extra large and that&#x27;s a good thing!  </li>
            <li> absolutely love the fact that it is ten different size dotting tips.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this seller  and these items.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> so i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> would have liked them to be labeled in some way, because there is no logic to how the different sizes corresponds to the colored handles and some of the tip sizes are so similar that you can only tell a difference upon very close inspection, if at all.</li>
            <li> Some of the very small sizes may look the same, but they aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Totally pleased and would order again!!</li>
            <li> I got these ones because I really like that clear plastic look for my nail tools.</li>
            <li> They help her to do delicate nail art on her own.</li>
            <li> I have had so much fun playing with the different patterns.</li>
            <li> Totally not what I visioned and never worked right.</li>
            <li> They looked different than the picture (they were black and white instead of rainbow) but other than that they are awesome!!</li>
            <li> They did take weeks to ship to my PO Box, but I guess that&#x27;s due to the free shipping.</li>
            <li> New nails</li>
            <li> my daughter loves creating new designs.  </li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all should get them because they make hard designs very very very easy</li>
            <li> They even come in a cute little case!</li>
            <li> They all seem to be at least slightly different sizes and are cute and colorful.</li>
            <li> They look exactly like the picture, coming in the same colors.</li>
            <li> One side of all the dotters are the exact same size.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these on Tuesday and they arrived at my house first thing Friday morning, and that&#x27;s with standard shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I got them early!</li>
            <li> the is the exact same size.  </li>
            <li> This leaves the yellow tool as the only tool with two completely unique sides.  </li>
            <li> At a first glance, yes some of the sizes do look alike and some seem like they have the same ends.</li>
            <li> At first I was sceptical because of the reviews about there only being 5 sizes</li>
            <li> Love uses these, helps a lot with small designs.</li>
            <li> Not only are these functional but they are so pretty too.</li>
            <li> in the picture they flip some of the sticks to make it seem like there are 10 DIFFERENT tip when really there are 7!</li>
            <li> one side of all of them is EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li> and I wanted but did not receive the exact same product.</li>
            <li> The little leather case that they come in makes it easy for her to pack them up and take them with her where ever she goes.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little different than the picture shown but other than that, the dotting tools are great.</li>
            <li> I first came upon this product when my young ten year pld cousin had ordered them.</li>
            <li> The pack I got came all in the same color, and true, there are only 6 sizes as opposed to 10.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re double sided which means you get more and it takes less space.</li>
            <li> The only problem I came across was that the metal pieces were not properly glued in but is easy to slide back into place!</li>
            <li> The biggest one is still a little too small for some of my designs, but it has many different small sizes, is easy to clean with acetone, and has pretty handles</li>
            <li> I love these little pens!!</li>
            <li> Didnt come with the pouch pictured just came in a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li> For the price of these tools, they came in a clear case which helps to keep them all together in my nailpolish bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my 11 years old.</li>
            <li> Also, the pink tool and the yellow tool had the same sized ends, it wasn&#x27;t a problem or anything I just thought it was interesting.</li>
            <li> Cheap price for five tools that create a total of ten different size</li>
            <li> I used to try to make dots with a qtip but having different sized dotting tools is alife saver for bubble themes and eyeballs haha</li>
            <li> Reccommend completely.</li>
            <li> so I needed these for the more complex designs.</li>
            <li> I use these quite a lot, they work very well for making different sized dots.  </li>
            <li> Professional looking dots await you.  </li>
            <li> The one I bought is the $6.99 one directly from cheeky that is prime eligible.</li>
            <li> I use these a lot to do simple polka dot details on my nails, simple and fun.</li>
            <li> I only liked the two sizes, the rest too big or small.</li>
            <li> but it wasnt a big deal because they do the same exact thing</li>
            <li> Now I do not have 10 different dotting sizes, I only have 6, but for the price I paid I&#x27;m willing to let that slide.  </li>
            <li> But 5 are the exact same size so you really only get 5 not 10.</li>
            <li> This is major quality!</li>
            <li> When i ordered these the colorful doting tools where supposed to arrive but instead the black and clear ones arrived.</li>
            <li> than i expected compared to my bobbypins but never the less I was able to get used to them.</li>
            <li> most dotting tools have five different ones on one side and all the same size on the other side of the dotting toll!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the 10 different sizes for the dotting tools, which is why I ordered this set from this buyer instead of other sellers on Amazon... got &#x27;em, and while they are perfectly fine dotting tools - there are NOT 10 different sizes.</li>
            <li> Each tool is a different size, so you really get ten dotting tools instead of five.</li>
            <li> I got 10 of them, but I got 2 big ones, and the rest were very small and pretty much the exact same size.</li>
            <li> I got blue, light blue, white, purple, and pink not the colors pictured  </li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate these--They work fine, but the dots seem to all come out the same...</li>
            <li> Thus, there are only 7 different dotting sizes, not the 10 different dotting sizes as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first time using dotting tools, 7 different sizes is probably going to be plenty for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not actually 10 different sizes, you only get 6 different sizes, as 5 of the ends are exactly the same</li>
            <li> I did some nail art and was surprised I felt like there weren&#x27;t enough options for dot sizes.</li>
            <li> So in reality I only have 6 different sizes and not 10 was really looking forward to the bigger size in the picture that I did not receive.</li>
            <li> The case is kinda cheep (be careful when you open it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I actually thought they would have flat ends instead of round, but they work fine and do what I need them do.</li>
            <li> and I thought the little carrying case was perfect, too bad</li>
            <li> But really it&#x27;s not all that different from making dots with a toothpick or the fat end of a straight pin, which is what we used before.</li>
            <li> With these little pens I was able to create fun flashy nail designs.</li>
            <li> set(the main one pictured) had green, yellow, white, blue and pink and it is pretty clear that they are all the same side on one end.</li>
            <li> The only problem is when I got it, there are two blue of this, but there is no pink one.</li>
            <li> In addition, the other side of the pink pen is the exact same size as one of the ones on the blue pen.  </li>
            <li> everyother day ;) remember to wipe polish off after few \\&quot;dots\\&quot; so it doesnt dry and get sticky</li>
            <li> Two of the tools are completely identical, and while the other three are different on one side, all five have the same size on the one end.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve mentioned in other reviews, I&#x27;ve recently developed an interest in all things nail art related.</li>
            <li> There are 5 tools with 2 sides each, but it&#x27;s really 1 large dotter, 6 medium, 2 small, and 1 stick with a point.</li>
            <li> I expected a product as described, 5 sticks with two different points for a total of 10 sizes, but no, I arrived 5 stick with the same size.</li>
            <li> overall the product is amazing - These are for my daughter and she has not even received them yet - The previous words are from someone who hijacked my ability to review - makes me skeptical about the reviews I read on other subjects</li>
            <li> I will mainly be using these for small crafts I do.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still unfortunate that the product description isn&#x27;t accurate.</li>
            <li> No wow feature.</li>
            <li> Took a bit long to arrive, since it came from China.</li>
            <li> It took so long to get here</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how heavy they are.</li>
            <li> My pink dotting tool only has one end!</li>
            <li> I got 5 different sides on one end and 5 all the same on the other!</li>
            <li> Other tools on amazon were sold in sets of 5 but not all of the tools are different.</li>
            <li> Each tool has 2 separate ends and no tool has the same tips as any other.</li>
            <li> The company had it delivered earlier than expected I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> yes i would definitely recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> I belive the other people who had only 6 out of the 10 dot sizes just had a manufacturing error.</li>
            <li> There was one pink, one yellow, one green, one blue, and one purple.</li>
            <li> However, I am much more annoyed at the fact that the product falsely claims to have 10 different sides.  </li>
            <li> if you drop it they will break.. two of them have come loose when cleaning it, otherwise it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> - they range from big dots down to a tip</li>
            <li> I bought these not to long ago and the shipping only took a extra day from what they said which is not bad at all because all the reviews were saying how bad the shipping was</li>
            <li> case did not come with the black color shown in the photo, but in a simple translucent plastic bag.misleading advertising</li>
            <li> The dotting tools aren&#x27;t 10 different sizes as you might think they would be, but instead each tool has the same small dot on the bottom.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they were all colored with black and white only ,</li>
            <li> only thing i dident like was the little pouch they came in</li>
            <li> Each pen has two different size end unlike some reviews I read where they complained that two of the pens were the same.</li>
            <li> Some people complained of there only being 5 sizes, and some of the ends were the same size.</li>
            <li> I received before expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> They are everything I expected.</li>
            <li> to date, the mental pieces have come apart from the accerlic.</li>
            <li> Came sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected since they ship from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> I received 10 days before minimal estimate day.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a convenient case that snaps closed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I ordered these, I noticed they were expected to take a month to come in because they come from China, but they did come in quicker than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually did get 10 different dotting sizes, so I&#x27;m not sure how a few other customers didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I felt that it took a little bit to long</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve read that&#x27;s an issue with some other nail dotting tools.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get these for my nail art, it turns out I can use them for other crafts like clay charms.</li>
            <li> However, the ones I received are all pink!</li>
            <li> Before I buy any products I always view it for a while and compare it to other sellers/stores.</li>
            <li> I ordered these dotting tools the other day</li>
            <li> So if I have any other negative experiences with this product I will come back and update it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing if you&#x27;re working with different colors and don&#x27;t want to bother cleaning your tools over and over while you&#x27;re decorating, but just be aware.</li>
            <li> However, I was quite disappointed after a month&#x27;s worth of use when the end pieces started falling out and some of the tips are quite similar - disappointing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The purple, green, and pink pens all have one side</li>
            <li> Did not get the pretty colors that the picture shows mine came in black and white with gold tips (quite ugly).</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t mark it down for this.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sturdy and well-manufactured, and I don&#x27;t anticipate any issues down the line with cracking or breaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well!</li>
            <li> I will admit they are slightly heavier</li>
            <li> Try to make a line, the line will break or be cut in half.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve perchased the dotting tools themselves, they did not come with a black case pictured.</li>
            <li> I recieved the item in less than three weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These need to be separated into two different items because they are two different items and it is difficult to tell just which one you will get.</li>
            <li> and you get five for less than half of what one costs at Sallys.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when they came in the mail in a cheap plastic bag.</li>
            <li> The yellow one was broken, and Amazon was unable to send me a new set due to the seller being out of the product.</li>
            <li> It is late and past its last date of being here.</li>
            <li> I was a little upset</li>
            <li> I never received the little dotting tool bag.</li>
            <li> Make her little dots, hello Kitty bows, and etc.</li>
            <li> The came in a little pouch, not the little box they show.</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail dotting tools with a little skepticism.</li>
            <li> neat little case.  </li>
            <li> Coming up with new ways to express myself via my nails in an otherwise boring office environment has been fun.</li>
            <li> and I was not let down!</li>
            <li> the metal tips started falling out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Keeps them from getting misplaced.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these for my friends for Christmas.</li>
            <li> so it would have been a waste.</li>
            <li> and when I least expected it was here.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been looking for a package of these for a few months</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;m they&#x27;re different, but they&#x27;re not noticeably different that I was unable to put them in size order.</li>
            <li> Yet little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive double ended sticks with different sizes.</li>
            <li> Late one night, while I was painting little flowers on my toenails using just a nail polish brush and a cuticle care stick, I decided I should try a dotting tool.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using a lot of polish and very little - doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!  </li>
            <li> To use these I also bought a small dish to put a drop of nail polish in and then dip my tools from there.</li>
            <li> that is how small they are</li>
            <li> small and compact.</li>
            <li> .. is it hard to use?</li>
            <li> The product came in the mail a month late.</li>
            <li> At least I get a variety of sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li> so i mean the should work of how the advertise it</li>
            <li> You get a very, very small dot to a medium/large dot.</li>
            <li> If you are serious about nail art, I recommend this investment.</li>
            <li> but only to be disappointed by the fact that i didnt get what was advertised.</li>
            <li> Which reallllyyyyyyyyyyyy annoyed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that some people had received ones that were all identical or broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product or the seller.</li>
            <li> One of the tools was broken</li>
            <li> None of them have broken yet or had any damage done to them.</li>
            <li> I ordered in late November and got them on January 15!!</li>
            <li> These are useless for anything</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> 2 months for such crap!</li>
            <li> Call me crazy.</li>
            <li> Of course, this means you might go crazy with them.</li>
            <li> resend and I will remove this post but meantime disappointing.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating &amp; disappointing!</li>
            <li> i read a lot bad reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> Before i bought them i was debating because of the bad reviews but at the end i decided to take the risk.</li>
            <li> Even though I did receive this item well before time estimated, I was disappointed when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE THESE, THIS WAS A GREAT PURCHASED USE THEM TO DESIGN MY NAILS.</li>
            <li> I received before expected delivery date.  I saw that some people said they didn&#x27;t get the different sizes that the description says but mine are all different sizes. Very happy with this product and the delivery,</li>
            <li> i do my own nails and these tools help alot with different designs that i do--also bought a set for my sister and she loves them also</li>
            <li> When i ordered these the colorful doting tools where supposed to arrive but instead the black and clear ones arrived. I was a little upset but it wasnt a big deal because they do the same exact thing, i just liked the way the other ones looked more.</li>
            <li> the metal tips started falling out after a few uses. Did not get the pretty colors that the picture shows mine came in black and white with gold tips (quite ugly).</li>
            <li> There are 5 tools with 2 sides each, but it&#x27;s really 1 large dotter, 6 medium, 2 small, and 1 stick with a point. This set is super inexpensive, so I&#x27;m not complaining. The yellow box is cute storage. My nieces and I have lots of fun coming up with nail designs, so I&#x27;m glad I bought it. But really it&#x27;s not all that different from making dots with a toothpick or the fat end of a straight pin, which is what we used before.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that these come in different sizes.  It works great for my nail art work.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for these dotting tools!</li>
            <li> This are amazing! I can now do all the cool designs that I find on pinterest for my nails! I had to buy a pack for my mom because she was jealous!</li>
            <li> Arrived in 2 weeks, in great condition.  These are nice dotting tools! The price was good and after using them for about a month now, I can tell you that they are very good quality and I recommend them very highly. Totally happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!  Totally not what I visioned and never worked right. Very disappointing!  You are better off using a ballpoint pen!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my 11 years old. She loves it. The tools do work and what a great price!</li>
            <li> The item was just as described. I loved the bright colors on the handles as well as their sturdy design. I used to use bobbypins to make flowers on my nails but i desired a variety of dot size. With these little pens I was able to create fun flashy nail designs. I will admit they are slightly heavier than i expected compared to my bobbypins but never the less I was able to get used to them. Now my nails are noticed and I love the shock on peoples&#x27; faces when I  tell them I do it all by hand. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love these little pens!! The package came earlier than expect and just in time for my brother&#x27;s graduation (yay). Each pen has two different size end unlike some reviews I read where they complained that two of the pens were the same. I am very happy with these tools.</li>
            <li> love theese so much love the different sizes and the colors...only thing i dident like was the little pouch they came in but that&#x27;s not a big deal..</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today. The shipping was fast. The tools have a cool design and look just like they do in the picture.  Tools work great, all different sizes... Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The case is kinda cheep (be careful when you open it for the first time. The clasp might pull off) but I didn&#x27;t buy a case I bought the dotting pens which are great. They all seem to be at least slightly different sizes and are cute and colorful. They are easy to clean and serve their purpose! What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> These are the dotting tools I have been looking for! Other tools on amazon were sold in sets of 5 but not all of the tools are different. Each of these in this set are unique with unique ends. They look exactly like the picture, coming in the same colors. Great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**March 15: Ordered these again for a friend, and I was given a product of lesser quality. They did not match the picture and 5 of the ends were identical. So instead of 10 different ends, there were only 6. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the dotting tools are nice for detailing you nails it just takes some practice not to have blobs or smears</li>
            <li> She loved it Fun nail time</li>
            <li> These are great! They are very nicely packaged and are double sided with all different sized balls. The colors are really nice to!</li>
            <li> Lots of people ask me all the time where I got these from - so I reccommend the site! The worked exactly like the nail salon!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these dotting tools. I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple years and even bought my sister the same kind. They&#x27;re durable and have a good selection of sizes for your dots. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good quality, inexpensive for home or professional use. No issues with this set and what a money saver! I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet but they are so cute and handy in the packaging. Keeps them from getting misplaced.</li>
            <li> Love these!!!  so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Fast shipping. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy these so that I could create cute nail patterns... Flowers, lines, things like that.  YouTube beauty gurus use these, so I figured, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, when the product says that these are dotting tools, they aren&#x27;t kidding.  They are used for dotting.  Try to make a line, the line will break or be cut in half.  I&#x27;ve tried using a lot of polish and very little - doesn&#x27;t help.  These are useless for anything BUT dotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different sized ends don&#x27;t help, either - and honestly, the sizes are very similar.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I use them almost every day. They are very durable and the case keeps them all neat and tidy. Very good set.</li>
            <li> The item was everything my wife wanted to use it on nails for friends and family. It was a great buy that I would definately recommend to other cosmetologist and nail technicians.</li>
            <li> Didnt come with the pouch pictured just came in a clear plastic bag. Work fine for designs.</li>
            <li> The yellow one was broken, and Amazon was unable to send me a new set due to the seller being out of the product. Amazon refunded my money and told me to keep the set I had received to make up for the inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The varying sizes allow me to create so many different designs on my nails, but these dotting tools are fairly versatile. I&#x27;ve also used them when painting crafts and when manipulating details on modeling clay creations.</li>
            <li> These dotting tools work fantastic and are WELL worth the  price. It&#x27;s kind of hard to get a straight line from them, but that is what you get with any dotting tool so I didn&#x27;t mark it down for this. Also, the pink tool and the yellow tool had the same sized ends, it wasn&#x27;t a problem or anything I just thought it was interesting. I recommend this to pretty much anyone who is into nail art designs. They look and work just like what professionals use in nail salons!</li>
            <li> I love my dotting tools. They are everything I expected. They make nail art so much easier. They arrived on time with no problem.</li>
            <li> I got the item right on time. Right away I used it and I loved it! It was just like the picture. This product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I love these tools. They are amazing and perfect for what I wanted them for. I use them for polymer clay for tiny details on things and also for blending reasons and these are AMAZING! I love the bright colors, they came in perfect condition regardless that my UPS carrier just tossed them on the ground about 5 feet from my door. Ugh! But they are amazing, definitely worth the buy! Recommending these to a friend who is also looking for dotting tools.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product solely because it advertised 10 different size ends which i did not receive.  One side of all the dotters are the exact same size.  I will not order from this seller again as i expect to get what is advertised not whatever they choose to send.</li>
            <li> they are well made, the case that holds the dotting pens is well made and sturdy. I can not wait to start using them to creat all kinds of fun art on my nails. &#x3D;)  I stongly recomend this item I like the idea of having them all together in one place ready for me to use.</li>
            <li> loved these og great quality and are still being used to this day!! would highly recommend this seller  and these items. will definitely be making more purchases!</li>
            <li> Package took forever to receive, but worth the wait! great product for the price! i would recommend! great for what I needed them for!</li>
            <li> works great case is cheap but tool is great  Nice color very good price ,long time to ship but worth the wait</li>
            <li> This product was what I hoped it would be. It works great and an awesome price. I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Dotting tools are great, but for the price I don&#x27;t think they were worth it. I never received the little dotting tool bag. It was to be included in a nail kit for a friend&#x27;s birthday and I thought the little carrying case was perfect, too bad I never got it and had to buy something else.</li>
            <li> I love to do design work on my kids nails.  These tools have allowed me to retain my creative side!</li>
            <li> I received 5 dotting tools and they look just like the picture. There was one pink, one yellow, one green, one blue, and one purple. They are very pretty and the colors are so vibrant. Each dotter came in its own sleeve to protect them from rubbing togethger and getting scratched. Each dotter is double ended, and they are all diferent sizes to achieve different designs. The quality of the dotters is amazing. I received my package on time exactly when the seller said I would. I definetly recomend this product 100%.</li>
            <li> When I started looking for nail dotting tools, I really had no idea what I was looking for since I hadn&#x27;t used them before. However, I saw these and couldn&#x27;t resist since they&#x27;re such a good deal. Cheap price for five tools that create a total of ten different size dots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be very well-made. I don&#x27;t have any concerns about them breaking, since I&#x27;ve read that&#x27;s an issue with some other nail dotting tools. These are cute and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were packaged nicely in individual sleeves for storing. I&#x27;m very pleased with these! I definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for a nail dotting tool!</li>
            <li> love them. very sturdy</li>
            <li> They are great! They do take some practice at first but then you get the hang of it. Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> The only reason that i had a problem was the snaps that was attached to the case when i opened it after about 3 days later it came off, the leather inst very strong either. But other than that its great especially the dotting tools.</li>
            <li> Got these for my girl and she couldn&#x27;t be happier. Now she has the tools to make whatever kind of nail designs that she wants. The little leather case that they come in makes it easy for her to pack them up and take them with her where ever she goes. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> fun for doing all kinds of nail art!!  All different sizes and work great for setting on stones or for pushing glitter flakes on the nail where you want them.  Great price and well made!</li>
            <li> I goThey changed the shipping date. Which reallllyyyyyyyyyyyy annoyed me. But i ended up getting them only a week or so later. They are plastic, and alot smaller than i thought they would be. I got 10 of them, but I got 2 big ones, and the rest were very small and pretty much the exact same size. They work fine, and I love the design...but I wouldnt suggest getting these if you want a large variety, because you wont get it.</li>
            <li> I first came upon this product when my young ten year pld cousin had ordered them. I never thought of buying a dotting tool but she was able to use them so easily so I decided to order them as well. Unfortunately, I only received four instead of the five! But I contacted Cheeky and they were great and easy to communicate with! They sent me the missing one as soon as possible and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product and seller. I have also ordered there stamping plates and they all work fabulous I recommend this product and many others from Cheeky!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and cheap price! I love them so much. They are very very easy to clean too. Recommending 100%.</li>
            <li> was a present for my sister she loved them she started using them right away an said they were perfect</li>
            <li> These tools work ok.  They are &amp;#34;stepped&amp;#34; in sizes, but when used you only need 3 instead of 10.  The sizing is so close that it doesn&#x27;t really make a noticeable difference unless you skip a few sizing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get these for my nail art, it turns out I can use them for other crafts like clay charms. I love how they come in the case because it helps me keep it organized. Then I love the different sizes, I was able to do many designs with the dotting tools, not just for nails, but also drawing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve perchased the dotting tools themselves, they did not come with a black case pictured. It came in a plastic pouch.&lt;br /&gt;As to date, the mental pieces have come apart from the accerlic. The accerlic cracked and the piece feel out. The dotting part is perfect. A skill to learn, but it was good to use. But the price I payed was cheap, therefor you get cheap.</li>
            <li> These are just what my daughter wanted. Double-ended, each end with a different size, for nail art.  The case is convenient and secure for the tools to be kept in.</li>
            <li> These provide the perfect size tips to allow easy artistry even for a beginner like me..along with all the colors from other vendor my nails will have no limitations on design..great.set and compact in the case provided. Great product highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I just used them and there really good for being cheap. There good quality and they make some really cute flowers</li>
            <li> My Teenager loves it&lt;br /&gt;got it fast and it seems to be what she wanted at a good price&lt;br /&gt;so i approve</li>
            <li> the tools make for an okay dot. I like that they come in different sizes. I used one time, but i will use on occasion. Its not something i would go out and spend 20 plus bucks on. Its fit perfect for size and price on amazon. One pro is that it does come with a carrying case that fits perfectly into my nail polish bag. i would however recommend them to a nail polish/decorater.</li>
            <li> Unlike most reviews say there are all different sizes. if you dip them in polish and use them on paper you will see that. Also if you use too much polish it distorts the size of the dot. Also they are not the ones in the pictures. They do not come in a case or anything. Something like a pocket protecter. Plastic pen holder type thing. Which I have a place for all my nail stuff so this doesnt bother me but if you dont its pretty flimsy. Now thats to dispell the rumors I have seen on here. As for my personal use. I love them. I use them on my niece&#x27;s nails as well as mine. Make her little dots, hello Kitty bows, and etc. Great product.</li>
            <li> I get nice dots with these tools. They are good for nail art when ever time with great color too</li>
            <li> Daughter likes this product as she is able to make things on her nails and show them to friends.  Her nails are pretty</li>
            <li> I like the case it comes in...I&#x27;ve had these for some time now &amp; they&#x27;ve held up nicely. Some of the ends are the same size though, so don&#x27;t except each end to be a different size. Overall, very nice.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the price for the set...just haven&#x27;t mastered using them yet. I need some more practice. Highly recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> Im so happy i purchased these! I used to try to make dots with a qtip but having different sized dotting tools is alife saver for bubble themes and eyeballs haha</li>
            <li> REALLY GOOD PRICE. NO LEATHER CASE LIKE IN THE PICTURE. BUT OVERALL GOOD ITEMS  AND GOOD QUALITY. THANK YOU. FAST</li>
            <li> kool!..these are really nice. they were packaged well and came in a nice leather like case..each dotting tool is a different size..I havent used them as yet but I can tell I&#x27;m gonna do some awesome design with these..thank you amazon.</li>
            <li> Very different from picture shown.</li>
            <li> Perfect, beautiful. Came sooner then expected. Worth the price. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift to a friend of mine who is a nail enthusiast. They&#x27;re amazing! The came in a little pouch, not the little box they show. But thats alright!</li>
            <li> This double ended dotting tool i like a lot.  I do nails and i do tons of others nails and this seems to be my favorite.  I don&#x27;t exactly know how to explain how a doting tool can be fantastic but it really is.</li>
            <li> If you want to get the best design, you have to dip it. A lot. But they work great! Just makes sure you don&#x27;t use quick drying nail polish.. Hah</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves them!!! Product and case is immaculate.</li>
            <li> great product, great to add to nail artistry collections, it&#x27;s perfect for creating dots on you nails although you probably don&#x27;t need all of these sized dots all the time but it is very handy and creates great designs.</li>
            <li> It did not come in the case as shown in the picture.  But the tools are okay and works as intended. No wow feature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to assume whenever it gets here it will be what I hope it is. I&#x27;ll update this when it arrives.</li>
            <li> The products are great. The only problem is when I got it, there are two blue of this, but there is no pink one.</li>
            <li> They have many different points on both sides so that gives you a lot of freedom to create many different designs you can come up with.  I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> case did not come with the black color shown in the photo, but in a simple translucent plastic bag.misleading advertising</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves these. She can makes so many pretty designs with them.</li>
            <li> Nice set.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail dotting tools with a little skepticism. I&#x27;d read that some people had received ones that were all identical or broken. But, i am so glad I ordered them because they are perfect! Each tool has 2 separate ends and no tool has the same tips as any other. You get a very, very small dot to a medium/large dot. And in between, the dots vary just slightly in size which is perfect for finding the right dot for your nail design.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps that greatest thing about this item was how fast it got to my home. I ordered these on Tuesday and they arrived at my house first thing Friday morning, and that&#x27;s with standard shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be checking out the rest of this store and ordering in the future.&lt;br /&gt;order them! you won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> my friend had these dotting tools and she let me borrow them one time and i knew that i had to get them...they make perfect little circles in every size...the only thing that i have to say i that after every time you use them that you need to clean them with nail polish remover. overall the product is amazing - These are for my daughter and she has not even received them yet - The previous words are from someone who hijacked my ability to review - makes me skeptical about the reviews I read on other subjects</li>
            <li> Its super awesome and it comes very quick the over all product its great 105% recommend it is awesome go get it!</li>
            <li> Took a bit long to arrive, since it came from China. It did come exactly like it looks in the picture, and the price was great.</li>
            <li> Really like these dotting tools. Great price and the case for them is really great! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These dotting tools are really great! They are cheap and they work, what more could you ask for ? They make nice designs . I would absolutely recommend these tools for beginners and professionals .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m use these tools to do my own nails at home.  Having said that, some of the ends on the tools are the same size and you&#x27;re not getting 10 different dotting sizes.  The tools are well made and pretty.  Overall, I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a super novice at nail designing. I got my nails done only once in my life and saw what tools they used. Now, I can do it at home! Good tools for the money.</li>
            <li> I had always wanted nail dotting tools. So when I seen these I ordered them right away! I was so happy when I received them, I used them the second I opened the package! Love them!</li>
            <li> Great item I love it and it really works. Anyone that loves doing nails should get this product. Best money I have ever spent on nail products!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister and she loves them. She researched all the cool tricks you can do with these. They are made very well and easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li> I chose these ones because I liked that they were different colors. I figured it would be easier to tell them apart just by color coding, so I could grab the one I wanted to use without having to check all the ends. However, the ones I received are all pink! Also, not only is the color different, the dot sizes aren&#x27;t the same as the picture either. Sure, there are different ones, but not as varied as the pic. Two of the tools are completely identical, and while the other three are different on one side, all five have the same size on the one end. So rather than 10 sizes, you get five. I&#x27;m keeping them just because they will still do the trick and I doubt any other seller is any better; many reviews claim that the product is different from the description and that is the case. Oh well, I can give the duplicate to a friend and still have four tools with five dot sizes. That&#x27;s good enough for me. Functionally, they are great, just don&#x27;t match the product description or pic.</li>
            <li> The pack I got came all in the same color, and true, there are only 6 sizes as opposed to 10. But for the price and what it does, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> My daugher is always changing her nail polish.  She is really enjoying this and does a great job.  Great gift!</li>
            <li> Great price for 5 dotting tools. I don&#x27;t feel like there are really 10 different sizes though, if feels like there are some repeats. But really, how many different sizes do you need? I probably use 3 of the sizes and that&#x27;s plenty. I use these a lot to do simple polka dot details on my nails, simple and fun. They clean up easy too. Not much to say, good tools and great price! Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I love the product. Is really to work with and now I can make any desing that I want with my nails.</li>
            <li> Really pretty tools at an inexpensive price. It should be a lot easier to use than a toothpick to make designs on fingernails.</li>
            <li> I love these dotting tools. As I&#x27;ve mentioned in other reviews, I&#x27;ve recently developed an interest in all things nail art related. Coming up with new ways to express myself via my nails in an otherwise boring office environment has been fun. These tools have been great for making new designs ranging from ladybugs to leopard prints. They store easily, and clean easily as well. They&#x27;re sturdy and well-manufactured, and I don&#x27;t anticipate any issues down the line with cracking or breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, at the price, they&#x27;re a great value for anyone&#x27;s makeup kit.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these for my friends for Christmas. They saw how much I enjoyed my items so I wanted them to have some. Great dotting tools and they are cute colors. Shipping was faster than expected since they ship from Hong Kong. Reccommend completely.</li>
            <li> i read a lot bad reviews about this product. let me tell one thing,got them today and i am super exited and happy, all 10 ends have different sizes, not all the same how a lot of people said it here. its a sincere review for all those girls that look in buying it. great price great product, recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> It has a simple function and it gets the job done! I love it! Definitely high quality. I also love the colors.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the box these are pictured in as it was a Christmas gift for my niece to go with her Cheeky plates. I was disappointed when they came in the mail in a cheap plastic bag. They offered me a return, but the shipping was more than the item itself so it would have been a waste. The dotting tools aren&#x27;t 10 different sizes as you might think they would be, but instead each tool has the same small dot on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I love these! They shipped faster than it said they would. They work great and I really love the price I paid for them! I&#x27;d definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> Even though I did receive this item well before time estimated, I was disappointed when I opened the package. I was supposed to get 10 different sized &amp; I ended up getting only 5 different sizes being 6 tips were of an identical size.</li>
            <li> Love the price , quality and variety of sizes on the pointers! Great colors so you get to do your nails in style! Lol</li>
            <li> I did not like this product one, i havent even gotten it. It is late and past its last date of being here. Im furious, I had my hopes up and now im just wondering, Have i been robbed? I would love to give a fair review because lots of people say these dotting tools are really good. Now just waiting to try them out myself,...If i ever get them.</li>
            <li> The product came in the mail a month late. I could not track the item. It was a Christmas gift and it showed up after Christmas and it was even the product I ordered. I ordered dotting tools. I received 10 rolls of nail tape. I&#x27;m very disappointed! It doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star.</li>
            <li> nice. I dont have time to be writing all this stuff. The product is nice. very pretty. Took forever to get it though.</li>
            <li> These naill art dotters are exactaly what i wanted.  Now I can bring the nail shop to my home.  If you are looking for a nail dotter this is a MUST BUY product for you.</li>
            <li> The material is heavy and amazing. It doesn&#x27;t feel cheap at all. I ordered november 18 and it got to california January 9. It took so long to get here I lost hope and when I least expected it was here. I wont dock any stars because I understand it was during the holidays. Overall I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li> These are really durable and stylish! It took a while to ship, but with the price, who could argue?  They are really easy to use, and if done correctly, you will get lots of comments on your nails.</li>
            <li> absolutely love the fact that it is ten different size dotting tips. most dotting tools have five different ones on one side and all the same size on the other side of the dotting toll!!</li>
            <li> These tools are perfect for creating neat dots, flowers, whatever you can think of! They fit easily in your hand, are comfortable to hold and use, and they are of high quality. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I received 10 days before minimal estimate day. I noticed they were shipping from Hong Kong and I started thinking I wouldn&#x27;t get them until Christmas, but I got them early! I also noticed in the reviews everyone was complaining about them having different sized tips, mine did not, and if they did I still got them very cheap! AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> great quality makes nail design so much easier and love the colors</li>
            <li> Sturdy and worth the inexpensive price</li>
            <li> Got them for my daughter as a gift and she uses them every chance she gets on herself and friends cool designs</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. Great quality at a Great price and shipped quickly! Love the colors too!</li>
            <li> The biggest one is still a little too small for some of my designs, but it has many different small sizes, is easy to clean with acetone, and has pretty handles</li>
            <li> very cute and so useful for making tons of nail designs.  makes it easy to make cute flowers and other fun designs.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! My nail tech paid lots more for a different set and they have stared falling apart.  These have been getting regular use in my salon and are still great.  They are not only dotting Tools,but also are great for lots of other nail art. Great value and qaulity.</li>
            <li> Dotting tools were well made. Easy to use. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because there are 6 different sizes not 10 like it says on the description.</li>
            <li> Great great great!! Love these dotting tools! Inexpensive, great quality and every size dotting tool you need is included! Shipping took awhile to the states. But no complaints!</li>
            <li> I just received it today, I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;It was well covered ,  has 10 different sizes as shown in the picture, and came up with a beautiful card from Cheeky !&lt;br /&gt;it took about 25 days to arrive , but that&#x27;s OK. It deserves waiting.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they were all colored with black and white only , They weren&#x27;t colored like the once in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you add a note about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Cheeky :)</li>
            <li> These are for my daughter and she loves them!  They help her to do delicate nail art on her own.</li>
            <li> The dotting tools are very helpful. I love them and they come in a box so i can always keep them organized and unafraid to lose them plus they come in a variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> I ordered these dotting pens so I could do my own nails.  They vary in size from extra small to extra large and that&#x27;s a good thing!  If you do your own nails, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I actually thought they would have flat ends instead of round, but they work fine and do what I need them do. I don&#x27;t use them very much though.</li>
            <li> They work really well but the first time I used them and went to wash them off one of the ends broke off</li>
            <li> Delivery was timely, tools were well made and work great! The box they came in was bent and damaged but the tools were fine. The price was well worth it!</li>
            <li> I love it !!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I needed in my life !&lt;br /&gt;Helps me do AMAZEING nail art &amp; Easy to use .</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter and she loves them. They have every size dot you&#x27;ll need and they&#x27;re comfortable to hold and use. The price is great and I got them faster than they specified which was nice.</li>
            <li> These are a very good product! They came on time too! I do my nails very often so I needed these for the more complex designs. They even come in a cute little case!</li>
            <li> I got my sister these for Christmas and she loved them as soon as she opened them. Very happy with this product thank you.</li>
            <li> These are working well. They are fun to use and getting some really fun designs that would not be possible otherwise.</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little different than the picture shown but other than that, the dotting tools are great. Not all of the sizes are different, about three of the tips are the same size but I don&#x27;t mind at all. They work great and the price for five dotting tools is very good. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Product was neatly packaged and you receive exactly what you see advertised. They were different sizes and were double ended</li>
            <li> The product arrived as described. Now I just have to master using them.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Good quality!!</li>
            <li> My daughter had been looking for a package of these for a few months so I decided to get them for a Christmas gift. Comparing them to other offers I came by, these were hands down the best deal and pretty colors too.</li>
            <li> These are great dotting tools! I love how each pen has a different color swirl, so I&#x27;ll be able to tell which one is which without having to pull them out to look at the tips. All but one did manage to rip through their storage bags. Not a big deal at all for me, I had planned on taking them out of the bags anyways.  Edit Feb 20: So tonight while using the smallest tip (yellow swirl), the thing shattered. No idea what happened, I was using it to swirl nail polish for water marbling. I will be contacting Cheeky to complain about this.</li>
            <li> Late one night, while I was painting little flowers on my toenails using just a nail polish brush and a cuticle care stick, I decided I should try a dotting tool.  Having never used one before, I had no idea what I wanted in terms of size or anything really.  So I was thrilled when I came across this set on amazon for such a great price!  I impulsively ordered and could not wait to receive them.  My package arrived today, and I have yet to use them, so this is a review based solely on the product that arrived rather than how well it functions.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the tools look really nice.  They appear to be of good quality, and I love the bright colors.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, there are NOT 10 different dotting sizes.  The purple, green, and pink pens all have one side the is the exact same size.  In addition, the other side of the pink pen is the exact same size as one of the ones on the blue pen.  This leaves the yellow tool as the only tool with two completely unique sides.  Thus, there are only 7 different dotting sizes, not the 10 different dotting sizes as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first time using dotting tools, 7 different sizes is probably going to be plenty for me.  However, I am much more annoyed at the fact that the product falsely claims to have 10 different sides.  Based solely on principle, I would return these.  But since they will serve the purpose I needed them for, and were so reasonably priced, I&#x27;ll cut my losses and save myself the trip to the post office to return them.</li>
            <li> I love the shape and designs that I can make with the dotting tools!  It has 5 tools, but 10 different sizes which is great for any designs that you want to make!</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today! Received them earlier than scheduled and I am very pleased with the look of them and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out! Down side is they didn&#x27;t come in a cute box like pictured! Which was a very high selling point for me.  I&#x27;m sure I will give it more stars after I try them out! Very excited☆</li>
            <li> I expected a product as described, 5 sticks with two different points for a total of 10 sizes, but no, I arrived 5 stick with the same size. Wrong! I&#x27;m not happy with the product or the seller.</li>
            <li> Good price, i want to get them but i have a question.. is it hard to use? i am not the best at doing nails haha (;</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE DOTTING PENS, BUT THERE ARENT 10 DIFFRENT SIZES THERE ARE 5 PENS THAT HAVE THE SAME 2 SIZES....GRRRR</li>
            <li> I saw this product and thought \\&quot;I have to have these!!\\&quot; Before I ordered I went and read a bunch of the reviews. Some people complained of there only being 5 sizes, and some of the ends were the same size. I still though I should take a chance for the price because I saw others for just 5 sizes that was higher than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got these in the mail today so I haven&#x27;t actually used them yet. At a first glance, yes some of the sizes do look alike and some seem like they have the same ends. But after closely looking at them and just using them to make tiny dots, I have found that there is in fact 10 different sizes. But just looking at them they do loo a lot alike in the sizes. So I can see why some customers thought that they only received 5 sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for the price, this is a great item and I received it exactly on the estimates date.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. I was hesitant to order it but because it was it was so inexpensive I decided to try it. They are great I have been able to make designs and flowers easily. The company had it delivered earlier than expected I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> i like this product so much because it makes the perfect dots and im into nails i love doing mine...yes i would definitely recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> At first I was sceptical because of the reviews about there only being 5 sizes but I am happy to say that I had 10 sizes..amazing tools!Will be ordering another set  for me!</li>
            <li> Wife says these work well but a couple of the tools are the same size.  I think it was priced well.</li>
            <li> I used these all of the time whenever I&#x27;m painting specific images on my fingernails.  Great for dotting the middle of flowers, creating images of the sun and moon and great for creating images of eyse on little critters for your fingernails.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay for what it&#x27;s worth. if you drop it they will break.. two of them have come loose when cleaning it, otherwise it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  This is major quality!</li>
            <li> Love this dotting tool i recently used it to add dots on my nails for easter and it was so easy to use, i fell in love with this handy tool.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend but she said she and a friend loved them and appreciated them. They owe me a mani and a pedi.&lt;br /&gt;Took awhile to get them though. Believe from the postage they came from Japan(?)</li>
            <li> Very good works the packing is really cute and convenient to carry. I would recommend this product. Worth the money</li>
            <li> Even though my items got stuck in customs, they sent it again free of charge and I got them with a complementary disk of various nail art studs. They are very kind and helpful and the product of couse is just as I wanted.</li>
            <li> One of the tools was broken so I had to super glue it and two of the dotters are the same size. Took forever to get here too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the dotting tools okay. Y&#x27;all should get them because they make hard designs very very very easy</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to play with them as much as I&#x27;d like to yet, but they are better and easier than the toothpick I&#x27;ve been using (lol) and at the right price.</li>
            <li> The set is really nice with a variety of sizes.  It also comes in a convenient case that snaps closed.</li>
            <li> Great tools! It help me with my own designs...</li>
            <li> Love these dotting tools! They come in pretty colors and also the case is awesome so I can take them anywhere with me.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well! You get exactly what is shown in the picture. What most people don&#x27;t see is that one tip on every tool is the same, so you are only really getting six tips. But that is what the picture shows, and that is what you get. None of them have broken yet or had any damage done to them. They work very nice and create easy polka dots on your nails :)</li>
            <li> I received this product on time.  Now I do not have 10 different dotting sizes, I only have 6, but for the price I paid I&#x27;m willing to let that slide.  I find that these dotting pens are easy to use and I plan on using them for a while.</li>
            <li> I got the pack of 5 double-ended dotting tools which gave me a variety of sizes.  They&#x27;re really great - they range from big dots down to a tip so fine you can use it for stripes and etching which is fab.  Plus I love the wee case!  Great purchase all round.</li>
            <li> Love these tools! Great price and great conditon!!</li>
            <li> I originally only bought these so that I could get free shipping, but they are amazing! Easy to clean and super easy to make cute, simple designs that really make your nails look fancy.</li>
            <li> The package arrived very quickly and in great condition. The tools themselves seem to be of good quality, but the product description is a bit misleading. It&#x27;s not actually 10 different sizes, you only get 6 different sizes, as 5 of the ends are exactly the same size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve written to the company about this and have yet to hear back from them about it. Considering the price, I&#x27;m not too fussed about the whole thing. But it&#x27;s still unfortunate that the product description isn&#x27;t accurate.</li>
            <li> i did not get my dotting tools at all. its been over a month ! i dont like this service very much. i thought they were cute thats why i give them two stars.</li>
            <li> Didn think these dotting tools would be legit for the price of a penny! But they sure are...I use em.every time I do my nails!!</li>
            <li> The nail dotting tools work great and are extremely easy to clean! The only problem I came across was that the metal pieces were not properly glued in but is easy to slide back into place! I am not complaining for the price I paid !</li>
            <li> These nail tools are a lot of fun, and I was surprised by the quality.  The handles are actually a clear acrylic with the plastic swirls embedded into it, so they are rounded and smooth, not the way it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> Get these!  They are inexpensive and work great!  I love mine :)  I would buy again.  People always ask me \\&quot;where did you get your nails painted?\\&quot; and they cant believe I do them myself.  You&#x27;d be amazed at all the designs you can do with dotting tools.</li>
            <li> These dotting tools work just like they say. Im happy with them the only thing I would change is about 3 of  the dots are really close in size so you cant tell the difference in the dot. But out of all the shopping around Ive done they all seem to have that problem. At least I get a variety of sizes to choose from.</li>
            <li> I felt that it took a little bit to long but the product works great.so the packaging to way long.it was because if the hurracane though so I kind of understand.it should have been faster though.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I would absolutely recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got these ones because I really like that clear plastic look for my nail tools. I got 5 double ended ones so all in all it would be 10 nail tools. But 5 are the exact same size so you really only get 5 not 10. Other than that, these tools are really amazing for the price I got them at. I would recommend these ones for sure.</li>
            <li> Really good product and great for the use. I belive the other people who had only 6 out of the 10 dot sizes just had a manufacturing error. Great for the price and would last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these nail dotting tools almost a year ago and I love them. When I ordered them I was worried that I would get some of the same sizes but if you look closely you will notice they are each different. They are also very well made and have stayed in great condition. I keep mine in a drawer inside of my vanity and sometimes I forget I have them there and I put things on top of them or sometimes I accidentally drop them and they haven&#x27;t broke. I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love uses these, helps a lot with small designs. Had them for a while and still in good shape and very cheap</li>
            <li> Totally worth it. I have had so much fun playing with the different patterns. Youtube has lots of nail art video.</li>
            <li> I love these dotting tools, they were everything i expected and arrived 10 days before the estimated arrival date, im very please with this.</li>
            <li> I use these quite a lot, they work very well for making different sized dots.  But, in the item description it said there would be 10 different size dot &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34; when in reality there were only 6. 4 of the ends were the exact same size, but they still work great.</li>
            <li> I use these almost every time i do my nails. so easy to make different designs with. the sizes are great!</li>
            <li> Professional looking dots await you.  There&#x27;s enough of them in a set that many people can work from one set, no need to purchase more than one, except that everyone will want their own set!  A great little gift for someone who gets excited about nail art.</li>
            <li> The dotting tools are excellent. They&#x27;re double sided which means you get more and it takes less space. I love the box that they come in as it helps to keep them confined and easy for when you&#x27;re mobile.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift so I did not actually use it, but the recipient, my niece loved it.......she uses it all the time</li>
            <li> Before I buy any products I always view it for a while and compare it to other sellers/stores. This one was perfect. You can also just dip any of these dotting tools into a clear top coat and use it to pick up rhinestones/jews if you wanted too. It&#x27;s sooo much easier than using a tweezer and wasting more money for those other tools made just for \\&quot;picking up jews\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love these tools! So many designs to create other than dots! New nails everyother day ;) remember to wipe polish off after few \\&quot;dots\\&quot; so it doesnt dry and get sticky</li>
            <li> These dotting pens are really durable and I can&#x27;t believe how well they work. I am so pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> got these for my daughter who does art on her nails and she loves them</li>
            <li> The price was amazing and shipping was fast. I recieved the item in less than three weeks. The dotting tool works great and comes in a variety. Each tool is a different size, so you really get ten dotting tools instead of five.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift and I was not let down! The person receiving this item was blown away with all the wonderful ideas and uses AND not too mention the high quality for such a cheap price!!  I would use this seller again and again...they were awesome with delivery and you cannot beat the quality for the price paid!</li>
            <li> Before i bought them i was debating because of the bad reviews but at the end i decided to take the risk. Te dotting tools work great its been much easier to do my nails now. They did come in different color than the pic, i got a white one insted of the purple one but at the end its just a color so i didnt care, the sizes on them are diferent there might be 2 that might look like they are the same size but i still love them and so far im happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These dotting tools are great! They are good quality, just as seen in picture, but description is not correct! It says 10 different dotting sizes but its actually 5 different sizes that i got. i would have given this a 5 star but cant because it wasnt as described. Its a great price for them though because its $3.00 for just one dotting tool at my local store.</li>
            <li> These are the cheapest dotting tools I could find. They did take weeks to ship to my PO Box, but I guess that&#x27;s due to the free shipping. They seem very sturdy and are very easy to use and clean. A good buy.</li>
            <li> For the price of these tools, they came in a clear case which helps to keep them all together in my nailpolish bag. However, I was quite disappointed after a month&#x27;s worth of use when the end pieces started falling out and some of the tips are quite similar - disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only PRO: I guess they are still helpful, though, in making polka dots and designs on my nails. If you don&#x27;t mind using them without being attached to the holders, you can still actually use the end pieces on their own.</li>
            <li> I like these they are a cute design. They work really well when doing nail art. Not a bad price.</li>
            <li> Dotting made easy. I know you can make your own dotting tools. Or you can use things already around the house like toothpicks and QTips and whatnot.  But (a) I like the spiral design it reminds me of my cateye marbles I had as a kid and (b) I don&#x27;t have to make-shift something and (c) you get various sizes for the dots.... Okay maybe &amp;#34;a&amp;#34; shouldn&#x27;t be first ;-) ... but it was my first thought when I saw it (&amp;#34;Oh cool design!&amp;#34; then it was &amp;#34;and it would be useful.&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course you can make more than dots with these things -- you can use them to help you create other shapes and lines depending on how you use it / apply the polish.</li>
            <li> These tips are nice, a lot of different ones.  Not uses them much though</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the 10 different sizes for the dotting tools, which is why I ordered this set from this buyer instead of other sellers on Amazon... got &#x27;em, and while they are perfectly fine dotting tools - there are NOT 10 different sizes. All 5 on 1 side are the same size. Lame.</li>
            <li> Great quality and useful for your nails arts and more.</li>
            <li> Good cheap product, so I guess it shouldn&#x27;t matter that I only use the two. I did some nail art and was surprised I felt like there weren&#x27;t enough options for dot sizes. I only liked the two sizes, the rest too big or small.</li>
            <li> She got into nails and designs and these were something she asked for to make better designs.  They were cheap enough and she really enjoys them and can make great designs using them.</li>
            <li> great product..... awesome price...... havent really had a chance to try these but they seem pretty good. loved the packaging.</li>
            <li> good product i just need to practice more because it takes a steady hand, and know how.  Practice makes perfect</li>
            <li> 10 different sized tools along with a nice case.  I have yet to use them but they seem strong.  Great purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> These tools are amazing. I was surprised by how heavy they are. Each side is a different size dot and cleans easy with polish remover. I have been able to do lots of awesome designs without a lot of practice.</li>
            <li> Now I can make flowers on my girls toes and my own.  They have the same ones in the nail salon.</li>
            <li> This dotting Tool for nails is really Good &amp; Cheap I recommend it. Easy for dots on your nail &amp; cool Design</li>
            <li> if you dont need it right away, very good price, too long to get it, but that is what they said</li>
            <li> All dotting sizes seemed similar except for two. I mean I&#x27;m they&#x27;re different, but they&#x27;re not noticeably different that I was unable to put them in size order. Call me crazy. Then again they do the job, so it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> These come in a nice little package and are easily stored. Nice assortment of sizes. These are great for decorating nails and for adding on gems!</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of reviews saying that the sets they got had all the same size on one end. I get the feeling that it depends on which vendor you order from. Basically two different sets are being sold under the same item. One set(the main one pictured) had green, yellow, white, blue and pink and it is pretty clear that they are all the same side on one end. However, there is another set which has purple instead of white. That set is the one that has all different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to order this specifically because it has 10 different sides, go to &#x27;more buying options.&#x27; The one I bought is the $6.99 one directly from cheeky that is prime eligible. I got 5 different tools and there are indeed 10 different sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These need to be separated into two different items because they are two different items and it is difficult to tell just which one you will get.</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered this set because it shows that it comes with a cute case. I already own a set of good quality dotting tools and wanted to put them in this adorable case as shown on the picture. What I got were cheap quality dotting tools that break with the slightest pressure and a cheap plastic sleeve. I ordered in late November and got them on January 15!! 2 months for such crap!</li>
            <li> These are great tools to use for any type of nail art. When I received them, I had to recluse some of the tips to the handles, but they are good.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect gift for the friend that loves to do decorative nails. it includes an awesome variety to make alot of nails that you would see online. great!</li>
            <li> Product did exactly what it is intended to do.  My 11 year daughter found it easy to use and enjoyed the color of the product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product! It is a great quality tool. I like how there are multiple sizes for different size dots. To use these I also bought a small dish to put a drop of nail polish in and then dip my tools from there. I love using these tools to make cheetah print!</li>
            <li> Got these in the mail and they arrived in great condition. I will mainly be using these for small crafts I do. I think these will be perfect. The only thing is the shipping probably took around 3 weeks, but other than that I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> She really found these easy to use, she has done her nails over &amp; over using these tools. She likes them alot.</li>
            <li> Works great love the nail designs I can do with it my sister loves them too borrows them all the time!</li>
            <li> sturdy material, exactly as pictured.  My daughter wanted the tools and they met her  expectations.  They shipped from China to the U.S. and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Not only are these functional but they are so pretty too. Use these for simple nail art and they work great.</li>
            <li> I love these! They have come in so handy and you get five for less than half of what one costs at Sallys. Very durable feeling and all the sizes you need!</li>
            <li> Nice tools. Work well. I got this for my daughter and she was using them to make design on the nails. She likes the tools. easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient to have the ten different sizes of dots. Of course, this means you might go crazy with them. But that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> These tools have really expanded my nail art.  They are a quality set with an inexpensive price.  If you are serious about nail art, I recommend this investment.</li>
            <li> Great for designs on the nails I had fun using these when doing my nails I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Very nice and you can&#x27;t beat the price, I got three of theses. I love doing my nails and when i saw this for a penny, I just had to get 3 of them!!!! Winning!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much, it&#x27;s PERFECT. I am a big fan of nail designs so i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WE HAVE NOT GOT THIS ORDER YET AND NOW IT IS 4 JAN 2013.  THE PRODUCT WAS TO BE HERE BUY 27 DEC 2012.</li>
            <li> The width and weight of the handle makes it easier to hold onto when you&#x27;re hunched over your nails. They&#x27;re easy to clean, and the different colors help you keep track of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have liked them to be labeled in some way, because there is no logic to how the different sizes corresponds to the colored handles and some of the tip sizes are so similar that you can only tell a difference upon very close inspection, if at all. They don&#x27;t make a noticeable difference in size of dot they make, so 6 out of 10 tips work like repeats (2 of each for 3 different sizes). This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing if you&#x27;re working with different colors and don&#x27;t want to bother cleaning your tools over and over while you&#x27;re decorating, but just be aware.</li>
            <li> My daughter is always looking for ways to do designs on my nails when she paints them. These work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> They looked different than the picture (they were black and white instead of rainbow) but other than that they are awesome!!</li>
            <li> I never got the package with it and it came in a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;Please resend and I will remove this post but meantime disappointing.</li>
            <li> I dont find myself using them a lot they are not that good like 2 or 3 of them are pretty much nothing that is how small they are</li>
            <li> I saw these and rushed into buying them after I couldn&#x27;t seem to find them in my local beauty supply stores. They&#x27;re ok but you can still find some which are even cheaper for all 5 dotting tools.</li>
            <li> perfect sizes.  my daughter loves creating new designs.  this set is perfect.  different sizes.  neat little case.  small and compact.</li>
            <li> I have been doing so many cool nail projects with my girls.  Elmo, Gum Balls etc...They are a lot of fun &amp; make things so easy.</li>
            <li> From creating dots, to hand drawing flowers and flames, this tool is the best! I also use it to assit me in picking up tiny rhinestones and press them onto my nails. The different sized dots are amazing and the tools themselves are surprisingly quite sturdy. Every nail artist should have a set!</li>
            <li> great product my daughter love this too much.. its nice one.. everything is nice.. we will refer to friends &amp; family too : thanks HP</li>
            <li> May daughter really likes these. Gave a second set as a friend for part of her birthday present.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate these--They work fine, but the dots seem to all come out the same...each one looks different, but not on the nail??</li>
            <li> These are great!  Sturdy and the tips work well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one for the 10 different sides.  I got 5 different sides on one end and 5 all the same on the other!</li>
            <li> These dotting tools are exactly as pictured and they work great. The variety of tip sizes to choose from means you can create many different nail art designs.</li>
            <li> so my boy friend bought me this set and i was so excited. but only to be disappointed by the fact that i didnt get what was advertised. in the picture they flip some of the sticks to make it seem like there are 10 DIFFERENT tip when really there are 7! one side of all of them is EXACTLY the same. so i mean the should work of how the advertise it beacuse they lied this time:/</li>
            <li> My pink dotting tool only has one end! It looks like a pencil with no eraser! If it was double sided, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. The colors are nice, the sizes are all different (as far as I can tell) but they are advertising one thing and I wanted but did not receive the exact same product. I have not tried out the product yet and I have read a couple reviews about the dotting tools shattering. So if I have any other negative experiences with this product I will come back and update it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail dotters after reading the reviews saying they did not receive all different dotting sizes hoping I would get them all. I only received 4 sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are not the colors pictures, but totally different. I got blue, light blue, white, purple, and pink not the colors pictured  I really wanted the green one  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I ordered these, I noticed they were expected to take a month to come in because they come from China, but they did come in quicker than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer if Beware if you want what is pictured buy from a different company you will thank me!</li>
            <li> I ordered these dotting tools the other day and I love them. I actually did get 10 different dotting sizes, so I&#x27;m not sure how a few other customers didn&#x27;t. I have yet to use them, so I may post another review in a couple weeks when I do. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Product was great for the price and shipping was better than expected. Yet little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t receive double ended sticks with different sizes. So in reality I only have 6 different sizes and not 10 was really looking forward to the bigger size in the picture that I did not receive.</li>
            <li> These are great, just remember to clean off the nail polish, otherwise the size gets bigger and bigger each time!</li>
            <li> Thrilled that I got these at such a great price! All 5 tools are well crafted and look really pretty with their pastel hued handles. And yes, all of them have two different sized heads. Some of the very small sizes may look the same, but they aren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Totally pleased and would order again!!</li>
            <li> My item was supposed to be here by the 3rd of january, I still havent recieved it!! Very frustrating &amp; disappointing!</li>
            <li> I bought these not to long ago and the shipping only took a extra day from what they said which is not bad at all because all the reviews were saying how bad the shipping was but the shipping was actually good but anyways the product overall is amazing they each have different sizes and such good quality. I have already done so many designs with them they are awesome !!!!!! Totally in love with them&amp;#60;3 by the way they look exactly like the picture. Would totally recommend to everyone that loves to do nails ^_^&lt;br /&gt;There is no cons for this product</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter and I and so far we love them.  Great price &amp; love the case it comes with.  If doing a lot of dotting you do have to keep cleaning the tool but I&#x27;m sure they all work that way.</li>
