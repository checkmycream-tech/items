            <li>In my opinion, It is the best lotion available, suggested to me by my doctor.</li>
            <li>Although this product has tons of great reviews, I have to be honest with my experience as well.</li>
            <li>good product.  </li>
            <li>Good as always.</li>
            <li>Use this after a good exfoliation session in the shower.</li>
            <li>This size is avery good buy.</li>
            <li>As good as it is, I won&#x27;t buy it again unless they do something about the smell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good, but it WORKS.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While this lotion doesn&#x27;t smell good, the scent isn&#x27;t bothersome in any way.</li>

            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>, purchasing it from Amazon with its great shipping makes it easy to shop for AmLactin.</li>
            <li>What I HAVE noticed is the overwhelming odor - it isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>I used it the first night, and in the morning it was soooo much better!!!  </li>
            <li>Great exfoliant and keeps winter skin smooth.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, I don&#x27;t know what will.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and has even helped even out my skin tone on my chest where I had hypo-pigmentation from acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This cream works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>but this one is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but this lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Give it a week and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>The company who makes Amlactin has helped many sufferers of KP; they are doing good in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>it grows in effective after a while.</li>
            <li>So use it on your face at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes me nice and juicy.</li>
            <li>Went through literally gallons of every kind of lotion you can imagine.  </li>
            <li>However, I have to say the Cetaphil and Buf Puf did not work on their own--</li>
            <li>This is an effective AH acid, but it is a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that there are many happy customers who purchased this item, but it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream.</li>
            <li>but, honestly, I don’t notice any smell at all.</li>
            <li>I used this in the prescription form for over 10 years and this is just as effective.</li>
            <li>so that is really saying something about how great this lotion is!</li>
            <li>Especially useful for feet and elbows.</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like paint.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion</li>
            <li>Better than the offbrands, but not as good as Lachydron was,</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t wait to wear tanks this year, and it makes the skin nice and even too.</li>
            <li>Thanks from a happy customer!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the nice results I also started the use it on my bacne, hope it does wonders to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also works nicely on my wifes eczema.</li>
            <li>The lotion seems kind of running when you squirt it into your hand, but as you massage it into your skin it appears to get thicker and &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; for a bit, but absorbs all the way</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a KP sufferer and have put up with the kind of struggle to find something that works that I have, you know I&#x27;m not exaggerating.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say it works.</li>
            <li>Was delivered fast and packaging was great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how effective it is.  </li>
            <li>I cannot give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best moisturizer with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Awesome lotion - great for smoothing out dry or &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very strong, ammonium smell (the &amp;#34;lactic acid&amp;#34; is in the form of the ammonium lactate salt).</li>
            <li>smell is very strong.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth paying a bit more for the good stuff!</li>
            <li>They all agree that this is the best product that they have used that completely eliminated the ashy bits</li>
            <li>As far as a quality dermatology product, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>amonia smell-  but putting up with that  to get great results is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I always jealous of girls with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; legs that just looked like good, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, though, pretty great results with this stuff, and a nice amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so this does not tend to affect the appearance of my skin, except that I find it itchy and scratch at it.</li>
            <li>Part of latest attempt to deal with ingrown hairs and irritation associated with shaving, AmLactin is the best adjunct treatment I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>This lotion has lactic acid which may sting at first but does a great job of exfoliation and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I saw that reported by others but hadn&#x27;t experienced it in my first try.</li>
            <li>After first applying, it felt great</li>
            <li>Very good for dry flaky skin and the best thing I&#x27;ve found for wrinkles, really!  </li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s fine!  </li>
            <li>Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- very light texture, non greasy.</li>
            <li>The product is very effective for me, so I&#x27;m willing to deal with it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the rest of my arms are finally smooth and the redness mostly gone!  </li>
            <li>This lotion works fine but smells kind of chemically and is a thinner lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me too much - it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell great</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I store, plus you get more.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and it feels nice on my KP too.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I am able to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Better than the name brand lotions.</li>
            <li>I really love it and the softness.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that there is anything else better.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this and like it better.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing lotion is excellent we did have it on subsciption until they did away with the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>It defoliates the skin better than anything.</li>
            <li>This stuff is basically magic for the dermatitis on my fingers.</li>
            <li>I saw this product on The Meredith Viera Show when she had one of the top Dermatologist on and she recommended this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Even my regular pedi girl cannot believe how wonderful this works.</li>
            <li>You will definitely not be disappointed !!!!</li>
            <li>This is simply the best.</li>
            <li>I am amazed and in love.</li>
            <li>I had to share the love. :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Ok so I almost wish this stuff didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li>The one thing I would caution you with is make sure you don&#x27;t leave yourself unprotected in the Sun.</li>
            <li>I think I would have to use a stronger version with more lactic acid.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>Recently (at the 6+ month mark) i noticed my Freckles/hyperpigmentation have almost faded to flawless making my skin tone unified.</li>
            <li>They also are getting more \\&quot;skin colored\\</li>
            <li>and if i sprayed my cologne over top of it the smell notes were distorted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holy guacamole am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>I had more energy.</li>
            <li>But I am so far incredibly thankful</li>
            <li>My skin looks better every day.</li>
            <li>And this is a way better price than retail.</li>
            <li>My hands are looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>Better than all the \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li>In my experience, though, you need to start with a topical steroid cream for a couple of weeks before using this to get the best benefit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still experimenting and may add a drop or two more.  </li>
            <li>It took maybe a month of daily use for me to see a difference, my dermatologist was impressed.</li>
            <li>It also helped smooth the skin on my face which wasnt even why i bought it!</li>
            <li>I cant recommend it enough, great product!</li>
            <li>I prefer the thicker, more emollient, feel of the CeraVe for my feet.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not, however, put this on more than the recommended twice a day.</li>
            <li>It probably does more healing than I realize</li>
            <li>Another top notch review here.</li>
            <li>Really love the way my skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t recommend using it on face, but love it otherwise.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I thought &#x27;at over $1.00/oz this stuff better work miracles and dance jigs&#x27;.</li>
            <li>BIG WIN!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t stop using it, so you need to buy more, but it becomes costly to afford</li>
            <li>I bought Lac-Hydrin before this for my KP and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I had to take a shower immediately to get the odor off, but it still lingered for a while more.</li>
            <li>For many years I used Lac-Hydrin 5.  </li>
            <li>and it was 80% better.</li>
            <li>Great product,  fast shipping, recommended by dermatologist,</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Feels great, moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>make sure you wear it before you go to bed.</li>
            <li>All of them are pleased as punch, so then so am I.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li>KP looks much better.  </li>
            <li>It seems best used the evening after shaving, and both morning and evening on the following day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for many, many years</li>
            <li>It made my skin smooth!</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love what it  does to my skin...feels like silk.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kinda ok.</li>
            <li>This lotion is fabulous!</li>
            <li>so I can have lovely skin.</li>
            <li>so many months now, that I don&#x27;t recall seeing mention of the &amp;#34;sun alert&amp;#34; on the bottom of the backside of the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have KP and for the most part I would say it helps</li>
            <li>Though the smell is not that appealing.</li>
            <li>I love results.</li>
            <li>Glad I chose it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Hopes this helps you :)</li>
            <li>This helps with KP I had for so many years that I didn&#x27;t thought anything can help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a year or more now.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite body lotion.</li>
            <li>I think any product that has many purposes saves me time and money.</li>
            <li>hopefully with more time it&#x27;ll be better.</li>
            <li>This lotion keeps me moist longer than most.</li>
            <li>This stuff is better.</li>
            <li>and it does wonders and is more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>One if my favorite moisturizing lotions.</li>
            <li>Love Amlactin products...</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t be able to find it anymore.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many things but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite beauty product.  </li>
            <li>Better than all of the prescription creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love the way</li>
            <li>Will defiantly purchase again. :)</li>
            <li>Still the same benefits, but with an awesome smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sit on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would be even better layered up with a thicker emollient.</li>
            <li>I guess the product accumulated there the most</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, even if it did work, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d have to continue putting it on for maintenance, keeping the kp at bay.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using this lotion, my skin has gotten better and better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading so many reviews about it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it works so well,</li>
            <li>Still, love this stuff for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>And as I continue use, it has just gotten better and better.</li>
            <li>most lotions make my hands itch.</li>
            <li>burns my face, but it is a potent product.</li>
            <li>Foot doctor recommended it to me and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Tried hundreds of brands over 35 years and have found nothing better.</li>
            <li>The backs of my hands and my neck are most improved by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star for three smallish reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>Seems to soak instead of sit on top of your skin</li>
            <li>Love my food saver.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love rings and quit wearing them</li>
            <li>and I was duped  by a famous dermatologist on tv.  </li>
            <li>This is a most soothing lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using AmLactin, and I hope to have even better and better results in the coming days.</li>
            <li>I scratch, the more they itch and irritate me.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Cheaper and worked better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone with KP try it, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I started out using this product but not being on top of it.</li>
            <li>unless I know for sure I won&#x27;t leave my room</li>
            <li>I wanted to give this a five star review, but I think I&#x27;m going to wait a bit more time on that.  </li>
            <li>and so glad to find an OTC product that works.</li>
            <li>She referred me to a dermatologist who couldn&#x27;t tell me for sure what it is , maybe Poikiloderma of Civatte.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT DID NOT DO THE JOB IT PROMISED FOR ME, HOPE YOU HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH IT</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with the lotion since it&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>used for many years</li>
            <li>The skin on my arms and thighs is even better.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to read the instructions and shake it well before every use.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, worth the money!</li>
            <li>Skin does feel good at first but not for more than a day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strictly for night use because of the weight, but it does give a pretty good peel over time.  </li>
            <li>I thought pretty good.</li>
            <li>We both are excited!</li>
            <li>I tried so many Walmart products claiming to give me great, soft, moisturized skin; Vaseline, Ponds, Ceravae, Gold Bond, Eucerin, Plastic Wrap, Suave, Aveeno.</li>
            <li>I love that it spreads and absorbs quite easily.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best cream for dry skin</li>
            <li>I must say while the lotion itself does sting a bit, it is an excellent lotion for those with really dry skin.</li>
            <li>Awesome moisturizing lotion for dry feet and hands.</li>
            <li>Yes it does have a not so pleasant smell but it fades away really fast.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>The BEST moisturizer for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product on the market for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how quickly this lotion works.  </li>
            <li>cream is more liquid than I&#x27;d like, but the most important factor that screams for a return is the smell.</li>
            <li>: Too many to list, but most importantly, it helped my KP</li>
            <li>Use it daily and stick with it, and you will enjoy some great results!</li>
            <li>Best lotion we&#x27;ve tried for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin on my legs was always, always a huge insecurity, but after using AmLactin I love wearing shorts, skirts, and showing my legs.</li>
            <li>There is more to life than completely smooth skin and remember to appreciate the parts of your skin that don&#x27;t suffer from KP.</li>
            <li>So far, it is a great body lotion.</li>
            <li>This fragrance free product seems to work better for me than the product with fragrance.</li>
            <li>Everything feels smooth and healthy, and I can see no discoloration.</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR THE SKIN, KEEPS IT SOFT.</li>
            <li>I can feel my skin immediately becoming hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It makes skin look so much better and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Amlactin is fantastic in the winter and even better after swimming in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I have continued using Amlactin since becoming OTC and have the smoothest, softest hands.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the price was good.</li>
            <li>Just started using it a couple weeks ago, so can&#x27;t say much except that it feels good</li>
            <li>If they could figure out how to make it smell better and absorb better, it would be an over-the-counter \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; lotion, worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other foot lotions, but this is the best.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to spread, but I&#x27;m putting on my clothes still feeling damp.  </li>
            <li>Amlactin is also on the runny side so if a drop hangs from the applicator after you pump it it will drop and it spills from hands easily.</li>
            <li>it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have an odor to it</li>
            <li>Doctor recommended --- received very quickly...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and soaks in.</li>
            <li>I hesitate sometimes because of the somewhat strong ammonia smell</li>
            <li>like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read so many testimonials about this stuff that I really wanted it to work, but to be honest</li>
            <li>Too strong.</li>
            <li>Scent is too strong.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong for my face though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER... I strongly suggest NOT using this in the summer if you&#x27;re going out in the sun.</li>
            <li>Some others who reviewed said there is a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>The lotion soaks in quickly and the texture is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that it kind of burned my skin.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was pretty impressed with it and have changed my review from 2 stars to 4 stars because I definitely think it is better than I originally gave it credit for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells the first two minutes after applying, but then this kind of acid smell fades away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my own fault, I am well aware</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the BEST lotion on the market for smoothing and re-texturizing skin.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair and have had dry scaly patches on my hands for 15 years.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the year I do fine with just about any moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It was fine if I didn&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li>Just fine, no problems at all, will buy from again.</li>
            <li>Its super!</li>
            <li>If I had used it every day it probably would have been gone more quickly.</li>
            <li>and this has helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li>This works great for dry skin, and I love the pump feature.</li>
            <li>the huge drawback for me is that I can&#x27;t get over the scent.</li>
            <li>and now I have a huge sunburn.</li>
            <li>This lotion has my skin incredibly smooth, the bumps on the back of my legs and arms are gone and even the discolouration is greatly improved...</li>
            <li>I can say this product made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>: this helps smooth kp bumps, but it does not get rid of the redness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is supposed to be fragrance free</li>
            <li>Silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It is light, never oily.</li>
            <li>I think Amlactin is a fantastic product</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and there is no redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take some time to fix ten years&#x27; worthof damage, but with results like these, I&#x27;m a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also helped my feet and made the skin on my feet feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I have stuff to do with smooth legs, people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was told it will help smooth out the bumps</li>
            <li>I use it all over, and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was trying to find sa product to smooth my bumpy forearms.  </li>
            <li>It also made my perpetually-cracked elbows incredibly smooth.  </li>
            <li>By the time I go to the doctor and pay a  co-pay then have the prescription filled this probably saves me money.</li>
            <li>This stuff is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Using this once a day has made my skin entirely smooth.</li>
            <li>Amlactin lotion keeps my summer sandal feet nicely smooth and moisturized like others didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Helped to smooth skin and lessened my arm bumps a bit.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for which I&#x27;m crediting the Hyaluronic Acid component.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin baby smooth all day and even on days I forget to use it</li>
            <li>Paired with exfoliation, it keeps my arms and legs smooth from my keratosis.</li>
            <li>My skin was extremely smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of another product from this company.</li>
            <li>cause they work and are cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and my skin remains silky smooth...</li>
            <li>So I use it at night and wake up in the morning with moist smooth skin.</li>
            <li>This is the same strength that used to be sold by prescription and works great for eczema.</li>
            <li>I just want smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I am using this for my body and also for my face, fantastic results, have to scrub skin about every 4 days.</li>
            <li>This a fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li>They say it is fragrance free, but it smells like ammonia.  </li>
            <li>My legs are wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li>We were really surprised when it worked so good.</li>
            <li>I had planned on getting my skin to a good enough point to wear foundation makeup, but I don&#x27;t need to any more.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use it right after you shower and while your skin is still wet</li>
            <li>tomorrow I could wake up with a major breakout, but so far, I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>sink.&lt;br /&gt;Within just a couple or three days or so, the top of my right hand had a significant rash, and I immediately stopped using this lotion, wondering whether this lotion had caused it, or fearing that I might be having a reaction to a medication.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The hydroxy component leaves the skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>My primary care physician recommended this because she was pretty sure I&#x27;d like it.  </li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best stuff for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to be that consistent with it</li>
            <li>I got this originally for keratosis pilaris on my arms about 6 months ago</li>
            <li>/&gt;This does contain alpha-hydroxy acid, so if you use it on skin that will be in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen since the acid leaves you more sensitive to UV light.</li>
            <li>the Amlactin had my arms smooth, soft &amp; lovely!  </li>
            <li>After that subsides skin tone is much more even and redness associated with irritation is either much lessened or gone!</li>
            <li>This is great, as long as I don&#x27;t use it full-strength.  </li>
            <li>After applying this 2x per day for a week I see a significant difference.</li>
            <li>one I am happy to incorporate as long as it works.</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased this after hearing from a dermatologist that it would help treat my Acanthosis Nigricans (I have PCOS and AN</li>
            <li>significantly reduces Keratosis pilaris, as well as any body acne.  </li>
            <li>However, it is worth it for the results!</li>
            <li>I had more pimples pop up after the first couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excited to see what it does for them.  </li>
            <li>I have been using AmLactin 12% for 24 years (I originally used it in prescription form).</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it and it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The smell is okay..somewhat pleasant because it&#x27;s not too LOUD unless you apply it right under your nose</li>
            <li>Not the best smell, and a little greasy but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Great for dry knees and elbows too.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff for dry, alligator skin.</li>
            <li>Great lotion if you have dry skin like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it with great success when I remember to use it regularly!  </li>
            <li>If Amlactin would clean up their products, I&#x27;d be a faithful user.  </li>
            <li>Great for really dry skin</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft and I love it!</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything special for me.  </li>
            <li>(whoever said that before was the one who convinced me and she was right!)</li>
            <li>Since I started using this on my face, all of my blemishes have cleared up and right now I have no blemishes at all!  </li>
            <li>It is very effective though for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>The product is very effective on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I spent so much money on lotions and this one is the best so the cost was worth it.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing Lotion - my doctor recommended this product for rough feet</li>
            <li>Once it was, I used different creams but they didn&#x27;t do much good.</li>
            <li>lotion is fairly pricey, around $22-25 a bottle, but you get a BIG 20z bottle!</li>
            <li>However, you don&#x27;t need much of it to spread over affected parts, in my case most of my body.</li>
            <li>Have been using this lotion for over a year, does a good job, and Amazon has a lower price then the local stores.</li>
            <li>Any suggestions for better options for face cream would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>Even after a full day, I can&#x27;t get over it.</li>
            <li>This AmLactin seems okay for the rest of the body, but again, I don&#x27;t really care for the chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Nothing really made it better.</li>
            <li>This really works better than I ever imagined</li>
            <li>Really embarrasing when your hands are more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; than your man&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is particularly good for the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; I used to get on the backs of my arms and upper thighs.  </li>
            <li>Not for sensitive noses - it makes me feel kind of nauseous.</li>
            <li>Good enough but not quite as advertised.</li>
            <li>A good product; however I do not use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s NOT a chemical smell; it&#x27;s simply a true fragrance-free product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and can&#x27;t say enough about how good it is.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li>He said his back hasn&#x27;t looked this good since 5th grade.</li>
            <li>Some have said ammonia which is true</li>
            <li>The odor is not nearly as bad as some people claim.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad and I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>Great dry skin lotion!!</li>
            <li>within about 2-3 weeks (which is SUPER fast for KP) and the bumps on my arm are almost gone, too (they&#x27;re more stubborn as I&#x27;ve had them for decades).  </li>
            <li>It moisturises amazingly and most importantly, the itching my daughter used to experience due to dryness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not goin to say that it&#x27;s the best thing out there for dry skin, but this may be the most affordable therapeutic lotion for dry skin so that work s for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong stuff.  </li>
            <li>This was a great buy for my KP and other skin issues (some leftover hyperpigmentation, ingrown hairs, etc).  </li>
            <li>When I first used this lotion I thought it was working fine.</li>
            <li>I do find that if I skip a couple of days without putting it on that the bumps quickly return.</li>
            <li>I may add , that you may need to use a mild loofah once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I wasn&#x27;t sure if this stuff was helping or hurting at first, I thought I&#x27;d include a log of how this stuff works (which I looked for when I first started using it).</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s sold --- her hands cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li>works well, super lotion</li>
            <li>Love love this lotion, I thought I would be forever plagued with bumpy skin especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li>but I figured if it works good it would be worth it since lotion is something that last awhile.</li>
            <li>has reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li>This is a great product though I recommend it to be used only on areas that you really need it.</li>
            <li>I have mild Keratosis Pilaris on my thighs and after applying this nightly for a month they&#x27;ve visibly reduced.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>Decent, still has to be something better out there.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub in super well though.  </li>
            <li>They exfoliate quickly but without the flaking.</li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds of high-end and affordable body lotions and finally found favorite one.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to get mild hyperkeratinization.</li>
            <li>I am going to go back to using Aveeno since its cheap and effective for all over body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I suffer from a mild form of ichthyosis which creates a &#x27;scaling&#x27; on my legs.</li>
            <li>I guess the magic is in the high amount of lactic acid.</li>
            <li>I LOVE AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Lotions that smell nice generally don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this for LESS THAN A WEEK, and have seen a great improvement.  </li>
            <li>May work great for others just not for me and especially during winter time when my skin is drier than normal.</li>
            <li>The skin remains moisturized for a long time and for best result it should be applied twice daily.</li>
            <li>good lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>AmLactin 12%  Moisturizing Lotion  is good on dry skin.</li>
            <li>I saw this on Good Morning America to tighten skin on arms and legs and help with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the BEST lotion I have ever used, and there are not many that I haven&#x27;t tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mentioned my skin is VERY dry, and although this lotion has a nice consistency and smooths on easily, it just doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin and many products bother me.  </li>
            <li>I literally bought another bottle two weeks into my first bottle for fear of the company discontinuing this stuff!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I look for more of a remedy-type lotion than a nice smell girly cream that doesn&#x27;t do much in the long run.  </li>
            <li>It works really fast!!</li>
            <li>and it does EXACTLY what it is promoted as doing !</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, they both absorbed fast without feeling tacky or greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries quickly for a non-greasy very soothing finish.  </li>
            <li>but luckily AmLactin nips that right in the butt and makes retin-a not so sucky.</li>
            <li>I discovered AmLactin last year and the first bottle cleared my legs 80%!!!!</li>
            <li>I was impressed by how quickly it worked when I had been using other lotions that still hadn&#x27;t done the trick after several weeks of repeated use.</li>
            <li>But this is really the most accurate way I can describe this product and what it&#x27;s done for me, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my skin besides make it smooth.</li>
            <li>Really helps my hands in the winter it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly, though, the softness of my legs was undeniable, even after several hours and overnight.</li>
            <li>It really helps to smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin very  supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Even after one use the lotion did make my skin feel smooth and silky, but the smell was too much for me to deal with</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Once your symptoms clear you may be able to use it once a day instead.</li>
            <li>The lotion takes its time to get absorbed in the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While they don&#x27;t recommend using this, I have when I didn&#x27;t have my face ointment available and the results are usually better than my RX facial ointment.</li>
            <li>I hesitate to write a review about this product because I want everyone to think my skin just naturally looks this fantastic!</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my dermatologist and really works, but you have to use it regularly for optimum results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Kind of a no brainier but as you constantly have \\&quot;new\\&quot; skin now its easier to burn&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use an essential oil, rose lavender, ginger.</li>
            <li>will say this product gives good results for softening and smoothing rough patches and skin</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t nearly as fun as buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion is worth the price</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>And have never really felt like i&#x27;ve gotten a good deal on it.</li>
            <li>They are baby soft :)</li>
            <li>The minimal fragrance, and fast absorption means I can apply the lotion and great dressed almost immediately after.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin and an elaborate routine for my face)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totoally worth it.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Though it can sting a bit when applied over freshly shaven skin it keeps irritation and razor bumps away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve delayed/avoided doing many chores/other things, to prevent need for frequent hand-washing.&lt;br /&gt;Reading</li>
            <li>I am a 86 year old man, drove a truck most of my work life and now my HANDS  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I now get COMPLIMENTS on how nice my skin is (especially my legs!).</li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>just started to use it, so far it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m oovy groovy and use more natural products the rest of the year.</li>
            <li>Love this, keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any issue with my skin, and was told many times that my skin is soft anyway, but after using this lotion my skin feels noticeably smoother and softer after one use.</li>
            <li>I showed him how soft and silky my skin stays when I use it after showering:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that within a month or two, it will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>This lotion was first recommend to me by my dermatologist to help with my mild KP.</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells funky but that fades pretty quickly, and yes it burns like the dickens if you put it on immediately after shaving.  </li>
            <li>but as others have said it disappears pretty quickly and can be covered with perfume.  </li>
            <li>I used to not be able to grow hair on my DRY legs, now they&#x27;re full of hair!  </li>
            <li>would have given it 5 stars except it doesn&#x27;t smell so great--\\&quot;mediciny\\&quot; is a good description some other reviewers have shared.  </li>
            <li>put it on after you shower or right before you get into bed.</li>
            <li>I came on Amazon and found this, ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>I put it on right before going to bed</li>
            <li>Arrived right when it said it would.</li>
            <li>right after you towel off after your shower-</li>
            <li>There is some alcohol in the formulation so it stings a bit if I put it on right after shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything right from doctor&#x27;s prescribed stuff to home remedies and nothing worked out.</li>
            <li>RIGHT BEFORE I SLEEP)</li>
            <li>I think that, for me, AmLactin provides the right amount of cell turnover to keep those blemishes from forming.  </li>
            <li>I developed some small bumps on my arms over the summer and this lotion worked great!  </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled to finally find something that so quickly &amp; easily got completely rid of the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator with along with this, and really only had skin peel off from my feet (top and bottom).  </li>
            <li>But very sensitive or allergic people might find it too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try it for another week and see if it gets better, but so far I would say this stuff is nowhere near as good as a simple body lotion from Cerave or Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too strong for their sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not terrible pain but a slight tingling sensation and wayyyy more tolerable than blisters or bleeding cracks.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face was dry to point of cracking, and after we moved to an incredibly humid place, it was red, itchy, and peeling ALL THE TIME.</li>
            <li>A great product I&#x27;ve been using for years that does wonders for the dry areas of my skin - silky soft.</li>
            <li>I am a beauty addict, and product junkie and have tried many moisturizer options for my slightly crepey skin (mostly back-of-hands, lower arms, chest and neck areas).  </li>
            <li>The company was very gracious in refunding me my full amount I paid for them.</li>
            <li>The smell is medicinal when first applied and mellows out after it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li>Try it, I think it&#x27;s worth the money and will absolutely be buying this again!</li>
            <li>so not sure how great it is.  </li>
            <li>I think it has helped some with the KP, I use another exfolient in the shower first then this lotion right after and they seem to be helping with the KP.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought I took a bath in pure ammonia!</li>
            <li>Way better than regular lotion, worth the money.</li>
            <li>You will burn super fast.</li>
            <li>It is quick absorbing and keeps</li>
            <li>When I saw reviews stating that it was too medicine scent strong, I thought the reviewer was too sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li>I am diabetic and this brand is what my dermatologist recommended I&#x27;ve use this for many years, makes your body feel soft and very well protected</li>
            <li>The acid sloughs off dead skin and leaves your skin so nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice a smell per se and it absorbs pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>So  I figured my skin was just too sensitive for this product, so i gave the rest to my mother who has normal non sensitive skin, at first she too also loved it  </li>
            <li>Best out the doc recommend this, wow, no work dry skin if used daily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks, about every other day after I shower, and it has noticeably helped, clearing up the redness and making my skin so much more smooth.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, (my mother used to call it &amp;#34;redheaded&amp;#34; skin) and this works fine for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After much research on lotion that can help soothe skin from chlorine and salt water (avid swimmer) I read that this lotion does the trick - and it does!  </li>
            <li>As a black woman with extremely dry skin (except for my oily face) this is perfect for me!</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in my area, and I was happy to find this product on your site.</li>
            <li>AmLactin is pretty much all body lotion except on lips and in certain more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done anything else as far as toning or working out, just using the lotion and noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>It was exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>It covers mostly my legs, buttocks, and backside of my upper arms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would have to go to the dermatologist to get a topical steroid to help with that.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this soft or smooth.</li>
            <li>The result is smoothness - like butter in the hot sun smoothness.</li>
            <li>AmLactin is not a cure for the currently incurable ichtheosis, but it&#x27;s the best over the counter thing out there.</li>
            <li>Now I use it regularly and even though I love to go for my pedis</li>
            <li>For the first time in 10 years I have found something that helps my KP.  </li>
            <li>When you first start using , you have a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>I got on amazon one day and typed in, &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; and the first item that appeared on the page was Amlactin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s is the first time in 20 years</li>
            <li>With the first time applying it, it was instantaneous in improving my skin.</li>
            <li>again!My hands are soft and smooth and I never get hang nails.</li>
            <li>no fake and bake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t have my go-to lotion at the drug store, and there were a bunch of tourists that wouldn&#x27;t move out of the lotion aisle, so I grabbed the first unscented thing I saw.</li>
            <li>Ten years went by and even years after I refused to put more poison on my face, I hadn&#x27;t recovered.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it enough to see any effects because I don&#x27;t even want to wear it at home.</li>
            <li>I have to say, at first, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Now I grab it first.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff except for one really BIG problem.  </li>
            <li>First let me say that I did not purchase this lotion from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent of this lotion, but it worked really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;To maintain your newly soft and smooth skin, you might also consider using a non-comedogenic cleanser/body wash like Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>And, ultimately, my hair was winning.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for several years and am totally satisfied with its results.</li>
            <li>you have never used it before, it might sting for a bit when you first put it on, but that goes away.  </li>
            <li>It is tingly at first, but you get used to it</li>
            <li>healthy radiant skin will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different creams and lotions in my search for a product that would do more than simply grease me up.</li>
            <li>After searching around I found this product first at Costco and tried it out as I was going to get married soon and was going to wear a strapless dress.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was back for more in minutes.</li>
            <li>Most likely allergic to something in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion is pretty greasy and for keratosis I tend to use a lot.</li>
            <li>: First day, Khiel&#x27;s Razor Bump Relief.</li>
            <li>I have had keratosis pelaris for years, mostly on my arms, and my doctor recommended a similar lotion.  </li>
            <li>Better price than stores plus bigger.</li>
            <li>In patient care, the back rub should be uses more often.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth and clear, and the product does not burn when I put it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100% gone, but pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I think I hadn&#x27;t given it a proper chance when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>Come winter, I&#x27;m pretty screwed.</li>
            <li>I decided to try to AmLactin first and have been blown away by the results on my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll use this up first</li>
            <li>At the same time, I also purchases Cera Ve and love that.</li>
            <li>It makes my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, know my sister uses it too!&lt;br /&gt;The alpha-hydroxy therapy makes all the difference for me personally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit runny, not thick, but it does restore the skin to a nice, non-greasy, moist-feel-to-the-touch with regular use.  </li>
            <li>It actually works my skin has gotten better than it was</li>
            <li>I bought this mostly to improve the bumps on the back of my arms.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s helped fade my old light colored stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had moisturizers that just didn&#x27;t help eczema before, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve come across that</li>
            <li>First of all, a lotion that must be shaken before use?</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>, my skin is soooo smooth, My kp dark dots are still there, maybe i need to way a bit more...</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer for skin that is unable to retain moisture.  </li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle now and love this product.  </li>
            <li>I used to be an avid sun-worshipper</li>
            <li>This does not have a pretty smell (at all).  </li>
            <li>After FIRST day of using this lotion I immediately noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>But now that I&#x27;ve tried it first hand</li>
            <li>works well, nice that it is not very scented</li>
            <li>Wish they could make it smell pretty js</li>
            <li>A soothing balm and modern miracle!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this in a big size.</li>
            <li>I would have to check back with a review as time goes by in order to give more information.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently and saw no improvements.</li>
            <li>online searched through many sites and finally I decided to try AMLACTIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it smells like ammonia when you first apply it -</li>
            <li>I first applied this to my feet then wore socks to bed.  </li>
            <li>Really helped improve my keratosis pilaris on my arms and thighs!</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I&#x27;m gladly slathering it head-to-toe twice daily.</li>
            <li>This lotion has pretty much eradicated my arm bumps after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>I was only able to apply AmLactin 12% Moisturizing Lotion once because I couldn&#x27;t stand the ammonia smell.  </li>
            <li>I am an absolute believer!  </li>
            <li>Not only did they deliver it before the expected time, the product works great right away.</li>
            <li>but I really could care less because it has given me beautiful clear skin...</li>
            <li>None have come close to Amlactin for greatly reducing my dry skin, especially on my heels.</li>
            <li>It is Great for anyone with dry, itchy, skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>Having suffered with dry, flaky skin on the bottom of my feet, blisters, and cracking heels, I can attest to what a joy it is to get some almost instant relief from these conditions.</li>
            <li>Skip right over everything else in the drugstore and go straight for the AmLactin.</li>
            <li>and you know all the other amazing things that ive stated.</li>
            <li>Stopped using it immediately and purchased a humidifier; it helped a lot, so now my skin is silky smooth and my KP is back to being barely visible :)</li>
            <li>That said, I do live in the desert, so my needs are a little more than most folks.  </li>
            <li>at least feels more healthy.</li>
            <li>Most lotions don&#x27;t do much for my skin and this one was no different.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and rubs in quickly and helps relieve dry skin immediately almost.</li>
            <li>Amlactin is the only one which made my skin look and feel good for an entire 24 hour period.</li>
            <li>For the first time in his life his KP is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion but kind of expensive</li>
            <li>My dermatologist actually recommended this as a good overall lotion.</li>
            <li>I was AMAZED at how quickly it helped the KP on my legs, it disappeared (almost completely!)</li>
            <li>but I did see SOME positive results and still use as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 4 days, the bumps on my knees are almost gone, then I decided to try this out because it&#x27;s cheaper and a lot of people gave it positive reviews.</li>
            <li>A few days in and most of the problems have mostly cleared up, and my feet feel much better, and I am less embarrassed by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>particularly like the convenience of having it delivered right to my door when I order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>But on other days, it gently exfoliates my skin, keeps it nice a moisturized, and prevents ingrown</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried pretty much everything to no avail.</li>
            <li>I use it on my feet and pretty much all over.  </li>
            <li>many of these reviews, I have not seen any mention of how long it took for others to recover from rashes caused by this Amlactin</li>
            <li>I have had keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms and legs for pretty much my whole life.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the lotion it seemed very runny.  </li>
            <li>So far the areas I&#x27;ve used it on have had no bad reactions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first use he could tell a difference and within just a few days he was good as new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They should have &amp;#34;SUN ALERT&amp;#34; written in large red print on the top of the front and backsides of this bottle, rather than barely mentioning it last thing in tiny print on the lower backside of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been several days now, and the rash has not yet improved at all, despite my avoidance of putting ANY kind of lotion on it, and hardly touching the backside of my hand with infrequent use of Cetaphil mild hand soap.  </li>
            <li>My skin is now super duper silky soft</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years to help with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite lotion for exceptionally dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended the product to some friends with dry hands and they also love it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The dry skin is actually more like scales or leopard or giraffe spots.  </li>
            <li>When my skin is so dry it hurts, this speeds recovery better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m using Amlactin every day or two just in the areas where my skin tends to be the most dry and where the KP tends to pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the odor goes away within 10 minutes or so, you can also place a scented cream on top once it&#x27;s dry to cover up the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said Amlactin was better for my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better even though I don&#x27;t have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have the most severe dry skin I have ever encountered on anybody.</li>
            <li>I have problems with my legs being dry, scaly and the more</li>
            <li>The urea smell is only strong for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still the same benefits, but without the strong Amlactin odor.</li>
            <li>This is an effective moisturizer and is unscented, which I really appreciate since I use a little bit of a scented lotion on my lower arms and chest (just because I like to smell pretty).</li>
            <li>It is a large bottle</li>
            <li>If you like it, then order the large amount from Amazon.</li>
            <li>my opinion, this is a great lotion and well worth the cost as well as the few minor cons.</li>
            <li>Often will sting due to high -- effective AHA content.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion for skin that has KP, is rough or extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a challenge to keep the bumps down in the winter time, but I guess I could apply it more regularly too.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the strong chemical smell too much, but ultimately no results, despite the glowing reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>cream also works well on rough skin like feet, literally makes your feet super smooth in the summer when you&#x27;re walking around in your flip flops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>regimenThis product worked much better and was much easier than applying BP and waiting for it to dry and then putting on a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my KP and dry winter skin!</li>
            <li>but it certainly does it&#x27;s job and fast.</li>
            <li>Then the shedding begins--the inside of my clothes become a flaky mess for about 2 weeks while AmLactin works its magic, but then my skin normalizes and becomes smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Can be a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li>and it does my arms a little red, but overall I&#x27;m impressed with it.</li>
            <li>This lotion was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dermatologist for the bumps on her upper arms, and it really helps smooth things out.  </li>
            <li>Once heels are smooth, application every few days will be sufficient for maintaining smooth heels.  </li>
            <li>If you stop using the cream for a few weeks, the bumps come back as it&#x27;s not a cure, however it&#x27;s a great treatment.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; not in pieces.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast</li>
            <li>I use a much creamier, moisturizing lotion on the days I shave.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it much so</li>
            <li>This was a real winner.</li>
            <li>really REALLY gets in there and stays there.</li>
            <li>It does everything she said it would; I had not used any lotion on my feet for a whole week</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very watery</li>
            <li>my whole life on and off and</li>
            <li>the results provided are absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sent some to my Mom and she has had the same fantastic experience.  </li>
            <li>I figured this could not be acne and finally went a dermatologist who confirmed it was keratosis pilaris, which then caused acne like issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really notice it and it does go a way after its fully absorbed...so</li>
            <li>--if you try to apply too much of this lotion at once it won&#x27;t soak in very well.</li>
            <li>This works very well on my X-linked ichthyosis.  </li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hope.</li>
            <li>I felt hopeful, but tried not to put too much stock into it.</li>
            <li>: Woke up very flaky, but after I washed my face</li>
            <li>My blemishes were healing fast.</li>
            <li>Absolutely unusable.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve used religiously for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>the skin feels sooo much smoother.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very chemical smell on my skin until I shower it off.</li>
            <li>It really does heal your skin.</li>
            <li>I like to use it before bed (after a shower) to really let it soak into my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no addicted to this lotion.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you how much this lotion has helped me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really wanting it work, so I plan on sticking with it until I use it all up.</li>
            <li>The texture was sort of watery, but really helped with the KP, and I started using it everywhere</li>
            <li>really like this lotion, even for the price.</li>
            <li>Within a week, the skin on my arms is much smoother.  </li>
            <li>use it for a couple weeks straight before you judge it.</li>
            <li>Once it got to that point, I only had to use it two or three times a week, once a day, to maintain the smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Amlactin is the real</li>
            <li>But Iwasn&#x27;t saving much.</li>
            <li>No one wants to sell their cat.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li>Today my husband helped me apply AmLactin on my whole body</li>
            <li>Like putting straight chemical on your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amlactin.</li>
            <li>Im not going to tell you not to buy it but dont get your hopes up too much because it may not work for you.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t really focus on the benefits it could give.</li>
            <li>I have always had keratosis on my arms, with this I FINALLY have smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>Although I used the whole bottle, I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>All of my skin (even non-KP affected) is much, much smoother and silkier now that I started using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my SO really likes it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I will buy and use this product for years to come, no matter how much it costs.</li>
            <li>This really helps to even out tone and make my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>I like Amlactin because it has no fragrance and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>I have PCOS on my legs &amp; arms and this lotion didn&#x27;t help it much.</li>
            <li>This really works well for my skin.</li>
            <li>For me it was very sticky....</li>
            <li>I really did not see any difference with this lotion.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>My skin is definitely much softer</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does work very well, and I have not complaints about it.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really works on me...</li>
            <li>But not now, thanks to this God Sent lotion from heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now I really see a noticeable skin difference.</li>
            <li>It works but keep it out of your mouth as it tastes real bad&lt;br</li>
            <li>much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I scratched so much without noticing until I saw my legs at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I was having very itchy and irritated skin on my arms and legs to the point</li>
            <li>Used a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>I cannot fully express how much this lotion has saved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>This lotion really helps with my KP.</li>
            <li>but nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about one month and have really noticed a reduction in the keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes well but hasn&#x27;t really done much for the issue.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin feel very silky and does help to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Really helps with my KP (keratosis pilaris)</li>
            <li>It really has helped my skin, but I can&#x27;t get over the ammonia scent it leaves on my hands..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it but haven&#x27;t seen too much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>It smells very clearn.</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me that much at all.</li>
            <li>very watery.</li>
            <li>so this is really helpful for that.</li>
            <li>it makes my eyes water and my whole bathroom reeks for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and deeply moisturized!</li>
            <li>the skin on my hands looks much healthier and is no longer cracked and bleeding.  </li>
            <li>forward to my late twenties when I got a good job</li>
            <li>My own dermatologist said get this stuff for my dried out elbows.</li>
            <li>Metaderm (made it worse), Aveeno oatmeal baths (undecided on whether or not this helps), Aquaphor (good to put on top of steroids as a moisturizer, but does not help the actual eczema), and Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight odor (really not bad and dissipates quickly) and can leave your skin a bit sticky, but it works!</li>
            <li>I have tried others in the past and this one is by far the best that I have tried for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m relatively pleased with the product, if in time I notice a major improvement in my chicken skin, I will happily give 5 stars as nothing else has cured it.</li>
            <li>At first, it felt a little \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, but my face really did feel (and look) better.  </li>
            <li>I use this lotion along with Tree Hut&#x27;s original shea body butter as my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>I actually bought the product, originally, to moisturize my face after working out and showering at the gym.  </li>
            <li>but like some other lotions better for all day comfort.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I use to have to have this lotion prescribed to me from my dermatologist  due to my eczema.</li>
            <li>at first I was using my facial product but have actually found it looks better using this.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other product that I have used on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have noticed a great improvement and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have other lotions that seem to help my skin more.  </li>
            <li>(I hope that&#x27;s normal!?)  </li>
            <li>After the first day I saw improvement, second day the red, blotchy skin was replaced by healthy, even coloration.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t review products, but I have to say that this lotion has made a world of a difference for me!  </li>
            <li>This product worked better than any other treatment that was tried.</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased a similar lotion at a well known drugstore</li>
            <li>others have mentioned, it helps to let your skin dry after showering before you apply this, otherwise it takes much longer to absorb and kind of creates a white film.</li>
            <li>In fact, all of my skin is so soft and feels better than it&#x27;s been for a long time and all the bumps are gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing, I would highly recommended this.</li>
            <li>This lotion will do amazing things for your dry skin, starting after just one application.  </li>
            <li>This product worked effectively on Keratosis pilaris (Dry, slightly red, bumpy skin).</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smooth -- not greasy -- and I was amazed at how long my skin stays moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Personally I would have preferred some sweet smell in it.</li>
            <li>First of, I&#x27;m 29 years old and always thought I had &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; on my bum... and used all types of over the counter acne medication</li>
            <li>and I finally had a full night sleep yesterday.</li>
            <li>For the first time my skin cleared up and was normally soft.</li>
            <li>but so far no ill effects.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, for the first time, my husband commented on my soft skin.  </li>
            <li>By now I have nearly used the entire bottle, probably 3/4 or more of it during my time of &amp;#34;religious use.&amp;#34; The backs of my arms are FAR softer, though they are still a bit red/splotchy.</li>
            <li>Amylactin takes it to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so there is no seductive packaging, no subtle scent, but who cares!  </li>
            <li>In a week my feet were like new!</li>
            <li>I like that the consistency is thinner with this lotion which allows you to use less to cover more, resulting in cost savings.</li>
            <li>I have medium brown skin that was too dry and developing light spots.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can order it and have it in 2 days or less.</li>
            <li>I use this product a couple of times a week to get rid of dry skin on my feet and keep them feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Eucerin and had decent results.</li>
            <li>my heels and back of ankles are soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Way better price on amazon than in store, it&#x27;s the same price for a smaller bottle at wal-mart.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it has a bit of a funky scent, but it absorbs quickly and the smell disappears.</li>
            <li>I believe this is another key factor in my skin acting better this year.</li>
            <li>really lucky finding this product last year on a clearance shelf.</li>
            <li>I have a moderate case of keratosis Pilaris on the backs of my arms (and an extremely mild case on the backs of my thighs).</li>
            <li>My skin STILL feels soft and smooth hours later, WITHOUT any LOtion.</li>
            <li>If you decide to try this on your face, test it in a small area first to make sure that your skin can take it.  </li>
            <li>And even when shaken the consistency, while very light, almost milky, seems a little pasty when applied.  </li>
            <li>Working fine on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited about the results so far and plan on continuing use even after the bumps completely disappear, just for maintenance (cut back to 2 or 3 times a week then).</li>
            <li>I originally bought this lotion to help with a very stubborn patch of eczema on my leg, but to my surprise, it has also helped with my dry heels!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve a mild case of Ichthyosis vulgaris, but by using this lotion religiously, my skin feels almost normal.  </li>
            <li>I have witness a change in my skin and high levels of moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amlactin does smell HIGHLY medicated, and it does irritate my nose.</li>
            <li>This is a highly recommended (by dermatologists and skin care specialists) moisturizer for your body.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my daughter this winter do to the high winds and freezing</li>
            <li>The price was a bit high</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this product after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this body lotion with AHA&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend spot testing this stuff before you spread it all over your body.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to those with KP</li>
            <li>Once again, personally I really should&#x27;ve reconsidered purchasing this product from the start because NATURAL is always the most beneficial when it comes to heeling psychologically, BUT in this case physically.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with this skin condition.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, especially for rough, dry heels/feet.  </li>
            <li>I could actually take off my clothes in a pool or hot tub and not feel the staring eyes of people!</li>
            <li>I was preparing to seek a dermatologist&#x27;s help prior to trying Amlactin, but it has really helped my skin!!  </li>
            <li>ENTIRE BODY!I had dry, rough, cracking heals and it turned into \\&quot;I just got a pedicure\\&quot; kind of soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>So when I read the reviews about this lotion I was anxious to try it because I had never heard of it, my dermotologist at the time certainly didn&#x27;t recommend it, he recommended using Cetaphil products which are okay.  </li>
            <li>Also I have significant redness and extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>As a teenager, I just thought this was something I had to live with until I got older.</li>
            <li>The bottle you can get from Amazon is huge and will last a while, plus it is a better value than the stores near me which sell small bottles for $14 dollars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not messy or real greasy like some lotions of this type.</li>
            <li>Really helps my skin stay soft as it exfoliates and hydrates.</li>
            <li>Aside from the weird &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I use a great face moisturizer for my face, but it was so expensive.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin, in fact, my skin is very tolerant.</li>
            <li>While it does leave my skin feeling soft, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in the texture or reduction of KP bumps.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t completely gone, but is much improved with softer, smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Imagine my surprise when after a long day, I come home and realized my skin was as soft and smooth as the morning when I put this lotion on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I was so blown away with this lotion I had to.</li>
            <li>I started retin-a recently and the flakey skin bit really isn&#x27;t fun...</li>
            <li>I am a normal person.</li>
            <li>However, it is well worth every penny and the extra drive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what ever became of my old standby, but this seems to be the same thing only better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old male with (what I believe is) KP on my thighs, butt, and lower back for most of my life.</li>
            <li>It does smell like ammonia, but it mostly goes away after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy it in the bigger bottle since I use it frequently.</li>
            <li>The only thing is the smell or ammonia (I know that not it), but it does go away pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>It tingles when you apply it on normal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you are suffering with any of the aforementioned skin conditions.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only product that moisturizes for the whole day.</li>
            <li>The first use, I&#x27;d recommend having at least a couple hours to let it set; after using it a couple times, though, it absorbs faster--in about 15-20 minutes (probably because it&#x27;s repaired the top level of skin).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe i&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Slightly pricey compared to normal lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally apply this after taking a shower at night or before getting dressed in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter, has been struggling with red, bumpy skin (can&#x27;t remember the medical term used), for many years now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s done more for my skin in a few days than salicylic acid did in... ever.</li>
            <li>It is hydrated, no dry patches, absorbs great, does not have an ordor, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>My KP never really bothered me before (very light, looks more like little freckles only on my arms) until two weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I am a 29-year-old male with mild adult acne.</li>
            <li>Or should I say: I WAS a 29-year-old male with mild adult acne.</li>
            <li>Right after you take a shower and after you smother on some Amlactin, within 10 minutes you&#x27;ll only smell the soap you used on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this on my left arm and leg and the Aveeno on my right arm and leg.</li>
            <li>I only use it once a day, right after my shower, because it does leave you kinda sticky.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very effective against my troubled skin.</li>
            <li>I have used 2-3 times so far and have not seen any clearing of the bumps but the lotion is incredibly thick and seems to work great as a moisturizer as I only have to apply once after showering and my skin stays soft for two or three days even after showering without re-applying.</li>
            <li>At first I only used it on the areas that are affected by the KP, but after feeling how soft my skin was after just one or two applications I started using it on my whole body.  </li>
            <li>As I grew up I just learned to live with it and accept it as a part of my life.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I have new skins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AmLactin works by exfoliating the outer-most skin layers boosting your skin&#x27;s cellular turnover rate all the while moisturizing your new skin.</li>
            <li>About a year ago I ran out of it and purchased a couple of new tubes.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
            <li>Now I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a new, permanent condition.  </li>
            <li>I live on the desert and my skin itches at times</li>
            <li>I absolutely live by this lotion now.</li>
            <li>this lotion is really good for slight exfoliation/brightening/holding in moisture and helping enhance other beauty prodct</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this cream as good as other lotions on the market for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this about twice daily, following it with St. Ives Naturally Smooth Oatmeal &amp; Shea Butter moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and smoothes dry scaley skin.</li>
            <li>also have KP on my legs and upper arms, but it doesn&#x27;t really help much for that, in my case.  </li>
            <li>The key to this lotion is that it really is the only product over the counter that turns over skin cell production quickly.</li>
            <li>Treats super dry skin</li>
            <li>My skin, ALL my LIFE, had been SUPER dry, and flaky.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>, my skin is very sensitive and I used to get razor bumps on my underarms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I am using too help with  skin condition and it is leaving my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite, I don&#x27;t usually use body lotions</li>
            <li>I went online to try and find a product that wld help with my super duper scaly dry skin, that&#x27;s when I found Amlactin!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Completely unsatisfied!</li>
            <li>WOW had no idea it would solve my body acne!</li>
            <li>The rest of my body stays soft, and I never have flaky skin anymore!</li>
            <li>At first she said that only the packaging had changed.  </li>
            <li>Makes it so soft!</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on his skin, he screamed &amp;#34;OW, OW, OW!&amp;#34; and cried for several minutes after I&#x27;d finished.  </li>
            <li>Having a pump on the bottle, I responded that for my hands I usually keep a pump bottle at each sink and more places.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Not sure what caused this to happen, but my KP spread all over my legs and became a lot more noticeable on my arms.</li>
            <li>I somehow got some on my upper chest the first day</li>
            <li>they were that soft!</li>
            <li>I put it on first thing in the am and last thing at night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not use this cream on young children!</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s not a deadly burn, just the normal pain</li>
            <li>Upon my first use of AmLactin I feel immediate relief (and a tiny sting).</li>
            <li>Today, I actually skipped putting on the lotion, and no ill effects.</li>
            <li>may be kissing your significant other, specifically on the face or neck.</li>
            <li>This is working better on my thighs than my arms (not sure why).  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ll keep using it as it&#x27;s better than other similar products.</li>
            <li>I did shake it the first day without issue; I forgot to shake it the second day, and I noticed an ammonia smell.  </li>
            <li>So if you have dry skin put this on after your shower or bath-no more dry skin.</li>
            <li>After about 4 weeks of steady use, AmLactin 12% has made a very noticeable improvement in overall skin texture.  </li>
            <li>Really softens skin, but the smell made me feel like I was back in my high school chem lab.</li>
            <li>Using Amlactin twice daily has improved my skin more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s kind of hard in the summer, so beware!</li>
            <li>, it does really works well, it heals dry skin, it is very essential to have it against dry or aging problems or for treating itchy damaged skin, its very light and not greasy, i like also treat scars and i like its sense,</li>
            <li>I have also had success getting rid of dry, scaly skin on my feet as well.</li>
            <li>I use it on my dry scaly elbows with success.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin soft at first, then I started to get red itchy spots.</li>
            <li>The positive effects, however, last ALL day.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic for psoriasis, eczema, extremely rough, dry skin.</li>
            <li>had moderate acne which I more or less kept under control using acne.orgs</li>
            <li>So, as I saw in other reviews, you pretty much can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li>Protect that skin if you are going outside after because they are not kidding when they say that your skin is a little more susceptible to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The little bumps are noticeably reduced and the actual texture of my skin is getting better on my neck as well.</li>
            <li>It works super well, but it&#x27;s not exactly all natural which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using this lotion after my shower at night, I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It is great lotion for the cold winter chaffing.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, I saw a huge difference in my KP within a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff takes what feels like forever to clear up KP</li>
            <li>I have used it two times, and it is clear that the bumps on the knees started to come back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that has really helped the bumps is just getting natural sun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for these symptoms, from lotions to oils, and all of them provided only very temporary solutions, and even then never came close to completely clearing up the issues.</li>
            <li>Results were clearly seen within two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t a more commonly known product.</li>
            <li>(I was working out doors at the time) and a co-worker looked at my arms and said loudly, &amp;#34;oooh,</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a professional dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I had been suffering as a young teenager with keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>Smells like ammonia, but keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Fast forward ten years</li>
            <li>My feet are sooooo soft and my winter-time alligator legs must have gone south for the winter.</li>
            <li>I discontinued frequent use because I frequent the outdoors</li>
            <li>AmLactin and its sister product, LacHydrin, keep my skin soft and moisturized for days on end.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised by how well it worked when used twice a day.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely soft and the lotion doesn&#x27;t have any scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Doctor recommended this lotion for my sensitive skin on my arms that was getting bumpy and agitated.</li>
            <li>The unexpected benefit is that my thumbs no longer split/crack in the winter from drying out (at the corner of the thumb-nail).  </li>
            <li>I developed a reaction to the acid in it.</li>
            <li>I rinse it completely off, scrubbing it as I rinse it, then apply lots of Amlactin, and my arms look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is much cheaper than local store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but not a nice lotion smell.  </li>
            <li>Its gentle enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want my skin to be too sensitive</li>
            <li>So far, it has.</li>
            <li>Skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and was hoping for a lotion my skin could tolerate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel self conscious about wearing shorts this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over time it has even helped with old scars.  </li>
            <li>It has smoothed out all my skin and make my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Also use on my face and doesn&#x27;t break me out (really sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how photo sensitive it will be while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does make your skin sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>My skin is baby soft to the touch, my tone is evening out.  </li>
            <li>I will also say it is much cheaper at Amazon that my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it nearly as often as they say (twice a day) except when a therapeutic regimen seems called for, but when I need it it practically works miracles.  </li>
            <li>YOU ARE OLD...</li>
            <li>and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And lastly, you are supposed to avoid too much sun on the area you are using it.  </li>
            <li>so I am hoping to see results soon as it adds an extra step to getting ready for the day or to go to bed...</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin really soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Not entirely 100% but enough that I definitely feel better about my overall appearance.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream at the drug store and after about 3 weeks of using it, my old arms were back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>like a week after using it, my skin looks like it did when I was 20 years old.  </li>
            <li>Also makes you skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Its gives my skin the softness that last the whole day  +</li>
            <li>So much so that I actually have to put on perfume to cover it up.</li>
            <li>This makes your skin soft</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who has old looking skin.</li>
            <li>I wish I could get my money back too because I really didn&#x27;t want to pay 20 bucks for a bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING and came across this product by complete accident.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference after two weeks and my skin feels so soft this</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother who developed a rash on neck and chest (though not anywhere else on her body) after a week&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 2 months of 3 day a week use, it&#x27;s almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>So far i haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>The generic is also great--it really helps skin stay moist, even in the desert.</li>
            <li>This product completely takes care of the problem.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for having such on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how soft my skin is when I use this product.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>And now its soft.</li>
            <li>and I felt overly conscious.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read it helps even gets rid of the condition completely from the reviews</li>
            <li>My hands remain hydrated and soft even through the coldest weather.</li>
            <li>I needed a script a few years ago before it became available over the counter.</li>
            <li>No, the KP isn&#x27;t entirely gone, but my legs are much smoother and the darker spots seem to be lightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sensitive sense of smell, so</li>
            <li>nothing natural about this.</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t completely cured my KP</li>
            <li>My elbows are now as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, so I don&#x27;t even know what my bottom is soft as.</li>
            <li>that makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>My hands, elbows, feet and arms are wonderfully soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I seem to have a problem with shedding skin naturally</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and in just a week of use the goose pimply things on the back of my legs and arms are gone.  </li>
            <li>It will dissolve the top layer of dead skin and work its way DEEP INTO your skin, not just cover it up.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I try to use it more everyday it can help further.  </li>
            <li>will post an updated review after a few more weeks, but i couldn&#x27;t wait to share the results i&#x27;m getting after only 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It not only takes off the dead skin but moisturizes the layer underneath and it comes up healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>I apply the lotion thickly where needed and apply a layer of coconut oil on top of the lotion after it soaks in.</li>
            <li>Good buy for this expensive lotion</li>
            <li>recommend this product, it does take a few weeks to notice any affects and it doesn&#x27;t absorb right away but who really can complain about that if it clears your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took it upon myself to see a dermatologist and among many other creams and topical ointments, she recommended me Amlactin as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Improved my KP on my upper arms significantly as well along with proper exfoliation and use of sun screen prior to going into the sun!</li>
            <li>The other areas affected are showing healthy pink skin.  </li>
            <li>I recommend dry brushing first, then use this.</li>
            <li>STRONG chemical smell (like the smell of hair dye).&lt;br /&gt;- stings when you have small wounds like mosquito</li>
            <li>I will use it everyday forever with a smile!</li>
            <li>You get more for your money because a 17.6 oz bottle of AmLactin is never more than 24 dollars, and a 8 oz of the similar brand</li>
            <li>It would be a nice daily moisturizer for someone who just wants to keep their skin hydrated, but unfortunately it is too watery for me, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a lasting effect.</li>
            <li>I am a brown skinned African American woman and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I thought this would help or at least moisturize it good enough to where it would get even a tiny bit better, but it made my skin break out into itchy bumps which then aggravated the KP and made it worse.</li>
            <li>It still burned a little when I put the lotion on, but not horribly painfully so.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it smells a bit like hair bleach (after all it DOES have a high alpha hydroxy acid content), but once your skin absorbs it the smell is gone.</li>
            <li>I would put this up against any high dollar facial moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li>This preparation came highly recommended by different doctors but is not working that well for me</li>
            <li>If anyone else is having similar skin issues, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Few had issues with breakouts, few had problems with the residue, few needed more moisture, and most had ASHY issues.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a little more than twenty three dollars and Aveeno 18 ounce daily moisturizing lotion for just under ten dollars.</li>
            <li>Love this for those little red bumps on the upper arms -- UV rays will help with it, also, but if you are avoiding that, then this lotion works well.</li>
            <li>Wash your hands with soap afterward or you will bleach anything you touch, and make sure to let your skin dry a few moments before putting on clothing.</li>
            <li>All in all, I will NOT BUY again simply because it&#x27;s nothing special than any other lotion with tons of chemicals.</li>
            <li>It takes a small amount to give you smooth and moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>This thing will last me about two months in the winter (I use it about 2x every day for full body coverage) and 3-4 months in other seasons.</li>
            <li>Not flaky, not red and irritated, but just normal skin.</li>
            <li>My feet have crazy cuticles, lots of white, yet other lotion, pumice and more can&#x27;t keep them looking nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on lotions for my feet, and nothing compares to this!</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of using, my hands were back to normal.  </li>
            <li>The same large itchy red bump welts.</li>
            <li>After only a few days with AmLactin, we noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This lotion works really well in controlling the bumps and dry skin on the backs of my arms (Keratosis Pilaris).</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin that flakes very noticeably.</li>
            <li>This is a cream that really works on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect this to help my dry snake skin as much as it did.</li>
            <li>Bought on a suggestion from a dry skin forum, but it isn&#x27;t really doing it for me.</li>
            <li>Does very well moisturizing dry skin exacerbated by winter air.</li>
            <li>The AHA in this gently removes the dry skin while attracting moisture into your skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it once or twice a week all over, including my feet; it really helps with dry skin and KP.</li>
            <li>I dont like the smell much, but it disappears once dry.</li>
            <li>it really helps moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li>and it really helps the dry skin issues.</li>
            <li>I became very ashamed of my skin and simply didn&#x27;t talk about it even to my regular doctors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>It seemed like a different product; its consistency was much looser than it had been and it smelled different.</li>
            <li>I am 52 and have never really sunbathed too much so my skin was relatively soft anyway.</li>
            <li>Eventually, the red bumps were reduced and with a bit of natural tanning they are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>the red arm bumps on the backs of my arms).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this 2x daily for about 25 days straight</li>
            <li>Growing up in Florida, I spent far too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I am a 59 tear old male and my skin is moving to old man skin</li>
            <li>This is a tremendous product for removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>It will make your skin VERY soft in a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li>No other body moisturizer can compare.</li>
            <li>Even the next morning my lower legs are still soft and moisturized!  </li>
            <li>Other members of my family and myself saw many doctors and dermatologists, to little avail.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before purchasing the product and none of the people I knew enough to respect their opinion which is something I should&#x27;ve considered before purchasing a jar of chemicals OVER &amp;#34;ALL natural products&amp;#34; since our body is an organic system created to heal it self anyway!</li>
            <li>It also keeps my skin from becoming too dry in this harsh winter weather.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a female with really dry, rough and huge  hands.</li>
            <li>So far this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li>My arm and legs which have the most KP are a lot clearer since I started using Amlactin due to the dead skin cells being dissolved away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pure Vitamin E cream in the past and it smells exactly the same, so don&#x27;t let this concern you.</li>
            <li>, so I mix equal parts of this, a 1% hydrocortsone lotion, and another dry skin moisturizer (D-ve Cream Oil for Extra Dry Skin) in my hands, then smooth it all over my itchy body.  </li>
            <li>then I&#x27;ve found that any lotion, or any soap, and even just water further irritates this rash.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this lotion caused it, and I highly suspect that the sunshine had further aggravated matters.</li>
            <li>But, one hugely positive thing I can say for it (other than getting rid of my bumps) is that this stuff has yet to discolor any of my towels or clothes.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li>The first week it made my arms feel smooth and nice but slowly my arms started to react badly.</li>
            <li>Then a few days later I noticed huge red bulgy bumps!</li>
            <li>I am about 99.9% clear on my back and chest</li>
            <li>Only clear skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for months now and it seems to definitely have helped clear up the blemishes on my skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a totally clear face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using it directly after shaving because it burns and makes the follicles red.</li>
            <li>It was very watery and didn&#x27;t do the job that I expected it to do on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it several weeks, it does make my skin soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help with back acne that I struggle with as an adult.</li>
            <li>My skin is finally silky soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30 year old white, european woman with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far Amazon is the only shelf I have found it on since.  </li>
            <li>, so far it has helped reduce the bumps on her stomach and the ones on her back have completely disappeared and hasn&#x27;t come back</li>
            <li>it was different and didn&#x27;t work at all, although it never ever worked anywhere near as well as the Amlactin does.  </li>
            <li>If I even just barely touched something, you could kiss it goodbye.  </li>
            <li>I have been applying twice a day for weeks, and have noticed in the last 2 weeks that an itchy rash developed on my arms.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, it may burn initially as it contains glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>Well, I am coming near the end of healing the second ulcer</li>
            <li>/&gt;I only have two complaints about the product: if your skin is quite sensitive, the product can sting on contact and there is a burning sensation afterward for 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I tried EVERYTHING for my keratosis pili, spent so much money</li>
            <li>It helps with overall skin texture, smoothing and making you feel soft after it fully absorbs.</li>
            <li>But one big warning - don&#x27;t apply any time near you</li>
            <li>She has tried other more expensive remedies but this works better than any other alternative.  </li>
            <li>By the time it dries, the smell is barely there.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li>This is my third day using it and my arms are almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>The tingling/burning sensation is a bit worse on  your face than body as your face is more sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>top was broken off the pump</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was reluctant to purchase it because of the price (poor college student), but I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Others have said it will bleach clothing, I have not experienced this, but I&#x27;ve also rubbed it in fully before putting on clothes/ touching</li>
            <li>Not gone completely, but certainly made less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I used a bath &amp;#34;pouf&amp;#34; to gently exfoliate but never saw a huge difference, other than my skin being less dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but completely worth it!</li>
            <li>But...then...I had a big problem, a new burn, and I started to use it regularly.</li>
            <li>and it turned my rough keratosis pilaris patches into normal feeling skin!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It can create a slight burning sensation when first applied&lt;br /&gt;Probably</li>
            <li>They were noticeably softer and less ashy after the first use.</li>
            <li>This lotion is more costly than other products that I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and it took a long time to get used to this product.</li>
            <li>I just pour out half the bottle (save for later) and mix my fragrant oil, body butter or lotion right in.</li>
            <li>It  works great though a little expensive</li>
            <li>Havent noticed much difference on the other parts of my body though.</li>
            <li>It works really, really works well for those with keratosis pilaris and any rough skin!</li>
            <li>I only use this every few days, but after the first  2 applications, I could already feel a marked difference.</li>
            <li>I live rather rurally, so this product is hard to find in stores, but worth it to order online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now looking for a new solution to my dry skin problem...</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft, it was absorbed quickly, and it made me itch like crazy.  </li>
            <li>I find the smell just too unpleasant for me to use on a regular basis, and with this kind of product I think consistent use is necessary for it to actually work.  </li>
            <li>Those that do appear look much less like ingrown hairs and more like random bumps, which is a lot better (in my opinion) as the bumps are far less obvious than red bumps.</li>
            <li>It absolutely helps with that, so my overall assessment is that if you&#x27;re looking for something to get you through dry months definitely get this.</li>
            <li>short, BUY THIS LOTION!sation is a bit worse on  your face than body as your face is more sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have delicate skin and this lotion quickly removed most of the bumps within a couple of weeks without stinging or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot rave enough about it, evens out my skin like no other.</li>
            <li>it!&lt;br /&gt;It stings a little when you first apply but with the time you will get used to it</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this to anyone with rough bumpy skin.</li>
            <li>I mean never, had smooth thighs and back of arms....</li>
            <li>I have been to dermatologists, used expensive lotions, ointments, and have been told that it would never clear up or would get better as I got older.  </li>
            <li>A few drops to each bottle gives a faint scent that is very nice</li>
            <li>But with Amlactin, my skin is BABY SOFT ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li>I barely went outside also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a small eczema breakout in my mid-twenties, a dermatologist had me slather my face with a powerful corticosteroid.</li>
            <li>Having read the reviews, I knew to expect that it would sting the first few times, so I kept going twice a day for about 10 days until I just couldn&#x27;t take his screaming anymore.  </li>
            <li>It will sting a bit if you apply it after shaving, but it&#x27;s worth the small pain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first time I used lactic acid, it was in the form of a chemical peel solution that you apply and wash off in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>As someone with normal skin, this lotion makes my skin feel permanently &#x27;wet&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This really help dry dry skin.  </li>
            <li>, it really works for my dry arm, it had reduced the redness and dry, however, you have to keep using it</li>
            <li>The product goes on more or less &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, but the operative chemicals in it can develop on your skin over the following hours, be absorbed into your system through the skin, and the resulting horrible scent can be overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>a tip, it smells like straight up chemicals but the smell fades after it dries down.</li>
            <li>I used it for several weeks straight, twice a day, saw no results other than chemical burns/rashes in the inner creases of my elbows.</li>
            <li>I live in ridiculously sunny hot AZ and worry if this lotion will make my skin super-sensitive to sunlight</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and with winter approaching I&#x27;m always open to new moisturizing ideas.</li>
            <li>Sensitive, dry and</li>
            <li>We purchased this lotion at the advice of our pediatrician for my 18 month old twins who both suffer from dry skin and ecsema.</li>
            <li>This lotion exfoliates and moisturizes my sensitive and at times dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin.  </li>
            <li>At first I was extremely skeptical as I have literally tried every lotion and cream worth its salt on the market.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time ive reviewed something and wanted to be as thorough as I can with my personal experience and the experience of a few friends.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft and moist all day, and it costs far less that the fancy creams that are priced by the fraction of an ounce.  </li>
            <li>While Amlactin hasn&#x27;t helped get rid of either of the affected areas after two months of use, it has at least slightly approved its appearance now that the skin stays so much more hydrated than before</li>
            <li>A week into use, I only have a few small, almost unnoticeable bumps left in the area, and I might pumice them to expedite their departure, though I&#x27;m certain they&#x27;ll be gone in a few more days while I&#x27;m using this lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is not very pleasant but it totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It was a huge let down because I was really thinking it was going to work, and I definitely did not think that it would make matters worse.</li>
            <li>There is still a little flaking, but not so much that I&#x27;m embarrassed to show my face.</li>
            <li>the bumps are so much smoother, little eczema patches are disappearing.  </li>
            <li>I also just started using it on my knee where I have a little keratosis pilaris, and my knees are much smoother now.</li>
            <li>My teenage girls use this for those little red bumps on the back of the arm - really keeps it under control.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I can&#x27;t express how wonderful this product is!</li>
            <li> AmLactin is the best cream I have ever used for my KP condition.</li>

            <li> Nice lotion!</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled!  </li>
            <li> This is the best cream yet, it took away most of my skin bumps..called KP skin.</li>
            <li> And it appears to be cumulative, because if I don&#x27;t apply it one day, my legs still look good with no signs of dryness, which is remarkable.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing at getting rid of them and this a great size.</li>
            <li> Good price for amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is a fair moisturizer but don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Consistently a good cream for my arms, legs and feet.  </li>
            <li> Good move on my part, will continue to purchase it online.</li>
            <li> So either cover up or use a good quality sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I saw this in the store and decided to try it before reading up on it, knowing that lactic acid is a good exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> good lotion mt podiatrist recommended it</li>
            <li> The skin on my face was tighter, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> In fact, I look really good.</li>
            <li> Also, a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference good quality lotion makes on your skin.</li>

            <li> Hydration wise-</li>
            <li> In my opinion, It is the best lotion available, suggested to me by my doctor.</li>
            <li> Although this product has tons of great reviews, I have to be honest with my experience as well.</li>
            <li> good product.  </li>
            <li> Good as always.</li>
            <li> Use this after a good exfoliation session in the shower.</li>
            <li> This size is avery good buy.</li>
            <li> As good as it is, I won&#x27;t buy it again unless they do something about the smell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good, but it WORKS.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While this lotion doesn&#x27;t smell good, the scent isn&#x27;t bothersome in any way.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> , purchasing it from Amazon with its great shipping makes it easy to shop for AmLactin.</li>
            <li> What I HAVE noticed is the overwhelming odor - it isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> I used it the first night, and in the morning it was soooo much better!!!  </li>
            <li> Great exfoliant and keeps winter skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, I don&#x27;t know what will.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and has even helped even out my skin tone on my chest where I had hypo-pigmentation from acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This cream works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> but this one is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but this lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Give it a week and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> The company who makes Amlactin has helped many sufferers of KP; they are doing good in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> it grows in effective after a while.</li>
            <li> So use it on your face at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes me nice and juicy.</li>
            <li> Went through literally gallons of every kind of lotion you can imagine.  </li>
            <li> However, I have to say the Cetaphil and Buf Puf did not work on their own--</li>
            <li> This is an effective AH acid, but it is a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that there are many happy customers who purchased this item, but it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream.</li>
            <li> but, honestly, I don’t notice any smell at all.</li>
            <li> I used this in the prescription form for over 10 years and this is just as effective.</li>
            <li> so that is really saying something about how great this lotion is!</li>
            <li> Especially useful for feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like paint.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion</li>
            <li> Better than the offbrands, but not as good as Lachydron was,</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait to wear tanks this year, and it makes the skin nice and even too.</li>
            <li> Thanks from a happy customer!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the nice results I also started the use it on my bacne, hope it does wonders to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also works nicely on my wifes eczema.</li>
            <li> The lotion seems kind of running when you squirt it into your hand, but as you massage it into your skin it appears to get thicker and &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; for a bit, but absorbs all the way</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a KP sufferer and have put up with the kind of struggle to find something that works that I have, you know I&#x27;m not exaggerating.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say it works.</li>
            <li> Was delivered fast and packaging was great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how effective it is.  </li>
            <li> I cannot give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best moisturizer with no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Awesome lotion - great for smoothing out dry or &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very strong, ammonium smell (the &amp;#34;lactic acid&amp;#34; is in the form of the ammonium lactate salt).</li>
            <li> smell is very strong.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth paying a bit more for the good stuff!</li>
            <li> They all agree that this is the best product that they have used that completely eliminated the ashy bits</li>
            <li> As far as a quality dermatology product, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> amonia smell-  but putting up with that  to get great results is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I always jealous of girls with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; legs that just looked like good, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, though, pretty great results with this stuff, and a nice amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, so this does not tend to affect the appearance of my skin, except that I find it itchy and scratch at it.</li>
            <li> Part of latest attempt to deal with ingrown hairs and irritation associated with shaving, AmLactin is the best adjunct treatment I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> This lotion has lactic acid which may sting at first but does a great job of exfoliation and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I saw that reported by others but hadn&#x27;t experienced it in my first try.</li>
            <li> After first applying, it felt great</li>
            <li> Very good for dry flaky skin and the best thing I&#x27;ve found for wrinkles, really!  </li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s fine!  </li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- very light texture, non greasy.</li>
            <li> The product is very effective for me, so I&#x27;m willing to deal with it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the rest of my arms are finally smooth and the redness mostly gone!  </li>
            <li> This lotion works fine but smells kind of chemically and is a thinner lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me too much - it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell great</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I store, plus you get more.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and it feels nice on my KP too.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I am able to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Better than the name brand lotions.</li>
            <li> I really love it and the softness.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that there is anything else better.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this and like it better.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing lotion is excellent we did have it on subsciption until they did away with the smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> It defoliates the skin better than anything.</li>
            <li> This stuff is basically magic for the dermatitis on my fingers.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on The Meredith Viera Show when she had one of the top Dermatologist on and she recommended this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Even my regular pedi girl cannot believe how wonderful this works.</li>
            <li> You will definitely not be disappointed !!!!</li>
            <li> This is simply the best.</li>
            <li> I am amazed and in love.</li>
            <li> I had to share the love. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Ok so I almost wish this stuff didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li> The one thing I would caution you with is make sure you don&#x27;t leave yourself unprotected in the Sun.</li>
            <li> I think I would have to use a stronger version with more lactic acid.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Recently (at the 6+ month mark) i noticed my Freckles/hyperpigmentation have almost faded to flawless making my skin tone unified.</li>
            <li> They also are getting more \\&quot;skin colored\\</li>
            <li> and if i sprayed my cologne over top of it the smell notes were distorted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holy guacamole am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> I had more energy.</li>
            <li> But I am so far incredibly thankful</li>
            <li> My skin looks better every day.</li>
            <li> And this is a way better price than retail.</li>
            <li> My hands are looking better than ever.</li>
            <li> Better than all the \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li> In my experience, though, you need to start with a topical steroid cream for a couple of weeks before using this to get the best benefit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting and may add a drop or two more.  </li>
            <li> It took maybe a month of daily use for me to see a difference, my dermatologist was impressed.</li>
            <li> It also helped smooth the skin on my face which wasnt even why i bought it!</li>
            <li> I cant recommend it enough, great product!</li>
            <li> I prefer the thicker, more emollient, feel of the CeraVe for my feet.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not, however, put this on more than the recommended twice a day.</li>
            <li> It probably does more healing than I realize</li>
            <li> Another top notch review here.</li>
            <li> Really love the way my skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend using it on face, but love it otherwise.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought &#x27;at over $1.00/oz this stuff better work miracles and dance jigs&#x27;.</li>
            <li> BIG WIN!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t stop using it, so you need to buy more, but it becomes costly to afford</li>
            <li> I bought Lac-Hydrin before this for my KP and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I had to take a shower immediately to get the odor off, but it still lingered for a while more.</li>
            <li> For many years I used Lac-Hydrin 5.  </li>
            <li> and it was 80% better.</li>
            <li> Great product,  fast shipping, recommended by dermatologist,</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Feels great, moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> make sure you wear it before you go to bed.</li>
            <li> All of them are pleased as punch, so then so am I.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li> KP looks much better.  </li>
            <li> It seems best used the evening after shaving, and both morning and evening on the following day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for many, many years</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth!</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love what it  does to my skin...feels like silk.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda ok.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fabulous!</li>
            <li> so I can have lovely skin.</li>
            <li> so many months now, that I don&#x27;t recall seeing mention of the &amp;#34;sun alert&amp;#34; on the bottom of the backside of the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have KP and for the most part I would say it helps</li>
            <li> Though the smell is not that appealing.</li>
            <li> I love results.</li>
            <li> Glad I chose it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Hopes this helps you :)</li>
            <li> This helps with KP I had for so many years that I didn&#x27;t thought anything can help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a year or more now.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion.</li>
            <li> I think any product that has many purposes saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> hopefully with more time it&#x27;ll be better.</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps me moist longer than most.</li>
            <li> This stuff is better.</li>
            <li> and it does wonders and is more convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> One if my favorite moisturizing lotions.</li>
            <li> Love Amlactin products...</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t be able to find it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many things but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite beauty product.  </li>
            <li> Better than all of the prescription creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love the way</li>
            <li> Will defiantly purchase again. :)</li>
            <li> Still the same benefits, but with an awesome smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sit on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> I imagine it would be even better layered up with a thicker emollient.</li>
            <li> I guess the product accumulated there the most</li>
            <li> /&gt;And, even if it did work, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d have to continue putting it on for maintenance, keeping the kp at bay.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this lotion, my skin has gotten better and better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading so many reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it works so well,</li>
            <li> Still, love this stuff for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> And as I continue use, it has just gotten better and better.</li>
            <li> most lotions make my hands itch.</li>
            <li> burns my face, but it is a potent product.</li>
            <li> Foot doctor recommended it to me and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Tried hundreds of brands over 35 years and have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> The backs of my hands and my neck are most improved by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star for three smallish reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Seems to soak instead of sit on top of your skin</li>
            <li> Love my food saver.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love rings and quit wearing them</li>
            <li> and I was duped  by a famous dermatologist on tv.  </li>
            <li> This is a most soothing lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using AmLactin, and I hope to have even better and better results in the coming days.</li>
            <li> I scratch, the more they itch and irritate me.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Cheaper and worked better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone with KP try it, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I started out using this product but not being on top of it.</li>
            <li> unless I know for sure I won&#x27;t leave my room</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a five star review, but I think I&#x27;m going to wait a bit more time on that.  </li>
            <li> and so glad to find an OTC product that works.</li>
            <li> She referred me to a dermatologist who couldn&#x27;t tell me for sure what it is , maybe Poikiloderma of Civatte.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOT DO THE JOB IT PROMISED FOR ME, HOPE YOU HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH IT</li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with the lotion since it&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> used for many years</li>
            <li> The skin on my arms and thighs is even better.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to read the instructions and shake it well before every use.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, worth the money!</li>
            <li> Skin does feel good at first but not for more than a day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strictly for night use because of the weight, but it does give a pretty good peel over time.  </li>
            <li> I thought pretty good.</li>
            <li> We both are excited!</li>
            <li> I tried so many Walmart products claiming to give me great, soft, moisturized skin; Vaseline, Ponds, Ceravae, Gold Bond, Eucerin, Plastic Wrap, Suave, Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I love that it spreads and absorbs quite easily.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best cream for dry skin</li>
            <li> I must say while the lotion itself does sting a bit, it is an excellent lotion for those with really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizing lotion for dry feet and hands.</li>
            <li> Yes it does have a not so pleasant smell but it fades away really fast.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry skin</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> The BEST moisturizer for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how quickly this lotion works.  </li>
            <li> cream is more liquid than I&#x27;d like, but the most important factor that screams for a return is the smell.</li>
            <li> : Too many to list, but most importantly, it helped my KP</li>
            <li> Use it daily and stick with it, and you will enjoy some great results!</li>
            <li> Best lotion we&#x27;ve tried for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin on my legs was always, always a huge insecurity, but after using AmLactin I love wearing shorts, skirts, and showing my legs.</li>
            <li> There is more to life than completely smooth skin and remember to appreciate the parts of your skin that don&#x27;t suffer from KP.</li>
            <li> So far, it is a great body lotion.</li>
            <li> This fragrance free product seems to work better for me than the product with fragrance.</li>
            <li> Everything feels smooth and healthy, and I can see no discoloration.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR THE SKIN, KEEPS IT SOFT.</li>
            <li> I can feel my skin immediately becoming hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It makes skin look so much better and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Amlactin is fantastic in the winter and even better after swimming in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I have continued using Amlactin since becoming OTC and have the smoothest, softest hands.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Just started using it a couple weeks ago, so can&#x27;t say much except that it feels good</li>
            <li> If they could figure out how to make it smell better and absorb better, it would be an over-the-counter \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; lotion, worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other foot lotions, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to spread, but I&#x27;m putting on my clothes still feeling damp.  </li>
            <li> Amlactin is also on the runny side so if a drop hangs from the applicator after you pump it it will drop and it spills from hands easily.</li>
            <li> it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have an odor to it</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended --- received very quickly...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and soaks in.</li>
            <li> I hesitate sometimes because of the somewhat strong ammonia smell</li>
            <li> like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read so many testimonials about this stuff that I really wanted it to work, but to be honest</li>
            <li> Too strong.</li>
            <li> Scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong for my face though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER... I strongly suggest NOT using this in the summer if you&#x27;re going out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Some others who reviewed said there is a strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> The lotion soaks in quickly and the texture is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that it kind of burned my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was pretty impressed with it and have changed my review from 2 stars to 4 stars because I definitely think it is better than I originally gave it credit for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells the first two minutes after applying, but then this kind of acid smell fades away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my own fault, I am well aware</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the BEST lotion on the market for smoothing and re-texturizing skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair and have had dry scaly patches on my hands for 15 years.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the year I do fine with just about any moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It was fine if I didn&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li> Just fine, no problems at all, will buy from again.</li>
            <li> Its super!</li>
            <li> If I had used it every day it probably would have been gone more quickly.</li>
            <li> and this has helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li> This works great for dry skin, and I love the pump feature.</li>
            <li> the huge drawback for me is that I can&#x27;t get over the scent.</li>
            <li> and now I have a huge sunburn.</li>
            <li> This lotion has my skin incredibly smooth, the bumps on the back of my legs and arms are gone and even the discolouration is greatly improved...</li>
            <li> I can say this product made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> : this helps smooth kp bumps, but it does not get rid of the redness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is supposed to be fragrance free</li>
            <li> Silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It is light, never oily.</li>
            <li> I think Amlactin is a fantastic product</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and there is no redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take some time to fix ten years&#x27; worthof damage, but with results like these, I&#x27;m a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also helped my feet and made the skin on my feet feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I have stuff to do with smooth legs, people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was told it will help smooth out the bumps</li>
            <li> I use it all over, and my skin is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to find sa product to smooth my bumpy forearms.  </li>
            <li> It also made my perpetually-cracked elbows incredibly smooth.  </li>
            <li> By the time I go to the doctor and pay a  co-pay then have the prescription filled this probably saves me money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Using this once a day has made my skin entirely smooth.</li>
            <li> Amlactin lotion keeps my summer sandal feet nicely smooth and moisturized like others didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Helped to smooth skin and lessened my arm bumps a bit.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for which I&#x27;m crediting the Hyaluronic Acid component.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin baby smooth all day and even on days I forget to use it</li>
            <li> Paired with exfoliation, it keeps my arms and legs smooth from my keratosis.</li>
            <li> My skin was extremely smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of another product from this company.</li>
            <li> cause they work and are cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li> and my skin remains silky smooth...</li>
            <li> So I use it at night and wake up in the morning with moist smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This is the same strength that used to be sold by prescription and works great for eczema.</li>
            <li> I just want smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I am using this for my body and also for my face, fantastic results, have to scrub skin about every 4 days.</li>
            <li> This a fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li> They say it is fragrance free, but it smells like ammonia.  </li>
            <li> My legs are wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li> We were really surprised when it worked so good.</li>
            <li> I had planned on getting my skin to a good enough point to wear foundation makeup, but I don&#x27;t need to any more.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to use it right after you shower and while your skin is still wet</li>
            <li> tomorrow I could wake up with a major breakout, but so far, I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> sink.&lt;br /&gt;Within just a couple or three days or so, the top of my right hand had a significant rash, and I immediately stopped using this lotion, wondering whether this lotion had caused it, or fearing that I might be having a reaction to a medication.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The hydroxy component leaves the skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> My primary care physician recommended this because she was pretty sure I&#x27;d like it.  </li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite lotion!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best stuff for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I have never been able to be that consistent with it</li>
            <li> I got this originally for keratosis pilaris on my arms about 6 months ago</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does contain alpha-hydroxy acid, so if you use it on skin that will be in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen since the acid leaves you more sensitive to UV light.</li>
            <li> the Amlactin had my arms smooth, soft &amp; lovely!  </li>
            <li> After that subsides skin tone is much more even and redness associated with irritation is either much lessened or gone!</li>
            <li> This is great, as long as I don&#x27;t use it full-strength.  </li>
            <li> After applying this 2x per day for a week I see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> one I am happy to incorporate as long as it works.</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased this after hearing from a dermatologist that it would help treat my Acanthosis Nigricans (I have PCOS and AN</li>
            <li> significantly reduces Keratosis pilaris, as well as any body acne.  </li>
            <li> However, it is worth it for the results!</li>
            <li> I had more pimples pop up after the first couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excited to see what it does for them.  </li>
            <li> I have been using AmLactin 12% for 24 years (I originally used it in prescription form).</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it and it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The smell is okay..somewhat pleasant because it&#x27;s not too LOUD unless you apply it right under your nose</li>
            <li> Not the best smell, and a little greasy but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Great for dry knees and elbows too.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry, alligator skin.</li>
            <li> Great lotion if you have dry skin like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it with great success when I remember to use it regularly!  </li>
            <li> If Amlactin would clean up their products, I&#x27;d be a faithful user.  </li>
            <li> Great for really dry skin</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything special for me.  </li>
            <li> (whoever said that before was the one who convinced me and she was right!)</li>
            <li> Since I started using this on my face, all of my blemishes have cleared up and right now I have no blemishes at all!  </li>
            <li> It is very effective though for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> The product is very effective on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I spent so much money on lotions and this one is the best so the cost was worth it.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing Lotion - my doctor recommended this product for rough feet</li>
            <li> Once it was, I used different creams but they didn&#x27;t do much good.</li>
            <li> lotion is fairly pricey, around $22-25 a bottle, but you get a BIG 20z bottle!</li>
            <li> However, you don&#x27;t need much of it to spread over affected parts, in my case most of my body.</li>
            <li> Have been using this lotion for over a year, does a good job, and Amazon has a lower price then the local stores.</li>
            <li> Any suggestions for better options for face cream would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> Even after a full day, I can&#x27;t get over it.</li>
            <li> This AmLactin seems okay for the rest of the body, but again, I don&#x27;t really care for the chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Nothing really made it better.</li>
            <li> This really works better than I ever imagined</li>
            <li> Really embarrasing when your hands are more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; than your man&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is particularly good for the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; I used to get on the backs of my arms and upper thighs.  </li>
            <li> Not for sensitive noses - it makes me feel kind of nauseous.</li>
            <li> Good enough but not quite as advertised.</li>
            <li> A good product; however I do not use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s NOT a chemical smell; it&#x27;s simply a true fragrance-free product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and can&#x27;t say enough about how good it is.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> He said his back hasn&#x27;t looked this good since 5th grade.</li>
            <li> Some have said ammonia which is true</li>
            <li> The odor is not nearly as bad as some people claim.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad and I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great dry skin lotion!!</li>
            <li> within about 2-3 weeks (which is SUPER fast for KP) and the bumps on my arm are almost gone, too (they&#x27;re more stubborn as I&#x27;ve had them for decades).  </li>
            <li> It moisturises amazingly and most importantly, the itching my daughter used to experience due to dryness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not goin to say that it&#x27;s the best thing out there for dry skin, but this may be the most affordable therapeutic lotion for dry skin so that work s for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong stuff.  </li>
            <li> This was a great buy for my KP and other skin issues (some leftover hyperpigmentation, ingrown hairs, etc).  </li>
            <li> When I first used this lotion I thought it was working fine.</li>
            <li> I do find that if I skip a couple of days without putting it on that the bumps quickly return.</li>
            <li> I may add , that you may need to use a mild loofah once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I wasn&#x27;t sure if this stuff was helping or hurting at first, I thought I&#x27;d include a log of how this stuff works (which I looked for when I first started using it).</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s sold --- her hands cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li> works well, super lotion</li>
            <li> Love love this lotion, I thought I would be forever plagued with bumpy skin especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li> but I figured if it works good it would be worth it since lotion is something that last awhile.</li>
            <li> has reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li> This is a great product though I recommend it to be used only on areas that you really need it.</li>
            <li> I have mild Keratosis Pilaris on my thighs and after applying this nightly for a month they&#x27;ve visibly reduced.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> Decent, still has to be something better out there.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub in super well though.  </li>
            <li> They exfoliate quickly but without the flaking.</li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds of high-end and affordable body lotions and finally found favorite one.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to get mild hyperkeratinization.</li>
            <li> I am going to go back to using Aveeno since its cheap and effective for all over body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a mild form of ichthyosis which creates a &#x27;scaling&#x27; on my legs.</li>
            <li> I guess the magic is in the high amount of lactic acid.</li>
            <li> I LOVE AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Lotions that smell nice generally don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for LESS THAN A WEEK, and have seen a great improvement.  </li>
            <li> May work great for others just not for me and especially during winter time when my skin is drier than normal.</li>
            <li> The skin remains moisturized for a long time and for best result it should be applied twice daily.</li>
            <li> good lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> AmLactin 12%  Moisturizing Lotion  is good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Good Morning America to tighten skin on arms and legs and help with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST lotion I have ever used, and there are not many that I haven&#x27;t tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mentioned my skin is VERY dry, and although this lotion has a nice consistency and smooths on easily, it just doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin and many products bother me.  </li>
            <li> I literally bought another bottle two weeks into my first bottle for fear of the company discontinuing this stuff!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I look for more of a remedy-type lotion than a nice smell girly cream that doesn&#x27;t do much in the long run.  </li>
            <li> It works really fast!!</li>
            <li> and it does EXACTLY what it is promoted as doing !</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, they both absorbed fast without feeling tacky or greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries quickly for a non-greasy very soothing finish.  </li>
            <li> but luckily AmLactin nips that right in the butt and makes retin-a not so sucky.</li>
            <li> I discovered AmLactin last year and the first bottle cleared my legs 80%!!!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed by how quickly it worked when I had been using other lotions that still hadn&#x27;t done the trick after several weeks of repeated use.</li>
            <li> But this is really the most accurate way I can describe this product and what it&#x27;s done for me, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my skin besides make it smooth.</li>
            <li> Really helps my hands in the winter it is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly, though, the softness of my legs was undeniable, even after several hours and overnight.</li>
            <li> It really helps to smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin very  supple and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Even after one use the lotion did make my skin feel smooth and silky, but the smell was too much for me to deal with</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Once your symptoms clear you may be able to use it once a day instead.</li>
            <li> The lotion takes its time to get absorbed in the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While they don&#x27;t recommend using this, I have when I didn&#x27;t have my face ointment available and the results are usually better than my RX facial ointment.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to write a review about this product because I want everyone to think my skin just naturally looks this fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and really works, but you have to use it regularly for optimum results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Kind of a no brainier but as you constantly have \\&quot;new\\&quot; skin now its easier to burn&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use an essential oil, rose lavender, ginger.</li>
            <li> will say this product gives good results for softening and smoothing rough patches and skin</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t nearly as fun as buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion is worth the price</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> And have never really felt like i&#x27;ve gotten a good deal on it.</li>
            <li> They are baby soft :)</li>
            <li> The minimal fragrance, and fast absorption means I can apply the lotion and great dressed almost immediately after.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin and an elaborate routine for my face)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totoally worth it.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Though it can sting a bit when applied over freshly shaven skin it keeps irritation and razor bumps away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve delayed/avoided doing many chores/other things, to prevent need for frequent hand-washing.&lt;br /&gt;Reading</li>
            <li> I am a 86 year old man, drove a truck most of my work life and now my HANDS  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I now get COMPLIMENTS on how nice my skin is (especially my legs!).</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> just started to use it, so far it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m oovy groovy and use more natural products the rest of the year.</li>
            <li> Love this, keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any issue with my skin, and was told many times that my skin is soft anyway, but after using this lotion my skin feels noticeably smoother and softer after one use.</li>
            <li> I showed him how soft and silky my skin stays when I use it after showering:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that within a month or two, it will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> This lotion was first recommend to me by my dermatologist to help with my mild KP.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells funky but that fades pretty quickly, and yes it burns like the dickens if you put it on immediately after shaving.  </li>
            <li> but as others have said it disappears pretty quickly and can be covered with perfume.  </li>
            <li> I used to not be able to grow hair on my DRY legs, now they&#x27;re full of hair!  </li>
            <li> would have given it 5 stars except it doesn&#x27;t smell so great--\\&quot;mediciny\\&quot; is a good description some other reviewers have shared.  </li>
            <li> put it on after you shower or right before you get into bed.</li>
            <li> I came on Amazon and found this, ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> I put it on right before going to bed</li>
            <li> Arrived right when it said it would.</li>
            <li> right after you towel off after your shower-</li>
            <li> There is some alcohol in the formulation so it stings a bit if I put it on right after shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything right from doctor&#x27;s prescribed stuff to home remedies and nothing worked out.</li>
            <li> RIGHT BEFORE I SLEEP)</li>
            <li> I think that, for me, AmLactin provides the right amount of cell turnover to keep those blemishes from forming.  </li>
            <li> I developed some small bumps on my arms over the summer and this lotion worked great!  </li>
            <li> I am so thrilled to finally find something that so quickly &amp; easily got completely rid of the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator with along with this, and really only had skin peel off from my feet (top and bottom).  </li>
            <li> But very sensitive or allergic people might find it too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try it for another week and see if it gets better, but so far I would say this stuff is nowhere near as good as a simple body lotion from Cerave or Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too strong for their sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not terrible pain but a slight tingling sensation and wayyyy more tolerable than blisters or bleeding cracks.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face was dry to point of cracking, and after we moved to an incredibly humid place, it was red, itchy, and peeling ALL THE TIME.</li>
            <li> A great product I&#x27;ve been using for years that does wonders for the dry areas of my skin - silky soft.</li>
            <li> I am a beauty addict, and product junkie and have tried many moisturizer options for my slightly crepey skin (mostly back-of-hands, lower arms, chest and neck areas).  </li>
            <li> The company was very gracious in refunding me my full amount I paid for them.</li>
            <li> The smell is medicinal when first applied and mellows out after it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li> Try it, I think it&#x27;s worth the money and will absolutely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> so not sure how great it is.  </li>
            <li> I think it has helped some with the KP, I use another exfolient in the shower first then this lotion right after and they seem to be helping with the KP.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought I took a bath in pure ammonia!</li>
            <li> Way better than regular lotion, worth the money.</li>
            <li> You will burn super fast.</li>
            <li> It is quick absorbing and keeps</li>
            <li> When I saw reviews stating that it was too medicine scent strong, I thought the reviewer was too sensitive to scent.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and this brand is what my dermatologist recommended I&#x27;ve use this for many years, makes your body feel soft and very well protected</li>
            <li> The acid sloughs off dead skin and leaves your skin so nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice a smell per se and it absorbs pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> So  I figured my skin was just too sensitive for this product, so i gave the rest to my mother who has normal non sensitive skin, at first she too also loved it  </li>
            <li> Best out the doc recommend this, wow, no work dry skin if used daily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks, about every other day after I shower, and it has noticeably helped, clearing up the redness and making my skin so much more smooth.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, (my mother used to call it &amp;#34;redheaded&amp;#34; skin) and this works fine for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After much research on lotion that can help soothe skin from chlorine and salt water (avid swimmer) I read that this lotion does the trick - and it does!  </li>
            <li> As a black woman with extremely dry skin (except for my oily face) this is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in my area, and I was happy to find this product on your site.</li>
            <li> AmLactin is pretty much all body lotion except on lips and in certain more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done anything else as far as toning or working out, just using the lotion and noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> It was exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> It covers mostly my legs, buttocks, and backside of my upper arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would have to go to the dermatologist to get a topical steroid to help with that.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this soft or smooth.</li>
            <li> The result is smoothness - like butter in the hot sun smoothness.</li>
            <li> AmLactin is not a cure for the currently incurable ichtheosis, but it&#x27;s the best over the counter thing out there.</li>
            <li> Now I use it regularly and even though I love to go for my pedis</li>
            <li> For the first time in 10 years I have found something that helps my KP.  </li>
            <li> When you first start using , you have a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> I got on amazon one day and typed in, &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; and the first item that appeared on the page was Amlactin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s is the first time in 20 years</li>
            <li> With the first time applying it, it was instantaneous in improving my skin.</li>
            <li> again!My hands are soft and smooth and I never get hang nails.</li>
            <li> no fake and bake.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have my go-to lotion at the drug store, and there were a bunch of tourists that wouldn&#x27;t move out of the lotion aisle, so I grabbed the first unscented thing I saw.</li>
            <li> Ten years went by and even years after I refused to put more poison on my face, I hadn&#x27;t recovered.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it enough to see any effects because I don&#x27;t even want to wear it at home.</li>
            <li> I have to say, at first, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Now I grab it first.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff except for one really BIG problem.  </li>
            <li> First let me say that I did not purchase this lotion from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent of this lotion, but it worked really well</li>
            <li> /&gt;To maintain your newly soft and smooth skin, you might also consider using a non-comedogenic cleanser/body wash like Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> And, ultimately, my hair was winning.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for several years and am totally satisfied with its results.</li>
            <li> you have never used it before, it might sting for a bit when you first put it on, but that goes away.  </li>
            <li> It is tingly at first, but you get used to it</li>
            <li> healthy radiant skin will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different creams and lotions in my search for a product that would do more than simply grease me up.</li>
            <li> After searching around I found this product first at Costco and tried it out as I was going to get married soon and was going to wear a strapless dress.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was back for more in minutes.</li>
            <li> Most likely allergic to something in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty greasy and for keratosis I tend to use a lot.</li>
            <li> : First day, Khiel&#x27;s Razor Bump Relief.</li>
            <li> I have had keratosis pelaris for years, mostly on my arms, and my doctor recommended a similar lotion.  </li>
            <li> Better price than stores plus bigger.</li>
            <li> In patient care, the back rub should be uses more often.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and clear, and the product does not burn when I put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100% gone, but pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I think I hadn&#x27;t given it a proper chance when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> Come winter, I&#x27;m pretty screwed.</li>
            <li> I decided to try to AmLactin first and have been blown away by the results on my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll use this up first</li>
            <li> At the same time, I also purchases Cera Ve and love that.</li>
            <li> It makes my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, know my sister uses it too!&lt;br /&gt;The alpha-hydroxy therapy makes all the difference for me personally.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit runny, not thick, but it does restore the skin to a nice, non-greasy, moist-feel-to-the-touch with regular use.  </li>
            <li> It actually works my skin has gotten better than it was</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly to improve the bumps on the back of my arms.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s helped fade my old light colored stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had moisturizers that just didn&#x27;t help eczema before, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve come across that</li>
            <li> First of all, a lotion that must be shaken before use?</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> , my skin is soooo smooth, My kp dark dots are still there, maybe i need to way a bit more...</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for skin that is unable to retain moisture.  </li>
            <li> at first.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle now and love this product.  </li>
            <li> I used to be an avid sun-worshipper</li>
            <li> This does not have a pretty smell (at all).  </li>
            <li> After FIRST day of using this lotion I immediately noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> But now that I&#x27;ve tried it first hand</li>
            <li> works well, nice that it is not very scented</li>
            <li> Wish they could make it smell pretty js</li>
            <li> A soothing balm and modern miracle!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this in a big size.</li>
            <li> I would have to check back with a review as time goes by in order to give more information.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently and saw no improvements.</li>
            <li> online searched through many sites and finally I decided to try AMLACTIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it smells like ammonia when you first apply it -</li>
            <li> I first applied this to my feet then wore socks to bed.  </li>
            <li> Really helped improve my keratosis pilaris on my arms and thighs!</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m gladly slathering it head-to-toe twice daily.</li>
            <li> This lotion has pretty much eradicated my arm bumps after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I was only able to apply AmLactin 12% Moisturizing Lotion once because I couldn&#x27;t stand the ammonia smell.  </li>
            <li> I am an absolute believer!  </li>
            <li> Not only did they deliver it before the expected time, the product works great right away.</li>
            <li> but I really could care less because it has given me beautiful clear skin...</li>
            <li> None have come close to Amlactin for greatly reducing my dry skin, especially on my heels.</li>
            <li> It is Great for anyone with dry, itchy, skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Having suffered with dry, flaky skin on the bottom of my feet, blisters, and cracking heels, I can attest to what a joy it is to get some almost instant relief from these conditions.</li>
            <li> Skip right over everything else in the drugstore and go straight for the AmLactin.</li>
            <li> and you know all the other amazing things that ive stated.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it immediately and purchased a humidifier; it helped a lot, so now my skin is silky smooth and my KP is back to being barely visible :)</li>
            <li> That said, I do live in the desert, so my needs are a little more than most folks.  </li>
            <li> at least feels more healthy.</li>
            <li> Most lotions don&#x27;t do much for my skin and this one was no different.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and rubs in quickly and helps relieve dry skin immediately almost.</li>
            <li> Amlactin is the only one which made my skin look and feel good for an entire 24 hour period.</li>
            <li> For the first time in his life his KP is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion but kind of expensive</li>
            <li> My dermatologist actually recommended this as a good overall lotion.</li>
            <li> I was AMAZED at how quickly it helped the KP on my legs, it disappeared (almost completely!)</li>
            <li> but I did see SOME positive results and still use as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 4 days, the bumps on my knees are almost gone, then I decided to try this out because it&#x27;s cheaper and a lot of people gave it positive reviews.</li>
            <li> A few days in and most of the problems have mostly cleared up, and my feet feel much better, and I am less embarrassed by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> particularly like the convenience of having it delivered right to my door when I order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> But on other days, it gently exfoliates my skin, keeps it nice a moisturized, and prevents ingrown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried pretty much everything to no avail.</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet and pretty much all over.  </li>
            <li> many of these reviews, I have not seen any mention of how long it took for others to recover from rashes caused by this Amlactin</li>
            <li> I have had keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms and legs for pretty much my whole life.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the lotion it seemed very runny.  </li>
            <li> So far the areas I&#x27;ve used it on have had no bad reactions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first use he could tell a difference and within just a few days he was good as new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They should have &amp;#34;SUN ALERT&amp;#34; written in large red print on the top of the front and backsides of this bottle, rather than barely mentioning it last thing in tiny print on the lower backside of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been several days now, and the rash has not yet improved at all, despite my avoidance of putting ANY kind of lotion on it, and hardly touching the backside of my hand with infrequent use of Cetaphil mild hand soap.  </li>
            <li> My skin is now super duper silky soft</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years to help with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite lotion for exceptionally dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended the product to some friends with dry hands and they also love it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The dry skin is actually more like scales or leopard or giraffe spots.  </li>
            <li> When my skin is so dry it hurts, this speeds recovery better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using Amlactin every day or two just in the areas where my skin tends to be the most dry and where the KP tends to pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the odor goes away within 10 minutes or so, you can also place a scented cream on top once it&#x27;s dry to cover up the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She said Amlactin was better for my dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better even though I don&#x27;t have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have the most severe dry skin I have ever encountered on anybody.</li>
            <li> I have problems with my legs being dry, scaly and the more</li>
            <li> The urea smell is only strong for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still the same benefits, but without the strong Amlactin odor.</li>
            <li> This is an effective moisturizer and is unscented, which I really appreciate since I use a little bit of a scented lotion on my lower arms and chest (just because I like to smell pretty).</li>
            <li> It is a large bottle</li>
            <li> If you like it, then order the large amount from Amazon.</li>
            <li> my opinion, this is a great lotion and well worth the cost as well as the few minor cons.</li>
            <li> Often will sting due to high -- effective AHA content.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for skin that has KP, is rough or extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> It is more of a challenge to keep the bumps down in the winter time, but I guess I could apply it more regularly too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the strong chemical smell too much, but ultimately no results, despite the glowing reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> cream also works well on rough skin like feet, literally makes your feet super smooth in the summer when you&#x27;re walking around in your flip flops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> regimenThis product worked much better and was much easier than applying BP and waiting for it to dry and then putting on a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my KP and dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> but it certainly does it&#x27;s job and fast.</li>
            <li> Then the shedding begins--the inside of my clothes become a flaky mess for about 2 weeks while AmLactin works its magic, but then my skin normalizes and becomes smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Can be a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li> and it does my arms a little red, but overall I&#x27;m impressed with it.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dermatologist for the bumps on her upper arms, and it really helps smooth things out.  </li>
            <li> Once heels are smooth, application every few days will be sufficient for maintaining smooth heels.  </li>
            <li> If you stop using the cream for a few weeks, the bumps come back as it&#x27;s not a cure, however it&#x27;s a great treatment.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; not in pieces.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast</li>
            <li> I use a much creamier, moisturizing lotion on the days I shave.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it much so</li>
            <li> This was a real winner.</li>
            <li> really REALLY gets in there and stays there.</li>
            <li> It does everything she said it would; I had not used any lotion on my feet for a whole week</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very watery</li>
            <li> my whole life on and off and</li>
            <li> the results provided are absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sent some to my Mom and she has had the same fantastic experience.  </li>
            <li> I figured this could not be acne and finally went a dermatologist who confirmed it was keratosis pilaris, which then caused acne like issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really notice it and it does go a way after its fully absorbed...so</li>
            <li> --if you try to apply too much of this lotion at once it won&#x27;t soak in very well.</li>
            <li> This works very well on my X-linked ichthyosis.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hope.</li>
            <li> I felt hopeful, but tried not to put too much stock into it.</li>
            <li> : Woke up very flaky, but after I washed my face</li>
            <li> My blemishes were healing fast.</li>
            <li> Absolutely unusable.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve used religiously for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> the skin feels sooo much smoother.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very chemical smell on my skin until I shower it off.</li>
            <li> It really does heal your skin.</li>
            <li> I like to use it before bed (after a shower) to really let it soak into my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no addicted to this lotion.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you how much this lotion has helped me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really wanting it work, so I plan on sticking with it until I use it all up.</li>
            <li> The texture was sort of watery, but really helped with the KP, and I started using it everywhere</li>
            <li> really like this lotion, even for the price.</li>
            <li> Within a week, the skin on my arms is much smoother.  </li>
            <li> use it for a couple weeks straight before you judge it.</li>
            <li> Once it got to that point, I only had to use it two or three times a week, once a day, to maintain the smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Amlactin is the real</li>
            <li> But Iwasn&#x27;t saving much.</li>
            <li> No one wants to sell their cat.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> Today my husband helped me apply AmLactin on my whole body</li>
            <li> Like putting straight chemical on your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amlactin.</li>
            <li> Im not going to tell you not to buy it but dont get your hopes up too much because it may not work for you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t really focus on the benefits it could give.</li>
            <li> I have always had keratosis on my arms, with this I FINALLY have smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Although I used the whole bottle, I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> All of my skin (even non-KP affected) is much, much smoother and silkier now that I started using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my SO really likes it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I will buy and use this product for years to come, no matter how much it costs.</li>
            <li> This really helps to even out tone and make my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> I like Amlactin because it has no fragrance and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> I have PCOS on my legs &amp; arms and this lotion didn&#x27;t help it much.</li>
            <li> This really works well for my skin.</li>
            <li> For me it was very sticky....</li>
            <li> I really did not see any difference with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> My skin is definitely much softer</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does work very well, and I have not complaints about it.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY DOES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really works on me...</li>
            <li> But not now, thanks to this God Sent lotion from heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now I really see a noticeable skin difference.</li>
            <li> It works but keep it out of your mouth as it tastes real bad&lt;br</li>
            <li> much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I scratched so much without noticing until I saw my legs at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was having very itchy and irritated skin on my arms and legs to the point</li>
            <li> Used a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> I cannot fully express how much this lotion has saved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps with my KP.</li>
            <li> but nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about one month and have really noticed a reduction in the keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes well but hasn&#x27;t really done much for the issue.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel very silky and does help to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Really helps with my KP (keratosis pilaris)</li>
            <li> It really has helped my skin, but I can&#x27;t get over the ammonia scent it leaves on my hands..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it but haven&#x27;t seen too much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> It smells very clearn.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me that much at all.</li>
            <li> very watery.</li>
            <li> so this is really helpful for that.</li>
            <li> it makes my eyes water and my whole bathroom reeks for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and deeply moisturized!</li>
            <li> the skin on my hands looks much healthier and is no longer cracked and bleeding.  </li>
            <li> forward to my late twenties when I got a good job</li>
            <li> My own dermatologist said get this stuff for my dried out elbows.</li>
            <li> Metaderm (made it worse), Aveeno oatmeal baths (undecided on whether or not this helps), Aquaphor (good to put on top of steroids as a moisturizer, but does not help the actual eczema), and Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight odor (really not bad and dissipates quickly) and can leave your skin a bit sticky, but it works!</li>
            <li> I have tried others in the past and this one is by far the best that I have tried for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m relatively pleased with the product, if in time I notice a major improvement in my chicken skin, I will happily give 5 stars as nothing else has cured it.</li>
            <li> At first, it felt a little \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, but my face really did feel (and look) better.  </li>
            <li> I use this lotion along with Tree Hut&#x27;s original shea body butter as my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the product, originally, to moisturize my face after working out and showering at the gym.  </li>
            <li> but like some other lotions better for all day comfort.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I use to have to have this lotion prescribed to me from my dermatologist  due to my eczema.</li>
            <li> at first I was using my facial product but have actually found it looks better using this.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other product that I have used on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed a great improvement and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have other lotions that seem to help my skin more.  </li>
            <li> (I hope that&#x27;s normal!?)  </li>
            <li> After the first day I saw improvement, second day the red, blotchy skin was replaced by healthy, even coloration.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review products, but I have to say that this lotion has made a world of a difference for me!  </li>
            <li> This product worked better than any other treatment that was tried.</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased a similar lotion at a well known drugstore</li>
            <li> others have mentioned, it helps to let your skin dry after showering before you apply this, otherwise it takes much longer to absorb and kind of creates a white film.</li>
            <li> In fact, all of my skin is so soft and feels better than it&#x27;s been for a long time and all the bumps are gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very moisturizing, I would highly recommended this.</li>
            <li> This lotion will do amazing things for your dry skin, starting after just one application.  </li>
            <li> This product worked effectively on Keratosis pilaris (Dry, slightly red, bumpy skin).</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smooth -- not greasy -- and I was amazed at how long my skin stays moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Personally I would have preferred some sweet smell in it.</li>
            <li> First of, I&#x27;m 29 years old and always thought I had &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; on my bum... and used all types of over the counter acne medication</li>
            <li> and I finally had a full night sleep yesterday.</li>
            <li> For the first time my skin cleared up and was normally soft.</li>
            <li> but so far no ill effects.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, for the first time, my husband commented on my soft skin.  </li>
            <li> By now I have nearly used the entire bottle, probably 3/4 or more of it during my time of &amp;#34;religious use.&amp;#34; The backs of my arms are FAR softer, though they are still a bit red/splotchy.</li>
            <li> Amylactin takes it to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so there is no seductive packaging, no subtle scent, but who cares!  </li>
            <li> In a week my feet were like new!</li>
            <li> I like that the consistency is thinner with this lotion which allows you to use less to cover more, resulting in cost savings.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown skin that was too dry and developing light spots.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can order it and have it in 2 days or less.</li>
            <li> I use this product a couple of times a week to get rid of dry skin on my feet and keep them feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Eucerin and had decent results.</li>
            <li> my heels and back of ankles are soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Way better price on amazon than in store, it&#x27;s the same price for a smaller bottle at wal-mart.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it has a bit of a funky scent, but it absorbs quickly and the smell disappears.</li>
            <li> I believe this is another key factor in my skin acting better this year.</li>
            <li> really lucky finding this product last year on a clearance shelf.</li>
            <li> I have a moderate case of keratosis Pilaris on the backs of my arms (and an extremely mild case on the backs of my thighs).</li>
            <li> My skin STILL feels soft and smooth hours later, WITHOUT any LOtion.</li>
            <li> If you decide to try this on your face, test it in a small area first to make sure that your skin can take it.  </li>
            <li> And even when shaken the consistency, while very light, almost milky, seems a little pasty when applied.  </li>
            <li> Working fine on my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty excited about the results so far and plan on continuing use even after the bumps completely disappear, just for maintenance (cut back to 2 or 3 times a week then).</li>
            <li> I originally bought this lotion to help with a very stubborn patch of eczema on my leg, but to my surprise, it has also helped with my dry heels!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a mild case of Ichthyosis vulgaris, but by using this lotion religiously, my skin feels almost normal.  </li>
            <li> I have witness a change in my skin and high levels of moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amlactin does smell HIGHLY medicated, and it does irritate my nose.</li>
            <li> This is a highly recommended (by dermatologists and skin care specialists) moisturizer for your body.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter this winter do to the high winds and freezing</li>
            <li> The price was a bit high</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this body lotion with AHA&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend spot testing this stuff before you spread it all over your body.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to those with KP</li>
            <li> Once again, personally I really should&#x27;ve reconsidered purchasing this product from the start because NATURAL is always the most beneficial when it comes to heeling psychologically, BUT in this case physically.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with this skin condition.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, especially for rough, dry heels/feet.  </li>
            <li> I could actually take off my clothes in a pool or hot tub and not feel the staring eyes of people!</li>
            <li> I was preparing to seek a dermatologist&#x27;s help prior to trying Amlactin, but it has really helped my skin!!  </li>
            <li> ENTIRE BODY!I had dry, rough, cracking heals and it turned into \\&quot;I just got a pedicure\\&quot; kind of soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> So when I read the reviews about this lotion I was anxious to try it because I had never heard of it, my dermotologist at the time certainly didn&#x27;t recommend it, he recommended using Cetaphil products which are okay.  </li>
            <li> Also I have significant redness and extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> As a teenager, I just thought this was something I had to live with until I got older.</li>
            <li> The bottle you can get from Amazon is huge and will last a while, plus it is a better value than the stores near me which sell small bottles for $14 dollars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not messy or real greasy like some lotions of this type.</li>
            <li> Really helps my skin stay soft as it exfoliates and hydrates.</li>
            <li> Aside from the weird &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I use a great face moisturizer for my face, but it was so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, in fact, my skin is very tolerant.</li>
            <li> While it does leave my skin feeling soft, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in the texture or reduction of KP bumps.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t completely gone, but is much improved with softer, smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Imagine my surprise when after a long day, I come home and realized my skin was as soft and smooth as the morning when I put this lotion on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I was so blown away with this lotion I had to.</li>
            <li> I started retin-a recently and the flakey skin bit really isn&#x27;t fun...</li>
            <li> I am a normal person.</li>
            <li> However, it is well worth every penny and the extra drive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what ever became of my old standby, but this seems to be the same thing only better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old male with (what I believe is) KP on my thighs, butt, and lower back for most of my life.</li>
            <li> It does smell like ammonia, but it mostly goes away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy it in the bigger bottle since I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the smell or ammonia (I know that not it), but it does go away pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> It tingles when you apply it on normal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you are suffering with any of the aforementioned skin conditions.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product that moisturizes for the whole day.</li>
            <li> The first use, I&#x27;d recommend having at least a couple hours to let it set; after using it a couple times, though, it absorbs faster--in about 15-20 minutes (probably because it&#x27;s repaired the top level of skin).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Slightly pricey compared to normal lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally apply this after taking a shower at night or before getting dressed in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter, has been struggling with red, bumpy skin (can&#x27;t remember the medical term used), for many years now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done more for my skin in a few days than salicylic acid did in... ever.</li>
            <li> It is hydrated, no dry patches, absorbs great, does not have an ordor, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My KP never really bothered me before (very light, looks more like little freckles only on my arms) until two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I am a 29-year-old male with mild adult acne.</li>
            <li> Or should I say: I WAS a 29-year-old male with mild adult acne.</li>
            <li> Right after you take a shower and after you smother on some Amlactin, within 10 minutes you&#x27;ll only smell the soap you used on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this on my left arm and leg and the Aveeno on my right arm and leg.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day, right after my shower, because it does leave you kinda sticky.  </li>
            <li> This cream is very effective against my troubled skin.</li>
            <li> I have used 2-3 times so far and have not seen any clearing of the bumps but the lotion is incredibly thick and seems to work great as a moisturizer as I only have to apply once after showering and my skin stays soft for two or three days even after showering without re-applying.</li>
            <li> At first I only used it on the areas that are affected by the KP, but after feeling how soft my skin was after just one or two applications I started using it on my whole body.  </li>
            <li> As I grew up I just learned to live with it and accept it as a part of my life.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I have new skins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AmLactin works by exfoliating the outer-most skin layers boosting your skin&#x27;s cellular turnover rate all the while moisturizing your new skin.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I ran out of it and purchased a couple of new tubes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
            <li> Now I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a new, permanent condition.  </li>
            <li> I live on the desert and my skin itches at times</li>
            <li> I absolutely live by this lotion now.</li>
            <li> this lotion is really good for slight exfoliation/brightening/holding in moisture and helping enhance other beauty prodct</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this cream as good as other lotions on the market for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this about twice daily, following it with St. Ives Naturally Smooth Oatmeal &amp; Shea Butter moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and smoothes dry scaley skin.</li>
            <li> also have KP on my legs and upper arms, but it doesn&#x27;t really help much for that, in my case.  </li>
            <li> The key to this lotion is that it really is the only product over the counter that turns over skin cell production quickly.</li>
            <li> Treats super dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin, ALL my LIFE, had been SUPER dry, and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> , my skin is very sensitive and I used to get razor bumps on my underarms and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I am using too help with  skin condition and it is leaving my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite, I don&#x27;t usually use body lotions</li>
            <li> I went online to try and find a product that wld help with my super duper scaly dry skin, that&#x27;s when I found Amlactin!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Completely unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> WOW had no idea it would solve my body acne!</li>
            <li> The rest of my body stays soft, and I never have flaky skin anymore!</li>
            <li> At first she said that only the packaging had changed.  </li>
            <li> Makes it so soft!</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on his skin, he screamed &amp;#34;OW, OW, OW!&amp;#34; and cried for several minutes after I&#x27;d finished.  </li>
            <li> Having a pump on the bottle, I responded that for my hands I usually keep a pump bottle at each sink and more places.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Not sure what caused this to happen, but my KP spread all over my legs and became a lot more noticeable on my arms.</li>
            <li> I somehow got some on my upper chest the first day</li>
            <li> they were that soft!</li>
            <li> I put it on first thing in the am and last thing at night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not use this cream on young children!</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s not a deadly burn, just the normal pain</li>
            <li> Upon my first use of AmLactin I feel immediate relief (and a tiny sting).</li>
            <li> Today, I actually skipped putting on the lotion, and no ill effects.</li>
            <li> may be kissing your significant other, specifically on the face or neck.</li>
            <li> This is working better on my thighs than my arms (not sure why).  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ll keep using it as it&#x27;s better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> I did shake it the first day without issue; I forgot to shake it the second day, and I noticed an ammonia smell.  </li>
            <li> So if you have dry skin put this on after your shower or bath-no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> After about 4 weeks of steady use, AmLactin 12% has made a very noticeable improvement in overall skin texture.  </li>
            <li> Really softens skin, but the smell made me feel like I was back in my high school chem lab.</li>
            <li> Using Amlactin twice daily has improved my skin more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kind of hard in the summer, so beware!</li>
            <li> , it does really works well, it heals dry skin, it is very essential to have it against dry or aging problems or for treating itchy damaged skin, its very light and not greasy, i like also treat scars and i like its sense,</li>
            <li> I have also had success getting rid of dry, scaly skin on my feet as well.</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry scaly elbows with success.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin soft at first, then I started to get red itchy spots.</li>
            <li> The positive effects, however, last ALL day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic for psoriasis, eczema, extremely rough, dry skin.</li>
            <li> had moderate acne which I more or less kept under control using acne.orgs</li>
            <li> So, as I saw in other reviews, you pretty much can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> Protect that skin if you are going outside after because they are not kidding when they say that your skin is a little more susceptible to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little bumps are noticeably reduced and the actual texture of my skin is getting better on my neck as well.</li>
            <li> It works super well, but it&#x27;s not exactly all natural which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this lotion after my shower at night, I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It is great lotion for the cold winter chaffing.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, I saw a huge difference in my KP within a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff takes what feels like forever to clear up KP</li>
            <li> I have used it two times, and it is clear that the bumps on the knees started to come back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that has really helped the bumps is just getting natural sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for these symptoms, from lotions to oils, and all of them provided only very temporary solutions, and even then never came close to completely clearing up the issues.</li>
            <li> Results were clearly seen within two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t a more commonly known product.</li>
            <li> (I was working out doors at the time) and a co-worker looked at my arms and said loudly, &amp;#34;oooh,</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a professional dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I had been suffering as a young teenager with keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> Smells like ammonia, but keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Fast forward ten years</li>
            <li> My feet are sooooo soft and my winter-time alligator legs must have gone south for the winter.</li>
            <li> I discontinued frequent use because I frequent the outdoors</li>
            <li> AmLactin and its sister product, LacHydrin, keep my skin soft and moisturized for days on end.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised by how well it worked when used twice a day.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely soft and the lotion doesn&#x27;t have any scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this lotion for my sensitive skin on my arms that was getting bumpy and agitated.</li>
            <li> The unexpected benefit is that my thumbs no longer split/crack in the winter from drying out (at the corner of the thumb-nail).  </li>
            <li> I developed a reaction to the acid in it.</li>
            <li> I rinse it completely off, scrubbing it as I rinse it, then apply lots of Amlactin, and my arms look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is much cheaper than local store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, but not a nice lotion smell.  </li>
            <li> Its gentle enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want my skin to be too sensitive</li>
            <li> So far, it has.</li>
            <li> Skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and was hoping for a lotion my skin could tolerate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel self conscious about wearing shorts this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over time it has even helped with old scars.  </li>
            <li> It has smoothed out all my skin and make my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Also use on my face and doesn&#x27;t break me out (really sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how photo sensitive it will be while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does make your skin sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> My skin is baby soft to the touch, my tone is evening out.  </li>
            <li> I will also say it is much cheaper at Amazon that my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it nearly as often as they say (twice a day) except when a therapeutic regimen seems called for, but when I need it it practically works miracles.  </li>
            <li> YOU ARE OLD...</li>
            <li> and I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And lastly, you are supposed to avoid too much sun on the area you are using it.  </li>
            <li> so I am hoping to see results soon as it adds an extra step to getting ready for the day or to go to bed...</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin really soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Not entirely 100% but enough that I definitely feel better about my overall appearance.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream at the drug store and after about 3 weeks of using it, my old arms were back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like a week after using it, my skin looks like it did when I was 20 years old.  </li>
            <li> Also makes you skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Its gives my skin the softness that last the whole day  +</li>
            <li> So much so that I actually have to put on perfume to cover it up.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin soft</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who has old looking skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get my money back too because I really didn&#x27;t want to pay 20 bucks for a bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING and came across this product by complete accident.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference after two weeks and my skin feels so soft this</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who developed a rash on neck and chest (though not anywhere else on her body) after a week&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 2 months of 3 day a week use, it&#x27;s almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> So far i haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> The generic is also great--it really helps skin stay moist, even in the desert.</li>
            <li> This product completely takes care of the problem.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for having such on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how soft my skin is when I use this product.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> And now its soft.</li>
            <li> and I felt overly conscious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read it helps even gets rid of the condition completely from the reviews</li>
            <li> My hands remain hydrated and soft even through the coldest weather.</li>
            <li> I needed a script a few years ago before it became available over the counter.</li>
            <li> No, the KP isn&#x27;t entirely gone, but my legs are much smoother and the darker spots seem to be lightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sensitive sense of smell, so</li>
            <li> nothing natural about this.</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t completely cured my KP</li>
            <li> My elbows are now as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, so I don&#x27;t even know what my bottom is soft as.</li>
            <li> that makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> My hands, elbows, feet and arms are wonderfully soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I seem to have a problem with shedding skin naturally</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and in just a week of use the goose pimply things on the back of my legs and arms are gone.  </li>
            <li> It will dissolve the top layer of dead skin and work its way DEEP INTO your skin, not just cover it up.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I try to use it more everyday it can help further.  </li>
            <li> will post an updated review after a few more weeks, but i couldn&#x27;t wait to share the results i&#x27;m getting after only 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It not only takes off the dead skin but moisturizes the layer underneath and it comes up healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> I apply the lotion thickly where needed and apply a layer of coconut oil on top of the lotion after it soaks in.</li>
            <li> Good buy for this expensive lotion</li>
            <li> recommend this product, it does take a few weeks to notice any affects and it doesn&#x27;t absorb right away but who really can complain about that if it clears your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took it upon myself to see a dermatologist and among many other creams and topical ointments, she recommended me Amlactin as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Improved my KP on my upper arms significantly as well along with proper exfoliation and use of sun screen prior to going into the sun!</li>
            <li> The other areas affected are showing healthy pink skin.  </li>
            <li> I recommend dry brushing first, then use this.</li>
            <li> STRONG chemical smell (like the smell of hair dye).&lt;br /&gt;- stings when you have small wounds like mosquito</li>
            <li> I will use it everyday forever with a smile!</li>
            <li> You get more for your money because a 17.6 oz bottle of AmLactin is never more than 24 dollars, and a 8 oz of the similar brand</li>
            <li> It would be a nice daily moisturizer for someone who just wants to keep their skin hydrated, but unfortunately it is too watery for me, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a lasting effect.</li>
            <li> I am a brown skinned African American woman and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I thought this would help or at least moisturize it good enough to where it would get even a tiny bit better, but it made my skin break out into itchy bumps which then aggravated the KP and made it worse.</li>
            <li> It still burned a little when I put the lotion on, but not horribly painfully so.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it smells a bit like hair bleach (after all it DOES have a high alpha hydroxy acid content), but once your skin absorbs it the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> I would put this up against any high dollar facial moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li> This preparation came highly recommended by different doctors but is not working that well for me</li>
            <li> If anyone else is having similar skin issues, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Few had issues with breakouts, few had problems with the residue, few needed more moisture, and most had ASHY issues.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a little more than twenty three dollars and Aveeno 18 ounce daily moisturizing lotion for just under ten dollars.</li>
            <li> Love this for those little red bumps on the upper arms -- UV rays will help with it, also, but if you are avoiding that, then this lotion works well.</li>
            <li> Wash your hands with soap afterward or you will bleach anything you touch, and make sure to let your skin dry a few moments before putting on clothing.</li>
            <li> All in all, I will NOT BUY again simply because it&#x27;s nothing special than any other lotion with tons of chemicals.</li>
            <li> It takes a small amount to give you smooth and moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> This thing will last me about two months in the winter (I use it about 2x every day for full body coverage) and 3-4 months in other seasons.</li>
            <li> Not flaky, not red and irritated, but just normal skin.</li>
            <li> My feet have crazy cuticles, lots of white, yet other lotion, pumice and more can&#x27;t keep them looking nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on lotions for my feet, and nothing compares to this!</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of using, my hands were back to normal.  </li>
            <li> The same large itchy red bump welts.</li>
            <li> After only a few days with AmLactin, we noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This lotion works really well in controlling the bumps and dry skin on the backs of my arms (Keratosis Pilaris).</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin that flakes very noticeably.</li>
            <li> This is a cream that really works on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect this to help my dry snake skin as much as it did.</li>
            <li> Bought on a suggestion from a dry skin forum, but it isn&#x27;t really doing it for me.</li>
            <li> Does very well moisturizing dry skin exacerbated by winter air.</li>
            <li> The AHA in this gently removes the dry skin while attracting moisture into your skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it once or twice a week all over, including my feet; it really helps with dry skin and KP.</li>
            <li> I dont like the smell much, but it disappears once dry.</li>
            <li> it really helps moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it really helps the dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I became very ashamed of my skin and simply didn&#x27;t talk about it even to my regular doctors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> It seemed like a different product; its consistency was much looser than it had been and it smelled different.</li>
            <li> I am 52 and have never really sunbathed too much so my skin was relatively soft anyway.</li>
            <li> Eventually, the red bumps were reduced and with a bit of natural tanning they are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> the red arm bumps on the backs of my arms).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this 2x daily for about 25 days straight</li>
            <li> Growing up in Florida, I spent far too much time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I am a 59 tear old male and my skin is moving to old man skin</li>
            <li> This is a tremendous product for removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> It will make your skin VERY soft in a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li> No other body moisturizer can compare.</li>
            <li> Even the next morning my lower legs are still soft and moisturized!  </li>
            <li> Other members of my family and myself saw many doctors and dermatologists, to little avail.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing the product and none of the people I knew enough to respect their opinion which is something I should&#x27;ve considered before purchasing a jar of chemicals OVER &amp;#34;ALL natural products&amp;#34; since our body is an organic system created to heal it self anyway!</li>
            <li> It also keeps my skin from becoming too dry in this harsh winter weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female with really dry, rough and huge  hands.</li>
            <li> So far this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My arm and legs which have the most KP are a lot clearer since I started using Amlactin due to the dead skin cells being dissolved away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pure Vitamin E cream in the past and it smells exactly the same, so don&#x27;t let this concern you.</li>
            <li> , so I mix equal parts of this, a 1% hydrocortsone lotion, and another dry skin moisturizer (D-ve Cream Oil for Extra Dry Skin) in my hands, then smooth it all over my itchy body.  </li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ve found that any lotion, or any soap, and even just water further irritates this rash.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this lotion caused it, and I highly suspect that the sunshine had further aggravated matters.</li>
            <li> But, one hugely positive thing I can say for it (other than getting rid of my bumps) is that this stuff has yet to discolor any of my towels or clothes.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> The first week it made my arms feel smooth and nice but slowly my arms started to react badly.</li>
            <li> Then a few days later I noticed huge red bulgy bumps!</li>
            <li> I am about 99.9% clear on my back and chest</li>
            <li> Only clear skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for months now and it seems to definitely have helped clear up the blemishes on my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a totally clear face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using it directly after shaving because it burns and makes the follicles red.</li>
            <li> It was very watery and didn&#x27;t do the job that I expected it to do on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it several weeks, it does make my skin soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with back acne that I struggle with as an adult.</li>
            <li> My skin is finally silky soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old white, european woman with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far Amazon is the only shelf I have found it on since.  </li>
            <li> , so far it has helped reduce the bumps on her stomach and the ones on her back have completely disappeared and hasn&#x27;t come back</li>
            <li> it was different and didn&#x27;t work at all, although it never ever worked anywhere near as well as the Amlactin does.  </li>
            <li> If I even just barely touched something, you could kiss it goodbye.  </li>
            <li> I have been applying twice a day for weeks, and have noticed in the last 2 weeks that an itchy rash developed on my arms.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, it may burn initially as it contains glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> Well, I am coming near the end of healing the second ulcer</li>
            <li> /&gt;I only have two complaints about the product: if your skin is quite sensitive, the product can sting on contact and there is a burning sensation afterward for 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried EVERYTHING for my keratosis pili, spent so much money</li>
            <li> It helps with overall skin texture, smoothing and making you feel soft after it fully absorbs.</li>
            <li> But one big warning - don&#x27;t apply any time near you</li>
            <li> She has tried other more expensive remedies but this works better than any other alternative.  </li>
            <li> By the time it dries, the smell is barely there.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li> This is my third day using it and my arms are almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> The tingling/burning sensation is a bit worse on  your face than body as your face is more sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> top was broken off the pump</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was reluctant to purchase it because of the price (poor college student), but I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others have said it will bleach clothing, I have not experienced this, but I&#x27;ve also rubbed it in fully before putting on clothes/ touching</li>
            <li> Not gone completely, but certainly made less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I used a bath &amp;#34;pouf&amp;#34; to gently exfoliate but never saw a huge difference, other than my skin being less dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but completely worth it!</li>
            <li> But...then...I had a big problem, a new burn, and I started to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> and it turned my rough keratosis pilaris patches into normal feeling skin!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It can create a slight burning sensation when first applied&lt;br /&gt;Probably</li>
            <li> They were noticeably softer and less ashy after the first use.</li>
            <li> This lotion is more costly than other products that I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and it took a long time to get used to this product.</li>
            <li> I just pour out half the bottle (save for later) and mix my fragrant oil, body butter or lotion right in.</li>
            <li> It  works great though a little expensive</li>
            <li> Havent noticed much difference on the other parts of my body though.</li>
            <li> It works really, really works well for those with keratosis pilaris and any rough skin!</li>
            <li> I only use this every few days, but after the first  2 applications, I could already feel a marked difference.</li>
            <li> I live rather rurally, so this product is hard to find in stores, but worth it to order online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now looking for a new solution to my dry skin problem...</li>
            <li> It made my skin soft, it was absorbed quickly, and it made me itch like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I find the smell just too unpleasant for me to use on a regular basis, and with this kind of product I think consistent use is necessary for it to actually work.  </li>
            <li> Those that do appear look much less like ingrown hairs and more like random bumps, which is a lot better (in my opinion) as the bumps are far less obvious than red bumps.</li>
            <li> It absolutely helps with that, so my overall assessment is that if you&#x27;re looking for something to get you through dry months definitely get this.</li>
            <li> short, BUY THIS LOTION!sation is a bit worse on  your face than body as your face is more sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin and this lotion quickly removed most of the bumps within a couple of weeks without stinging or irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot rave enough about it, evens out my skin like no other.</li>
            <li> it!&lt;br /&gt;It stings a little when you first apply but with the time you will get used to it</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this to anyone with rough bumpy skin.</li>
            <li> I mean never, had smooth thighs and back of arms....</li>
            <li> I have been to dermatologists, used expensive lotions, ointments, and have been told that it would never clear up or would get better as I got older.  </li>
            <li> A few drops to each bottle gives a faint scent that is very nice</li>
            <li> But with Amlactin, my skin is BABY SOFT ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li> I barely went outside also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a small eczema breakout in my mid-twenties, a dermatologist had me slather my face with a powerful corticosteroid.</li>
            <li> Having read the reviews, I knew to expect that it would sting the first few times, so I kept going twice a day for about 10 days until I just couldn&#x27;t take his screaming anymore.  </li>
            <li> It will sting a bit if you apply it after shaving, but it&#x27;s worth the small pain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first time I used lactic acid, it was in the form of a chemical peel solution that you apply and wash off in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> As someone with normal skin, this lotion makes my skin feel permanently &#x27;wet&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This really help dry dry skin.  </li>
            <li> , it really works for my dry arm, it had reduced the redness and dry, however, you have to keep using it</li>
            <li> The product goes on more or less &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, but the operative chemicals in it can develop on your skin over the following hours, be absorbed into your system through the skin, and the resulting horrible scent can be overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> a tip, it smells like straight up chemicals but the smell fades after it dries down.</li>
            <li> I used it for several weeks straight, twice a day, saw no results other than chemical burns/rashes in the inner creases of my elbows.</li>
            <li> I live in ridiculously sunny hot AZ and worry if this lotion will make my skin super-sensitive to sunlight</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and with winter approaching I&#x27;m always open to new moisturizing ideas.</li>
            <li> Sensitive, dry and</li>
            <li> We purchased this lotion at the advice of our pediatrician for my 18 month old twins who both suffer from dry skin and ecsema.</li>
            <li> This lotion exfoliates and moisturizes my sensitive and at times dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry skin.  </li>
            <li> At first I was extremely skeptical as I have literally tried every lotion and cream worth its salt on the market.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time ive reviewed something and wanted to be as thorough as I can with my personal experience and the experience of a few friends.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin soft and moist all day, and it costs far less that the fancy creams that are priced by the fraction of an ounce.  </li>
            <li> While Amlactin hasn&#x27;t helped get rid of either of the affected areas after two months of use, it has at least slightly approved its appearance now that the skin stays so much more hydrated than before</li>
            <li> A week into use, I only have a few small, almost unnoticeable bumps left in the area, and I might pumice them to expedite their departure, though I&#x27;m certain they&#x27;ll be gone in a few more days while I&#x27;m using this lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is not very pleasant but it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It was a huge let down because I was really thinking it was going to work, and I definitely did not think that it would make matters worse.</li>
            <li> There is still a little flaking, but not so much that I&#x27;m embarrassed to show my face.</li>
            <li> the bumps are so much smoother, little eczema patches are disappearing.  </li>
            <li> I also just started using it on my knee where I have a little keratosis pilaris, and my knees are much smoother now.</li>
            <li> My teenage girls use this for those little red bumps on the back of the arm - really keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone with rough, dry skin</li>
            <li> You can use it all over, though if your skin is dry, it might sting the first few times.</li>
            <li> definitely feels softer than with my previous normal lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, that would mean stripping down and basting myself in this slightly off-smelling lotion, morning and night, never missing an application.  </li>
            <li> Full of lil hard bumps, now no bumps!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because there are some bumps still present, but I&#x27;ve read other reviews that have said it takes awhile for it to completely get rid of them</li>
            <li> but it is very slight and dissipates fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny because it works and you only have to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I found myself watching TV the other night just rubbing my calf because I&#x27;m just not use to my skin being this soft.</li>
            <li> Did learn the hard way that a small amount is better for my skin</li>
            <li> Put it on backs of upper arms due to keratosis pilaris and it has already started to clear the clear from bumps and it is starting to fade the existing spots in less than a week.</li>
            <li> But I rubbed my face down with a soft washcloth and to my surprise there was skin under there!</li>
            <li> It is the only product that seems to make any difference in keratosis pilaris (commonly called &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has gotten dry and just odd, especially on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have just short of rubbed this lotion directly onto my dark towels with ZERO effect.  </li>
            <li> I usually have 2-3 large blemishes on my face at any one time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing with very little scent.</li>
            <li> My whole face flaking out had been reduced to just a few dry spots.</li>
            <li> I always thought  I had regular dry skin and used lotions such as Eucerin or Curel.  </li>
            <li> When used as directed, I noticed a big improvement, especially during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin that requires constant moisturizing (especially during the winter).</li>
            <li> At first I was apprehensive as it was very thin, but the lotion is very lubricating and not sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different lotions over and over for so long.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use it long enough?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big product person when it comes to taking care of the skin on my body, which is why it took me so long to use it.  </li>
            <li> makes it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It only 2-3 days of using just a minor amount</li>
            <li> I have had KP on my thighs and on the back of my arms for as long as I can remember.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just have a few points to make about this product in comparison to the other reviews which helped me decide to purchase it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I have had little bumps on my arms and legs since I was very young.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and sometimes scales can appear if I don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly, this is the only lotion that works for me.  </li>
            <li> I had developed little bumps on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> one can mix in other products to daily routine if you like (such as using another lotion with fragrance for one of twice daily treatments).</li>
            <li> My skin would get so dry and red it would crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris, a skin condition that leaves red bumps and dry patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> Have a dry skin issue on my feet occasionally (not athlete&#x27;s foot).</li>
            <li> my dry skin comes back.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my Dermatologist for my extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> my KP, I use the Dermadoctor body scrub on my dry upper arms and let it sit there for about an hour.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for preventing dry skin and KP bumps.</li>
            <li> But the \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot; was finally diagnosed as icthyosis, which means \\&quot;fish scales.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I had to walk around naked for about 30 minutes to let it dry, and pray I didn&#x27;t bump into something.  </li>
            <li> If you stop using it, the bumps will come back as there isn&#x27;t a cure for chicken skin :)</li>
            <li> My husband loves for his extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> Finally a doctor recommended that I try AmLactin for a dry elbow issue I was having</li>
            <li> Which is the key to fighting dry, scaly skin.</li>
            <li> Seen a difference in my extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> You can also use it on your face if your skin is not super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Only moisturizer that I can find to help my dry skin .</li>
            <li> The condition can vary in severity and the bumps can be red like acne, white like whiteheads or not visible at all, but it makes your skin feel rough and bumpy.  </li>
            <li> This was bought as a supplement to the above concentrated cream  as a follow-up to initial applications and for use in other areas needing moisturizing.</li>
            <li> (not exactly the result I was after), but about 1 1/2 - 2 months of daily applications finally made a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like to put this on daily if it makes me this uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t bring significant results.</li>
            <li> Upon using it, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to discover it was much less effective than the original version.</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin becomes painfully dry in the winter and mimics the appearance of stretch-marks due to irritated, red, dry patches on my upper dermis.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only thing that helped my very, very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband back in the winter because he was working in the garage a lot and his hands were very dry and cracked and just wouldn&#x27;t heal.</li>
            <li> and I think it helps to clear them a little.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son has suffered with KP since he was little.</li>
            <li> I prefer a quick drying, less thick- type lotion.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little greasy/sticky when first applied, but this goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> and I wonder how this and the acids may harm my skin in the long run.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have cracks or bleeding in your skin it will sting, but not for long.</li>
            <li> the list is long.  </li>
            <li> In the old days, it was prescription-only, and my doctor prescribed it for me after I finished a course of accutane which killed my sebaceous glands.</li>
            <li> I just turned 50, so my skin has not seen this smoothness in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t \\&quot;last\\&quot; nearly as long as its predecessor.  </li>
            <li> I am not sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I run long distances and even with sunscreen I end up getting quite a bit of sun.  </li>
            <li> The only reason for minus a star is the smell.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin moist all day long.</li>
            <li> While the spots are not completely gone, they are no longer noticeable.  </li>
            <li> (very fluid - hence not very moisturising)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you might want to wear long cotton sleeves if you use it during the day while you&#x27;re holding an infant.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ll be a monkey&#x27;s uncle...</li>
            <li> Why have I not tried this long ago.  </li>
            <li> It can be a moisturizer but does not clear away my Keratosis pilaris .</li>
            <li> Costco(at least in my area) now only carries the new 20oz bottle with pump &amp; is now 19.50</li>
            <li> This makes dry blistery cold Winters a bit more bearable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream religiously and it has only improved my KP slightly.</li>
            <li> The research is not positive on whether parabens are actually harmful in cosmetic products, but they are found in breast tumors.  </li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t get over the price here, the small bottle of this runs about $15 where I live so</li>
            <li> No lotion helps and its dry all season long.</li>
            <li> My feet and hand cuticles look and feel so much healthier than the dried up mess</li>
            <li> Other than the smell (which is not overwhelming) it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is worth the price to eradicate keratosis pilaris, which, if you aren&#x27;t aware, is the little bumps you can get on your skin often referred to as \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; because of the way it looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> So, I bought a bottle and put it by my kitchen sink, near the Eucerin pump lotion that I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;Right away I disliked the smell, plus I thought it was too watery, and that it did not moisturize my hands nearly as well as the Eucerin pump lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other alpha-hydroxy creams and did not have the same results.</li>
            <li> I tried using cocoa butter lotions and numerous other greasy ones</li>
            <li> but I now use this on my entire body due to the fact that it has given my skin so meany benefits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried mixing it with other lotions or essential oils...  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it, but I will be trying other things, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second day and subsequent days: Tend Skin applied in one stroke all over shaved area; wait a little for it to absorb; AmLactin over the Tend Skin.</li>
            <li> Following the advice of other reviewers, I thought maybe this was the miracle I was waiting for.  </li>
            <li> My last derm recommended this for kertosis - tiny little bumps on my thigh.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I get little red bumps on my upper arms</li>
            <li> Then I use my other product; however, at night I use only AmLactin.  </li>
            <li> THere are other lotions out there with AHA in them that do NOT have parabens, which are only a preservative and not a necessity.  </li>
            <li> I gave up several times and then used it again for several more weeks just to be disappointed</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and have not noticed anything different with my skin than with other lotions.</li>
            <li> Mixed with other lotions to extend the use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a warning to limit sun exposure because of the lactic acid but my skin does not feel any more delicate than it used to, perhaps I just have tough skin.</li>
            <li> My hands aren&#x27;t getting chapped and we have started having some pretty cold days with high winds.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and during winter season tends to increase the problem.</li>
            <li> I was born with a dry skin condition called ichtheosis, disease of the fish.</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of specialized foot cremes for my dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> I hand mix with Eucerin pump lotion for my legs in the winter and his shins and dry feet.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my skin doc for dry skin.</li>

            <li> A miracle worker on dry skin with eczema.  </li>
            <li> it keeps them from being dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, you&#x27;ll want your skin to be mostly dry when using it.</li>
            <li> My feet are like butter, and they are always dry in winter.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> It was just so much dry skin.</li>
            <li> It works for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using AmLactin for over 25 years, since my hematologist wrote me a prescription for it in 1989 when he saw how dry my skin was.</li>
            <li> However, it has worked wonders for my dry heels and elbows.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and bought this thinking it might help.  </li>
            <li> I tried everything and my skin still had a dry crepey look.</li>
            <li> while it might work for dry skin and stuff, this lotion does not help for the keratosis.....</li>
            <li> Very itchy, irritating and gross goosebumps.</li>
            <li> I went back to Amlactin a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than willing to tolerate a slight odor if it means I can actually touch my upper arms and legs without feeling awful about myself.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> My skin actually looked really bad the first day, but after showering the next night and using my loofa for a longer period of time in the shower, MY KP IS COMPLETELY</li>
            <li> Once I started using it EVERY SINGLE TIME I got out of the shower</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry skin on my lower legs and usually with any other lotion, I would have dry flaky skin by the end of the day after applying my normal lotion in the morning.</li>
            <li> Then my GP suggested this, called it an old remedy, but it worked unbelievably.</li>
            <li> We tries several other things including prescriptions from dermatologist and nothing has come close to this.</li>
            <li> Last a long time because u only have to use a small amount..</li>
            <li> I had suffered from dark spots all over my torso for years, using this product coupled with my daily veggie shake has almost eliminated that problem.</li>
            <li> We have tried numerous products, with no success.</li>
            <li> In addition, I also use the Buf Puf Back Scrubber with the double sided sponge on all areas where keratosis is a problem, which sluffs off the dead, rough skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that gets rid of my keratosis pilaris, but I had to detract one star because it has a bit of a sour smell.</li>
            <li> I was a little put off by the price at first, and it was hard to find.</li>
            <li> So I lost a substantial portion of expensive product, and also had a big mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way... ruined a brand new hand towel and shirt.</li>
            <li> Every year, I inevitably break down and buy AmLactin in the winter.</li>
            <li> and there is just one stubborn strip left down each arm.</li>
            <li> As a teacher I could barely hold chalk or a pen much less use them!</li>
            <li> Just know when to stop using or youmight end up with flaky, dry skin!</li>
            <li> My skin tone on my legs has evened out and my heals are no longer dry and cracking!  </li>
            <li> My fingers and the heels of my feet would dry, crack and bleed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female with brown skin prone to hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Previously, to control skin flaking/cracking, I would have to use lotion and oil on my skin after showering and daily.</li>
            <li> Put it on while skin is still wet and air dry.</li>
            <li> Faint ammonia smell, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Now that it is OTC, I find it difficult if not impossible to locate---especially this &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; version of the brand &amp;#34;LacHydrin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders for getting rid of those little dry skin bumps on the back of your arms!</li>
            <li> It helps prevent very dry skin.  </li>

            <li> I have very dry skin and also suffer with &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this lotion works well for very dry skin</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have eczema and very dry skin and with this lotion...</li>
            <li> I tend to have very dry hands and feet</li>
            <li> I have never tried KP Derma Doctor, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is a huge bottle for the same price as DD&#x27;s small bottle, so ill stick with Amlactin.</li>
            <li> Do you have a rash or something?&amp;#34; Then other co-worker said, &amp;#34;It must be heat rash because of wearing long sleeves&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for a long time, in conjunction with other lotions that do not have urea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It recommends using the product at least twice a day (morning and night), but for my skin that seemed to be a little too much as my arms were starting to look a little red and feel a tiny bit raw.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t burn that much when you put it on dry broken skin.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s thin, it really helps with dry skin, almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is neither horrible nor pleasant, probably smells just like its component chemicals, but anyway it goes away soon enough.</li>
            <li> use it every single night after my shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars only because I don&#x27;t know if it actually works since I stopped using it, but anything that painful is deserving of a poor review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to help other eczema sufferers, I&#x27;ve tried all of the following, and they haven&#x27;t worked:  Aveeno Baby Eczema, Eucerin Eczema,</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching products for dry skin, especially after starting medication that only made my dry skin worse.</li>
            <li> Oh well, they&#x27;re only little bumps so who cares anyway?</li>
            <li> Little red bumps on the backs of legs/arms?</li>
            <li> It does sting a little if you have an open cut.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to get this cream for the little bumps on the back of my arms.  </li>
            <li> You know those little red bumps you sometimes get on your arms-</li>
            <li> It actually gets rid of these nagging little bumps (while you use it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and upper arms for a year now, and it has cleared up 95% of those pesky little bumps that I&#x27;ve had for ages.</li>
            <li> I decided I would spend a little on this possible solution.</li>
            <li> I mean, come on, I&#x27;m young and single here.</li>
            <li> and I occasionaly forget to use it everyday, but it seems to be helping a little so far.  </li>
            <li> This has cured my excessively dry skin unlike any other moisture lotions I have tried in 30 years.  </li>
            <li> I have issues with KP as well as severe dry skin due to thyroid issues.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to do that in years without feeling bad</li>
            <li> Ok, not that bad</li>
            <li> It was a huge disappointment and I remain baffled over the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked by the results that I went to target and purchased 8 more mini bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (KP never really goes away).</li>
            <li> Recommended by dermatologists world wide</li>
            <li> mentioned above, AMLACTIN does eat away a a layer of dead skin</li>
            <li> My legs always felt bumpy and rough whether I shaved and applied lotion immediately after.</li>
            <li> It always felt rough and there was nothing I could do about it</li>
            <li> have used this product 3 times a day, everyday, for the last two-three weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update throughout the next few weeks for folks that are looking for a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead decreased, too, though my skin was still really flaky.</li>
            <li> However, I added a few drops of essential oils and voila, smell is almost gone.</li>
            <li> But I would have expected some improvement over 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> You also have to be careful about going into the sun with the areas you apply it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is slimy when it gets wet even hours after application.</li>
            <li> I called the manufacturer because I was curious and spoke with a woman in the pharmacy department.  </li>
            <li> It only lasts a few minutes</li>
            <li> If this doesn&#x27;t work for you, try gold bond rough and bumpy..</li>
            <li> Also be careful about sun exposure  as this lotion can cause photosensitivity.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> What a difference in my rough spots on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did not really notice the smell, so I would say I have to disagree with people who say it smells like cat urine.  </li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected when something is over the counter versus prescription.</li>
            <li> I used it daily for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I needed to apply it twice daily for a while to get rid of all the dead skin cells causing all the flakiness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exfoliating, in fact seems to eat into dead skin, so it&#x27;s possible to overuse it.  </li>
            <li> and thats why I had &#x27;rough&#x27; unfeminine feet.</li>
            <li> Just know this can happen and be careful.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few months to report back.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few months and you can definitely feel the peel the medicine gives, but I think I need something stronger, personally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful of the ingredients before you purchase cosmetics.</li>
            <li> It will burn and flake if you have a lot of dead skin cells but with continued use my skin on my face is actually not as wrinkled as I thought.</li>
            <li> Be careful though.  </li>
            <li> For the results it gave, I would definitely pay the price it is up for since I wasted a hell lot of money over prescribed stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After an appointment with a dermatologist, he prescribed lac-hydrin 12% and after using two times a day everyday, my skin was totally healed within 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I expected something a bit thicker in consistency.  </li>
            <li> After using it only a few times, my skin is smoother than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> You can never really see if a product works for you unless you try it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back in a few months with an update.</li>
            <li> The day after applying, lots of dead skin sloughs off in the shower when I scrub with a washcloth, especially on my legs.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin getting softer, but the back of my thighs still feel rough and I use this product nearly everyday.  </li>
            <li> My KP is slowly going away, but it is hard to find the right time to put this on.</li>
            <li> My arms are way smoother after daily application, and I saw results in less than a week!</li>
            <li> But I have incredibly sensitive dry skin, so it&#x27;s not surprising.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well the lotion would work compared to other OTC lotions for other dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> This is extremely helpful lotion for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Soaks into very dry, scratchy skin and itching disappears!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this does much for my eczema other than keep me moist longer, but it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores, more expensive and only comes in small bottles with no pump.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the heaviness of the lotion, slight stickiness and slight smell.  </li>
            <li> Other lotions wouldn&#x27;t work for her rough skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not especially sensitive to odors, so I don&#x27;t notice it after a few minutes, even on my face.</li>
            <li> The smell fades after a couple of minutes and is completely drowned out by the other products I use.</li>
            <li> I, being young and dumb, failed to read all of the label and am currently not able to function properly because I have burns covering a large part of my body from being outside for two hours.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my hands have less dry skin and</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only complaint, and it is minor, because I know they have to put a chemical in the lotion to make it work, is that it smells like the bleach my stylist puts in my hair when I get my highlights done.</li>
            <li> so it looks less dry and scaly</li>
            <li> I went to my Doctor who prescribed a medication for general eczema but two tubes later it had just gotten worse.</li>
            <li> This helps a ton and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The saying &#x27;a little goes a long way&#x27; did not apply to me with this product (literally).</li>
            <li> A little of this lotion goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I tired it again on my hands, but each time was disappointed in the odor, the excess watery level, and lack of feeling as moisturized as most other hand lotions/creams I&#x27;ve used over the decades.&lt;br /&gt;Finally my bottle of Eucerin was empty, so then for at least a couple of days I was frequently using this lotion from this bottle of AmLactin which was near my kitchen</li>
            <li> Daily scrubbing with a loofah just wouldn&#x27;t quite cut it as my skin would still get dry even after a thick lotion application.  </li>
            <li> Still, the benefit outweighs any other complaints.</li>
            <li> I have widespread keratosis pilaris and after only a few days, I can see a difference!  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews, I amy have to start using it on my feet.</li>
            <li> I used my other lotion.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant when a friend recommended this due to the cost.</li>
            <li> I’ve only been using it a few days and the calluses on my feet are almost gone!</li>
            <li> Seems to have helped the rough elbow thing, too!</li>
            <li> I applied this every night and in the morning every other day.</li>
            <li> Another derm prescribed other products but they didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it once/day or once every other day</li>
            <li> got it for mom, she swears it works miracles on her skin without all the harmful chemicals other lotions have</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like that , do find some other lotion.</li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t ever recommend putting it on broken skin--it stings and leaves it a bit sore--and people who react to alpha hydroxy compounds, even if their skin isn&#x27;t normally oversensitive, will probably break out with this.)  </li>
            <li> This seems like any other lotion to me.</li>
            <li> is one of the symptoms) as well as small red bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> then decided to try it for other issues.  </li>
            <li> So, despite the extremely exorbitant price,  I purchased this lotion based on reviews.</li>
            <li> Do not spend your money on other products for keratosis pili.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have ignored the other customers who said it gave them rashes.</li>
            <li> It is not as sticky as other lotions.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help with some small bumps I get on the back of my arms and inside of my knees.</li>
            <li> Well, not really and not for the price!  </li>
            <li> on another note I don&#x27;t smell anything like other people have said.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why it&#x27;s effecting me this way since few other reviews seem to reflect this reaction, but it has definitely made things much worse for me so far.  </li>
            <li> Just a little once or twice a day does wonders for dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a little longer to dry than regular lotion and you may feel a little sticky for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I get very few red bumps on my thighs now.  </li>
            <li> (I was very small and had a very big baby a few years back).</li>
            <li> Be aware that when you place this lotion on a cut or opening it will burn for a second, and it sometimes can be unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I won’t spend money buying this lotion until I have some serious dry patches that will not go away with regular lotion.</li>
            <li> ; it gets rid of crust cracks and wrinkles and then slowly removes the old dead cells.</li>
            <li> It helps to remove the dry, dead skin cells from my body.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s a little more pricey than usual lotions, I&#x27;d buy it again if my KP decides to go crazy again.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and makes her skin less itchy and softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 and have had cystic acne for the last 15 years- usually on my neck and lower half of my face.  </li>
            <li> (A bit of background, I was suffering from what I guess you would term adult-onset acne due to a change in hormone levels and was dealing particularly with crazy breakouts on my face and upper shoulders only.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thin Irish skin that is so sensitive and sun wrecked (outdoorsy)</li>
            <li> Try to cut down on damaging your body with tanning and every other unnatural thing</li>
            <li> I use this product, but also mix in a bit of a conventional moisturizer, and it seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> It seems to help with hard KP bumps, if they haven&#x27;t been loofahed (save that for your next shower) or irritated beforehand.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this lotion, and buy it from Amazon, where it is at least five dollars cheaper than my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing white dead skin.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is that its a bit oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will take a few applications to see results on your keratosis pilaris and rough skin, maybe 2-3 days, using it 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would run my hands up and down my legs</li>
            <li> down side -1</li>
            <li> --you have to use sunscreen while using this stuff) and then hopefully go down to once a week, since I have the KP under control.</li>
            <li> Bruised from the knee down.</li>
            <li> It has a slight sour dairy odor</li>
            <li> No more red, raw patches.  </li>
            <li> You may think Amlactin expensive, but for me I go through regular oils and lotions so fast that it is actually less expensive for me to just pony up for a big bottle of Amlactin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is some slight burning/tingling sensation when you use it.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> less hang nails</li>
            <li> The slight acetic mix seems to take car of sores, cuts or spots on my skin..</li>
            <li> Had previously been getting this lotion at a pharmacy, just found out how to order online.  </li>
            <li> Previously I had tried an OTC psoriasis remedy with coal tar--it worked, but also stung and was smelly and stained</li>
            <li> I may try using it on my face, sparingly, in the winter when there&#x27;s less</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove the scales but it makes them a lot less noticeable for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> All also said that it had brightened up their skin and have lightened slightly</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well to make my skin less irritated.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Aveeno for less than half the price of this.</li>
            <li> I tried typical moisturizers to allow the hair to grow outwards..</li>
            <li> The slight medicinal odor goes away too.  </li>
            <li> This generous sized pump bottle of AmLactin is - ounce for ounce - half</li>
            <li> I have several skin problems that this lotion is recommended for, but sadly I can&#x27;t say if it works for me because the ammonia smell is so gross</li>
            <li> It took care of those bumps in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I used Eucerin previously</li>
            <li> I added a scented lotion to help with slight smell.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this with less than zero stars then I would.  </li>
            <li> , my left hand also had a serious rash on it too.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves a slight burning feeling</li>
            <li> My arms and legs were returning to their previous state and shade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it on my legs- on my knees and the backs of my thighs, where I believe I also had some slight KP.</li>
            <li> Recently moved back to the Northeast from the south and this dry cold air has been wreaking havoc on my skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight change in my KP,some of it disappeared slightly.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried coconut oil and scrubbing in the shower to no avail.</li>
            <li> My skin became smoother, and the keratosis pilaris has become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a caramel colored Black woman, and I am looking for ways to even out the tone of my skin color and hope that this will help.</li>
            <li> My face was a mess.</li>
            <li> My face is a mess.</li>
            <li> (it used to have a dark green cap), but there was no indication on the tube that the cream had changed.</li>
            <li> Overall not a good experience</li>
            <li> It is not a serious problem, but it is annoying, especially in the winter when my skin becomes so dry that I can cover the floor around me with dead skin when I scratch the itchy places.</li>
            <li> I mean its not completely gone but</li>
            <li> i have wicked keratosis pilarsis, since i was a kid;  got super bad after i had my baby.  </li>
            <li> Since I have started using it I have gotten no more pimples and the marks on my back are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- very difficult to be absorbed into the skin, even after rubbing the lotion for few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- smells like chemicals.</li>
            <li> The backs of my legs have a few bumps, but way less.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have little bumps all over my arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of medicine including herbal remedies to little or no effect.</li>
            <li> The acid does burn a little</li>
            <li> all I felt were little bumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the sticky side, but</li>
            <li> So use a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> I had some blocked hair follicles resulting in little bumps, this lotion got rid of the bumps.</li>
            <li> It also takes longer than \\&quot;regular\\&quot; lotions to absorb into the skin and until it does, feels a little tacky-sticky.  </li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris and while it did make my skin a little softer, it didnt get rid of the bumps.  </li>
            <li> (little bumps)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cure but helps a little.</li>
            <li> bit smelly and fells sticky for a little bit after putting on but works well</li>
            <li> Been using it for little over a year,.</li>
            <li> I mix it with shea butter and coconut oil,  and a little bit of my Bath and Body Works products.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter how little product I used</li>
            <li> Also has lightened dark spots and moisturises!</li>
            <li> My skin even has a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; going on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little smelly but that dissipates.  </li>
            <li> I develop little what look like little skin polyps when using this without a break</li>
            <li> I just started exfoliating again during a shower before applying this product, and it seems to be helping a little, too.</li>
            <li> Is a little on the sticky side and takes a while to absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li> So, there were little to no changes!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I tried a little on my jawline and had no issue, this weekend I&#x27;m going to try it on my face.  </li>
            <li> It smells faintly of ammonia when you put it on, but that goes away quickly and leaves behind no fragrance.</li>
            <li> it helps so much with the horrible dry alligator skin that makes you look like you&#x27;re a million frigging years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid ridiculous amounts of money for tiny jars of expensive exotic creams with promises of eczema and psoriasis relief only to be left with dozens of partially used bottles of useless crap lying around the house.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon after searching for anything to help with my Ichytosos Vulgaris (very, very dry skin condition - characterized by scaling), and I&#x27;ve been using it for at least two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Definitely do not apply to face or very delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> bought this because its suppose to help with the little red bumps behind my arms.</li>
            <li> Instead of simply clearing up an ugly but ultimately non-itchy skin condition (KP), this has made my skin raw and itchy all day long.  </li>
            <li> Really moisturizers your skin and removes chicken skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as most of us with excess keratin and chicken skin are.  </li>
            <li> within a few hours even the thickest creams rubbed off or evaporated to the point as if I&#x27;ve put no lotion on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use AmLactin year round.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with splitting skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;***PEOPLE OF COLOR!!!!!- Recommended this to a few friends who were having issues with their lotions .</li>
            <li> But I decided to give it a few days to see.</li>
            <li> I looked a few years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not available everywhere</li>
            <li> I used it every night for a few nights, then put it on about once a week.</li>
            <li> Dead skin was just slothing off onto my towel.</li>
            <li> This stuff is HARSH.</li>
            <li> This product has been diluted so that it is not the consistency of the one I bought a few months before.</li>
            <li> I have used Amlactin for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> They would drop by my table to take a few squirts and wander off in bliss.</li>
            <li> It stings and warms and initially makes the redness look worse.</li>
            <li> Finally, after a decade of fighting irritating and embarrassing skin blemishes, I found AmLactin.</li>
            <li> I tried it again and started using it for a few days, and the burning eventually went away.</li>
            <li> A waste of money, this is not a cheap product</li>
            <li> I a member of a few online skincare forums.</li>
            <li> I used it for two weeks hoping my skin was just going through an adjustment period, but the rash only got worse.</li>
            <li> Ah relief for dried out skin after a shower in the winter wonderland up here.</li>
            <li> I applied everyday after showering and shaving.  </li>
            <li> Has been making skin feel smoother after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> actually makes it worse.</li>
            <li> Do not use this after shaving because it will sting for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it everyday anymore</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It burns my skin - wasted my money</li>
            <li> I can now step out of the shower and not turn into a dried out alligator, immediately.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The bumps are 90% gone, though I still get a few here and there.</li>
            <li> I moved on to my legs, abdomen, and arms over the course of a few days.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the lotion being sticky or messy.  </li>
            <li> Note for Amazon - please don&#x27;t e-mail within a few days time to Review.  </li>
            <li> Impacting was recommended to me by two of my friends in two separate occasions, it helps with cracking and heavy dryness of the skin.</li>
            <li> Helps exfoliate any dead skin buildup I have anywhere</li>
            <li> very disappointed since many other consumers have reported that it works.</li>
            <li> The product smells a bit like sunless tanner when applied and leaves your skin slightly sticky for awhile after application, but this is a small inconvenience for a product that works.</li>
            <li> When used daily for a weeks, thise annoying small bumps on the back of your arms simply dissappear-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly strong, but given the alternatives I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terribly strong, but given the alternatives I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong ammonia scent</li>
            <li> then it is very slight.</li>
            <li> Not true!</li>
            <li> Made a big difference on my legs also that get dry during the cold weather.  </li>
            <li> Whatever sensations I get with this usually subsides within a few minutes anyways.</li>
            <li> It usually subsides within a few minutes anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It usually subsides within a few minutes anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amlactin seemed to push stuff to the surface too, and I got a few blemishes on my cheeks, but they were small and not too painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> story goes that my hair and my legs pretty much hate each other.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;d itch them raw while sleeping - this helps</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; other people complained about, yes it has a residue but only until it dries then your skin is softer than you could have ever imagined!</li>
            <li> came the part where I stopped using it, because I went on vacation and came back and just simply forgot (bad idea).</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have some really bad upper arm skin and keratosis pilaris on the back of my arms.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Not only was this painful, this did a number of my self esteem as people would constantly assume that I didn&#x27;t shower</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gotten rid of those ugly red bumps on the back of my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that after several weeks of using twice daily (recommended on package) that skin started peeling almost  in sheets.</li>
            <li> But at least I now had one less</li>
            <li> (both conditions look much worse with dry</li>
            <li> If my little bumps go away I will update this to show that it worked!</li>
            <li> I noticed that there was very little blotchiness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to feel a little thick and sticky&lt;</li>
            <li> Tad expensive but a little goes a long way this this.</li>
            <li> Also the texture is thin and wet</li>
            <li> lotion works by having a small amount of lactic acid.</li>
            <li> No more itching and keeps my skin refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had troubled skin my entire life!</li>
            <li> No more flakes.</li>
            <li> I have patches of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and in the past I have had to resort to prescription steroid creams to relieve my symptoms.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed this lotion to me in the past, but now it is in an OTC version.  </li>
            <li> Expensive for a product that will do the same thing as a cheaper product would.</li>
            <li> Also careful when applying to broken skin-</li>
            <li> It helps but is not perfect as it does not last all day.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting instant results here you&#x27;re doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> I can reclaim my legs again and not look like a lazy hag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had small bumps on my neck for years.</li>
            <li> Remember to avoid the sun for a few weeks after use though!</li>
            <li> Still just can&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li> consistently(of course he did that for a few weeks and then forgot!).</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed this lotion in the past.  </li>
            <li> It has unbelievably cleared and healed my skin which had been plagued with breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I gave it another go because I ran out of my usual lotion</li>
            <li> Not sure yet ...</li>
            <li> so I consider the stinging to be a small price to pay.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what everyone else is complaining about.</li>
            <li> No more itchiness and flakiness.</li>
            <li> I suggest for people who have not ordered this, get a small amount and try it out.</li>
            <li> No more cracked fingers when I use it.</li>
            <li> No more itching either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> No more flakes.  </li>
            <li> Love the product, but the vendor did a terrible job of packing it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does what is promised because it makes me feel so sticky, even for hours afterward, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I get nasty ashyness on my mouth and nose sides and this helps more than anything else</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it will hold up in the winter by itself, but I like that</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product in the past</li>
            <li> Some other reviews stated the same type of results and I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very unpleasant smell and is heavy and greasy when you first put it on then turns sticky as it dries.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is not very good either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not especially painful, but it looks awful and feels gross.</li>
            <li> sorry if this has been a long one</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have exceptionally dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for a lot of people, but for me, it unfortunately made it a lot worse. :(</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes is not saggy, my forehead has hardly any lines, and I am not itchy.</li>
            <li> so I recommend any one who is having a hard time to use this cream .</li>
            <li> Works wonders on hard cracked skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and goes away within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> burn cuts, and I have learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> The skin isn&#x27;t thick and dull anymore, and there are no scales to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the scent effect was so bad and took 3 days to clear out of my system.  </li>
            <li> No more itching, no more flakes, and the only scales left are on my elbow, always my worst patch of skin.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to be fragrance free, but it smells Awful.</li>
            <li> At least it is bearable.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day</li>
            <li> onthe skin helps to prevent skin tears especially for diabetics, or anyone for whom a skin tear could be dangerous.  </li>
            <li> we try to soak our feet at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> always, always had gross, bumpy chicken skin on my legs.</li>
            <li> It smells like urine, like I had been living on the street for at least 3 months and never seen shower since.</li>
            <li> For a year now I have been trying to get rid of a &amp;#34;rash&amp;#34; on my neck that looks like tiny bumps (looks like chicken skin)</li>
            <li> It is also a slow process and takes months to correct.</li>
            <li> slowly to fade away.</li>
            <li> I just apply a generous amount of it all over the tops and bottoms of my feet and then put on a pair of thick cotton socks to keep the lotion on my feet and not all over the floor.  </li>
            <li> Everything else I have tried is so thick and goopy.  </li>
            <li> No more blisters or cracked skin!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly unbelievable!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a small price to pay, imo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting that red, raw nasty dry skin on the sides of my nose for years.  </li>
            <li> My KP got really red the next morning, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So I have a tacky, cold, and clammy feeling on my skin all day long until I shower...</li>
            <li> I was relieved, no more unnecessary trips and frustration.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Specifically in the cold winter times when the skin is so dry</li>
            <li> This is a MUCH less expensive version, which is treated to take some of the &amp;#34;sour milk&amp;#34; odor away.</li>
            <li> but seriously I wear stillettos/high heels allot</li>
            <li> So I tried Amlactin for the heck of it and seriously,</li>
            <li> Exfoliate yes but does not moisturize as less expensive EUCERIN.</li>
            <li> and i was the lucky recipient of some awful postpartum eczema!  </li>
            <li> Anyone who suffers from dry, itchy skin, then I recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> My skin reacted to it poorly which doesn&#x27;t mean it is not a quality lotion.</li>
            <li> then hopefully it wouldn&#x27;t be TOO bad for the rest health in the long run.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had pretty terrible eczema all my life.  </li>
            <li> It is NEVER ro late to start grear skin care, ao start it wirh this product!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Dry patch of red on my chest wasn&#x27;t a burn :(</li>
            <li> I have really bad scaly, dry legs.</li>
            <li> Works well on the tough areas: feet, knees , elbows etc.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for a little over a week twice a day in hopes of curing my chicken skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe even worse.</li>
            <li> and I felt horrible when I (yes my whole body) stank, like a cat litter box.</li>
            <li> It will sting if it&#x27;s on even very slightly broken skin</li>
            <li> My KP got worse with this product.</li>
            <li> Its thin, liquidy, and smells like ammonia.</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken and cream was all over</li>
            <li> I have gotten it in my eyes before and it burned BAD, worse than any other cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still having problems with my neck area, but that&#x27;s because I got a really bad heat rash on it the other day.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff WORKS!  </li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic difference in the texture and bumps.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results, but it keeps my skin moisturized</li>
            <li> This stuff takes about 3 weeks to see dramatic results, but once you do, you will buy this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> I try not to use this on my hands because I found out the hard way that if I rub my eyes for any reason after having this on my hands, my eyes burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how bad the dead callused skin has been and nothing would seem to help.  </li>
            <li> Although it worked, it also dried my skin out really bad...</li>
            <li> They were all over my arms, a few on my legs but not as bad as my arms.</li>
            <li> Being post menopausal, my skin has dried out to the point of being painful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if  I received an old product or what, but the smell is awful.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion for my 2 year old who has terrible eczema.  </li>
            <li> you apply this, which to me almost completely defeats the purpose because suncream makes my skin disgusting all over again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it seemed to make my issues worse with continual use, despite being designed for acne.</li>
            <li> My family is afraid to move too slowly for fear of ending up in the freezer.</li>
            <li> After opening the bottle and smelling it I was a little disappointed, it smelled like a prescribed medicated lotion.</li>
            <li> Using the lotion ( with Keri as a companion), can help avoid the nusance of delicate skin tissue tears!!  </li>
            <li> The past month was really bad for some reason it got frenzy, that was when I started looking for that miracle</li>
            <li> lately it got REALLY bad again on the backs of my arms.</li>
            <li> My psoriasis flares during stress and weather changes, and I had been having some bad cracking and bleeding lately, with no time to make an appointment with my GP.</li>
            <li> All though I had a bad reaction I have been using now it on the bottoms of my feet/calves to see if it at least helps w the roughness.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s wrong with your arms?</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT is expensive</li>
            <li> Strangers wouldn&#x27;t look at me because I made them uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is helpful to reduce the swelling and redness associated with those dreadful red bumps.  </li>
            <li> My family likes it, but thinks it smells weird.</li>
            <li> It IS expensive if you get it at the store but like another reviewer</li>
            <li> Sorry, this stuff just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Having difficult time to use it.</li>
            <li> Expensive lotion that doesn&#x27;t work for the reason it was purchased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how anyone could go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I have read the review and ignored it sorry I did.</li>
            <li> But it made me go to bed feeling uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was not.  </li>
            <li> This is expensive lotion</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The KP is definitely improving but I may still do a chemical peel or on the worst areas to hurry things</li>
            <li> Sadly, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Scary.  </li>
            <li> Expensive lotions and creams didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Has a  faint chemical odour almost like  hair dye/</li>
            <li> touched my legs and asked what was wrong with them--</li>
            <li> I have a difficult  time finding this in stores.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ended up tossing it out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to return this item to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I felt an uncomfortable tingling and almost itchy dryness when using it.</li>
            <li> If you apply this product on any broken or scratched skin it will burn!</li>
            <li> I will just have to use a different lotion for my arms and legs because this smells awful!</li>
            <li> I would get people (friends, cousins aunts) asking me about what is wrong with my skin</li>
            <li> Recommended treatment is IPL or a chemical peel, which may or may not work (expensive by the way and not covered by insurance).&lt;br</li>
            <li> only issue is the horrible odor...</li>
            <li> Winters in the northeast were terrible - itching, dry flaky skin, redness, etc.</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry skin</li>
            <li> I had horrible dry feet since I had diabetes during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a skin condition called ichthyosis all my life, and my skin has been dry and awful.</li>
            <li> The smell was not great but not too bad that I couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> The other lotion I used to use would bleach the crap out of my towels and clothing!  </li>
            <li> Internet photos of bad reactions are also scary.</li>
            <li> I hope it will work on chicken skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on mine because I was desperate.</li>
            <li> 10: I&#x27;ve had a horrid reaction that I&#x27;m afraid might be tied to this lotion.</li>
            <li> It also clears up keratosis pilaris (aka chicken skin) on the arms and legs.</li>
            <li> It irritated my neck, which I was unhappy about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying desperately to prevent this from happening.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion for my wife since she suffers from rashes during the summer.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat the keratosis pilaris (aka chicken bumps) on my arms.</li>
            <li> They made my skin feel so clogged and disgusting even if I had already showered and exfoliated my body a few hours before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Possible cure for chicken skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eczema, KP, chicken skin, alligator skin.</li>
            <li> My skin does stay moistened throughout the day and night, but I do notice that if my skin is exposed to extremely cold weather, I can see the dryness breaking through.</li>
            <li> you have any broken skin, it will sting the crap out of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really recommend this product for people with difficult skin like mine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just mad</li>
            <li> It was terribly painful and inconvenient.</li>
            <li> know it is very difficult for KP sufferers.</li>
            <li> , I got that very uncomfortable, not supple, sticky feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> And if you can&#x27;t bear the smell, I feel bad cause</li>
            <li> Also all the scars have flattened out even my really bad ones</li>
            <li> It got so bad I had to stop shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad skin and a lot of stretch marks and wrippled skin on my stomach for years.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have never smelled any moisturizer that smells this bad.  </li>
            <li> Had a bad case of keratosis after spending days walking in my jeans during a vacation.  </li>
            <li> For 10 days I couldn&#x27;t even sleep well as the itch was so bad.  </li>
            <li> that bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve continued using it for the rest of my body since my skin drys out so badly during the fall/winter.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend because he has really bad keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> Like, really really bad.</li>
            <li> Some people report burning, I don&#x27;t find it bothersome or painful.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me because of how cracked and painful my skin on both my feet and my ankles were.</li>
            <li> I tan when I can, so that is a problem. :(</li>
            <li> I cannot find a cream that works for me :(</li>
            <li> Smells like ammonia :(</li>
            <li> I stopped after 2 wks and it took me another 2 weeks to recover :(</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If there is a fragrance or odor to this lotion, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and I have an annoyingly keen sense of smell.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just annoying.</li>
            <li> It tastes HORRIBLE and your tongue goes numb for hours if it comes in contact with it.</li>
            <li> Topnotes of glue give way to a base of cloying ammonia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> people viscerally hate the word \\&quot;moist.\\&quot; After feeling this moisturize your skin for hours on end, you will understand why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything with my KP, I hate the smell too.  </li>
            <li> It was very unpleasant looking and feeling, so I had to look for something to help cure this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The stinging is not as bad as it was with the coal tar ointment I tried!</li>
            <li> This year, I noticed I was getting KP on my legs - really bad!  </li>
            <li> They were so bad on heel cracked!</li>
            <li> I USED IT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weeks 1-3: I HATED the smell</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this stuff smells horrible...</li>
            <li> I am a African-American woman and I have Kerotis Pilaris in the worst way.  </li>
            <li> Also, Amlactin has a terrible smell to it.</li>
            <li> but this has a horrible medicinal smell that I can feel in my eyes.</li>
            <li> It gave me terrible rashes on my arms and neck.</li>
            <li> Gave me terrible rash and eczema!</li>
            <li> Gave me terrible rash and eczema!</li>
            <li> Horrible, SO DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t but this, it smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this to me after complaining about horrible KP on my legs.</li>
            <li> but nothing horrible.  </li>
            <li> and I still have a vicious, itchy rash on every part of my body where I applied this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about a week on those areas and it has made me insanely itchy</li>
            <li> Smell terrible.</li>
            <li> Miserable, my winter skin makes me miserable.</li>
            <li> I disagree with reviews dramatically stating it smells terrible.</li>

            <li> Very nice lotion. My Dr recommend it. Fast shipping &amp; not in pieces. Will order again if shipping can be lowered. Good price for amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have little bumps all over my arms. It does help but it advises you to stay out of the sun while using it. I tan when I can, so that is a problem. :(</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer on the market--no petrolatum or wax.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how wonderful this product is! I was skeptical about the &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; other people complained about, yes it has a residue but only until it dries then your skin is softer than you could have ever imagined! I wish I would have discovered this sooner &amp; I don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t a more commonly known product. Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product. I cannot rave enough about it, evens out my skin like no other. I love that it spreads and absorbs quite easily. I&#x27;m a black female with brown skin prone to hyper pigmentation. Way cheaper than buying it I store, plus you get more. Will always repurchase this item. My HG product!</li>
            <li> AmLactin is the best cream I have ever used for my KP condition. The bumps don&#x27;t disappear but they lessen (KP never really goes away). In addition, I don&#x27;t get ingrown hair bumps (larger red bumps on my arms). It leaves my skin feeling smooth and it feels nice on my KP too. I&#x27;ve used other alpha-hydroxy creams and did not have the same results. There is definitely 12% AH acid in this cream because it does exfoliate. KP can&#x27;t be cured but it can be controlled and this cream controls the condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it is very difficult for KP sufferers. I remember once I wore a short sleeved shirt at work (I was working out doors at the time) and a co-worker looked at my arms and said loudly, &amp;#34;oooh, what&#x27;s wrong with your arms? Do you have a rash or something?&amp;#34; Then other co-worker said, &amp;#34;It must be heat rash because of wearing long sleeves&amp;#34;. At the time I didn&#x27;t know I had KP; it hadn&#x27;t been diagnosed. Once it was, I used different creams but they didn&#x27;t do much good. And then I found AmLactin. I was researching on the internet and someone had suggested it. I am glad that I am able to purchase it. The company who makes Amlactin has helped many sufferers of KP; they are doing good in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care everyone and for the KP sufferers, take heart. There is more to life than completely smooth skin and remember to appreciate the parts of your skin that don&#x27;t suffer from KP. Sometimes thinking, &amp;#34;It could be worse&amp;#34;, puts things into perspective. But the cream helps, it definitely helps KP.</li>
            <li> Better than the name brand lotions. Works great.</li>
            <li> Since last year(2014) I have been using this product. I have witness a change in my skin and high levels of moisture. I really love it and the softness. I have KP and I think it helps to clear them a little.</li>
            <li> I cannot find a cream that works for me :(</li>
            <li> Way better than regular lotion, worth the money. However, if you have a Costco membership I would recommend buying it there. I bought a bottle yesterday for $15.04 after taxes and $4 manufacturer&#x27;s instant rebate.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this lotion. I absolutely love it?</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> It was exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for me.  It keeps my skin from having the snake skin look.  Shipping was fast and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Great lotion!  No fragrance!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this lotion to help with a very stubborn patch of eczema on my leg, but to my surprise, it has also helped with my dry heels!  Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a medication, and a darn good one! It used to be by prescription only and it turned my rough keratosis pilaris patches into normal feeling skin! If all you want is to make your healthy skin a bit softer, you&#x27;re looking at the wrong thing. It has a slight odor (really not bad and dissipates quickly) and can leave your skin a bit sticky, but it works! When you have a moderate to severe skin condition those &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; are nothing. I&#x27;m more than willing to tolerate a slight odor if it means I can actually touch my upper arms and legs without feeling awful about myself.&lt;br /&gt;For best results, use it 2x a day. Once your symptoms clear you may be able to use it once a day instead. If you stop using it, the symptoms will come back. It&#x27;s a treatment, not a cure.</li>
            <li> My Husband uses this product for his skin because he is diabetic.  It helps prevent very dry skin.  He has used it for a number of years.</li>
            <li> This makes dry blistery cold Winters a bit more bearable.</li>
            <li> I went online to try and find a product that wld help with my super duper scaly dry skin, that&#x27;s when I found Amlactin! I decided to order it and give it a try! Delivery was fast n I must say this product is better than great! My skin is now super duper silky soft I love it and plan to buy it over n over again!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a professional dermatologist. I had been suffering as a young teenager with keratosis pilaris. It covers mostly my legs, buttocks, and backside of my upper arms. I have been using this and only this for over ten years now. I don&#x27;t know that there is anything else better. (If there is, someone please let me know). This cream is very effective against my troubled skin. It is more of a challenge to keep the bumps down in the winter time, but I guess I could apply it more regularly too. I hesitate sometimes because of the somewhat strong ammonia smell and I wonder how this and the acids may harm my skin in the long run. Still, the benefit outweighs any other complaints.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for getting rid of those little dry skin bumps on the back of your arms!</li>
            <li> This lotion works really well in controlling the bumps and dry skin on the backs of my arms (Keratosis Pilaris). I used to use Eucerin and had decent results. I took a chance on this and like it better. I like that the consistency is thinner with this lotion which allows you to use less to cover more, resulting in cost savings. I do find that if I skip a couple of days without putting it on that the bumps quickly return. So for me, it is a daily application.</li>
            <li> Smells like ammonia, but keeps my skin soft. I don&#x27;t like using it directly after shaving because it burns and makes the follicles red. I use a much creamier, moisturizing lotion on the days I shave. But on other days, it gently exfoliates my skin, keeps it nice a moisturized, and prevents ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the only things I don&#x27;t like is the smell and the burning on shave days. But I have incredibly sensitive dry skin, so it&#x27;s not surprising.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  It was very watery and didn&#x27;t do the job that I expected it to do on my skin. I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Recommended by dermatologists world wide</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this to me. I have tried so many &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; creams and lotions. None have come close to Amlactin for greatly reducing my dry skin, especially on my heels.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this lotion after my shower at night, I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin. It is a lot softer, and I have fewer KP bumps. My legs are also a lot easier to shave. I am so happy to have found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this helps smooth kp bumps, but it does not get rid of the redness. I&#x27;m sure I would have to go to the dermatologist to get a topical steroid to help with that.</li>
            <li> If this works, you wouldn&#x27;t know it from my skin.  The bottle suggests applying twice daily.  Okay, that would mean stripping down and basting myself in this slightly off-smelling lotion, morning and night, never missing an application.  Did I mention that it&#x27;s kinda pricey?  Also the texture is thin and wet so it&#x27;s easy to spread, but I&#x27;m putting on my clothes still feeling damp.  I don&#x27;t enjoy it so I don&#x27;t use it much so no luck clearing the KP.  Oh well, they&#x27;re only little bumps so who cares anyway?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it several weeks, it does make my skin soft and not greasy.I think it has helped some with the KP, I use another exfolient in the shower first then this lotion right after and they seem to be helping with the KP.&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 things I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;1 - the price&lt;br /&gt;2 - the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to be fragrance free but it literally smells like cat pee when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;I will use the bottle up but I won&#x27;t buy it again because of this scent. It is the ammonium causing that smell I think.</li>
            <li> I received it on time without any problems, wrapped perfectly and unwrapped as well. The moisturizing lotion is excellent we did have it on subsciption until they did away with the smaller bottle. But are very happy with the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li> I received a travel size sample of Amlactin body lotion (2 oz.) along with a body cream from their Facebook promotion. I have really dry skin and during winter season tends to increase the problem. I was happy with the size of the bottle I received as sample. After opening the bottle and smelling it I was a little disappointed, it smelled like a prescribed medicated lotion. Personally I would have preferred some sweet smell in it. It is very effective though for dry skin. After applying the lotion my skin felt a bit greasy for a while but eventually the greasiness went away, leaving the skin a silky feeling. The skin remains moisturized for a long time and for best result it should be applied twice daily. I don’t think the lotion exfoliates the skin as it says on the product. The lotion takes its time to get absorbed in the skin. I won’t spend money buying this lotion until I have some serious dry patches that will not go away with regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with back acne that I struggle with as an adult. Since I have started using it I have gotten no more pimples and the marks on my back are slowly fading. I am ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li> The sounds like a giant hyperbole, I know. But this is really the most accurate way I can describe this product and what it&#x27;s done for me, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had pretty terrible eczema all my life.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of medicine including herbal remedies to little or no effect. As I grew up I just learned to live with it and accept it as a part of my life. Winters in the northeast were terrible - itching, dry flaky skin, redness, etc. My skin would get so dry and red it would crack and bleed. On any given day in January I would almost always have some sort of open or healing wound on my skin. My face and scalp is constantly flaking and shedding. Not only was this painful, this did a number of my self esteem as people would constantly assume that I didn&#x27;t shower or I was just gross. I became very ashamed of my skin and simply didn&#x27;t talk about it even to my regular doctors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to my late twenties when I got a good job and I paid for great health insurance. I took it upon myself to see a dermatologist and among many other creams and topical ointments, she recommended me Amlactin as a daily moisturizer. At first I was extremely skeptical as I have literally tried every lotion and cream worth its salt on the market. I&#x27;ve paid ridiculous amounts of money for tiny jars of expensive exotic creams with promises of eczema and psoriasis relief only to be left with dozens of partially used bottles of useless crap lying around the house. Literally everything felt great being lathered on after a shower but within a few hours even the thickest creams rubbed off or evaporated to the point as if I&#x27;ve put no lotion on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when after a long day, I come home and realized my skin was as soft and smooth as the morning when I put this lotion on. This was a real winner. My skin has never been this soft or smooth. I&#x27;ve never had a winter where I wasn&#x27;t a walking scab! No more blisters or cracked skin! I could actually take off my clothes in a pool or hot tub and not feel the staring eyes of people! This stuff is AMAZING! I literally bought another bottle two weeks into my first bottle for fear of the company discontinuing this stuff! (It did not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion works by having a small amount of lactic acid. It will dissolve the top layer of dead skin and work its way DEEP INTO your skin, not just cover it up. Once you put it on, it gets in there - really REALLY gets in there and stays there. The acid does burn a little but it&#x27;s not terrible pain but a slight tingling sensation and wayyyy more tolerable than blisters or bleeding cracks. The result is smoothness - like butter in the hot sun smoothness. I will touch my skin hours after treatment and wonder if it belongs to me because it feels so foreign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is fairly pricey, around $22-25 a bottle, but you get a BIG 20z bottle! Not some dinky two squirt bottle. This thing will last me about two months in the winter (I use it about 2x every day for full body coverage) and 3-4 months in other seasons. For around $100 a year, I can deal with the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some slight burning/tingling sensation when you use it. Some people report burning, I don&#x27;t find it bothersome or painful. Whatever sensations I get with this usually subsides within a few minutes anyways. If you use this on an open cut though, it will sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned above, AMLACTIN does eat away a a layer of dead skin so it is helpful for keratosis pilaris (KP), which I also have as a result of the eczema. My arm and legs which have the most KP are a lot clearer since I started using Amlactin due to the dead skin cells being dissolved away. I&#x27;m still working on the rest of my body but I feel like I have new skins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they don&#x27;t recommend using this, I have when I didn&#x27;t have my face ointment available and the results are usually better than my RX facial ointment. The tingling/burning sensation is a bit worse on  your face than body as your face is more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell does take some time to get used to. It has an acidic smell to it. It&#x27;s not terribly strong, but given the alternatives I&#x27;ll take it. It usually subsides within a few minutes anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, BUY THIS LOTION!sation is a bit worse on  your face than body as your face is more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell does take some time to get used to. It has an acidic smell to it. It&#x27;s not terribly strong, but given the alternatives I&#x27;ll take it. It usually subsides within a few minutes anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, BUY THIS LOTION!</li>
            <li> I was born with a dry skin condition called ichtheosis, disease of the fish. It is not a serious problem, but it is annoying, especially in the winter when my skin becomes so dry that I can cover the floor around me with dead skin when I scratch the itchy places. For years I tried just about every lotion on the market. When I discovered AmLactin I discovered the proverbial gold. It defoliates the skin better than anything. By using it daily I now have baby skin in some places. AmLactin is not a cure for the currently incurable ichtheosis, but it&#x27;s the best over the counter thing out there. The only draw back is that it is rather expensive. However, you don&#x27;t need much of it to spread over affected parts, in my case most of my body.</li>
            <li> I used to use presciption lotion which went up to $90 a bottle.  Read these ingredients and they are the same.  VERY satisfied with this product.  Silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a fair moisturizer but don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  I try not to use this on my hands because I found out the hard way that if I rub my eyes for any reason after having this on my hands, my eyes burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> Use as my face lotion also, Helps exfolliate.</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is basically magic for the dermatitis on my fingers. I&#x27;ve been using steroids for years...it grows in effective after a while.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different lotions over and over for so long. I saw this product on The Meredith Viera Show when she had one of the top Dermatologist on and she recommended this lotion.  It does everything she said it would; I had not used any lotion on my feet for a whole week and then I used this twice a day for three days and what a difference it made. Now I use it regularly and even though I love to go for my pedis I really wouldn&#x27;t need to. Even my regular pedi girl cannot believe how wonderful this works. You will definitely not be disappointed !!!!</li>
            <li> Look no further. This is simply the best. I ask myself where this lotion has been my entire life. My skin is finally silky soft. I am amazed and in love.</li>
            <li> Best thing since peanut butter.  Dermatologist recommended it years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of specialized foot cremes for my dry, cracked heels.  My dermatologist gave me a sample of AmLactin and in 2 days I noticed a difference, within 2 weeks my heels and back of ankles are soft and smooth.  Great for dry knees and elbows too.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works for KP!!!!!!  I can&#x27;t believe it.  For the first time in 10 years I have found something that helps my KP.  Couldn&#x27;t be more happy!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I thought the lotion would be thicker.  I should have bought the cream instead.  The lotion is very watery</li>
            <li> Have been using this lotion for over a year, does a good job, and Amazon has a lower price then the local stores.</li>
            <li> Way better price on amazon than in store, it&#x27;s the same price for a smaller bottle at wal-mart.  I use this after I shower on my upper arms/biceps and the sides of my torso to help relieve folliculitis and keratosis pilaris.  I have also noticed that my hands have less dry skin and less hang nails (bonus!)</li>
            <li> Best lotion we&#x27;ve tried for very dry skin.  It  works great though a little expensive it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I was so blown away with this lotion I had to. I have had Keratosis Pilaris my whole life on and off and lately it got REALLY bad again on the backs of my arms. I was trying everything and nothing was helping. I kept researching and came across this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. No lie, in TWO DAYS it&#x27;s all gone. I am so over the moon! In fact, all of my skin is so soft and feels better than it&#x27;s been for a long time and all the bumps are gone. I had to share the love. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic for psoriasis, eczema, extremely rough, dry skin. Often will sting due to high -- effective AHA content. I hand mix with Eucerin pump lotion for my legs in the winter and his shins and dry feet. Great price on Amazon to boot.</li>
            <li> Consistently a good cream for my arms, legs and feet.  The slight acetic mix seems to take car of sores, cuts or spots on my skin.. Its super!</li>
            <li> I hope it will work on chicken skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years to help with dry skin.  It&#x27;s best to use it right after you shower and while your skin is still wet so it will hold in the moisture.  Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so costly.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF........ESPECIALLY ON FEET &amp; LEGS.</li>
            <li> Seen this product in our fitness magazine. Love this product. No more itching and keeps my skin refreshed. When you first start using , you have a tingling sensation. That is the alpha hydroxy talking... From the wife of this account holder. I may add , that you may need to use a mild loofah once or twice a week.  USE lotion after every shower.</li>
            <li> You cannot lose off this product it does do it job work wonders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had troubled skin my entire life! Sensitive, dry and I even suffer with eczema once in a while. I tried using cocoa butter lotions and numerous other greasy ones and it&#x27;s safe to say that Amlactin gave me the best results! My legs always felt bumpy and rough whether I shaved and applied lotion immediately after. It always felt rough and there was nothing I could do about it (that&#x27;s what I thought). I got on amazon one day and typed in, &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; and the first item that appeared on the page was Amlactin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week my legs were noticeably smoother! I would run my hands up and down my legs and it felt like heaven! I haven&#x27;t been able to do that in years without feeling bad cause all I felt were little bumps. My mom even noticed herself! I was so shocked by the results that I went to target and purchased 8 more mini bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amlactin does smell HIGHLY medicated, and it does irritate my nose. However, the smells goes away within 5 to 10 minutes. So I wouldn&#x27;t worry about that. Right after you take a shower and after you smother on some Amlactin, within 10 minutes you&#x27;ll only smell the soap you used on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can bear the smell I would highly suggest this to anyone with rough bumpy skin. And if you can&#x27;t bear the smell, I feel bad cause the results provided are absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY AMLACTIN!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have found that smooths the bumps on the backs of my arms. It smells faintly of ammonia when you put it on, but that goes away quickly and leaves behind no fragrance. I use AmLactin year round. It is light, never oily. It seems to prevent ingrown hairs caused by shaving.</li>
            <li> Had previously been getting this lotion at a pharmacy, just found out how to order online.  Good move on my part, will continue to purchase it online.</li>
            <li> It has made a big difference in my skin.  I tend to have very dry skin and using Amlactin after my shower has noticeably improved the  moisture and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this stuff, my keratosis has reduced drastically, my feet are baby-soft and the sun spots on my face are gone, too! The only drawback is that it smells a bit like hair bleach (after all it DOES have a high alpha hydroxy acid content), but once your skin absorbs it the smell is gone. I will NEVER use another moisturizer again!</li>
            <li> I hesitate to write a review about this product because I want everyone to think my skin just naturally looks this fantastic!</li>
            <li> I just got his product and it came unseal and open, what guarantees do I have that this is a legit and unused product? Completely unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> Best out the doc recommend this, wow, no work dry skin if used daily</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and really works, but you have to use it regularly for optimum results.&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like the convenience of having it delivered right to my door when I order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer out there, to no avail.  In winter, my finger tips and heels split and sometimes bleed; I used to go to bed with neosporin and bandaids all over my hands and feet.  A cousin-in-law suggested this and it&#x27;s is the first time in 20 years I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with splitting skin.  I sent some to my Mom and she has had the same fantastic experience.  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny because it works and you only have to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Ok so I almost wish this stuff didn&#x27;t work so well. It works super well, but it&#x27;s not exactly all natural which is what I prefer. Am I still using it? Yes I am! It&#x27;s a little on the sticky side, but OMG if  you&#x27;re in my age bracket (57) it helps so much with the horrible dry alligator skin that makes you look like you&#x27;re a million frigging years old. With the first time applying it, it was instantaneous in improving my skin. I use it all over my body including my face. The one thing I would caution you with is make sure you don&#x27;t leave yourself unprotected in the Sun. You will regret it. You will burn super fast. So either cover up or use a good quality sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my skin doc for dry skin. It works.</li>
            <li> Hey&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review because the Amlactin did not work for .Although It can be a moisturizer but does not clear away my Keratosis pilaris . I think I would have to use a stronger version with more lactic acid.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> First of, I&#x27;m 29 years old and always thought I had &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; on my bum... and used all types of over the counter acne medication and it would never make a difference. As a teenager, I just thought this was something I had to live with until I got older. Fast forward ten years and I still had the problem. I figured this could not be acne and finally went a dermatologist who confirmed it was keratosis pilaris, which then caused acne like issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product 3 times a day, everyday, for the last two-three weeks and it has cleared up my keratosis pilaris on my bum. Miracles do happen! As a woman, its quite embarrassing to have, what looks like acne, in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, it does take a few weeks to notice any affects and it doesn&#x27;t absorb right away but who really can complain about that if it clears your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some complaints about the smell, I didn&#x27;t really notice it and it does go a way after its fully absorbed...so not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT is expensive but I really could care less because it has given me beautiful clear skin... worth-the-price.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin that flakes very noticeably. Our family doctor recommended this product and we found the best price on Amazon. We were really surprised when it worked so good. No more flakes. It&#x27;s also not messy or real greasy like some lotions of this type.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this several times, both from Amazon and from the store. It is the only product that seems to make any difference in keratosis pilaris (commonly called &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;). In my opinion, this stuff smells horrible... but as I said, it is the only thing that seems to help. You have to use it daily. My dermatologist actually suggested using this 2x a day in conjunction with a steroid foam (to reduce the inflammation). I have never been able to be that consistent with it but when I was it helped. The bottle you can get from Amazon is huge and will last a while, plus it is a better value than the stores near me which sell small bottles for $14 dollars.</li>
            <li> I have patches of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, and in the past I have had to resort to prescription steroid creams to relieve my symptoms.  My psoriasis flares during stress and weather changes, and I had been having some bad cracking and bleeding lately, with no time to make an appointment with my GP. I saw this in the store and decided to try it before reading up on it, knowing that lactic acid is a good exfoliant.  Previously I had tried an OTC psoriasis remedy with coal tar--it worked, but also stung and was smelly and stained clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, a week later and my scales are all but gone!  No more itching, no more flakes, and the only scales left are on my elbow, always my worst patch of skin.  The other areas affected are showing healthy pink skin.  I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, after a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance.  I may try using it on my face, sparingly, in the winter when there&#x27;s less sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons--if you try to apply too much of this lotion at once it won&#x27;t soak in very well. So use a little at a time.  Also, if you have cracks or bleeding in your skin it will sting, but not for long. The stinging is not as bad as it was with the coal tar ointment I tried!</li>
            <li> This works very well on my X-linked ichthyosis.  It doesn&#x27;t remove the scales but it makes them a lot less noticeable for extended periods of time. Also it doesn&#x27;t burn that much when you put it on dry broken skin.  It maybe stings in places for about a minute and then it&#x27;s fine!  The urea smell is only strong for about 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot.  It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> good lotion mt podiatrist recommended it</li>
            <li> AmLactin works by exfoliating the outer-most skin layers boosting your skin&#x27;s cellular turnover rate all the while moisturizing your new skin. I got this originally for keratosis pilaris on my arms about 6 months ago but I now use this on my entire body due to the fact that it has given my skin so meany benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@@@ WHAT ITS DONE FOR ME:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Healthy glowing skin/DEEPLY moisturized!!!- Noticed after 3 days - As it exfoliates I almost NEVER manually do it to glow. Its like wearing shimmer lotion all the time but my palms aren&#x27;t gold and i can touch things without turning it to glitter...best of all it doesn&#x27;t wash off ;)I never get \\&quot;dry\\&quot; even in winter also my ENTIRE BODY FEELS LIKE SILK!!! SILK I TELL YOU THE ENTIRE TIME!!!!&lt;br /&gt;***Healed heals, knees,elbows,AND NO MORE HANGNAILS!!!!!- Noticed after 7 days- Didn&#x27;t you read that silk comment? ENTIRE BODY!I had dry, rough, cracking heals and it turned into \\&quot;I just got a pedicure\\&quot; kind of soft and smooth. I&#x27;ll never touch another pumice stone again!My hands are soft and smooth and I never get hang nails. My knees and elbows have also been turned to silk even if i only use it on those areas 1 or 2 times a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Fixed blemishes, CLARITY!!!!!- Noticed after 2-6 weeks/6 months- WOW had no idea it would solve my body acne! I am about 99.9% clear on my back and chest and i had mild/moderate body acne. My Keratosis Pilaris was resolved by the 6th week. Recently (at the 6+ month mark) i noticed my Freckles/hyperpigmentation have almost faded to flawless making my skin tone unified. Also all the scars have flattened out even my really bad ones They also are getting more \\&quot;skin colored\\&quot; some have even vanished! ALSO I noticed I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs when i shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***CAN USE IT ON MY FACE!!!!- I started retin-a recently and the flakey skin bit really isn&#x27;t fun...but luckily AmLactin nips that right in the butt and makes retin-a not so sucky. My face also feels sooo moisturized without being oily and dare i say it it feels like it has balanced out the oil on my face giving it a dewy appearance. My face feels like it can breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***PEOPLE OF COLOR!!!!!- Recommended this to a few friends who were having issues with their lotions . Few had issues with breakouts, few had problems with the residue, few needed more moisture, and most had ASHY issues. They all agree that this is the best product that they have used that completely eliminated the ashy bits and you know all the other amazing things that ive stated. All also said that it had brightened up their skin and have lightened slightly this is after 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some drawbacks for me as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@@@ DRAWBACKS:&lt;br /&gt;***Smell- its like ammonia but dose go away after an hour and if i sprayed my cologne over top of it the smell notes were distorted.&lt;br /&gt;***Sun sensitivity- Kind of a no brainier but as you constantly have \\&quot;new\\&quot; skin now its easier to burn&lt;br /&gt;***Application- if you have a cut or just shaved it stings a bit...you must also wait till you are 100% dry before putting this on or it will not work. sunless tanner gets eaten after a day with this stuff too...no fake and bake.&lt;br /&gt;***GOALS-This stuff takes what feels like forever to clear up KP but if you stick with it you won&#x27;t regret it! BE PATIENT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ha sorry if this has been a long one but this is the first time ive reviewed something and wanted to be as thorough as I can with my personal experience and the experience of a few friends. I think Amlactin is a fantastic product and you shouldn&#x27;t hesitate to try it out as it dose so meany in one! just stick with it, be patient, and enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also at Costco the big bottle is $16 i believe (cheapest place to get it) and here is a coupon&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE 8/26/12***** Costco(at least in my area) now only carries the new 20oz bottle with pump &amp; is now 19.50&lt;br /&gt;[amlactin DOT com/print-save-enjoy]&lt;br /&gt;so you can save more!&lt;br /&gt;*****UPDATE 8/9/12**** AmLactin has Changed their bottles check their website to see updated packaging pictures They</li>
            <li> It was a fluke that I bought this. They didn&#x27;t have my go-to lotion at the drug store, and there were a bunch of tourists that wouldn&#x27;t move out of the lotion aisle, so I grabbed the first unscented thing I saw. Holy guacamole am I glad I did. This stuff has saved my skin and given me back my quality of life. Seriously. I can&#x27;t stress this enough. And I&#x27;ve only been using it for four days. My face was a mess. For years. After a small eczema breakout in my mid-twenties, a dermatologist had me slather my face with a powerful corticosteroid. And then another. And another. Ten years went by and even years after I refused to put more poison on my face, I hadn&#x27;t recovered. The skin on my face was dry to point of cracking, and after we moved to an incredibly humid place, it was red, itchy, and peeling ALL THE TIME. People wouldn&#x27;t touch me because they thought I was contagious. Strangers wouldn&#x27;t look at me because I made them uncomfortable. It sucked, people. And doctors never seemed to know what to do, so eventually I gave up and tried everything under the sun to fix my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I wasn&#x27;t sure if this stuff was helping or hurting at first, I thought I&#x27;d include a log of how this stuff works (which I looked for when I first started using it). I&#x27;ll update throughout the next few weeks for folks that are looking for a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*note: you are not supposed to put this on your face. I put it on mine because I was desperate. There is a warning on the label. So use it on your face at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 1: Omg. It burns!!!! My face was like a mask of dryness, and I thought I was having an allergic reaction. But I decided to give it a few days to see. I&#x27;d read so many testimonials about this stuff that I really wanted it to work, but to be honest, I didn&#x27;t have a whole lot of hope. I started using it twice a day, even though it felt like acid on my rashed-out face. I did use some Aveeno mid-morning and mid-afternoon to ease the discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 2: Still burns! Maybe even worse. But I rubbed my face down with a soft washcloth and to my surprise there was skin under there! Not flaky, not red and irritated, but just normal skin. I felt hopeful, but tried not to put too much stock into it. The lines on my forehead decreased, too, though my skin was still really flaky. The amlactin seemed to push stuff to the surface too, and I got a few blemishes on my cheeks, but they were small and not too painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 3: Woke up very flaky, but after I washed my face I noticed that there was very little blotchiness. My whole face flaking out had been reduced to just a few dry spots. My blemishes were healing fast. It still burned a little when I put the lotion on, but not horribly painfully so. I had more energy. The skin on my face was tighter, but in a good way. I looked a few years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 4 (today): I look ten years younger. There is still a little flaking, but not so much that I&#x27;m embarrassed to show my face. In fact, I look really good. My skin is smooth and there is no redness. The skin under my eyes is not saggy, my forehead has hardly any lines, and I am not itchy. The blemishes the lotion brought out are almost gone. I am a normal person. I did not have to supplement with Aveeno today. I didn&#x27;t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep adding updates as I need to. But I am so far incredibly thankful I found this stuff. It&#x27;s given me my life back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DAY 7: I got carded at the grocery store! And I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties. This stuff is the cat&#x27;s pajamas. All the dry spots on my face have smoothed out. I have a few marks from blemishes, but they are fading fast. I had planned on getting my skin to a good enough point to wear foundation makeup, but I don&#x27;t need to any more. My skin looks better every day. I&#x27;m still having problems with my neck area, but that&#x27;s because I got a really bad heat rash on it the other day. It&#x27;s going to take some time to fix ten years&#x27; worthof damage, but with results like these, I&#x27;m a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 10: I&#x27;ve had a horrid reaction that I&#x27;m afraid might be tied to this lotion. My face is a mess. I&#x27;m deeply depressed at the thought that I&#x27;ll have to find something else again. I&#x27;m leaving the rating because it works quite well everywhere but my face. Any suggestions for better options for face cream would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the BEST lotion on the market for smoothing and re-texturizing skin.  And this is a way better price than retail.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris, a skin condition that leaves red bumps and dry patches on my skin. I bought this lotion after a reviewer on another website said it&#x27;s the only thing she&#x27;s found to keep it at bay. I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks, about every other day after I shower, and it has noticeably helped, clearing up the redness and making my skin so much more smooth.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best cream for dry skin I have ever tried. My feet are sooooo soft and my winter-time alligator legs must have gone south for the winter. My hands are looking better than ever. This is now a bed side staple. Better than all the \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li> I have battled keratosis pilaris on my upper arms for years.  My dermatologist prescribed this lotion to me in the past, but now it is in an OTC version.  It is helpful to reduce the swelling and redness associated with those dreadful red bumps.  In my experience, though, you need to start with a topical steroid cream for a couple of weeks before using this to get the best benefit.  It is also a slow process and takes months to correct.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything like it. I only use this every few days, but after the first  2 applications, I could already feel a marked difference. I was looking for a different brand, and found this and decided to try it. It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but completely worth it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me.  It is supposed to be fragrance free, but it smells Awful. However, I added a few drops of essential oils and voila, smell is almost gone. At least it is bearable.  I&#x27;m still experimenting and may add a drop or two more.  I used eucalyptus oil.  I will try lavender next.</li>
            <li> The best.  My dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! My skin is noticeably softer and smoother. My family likes it, but thinks it smells weird. It&#x27;s not the best fragrance, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin and many products bother me.  My primary care physician recommended this because she was pretty sure I&#x27;d like it.  It made my skin soft, it was absorbed quickly, and it made me itch like crazy.  Absolutely unusable.</li>
            <li> This lotion will do amazing things for your dry skin, starting after just one application.  Also, a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> We purchased this lotion at the advice of our pediatrician for my 18 month old twins who both suffer from dry skin and ecsema. After only a few days with AmLactin, we noticed a huge difference. Definitely worth paying a bit more for the good stuff!</li>
            <li> Only been using this product for two weeks now and I occasionaly forget to use it everyday, but it seems to be helping a little so far.  Maybe if I try to use it more everyday it can help further.  A good lotion can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> For those purchasing Amlactin lotion.  Use an essential oil, rose lavender, ginger. the list is long.  A few drops to each bottle gives a faint scent that is very nice</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I&#x27;ve used religiously for many, many years.  Great exfoliant and keeps winter skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I had some blocked hair follicles resulting in little bumps, this lotion got rid of the bumps. The lactic acid in it helps to exfoliate the skin so over time the skin feels sooo much smoother. It took maybe a month of daily use for me to see a difference, my dermatologist was impressed. It IS expensive if you get it at the store but like another reviewer said, getting it  here or costco is your best bet.</li>
            <li> My feet have crazy cuticles, lots of white, yet other lotion, pumice and more can&#x27;t keep them looking nice. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS FOR ME!</li>
            <li> Used twice daily as directed over a three week period. I did not get the results I&#x27;d hoped for but I did see SOME positive results and still use as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I will say this product gives good results for softening and smoothing rough patches and skin at least feels more healthy. Some raised bumps possibly got smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This product did nothing to reduce the tiny red spots and bumps that others have seen reduced or eliminated.  Perhaps I didn&#x27;t use it long enough? But I would have expected some improvement over 3 weeks. I discontinued frequent use because I frequent the outdoors and this stuff attracts an instant sunburn. The smell isn&#x27;t  a deal breaker, but it&#x27;s not what I would call desirable.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion along with Tree Hut&#x27;s original shea body butter as my daily regimen. I was told of AmLactin by my doctor as an alternative to an Alpha Hydroxy prescription lotion. I have been using AmLactin for almost 4 years and the cracks and patches on my skin are virtually invisible. There are times where I might have a hang nail or a cut on my skin and I forget about it. Be aware that when you place this lotion on a cut or opening it will burn for a second, and it sometimes can be unpleasant. You get more for your money because a 17.6 oz bottle of AmLactin is never more than 24 dollars, and a 8 oz of the similar brand Lac-Hydrin Five is 15 dollars at a store like CVS.</li>
            <li> Smells like ammonia :(</li>
            <li> It leaves a very chemical smell on my skin until I shower it off. Even after a full day, I can&#x27;t get over it. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it enough to see any effects because I don&#x27;t even want to wear it at home.</li>
            <li> I have widespread keratosis pilaris and after only a few days, I can see a difference!  It also helped smooth the skin on my face which wasnt even why i bought it! I cant recommend it enough, great product!</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dermatologist for the bumps on her upper arms, and it really helps smooth things out.  She&#x27;s very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Sorry, this stuff just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Most lotions don&#x27;t do much for my skin and this one was no different.</li>
            <li> I have to say, at first, I didn&#x27;t like it. But...then...I had a big problem, a new burn, and I started to use it regularly. It truly helped the burn once it started to heal. Now I grab it first. It really does heal your skin. I use it every night. It also helped my feet and made the skin on my feet feel so smooth. My ingrown nail problem is almost gone.</li>
            <li> When winter comes this is the only thing that works for me. Otherwise my hands are in total misery, cracking and flaky. The rest of the year I do fine with just about any moisturizer. Last year I had a friend say nothing helped her hands and I shared my Almactin. She&#x27;s sold --- her hands cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from keratosis pilaris all my life and after extensive research I found out about AmLactin. I was a little put off by the price at first, and it was hard to find. However, it is well worth every penny and the extra drive. I use it at least once a day and it has done wonders. The only thing you MUST know is that this causes sun-sensitivity! If you like to tan then this may not be for you! You will become more prone to burning!!!</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite lotion for exceptionally dry skin. In the old days, it was prescription-only, and my doctor prescribed it for me after I finished a course of accutane which killed my sebaceous glands. Needless to say, I have exceptionally dry skin. AmLactin and its sister product, LacHydrin, keep my skin soft and moisturized for days on end. The only downside is that it has a bit of a funky scent, but it absorbs quickly and the smell disappears. I like to use it before bed (after a shower) to really let it soak into my skin. It also clears up keratosis pilaris (aka chicken skin) on the arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no addicted to this lotion.  At first I was apprehensive as it was very thin, but the lotion is very lubricating and not sticky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do much for my skin besides make it smooth. Expensive for a product that will do the same thing as a cheaper product would. I bought it for my keratosis pilaris, but it hasn&#x27;t helped it.</li>
            <li> This lotion works fine but smells kind of chemically and is a thinner lotion. My dermatologist recommended using this lotion or CeraVe Renewing System, SA Renewing Cream for the psoriasis on the soles of my feet. I prefer the thicker, more emollient, feel of the CeraVe for my feet. This AmLactin seems okay for the rest of the body, but again, I don&#x27;t really care for the chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Have a dry skin issue on my feet occasionally (not athlete&#x27;s foot). I wash my feet and apply the lotion. It is quick absorbing and keeps&lt;br /&gt;my feet smooth. I really enjoy this product. I&#x27;ve tried other foot lotions, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> i have wicked keratosis pilarsis, since i was a kid;  got super bad after i had my baby.  and i was the lucky recipient of some awful postpartum eczema!  i&#x27;ve been using this for LESS THAN A WEEK, and have seen a great improvement.  the bumps are so much smoother, little eczema patches are disappearing.  the redness is starting to fade as well.  will post an updated review after a few more weeks, but i couldn&#x27;t wait to share the results i&#x27;m getting after only 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also being fair-skinned, i&#x27;m layering a daily spf over this, as recommended.  don&#x27;t want to chance a sunburn--my arms are already red enough!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic! I have really bad scaly, dry legs. No lotion helps and its dry all season long. This helps a ton and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> works well, super lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only thing that helped my very, very dry skin. I&#x27;d tried pretty much everything to no avail. Nothing really made it better. My dermatologist recommended it to me because of how cracked and painful my skin on both my feet and my ankles were. Works like a charm. I was actually surprised by how well it worked when used twice a day. Esp. put it on after you shower or right before you get into bed. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not, however, put this on more than the recommended twice a day. My skin started getting a flaky peel thing going on. (Must be the acids) Once I went back to twice daily, I had no problems again. You also have to be careful about going into the sun with the areas you apply it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how much this lotion has helped me. I can tell if I skip a day or two bc my dry skin comes back. Seriously, this stuff WORKS!  And Amazon has it cheaper than Walmart or Target!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be the miracle for my arm bumps &amp; ingrown leg hairs but alas it doesn&#x27;t do much besides moisturize very well. Also careful when applying to broken skin- it will burn for awhile.</li>
            <li> Love love this lotion, I thought I would be forever plagued with bumpy skin especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes to remove the unsightly Keratosis pilaris on my upper arms. So far so good. My skin is extremely soft and the lotion doesn&#x27;t have any scent whatsoever. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because there are some bumps still present, but I&#x27;ve read other reviews that have said it takes awhile for it to completely get rid of them so now we wait...</li>
            <li> I am a African-American woman and I have Kerotis Pilaris in the worst way.  I have it all over my legs, upper thighs lower thighs, breasts, on my elbows.  I have tried every product out there for it,  With Eucerin supposing to be the best product for excema and the like. I&#x27;ve used Eucerin and Aveeno products on and off for years.  I&#x27;ve seen some softening of my skin but not to my satisifaction.  So when I read the reviews about this lotion I was anxious to try it because I had never heard of it, my dermotologist at the time certainly didn&#x27;t recommend it, he recommended using Cetaphil products which are okay.  I&#x27;ve used this lotion for two works and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin getting softer, but the back of my thighs still feel rough and I use this product nearly everyday.  I&#x27;m really wanting it work, so I plan on sticking with it until I use it all up. I&#x27;ve read that there is no cure for KP, and this lotion hasn&#x27;t made the bumps disappear, but I just want softer skin for myself.</li>
            <li> I would put this up against any high dollar facial moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li> I have touchy skin that flares up at a whim.  My dermatologist recommended this product. The hydroxy component leaves the skin smooth and clean. It is not available everywhere but I looked it up at Amazon and so I didn&#x27;t have to search for availability at nearby stores.</li>
            <li> Got in time, but pump was not functional. Having difficult time to use it. Did not know how to contact seller.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this lotion for my sensitive skin on my arms that was getting bumpy and agitated. Seems to be working well to make my skin less irritated. But feels gross. Doesn&#x27;t soak in well. My skin is slimy when it gets wet even hours after application.</li>
            <li> This is a cream that really works on dry skin. It irritated my neck, which I was unhappy about. The rest of my body stays soft, and I never have flaky skin anymore!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff except for one really BIG problem.  It&#x27;s advertised as being 20 oz.  The container I got was only 14.7 oz.</li>
            <li> Great product. excellent service.</li>
            <li> Makes me nice and juicy.</li>
            <li> I have had little bumps on my arms and legs since I was very young.  My dermatologist recommended this lotion, and it does keep them away! I live rather rurally, so this product is hard to find in stores, but worth it to order online.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the product, originally, to moisturize my face after working out and showering at the gym.  At first, it felt a little \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, but my face really did feel (and look) better.  The unexpected benefit is that my thumbs no longer split/crack in the winter from drying out (at the corner of the thumb-nail).  For the last two winters (north-central Illinois) my hands have been softer and crack-free!  I&#x27;ve recommended the product to some friends with dry hands and they also love it.</li>
            <li> Made my skin soft at first, then I started to get red itchy spots. I developed a reaction to the acid in it. Won&#x27;t buy again. Too strong.</li>
            <li> Item was received in damaged condition. Part of the lotion leaked from the bottle. I returned item for refund.</li>
            <li> I read in one of my pharmacy textbooks about this lotion. My skin gets dry/chapped/yucky in the winter. I&#x27;ve been trying desperately to prevent this from happening. My textbook said to find a lotion with 12% Lactic Acid. I came on Amazon and found this, ordered it right away. There is NO smell whatsoever which I am happy with. Lotions that smell nice generally don&#x27;t work for me. It does feel a little greasy/sticky when first applied, but this goes away after a few minutes. The results are awesome! My hands aren&#x27;t getting chapped and we have started having some pretty cold days with high winds. I will keep using through the winter and update if this ends up not working. Also, my textbook says lotion should be applied within 3 minutes of getting out of a bath/shower while skin is still damp. I believe this is another key factor in my skin acting better this year.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen results after 2 weeks for KP treatment.  Expensive lotion that doesn&#x27;t work for the reason it was purchased.  It is great lotion otherwise and is non-oily.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference good quality lotion makes on your skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion cures dry skin. I do not go without it!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my Dermatologist for my extra dry skin.  It helps but is not perfect as it does not last all day.  It probably does more healing than I realize but like some other lotions better for all day comfort.  Sometimes I use both.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I did not purchase this lotion from Amazon.  I saw a review on Youtube that prompted me to try it. I ran out and bought it, put it on my dresser, and it sat there for about eight months.  About two weeks ago I decided to finally start using it. After showering I just lotioned using about a dime size or so for each body part. It wasn&#x27;t even a week before I could feel that my skin was softer. I just turned 50, so my skin has not seen this smoothness in a long time.  I found myself watching TV the other night just rubbing my calf because I&#x27;m just not use to my skin being this soft. I&#x27;m not a big product person when it comes to taking care of the skin on my body, which is why it took me so long to use it.  Sometimes we get caught up in the thrill of the hunt, so actually using a product isn&#x27;t nearly as fun as buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One piece of advice though is to rinse your hands after you apply if you are going to go on to do your makeup.  The lactic acid on your hands can irritate the skin around your eyes.  Took me several days to figure out the connection. But, as I said, this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> This really works better than I ever imagined a body lotion could. I recommend dry brushing first, then use this. There are plenty of videos on the internet on how to do this. Your skin will feel like a baby&#x27;s skin....I am not exaggerating! I will never buy another lotion again! (I bought the Yerba dry brush here on Amazon, FYI)</li>
            <li> This is a highly recommended (by dermatologists and skin care specialists) moisturizer for your body.  I like the larger size, and keep this stocked around the house.  Great product at a great price, you do not have to pay a lot for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter this winter do to the high winds and freezing temps.&lt;br /&gt;will buy again and again as we need in the Michigan Winters</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really helps my skin stay soft as it exfoliates and hydrates.</li>
            <li> I developed some small bumps on my arms over the summer and this lotion worked great!  After about 2 weeks I saw a noticeable difference and after about a month they were all gone.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent of this lotion, but it worked really well and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> AmLactin Cream USED to be a great product. I started using it years ago after my dermatologist recommended it for my dry winter skin. About a year ago I ran out of it and purchased a couple of new tubes. I noticed the tube looked different (it used to have a dark green cap), but there was no indication on the tube that the cream had changed. Upon using it, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED to discover it was much less effective than the original version. It seemed like a different product; its consistency was much looser than it had been and it smelled different. It didn&#x27;t \\&quot;last\\&quot; nearly as long as its predecessor.  I called the manufacturer because I was curious and spoke with a woman in the pharmacy department.  At first she said that only the packaging had changed.  After putting me on hold and checking with some others at the company, she told me that THE FORMULA CHANGED WHEN THE PACKAGING CHANGED. I&#x27;m now looking for a new solution to my dry skin problem...</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel super soft and moisturized. Improved my KP on my upper arms significantly as well along with proper exfoliation and use of sun screen prior to going into the sun!</li>
            <li> Another top notch review here. This lotion is great. I am 52 and have never really sunbathed too much so my skin was relatively soft anyway. Amylactin takes it to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so there is no seductive packaging, no subtle scent, but who cares!  This does all a great lotion is supposed to. After reading some of the other reviews, I amy have to start using it on my feet. My face?  Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, try it.</li>
            <li> This lotion was first recommend to me by my dermatologist to help with my mild KP. I got this at Costco for about $17. It smelled sort of like glue, but after applying the smell didn&#x27;t linger. The texture was sort of watery, but really helped with the KP, and I started using it everywhere I used my other lotion. Even though it&#x27;s thin, it really helps with dry skin, almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my KP, I use the Dermadoctor body scrub on my dry upper arms and let it sit there for about an hour. I rinse it completely off, scrubbing it as I rinse it, then apply lots of Amlactin, and my arms look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this lotion, even for the price. I would never be without it again!</li>
            <li> Good product and it is much cheaper than local store.</li>
            <li> top was broken off the pump</li>
            <li> Great for kerititis pilaris sufferers.</li>
            <li> I got this because of the reviews. The price was a bit high but I figured if it works good it would be worth it since lotion is something that last awhile. I bought this for a little more than twenty three dollars and Aveeno 18 ounce daily moisturizing lotion for just under ten dollars. I used this on my left arm and leg and the Aveeno on my right arm and leg. They both worked the same. Easy to apply, they both absorbed fast without feeling tacky or greasy afterwards. I recommend the Aveeno for less than half the price of this. Also, Amlactin has a terrible smell to it. I am not sensitive to smells but this has a horrible medicinal smell that I can feel in my eyes. It only lasts a few minutes but it is gross. I don&#x27;t notice a smell with Aveeno unless I intentionally put my nose close to it to smell it then it is very slight. Amlactin is also on the runny side so if a drop hangs from the applicator after you pump it it will drop and it spills from hands easily.</li>
            <li> If this doesn&#x27;t work for you, try gold bond rough and bumpy..</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for skin that has KP, is rough or extremely dry.  This lotion has lactic acid which may sting at first but does a great job of exfoliation and moisturizing.  Definitely do not apply to face or very delicate skin.  Also be careful about sun exposure  as this lotion can cause photosensitivity.</li>
            <li> bought this because its suppose to help with the little red bumps behind my arms. been using it for 2 months now and there hasn&#x27;t been any change at all. very disappointed since many other consumers have reported that it works. oh well.</li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite lotion! Really love the way my skin feels after using it.  Does a great job on cracked heels from sandal wear.  Don&#x27;t recommend using it on face, but love it otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; arms for years.  Went through literally gallons of every kind of lotion you can imagine.  I wised up and bought Amlactin to see if it would be any different.  Within a week, the skin on my arms is much smoother.  I use it on my feet and pretty much all over.  Aside from the weird &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> The lotion is wonderful and addressed my KP immediately. The lotion is worth the price and I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Amlactin does help my dry skin.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly for a non-greasy very soothing finish.  It was shipped promptly and delivered as promised.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the price.  it is rather pricey for a body lotion, but it does the job.I would recommend it for anyone who has not found the lotion needed to combat dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product is probably a great lotion ( My Dermatologist recommended it) So I bought 2 bottles and found out that I have an allergy  to this lotion. It gave me terrible rashes on my arms and neck. The company was very gracious in refunding me my full amount I paid for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream religiously and it has only improved my KP slightly. I must say while the lotion itself does sting a bit, it is an excellent lotion for those with really dry skin. It works amazing as a moisturizing cream!</li>
            <li> great transaction. Product as described</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my KP and dry winter skin! The bottle says use up to 2x daily, but once is definitely enough for me. It is a bit pricey, but well worth it. I slather it on my dry feet and then bundle with socks, for baby-soft tootsies. Also works well on the bum and back for any acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does contain alpha-hydroxy acid, so if you use it on skin that will be in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen since the acid leaves you more sensitive to UV light.</li>
            <li> My teenage girls use this for those little red bumps on the back of the arm - really keeps it under control.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great, got rid of the alligator skin on my legs</li>
            <li> Helps with the bumpies on the back of my arms. Works as advertised....use it for a couple weeks straight before you judge it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a day, but I already feel the effects on my hands. I&#x27;m a female with really dry, rough and huge  hands. Really embarrasing when your hands are more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; than your man&#x27;s. But this lotion makes my hands softer. Havent noticed much difference on the other parts of my body though.</li>
            <li> This is worth the price to eradicate keratosis pilaris, which, if you aren&#x27;t aware, is the little bumps you can get on your skin often referred to as \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; because of the way it looks and feels.  The condition can vary in severity and the bumps can be red like acne, white like whiteheads or not visible at all, but it makes your skin feel rough and bumpy.  Mine was the invisible version, everywhere except my lower legs, lower arms, neck and face.  Initially I used it every day in the morning and evening, and in about 3 days, my skin felt visibly smoother and in about a week, it was the smoothest and softest it&#x27;s ever been.  Once it got to that point, I only had to use it two or three times a week, once a day, to maintain the smooth skin. If you stop using it, the keratosis returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To maintain your newly soft and smooth skin, you might also consider using a non-comedogenic cleanser/body wash like Cetaphil.  Non-comedogenic products won&#x27;t clog your pores.  In addition, I also use the Buf Puf Back Scrubber with the double sided sponge on all areas where keratosis is a problem, which sluffs off the dead, rough skin. However, I have to say the Cetaphil and Buf Puf did not work on their own--Amlactin is the real cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars except it doesn&#x27;t smell so great--\\&quot;mediciny\\&quot; is a good description some other reviewers have shared.  It&#x27;s not horrible, but not a nice lotion smell.  It also takes longer than \\&quot;regular\\&quot; lotions to absorb into the skin and until it does, feels a little tacky-sticky.  If they could figure out how to make it smell better and absorb better, it would be an over-the-counter \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; lotion, worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this and it is great!!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant when a friend recommended this due to the cost. I thought &#x27;at over $1.00/oz this stuff better work miracles and dance jigs&#x27;. Now, miracles is a loaded word. And expecting a bottle of moisturizer to dance jigs was just an improbable request on my part. But it has been my personal miracle for my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story goes that my hair and my legs pretty much hate each other. It&#x27;s been a 10 year battle over who&#x27;s going to win this fight. And, ultimately, my hair was winning. It got so bad I had to stop shaving. I&#x27;m a 30 year old white, european woman with sensitive skin. I would get ingrown hairs no matter what I did. I tried typical moisturizers to allow the hair to grow outwards.. nope. Different razors: razors for men, women 4/5/6/10 blades, sea salt, with use of abrasive to try to loosen the skin, then shaved with oil, then moisturized.. nope. Nothing worked... I have stuff to do with smooth legs, people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this worked. It wasn&#x27;t instant. If you&#x27;re expecting instant results here you&#x27;re doing it wrong. It worked so well. Started to repair the skin, the scarring started to go away. I could ACTUALLY shave without fear. BIG WIN! I can reclaim my legs again and not look like a lazy hag. I mean, come on, I&#x27;m young and single here. Lady Sasquatch was not going to get the gents. And maybe even non-lady sass wouldn&#x27;t either. But at least I now had one less obstacle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the part where I stopped using it, because I went on vacation and came back and just simply forgot (bad idea). I&#x27;m back to where I was before I started using it. So, as I saw in other reviews, you pretty much can&#x27;t stop using it. So, again, starts the healing process (a couple of weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side -1 star is that I still think this product is overpriced. You have to use a lot of it. The saying &#x27;a little goes a long way&#x27; did not apply to me with this product (literally). I tried buying it in bulk, like this big bottle here, to save cost.. But Iwasn&#x27;t saving much. And have never really felt like i&#x27;ve gotten a good deal on it. It&#x27;s like drugs, or pharmaceuticals. You can&#x27;t stop using it, so you need to buy more, but it becomes costly to afford so you sell your cat. No one wants to sell their cat. It&#x27;s just unreasonable.. think about that AmLactin. CATS! (Queue Inception BWONG [...]</li>
            <li> I use this daily for preventing dry skin and KP bumps. Its gentle enough to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Keratosis Pilaris sufferers--here&#x27;s your solution! This stuff cleared up what I&#x27;ve been suffering with for 10+ years. The bumps on my arms and thighs are GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it on a night because this stuff reeks. I put it on right before going to bed and then I hop under the covers and pull them up to my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I USED IT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weeks 1-3: I HATED the smell so I didn&#x27;t use it very often. I used it every night for a few nights, then put it on about once a week. I used a bath &amp;#34;pouf&amp;#34; to gently exfoliate but never saw a huge difference, other than my skin being less dry. Still had the KP bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 4: Finally got around to buying an actual loofa sponge. Used it briefly in the shower one night and when I started drying off, it was like I was molting. Dead skin was just slothing off onto my towel. My skin actually looked really bad the first day, but after showering the next night and using my loofa for a longer period of time in the shower, MY KP IS COMPLETELY GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this twice a week (summer warmth and sunshine has hit Houston and I don&#x27;t want my skin to be too sensitive--you have to use sunscreen while using this stuff) and then hopefully go down to once a week, since I have the KP under control.</li>
            <li> I chose AmLactin because it was recommended by my foot doctor. Goes on easy and rubs in quickly and helps relieve dry skin immediately almost. Have been using this product for several years and am totally satisfied with its results.</li>
            <li> I bought Lac-Hydrin before this for my KP and fell in love with it. After 4 days, the bumps on my knees are almost gone, then I decided to try this out because it&#x27;s cheaper and a lot of people gave it positive reviews. I have used it two times, and it is clear that the bumps on the knees started to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is more liquid than I&#x27;d like, but the most important factor that screams for a return is the smell. Today my husband helped me apply AmLactin on my whole body and I felt horrible when I (yes my whole body) stank, like a cat litter box. I had to take a shower immediately to get the odor off, but it still lingered for a while more. I&#x27;m sorry but it&#x27;s not for me and I will not purchase this lotion again.</li>
            <li> This is for incredibly dry skin and I got really lucky finding this product last year on a clearance shelf. So far Amazon is the only shelf I have found it on since.  Great pricing and still continues to be my skins best friend.  I use nothing else but grape seed oil or lavender for fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion in September because my daughter has KP and I was told it will help smooth out the bumps, so far it has helped reduce the bumps on her stomach and the ones on her back have completely disappeared and hasn&#x27;t come back</li>
            <li> AmLactin is an OTC prescribed by my dermatologist for a condition called icthyosis.  I always thought  I had regular dry skin and used lotions such as Eucerin or Curel.  But the \\&quot;dry skin\\&quot; was finally diagnosed as icthyosis, which means \\&quot;fish scales.\\&quot;  The dry skin is actually more like scales or leopard or giraffe spots.  And AmLactin though it is an over-the-counter is the prescribed treatment.  And it works miracles.  I no longer have dry skin.  I don&#x27;t know how well the lotion would work compared to other OTC lotions for other dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> Yikes! This stuff made me break out in a rash on my already red and bumpy skin (KP) I have a moderate case on my arms and thighs. I tried it on my arms for a couple weeks. The first week it made my arms feel smooth and nice but slowly my arms started to react badly. I stopped after 2 wks and it took me another 2 weeks to recover :( This stuff is HARSH. Like putting straight chemical on your skin. No thanks. I&#x27;ll stick to my organic coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update: All though I had a bad reaction I have been using now it on the bottoms of my feet/calves to see if it at least helps w the roughness. So far, it has. I guess I&#x27;ll just continue using it on my feet until it is all used up. Scared to apply it anywhere else though. Great for the feet though. They are baby soft :)</li>
            <li> For many years I used Lac-Hydrin 5.  Suddenly when I went to rebuy, this kept turning up in my searches instead.  I don&#x27;t know what ever became of my old standby, but this seems to be the same thing only better.  People don&#x27;t believe I am 75 when they meet me, and one thing they mention is my skin.  I use it all over, and my skin is silky smooth.  I never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used it before, it might sting for a bit when you first put it on, but that goes away.  The slight medicinal odor goes away too.  It leaves the skin soft and moist all day, and it costs far less that the fancy creams that are priced by the fraction of an ounce.  I have extremely sensitive skin, (my mother used to call it &amp;#34;redheaded&amp;#34; skin) and this works fine for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is particularly good for the &amp;#34;bumps&amp;#34; I used to get on the backs of my arms and upper thighs.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as described.  Will use seller again.  My husband is on immunosuppresants and prednisone.  Skin is sensitive.  Dermatologist recommended this cream for my husband&#x27;s skin.  I now use it as well.</li>
            <li> Amlactin 12% Mosturizing Lotion met my expectation. It moisturises amazingly and most importantly, the itching my daughter used to experience due to dryness has reduced tremendously. She started using it 2 weeks ago and the outcome has been impressive. I am indeed a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I order this stuff to Finland. The postage costs almost the same as the lotion itself. ...And I&#x27;m a student with no extra money to spend.&lt;br /&gt;If these facts don&#x27;t say: This is amazing, I don&#x27;t know what will. So far this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that really helps my dry skin. I guess the magic is in the high amount of lactic acid.</li>
            <li> omg stink...... I have read the review and ignored it sorry I did. the Ulactin is great</li>
            <li> Unusually good product for the skin dryness I experience in the winter months.  Stops the itching, immediately.</li>
            <li> Good lotion.  Recommended by my dermatologist.  I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> What a difference in my rough spots on my skin.  I will order this again and again.  Thanks again Amlactin.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris and while it did make my skin a little softer, it didnt get rid of the bumps.  Im not going to tell you not to buy it but dont get your hopes up too much because it may not work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had small bumps on my neck for years. Didn&#x27;t think I could do anything about it til I researched online one day and  read about AmLactin. Figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Wow. Noticed a difference within a week. A month later and it was 80% better. Only use it occasionally now, sometimes on ALL my skin. Makes it so soft! Love this stuff and tell people about it all the time! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Scent is too strong. When I saw reviews stating that it was too medicine scent strong, I thought the reviewer was too sensitive to scent. But it made me go to bed feeling uncomfortable. Couldn&#x27;t really focus on the benefits it could give.</li>
            <li> Product has caused dry skin to virtually disappear. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with rough, dry skin</li>
            <li> This product is great. My doctor recommended it to me and I have found it to be the best lotion I have found. I like the pump and the 20 oz size makes it last for a long time. It is Great for anyone with dry, itchy, skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! Smoother skin after only a week of use.  I have always had keratosis on my arms, with this I FINALLY have smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This product has been diluted so that it is not the consistency of the one I bought a few months before.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome moisturizer ... the best my family has ever used.</li>
            <li> Recommended by dermatologist. Have used before and this was a very good price.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find sa product to smooth my bumpy forearms.  It actually helped.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled to finally find something that so quickly &amp; easily got completely rid of the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; (little bumps) I have always had on the backs of my upper arms!  I used to use Glytone but the last time I bought it it was different and didn&#x27;t work at all, although it never ever worked anywhere near as well as the Amlactin does.  It only 2-3 days of using just a minor amount the Amlactin had my arms smooth, soft &amp; lovely!  I will use it everyday forever with a smile!</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Great product,  fast shipping, recommended by dermatologist, but I still need something stronger and  creamier.  This size is perfect with a fair price.</li>
            <li> This is an effective AH acid, but it is a bit greasy.  I think they could lighten up on the oil a bit.  It&#x27;s strictly for night use because of the weight, but it does give a pretty good peel over time.  It is tingly at first, but you get used to it and I actually sort of like the tingling now.  :)  You will see and feel noticeable results after about two weeks of continuous use.  Use it rather liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This generous sized pump bottle of AmLactin is - ounce for ounce - half the price of the same thing at WalMart though there you would have to buy two of their smaller bottles to equal the same volume. The minimal fragrance, and fast absorption means I can apply the lotion and great dressed almost immediately after. Good stuff that keeps my skin happy.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended this for my extremely dry skin. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a supplement to the above concentrated cream  as a follow-up to initial applications and for use in other areas needing moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like after a month!</li>
            <li> I would suggest that one should not apply after shaving legs...it will burn and itch. It was fine if I didn&#x27;t shave. I also didn&#x27;t like the greasiness if Amlactin. Although I used the whole bottle, I would not purchase it again. I&#x27;m sure that there are many happy customers who purchased this item, but it just isn&#x27;t for me. I prefer a quick drying, less thick- type lotion.</li>
            <li> Little red bumps on the backs of legs/arms? This lotion is amazing at getting rid of them and this a great size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream. But causes heat.</li>
            <li> Helps my legs, I have leiken planus and this helps.</li>
            <li> Faint ammonia smell, but it dissipates quickly. My skin felt like SILK!! (whoever said that before was the one who convinced me and she was right!) Great for post-shave exfoliation too. Sexy legs! Remember to avoid the sun for a few weeks after use though!</li>
            <li> Feels great, moisturizes very well. Put it on backs of upper arms due to keratosis pilaris and it has already started to clear the clear from bumps and it is starting to fade the existing spots in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I have used Amlactin for a few weeks. I&#x27;ve had bad skin and a lot of stretch marks and wrippled skin on my stomach for years. (I was very small and had a very big baby a few years back). I haven&#x27;t done anything else as far as toning or working out, just using the lotion and noticed a huge change. I can only imagine once I work out how the difference will be!</li>
            <li> I have several skin problems that this lotion is recommended for, but sadly I can&#x27;t say if it works for me because the ammonia smell is so gross I can&#x27;t bring myself to keep using it. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Toning my skin great I use this along with Kojic Acid Whitening Soap under a week and great results healthy radiant skin will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion for my wife since she suffers from rashes during the summer. Not only did they deliver it before the expected time, the product works great right away. My wife said it was like she was rubbing silk into her skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has gotten dry and just odd, especially on my legs. I&#x27;ve used so many different creams and lotions in my search for a product that would do more than simply grease me up. Amlactin is the only one which made my skin look and feel good for an entire 24 hour period. And it appears to be cumulative, because if I don&#x27;t apply it one day, my legs still look good with no signs of dryness, which is remarkable. This product is a winner.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for my KP and other skin issues (some leftover hyperpigmentation, ingrown hairs, etc).  While my KP is not totally gone, it is already drastically reduced.  I have been using this about twice daily, following it with St. Ives Naturally Smooth Oatmeal &amp; Shea Butter moisturizer.  I did not really notice the smell, so I would say I have to disagree with people who say it smells like cat urine.  I took off one point because it is quite expensive for a body lotion, but it made my KP much more tolerable.  It also made my perpetually-cracked elbows incredibly smooth.  All of my skin (even non-KP affected) is much, much smoother and silkier now that I started using this lotion.  I will continue to use this lotion, and buy it from Amazon, where it is at least five dollars cheaper than my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use to have to have this lotion prescribed to me from my dermatologist  due to my eczema. So happy to know I can get it from Amazon and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Stinky, but moisturizers well</li>
            <li> BEST cream for kp!!! Me &amp; my son suffer from KP so I recommend any one who is having a hard time to use this cream . make sure you wear it before you go to bed. or after you you bath. works amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I have a moderate case of keratosis Pilaris on the backs of my arms (and an extremely mild case on the backs of my thighs). Daily scrubbing with a loofah just wouldn&#x27;t quite cut it as my skin would still get dry even after a thick lotion application.  After searching around I found this product first at Costco and tried it out as I was going to get married soon and was going to wear a strapless dress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It recommends using the product at least twice a day (morning and night), but for my skin that seemed to be a little too much as my arms were starting to look a little red and feel a tiny bit raw. Once a day after my shower seemed to be enough. My arms are way smoother after daily application, and I saw results in less than a week! This is a great product though I recommend it to be used only on areas that you really need it. Protect that skin if you are going outside after because they are not kidding when they say that your skin is a little more susceptible to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and it is minor, because I know they have to put a chemical in the lotion to make it work, is that it smells like the bleach my stylist puts in my hair when I get my highlights done. In a point of desperation I had to use it all over my body when I ran out of my regular lotion and had to cover myself in scented oil so as not to smell burning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stuff before when it was a prescription from my doctor.  It&#x27;s not a cure but helps a little.</li>
            <li> I’ve only been using it a few days and the calluses on my feet are almost gone! I’ve read the reviews that say it smells like ammonia but, honestly, I don’t notice any smell at all. So far, it is a great body lotion.</li>
            <li> My own dermatologist said get this stuff for my dried out elbows. It did really good. No more embarrassing white dead skin. Hydrates and defoliates; it gets rid of crust cracks and wrinkles and then slowly removes the old dead cells. I thought pretty good. And my wife asked for some to put on her arms that were dry from a day on salt water. She was back for more in minutes. And again. Then she said for her GF to try it. They would drop by my table to take a few squirts and wander off in bliss. Soon wrinkles on arms went away. Then I thought, just get some for both ladies. So, now I have bought some for wife, BFF and the neighbor lady across the street that watches our home for us. All of them are pleased as punch, so then so am I.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product after reading the reviews. I don&#x27;t know if  I received an old product or what, but the smell is awful. I will not use.</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizing lotion for dry feet and hands.</li>
            <li> the best of the moisturizers</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect this to help my dry snake skin as much as it did. I stopped itching immediately. As a black woman with extremely dry skin (except for my oily face) this is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> Love this for those little red bumps on the upper arms -- UV rays will help with it, also, but if you are avoiding that, then this lotion works well. It&#x27;s very moisturizing with very little scent. Seems to have helped the rough elbow thing, too!</li>
            <li> Heard great things about this lotion. So took the plunge and tried it out. The bottle is huge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and was hoping for a lotion my skin could tolerate. It BURNED and ITCHED! I was itching all over.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as if I fell in a bucket of fleas. Ok, not that bad but it itched. Most likely allergic to something in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my SO really likes it. It works well for him and he likes that it is not scented and it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion but the huge drawback for me is that I can&#x27;t get over the scent. I find the smell just too unpleasant for me to use on a regular basis, and with this kind of product I think consistent use is necessary for it to actually work.  I&#x27;ve even tried mixing it with other lotions or essential oils...  Still just can&#x27;t get past the scent.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after only 4 days.  KP looks much better.  I shared with my sister and she has same results.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion to help with keratosis on my arms and legs. I applied this every night and in the morning every other day. Eventually, the red bumps were reduced and with a bit of natural tanning they are almost completely gone. I continue to use this 3 times a week to keep the redness suppressed. This lotion is pretty greasy and for keratosis I tend to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Part of latest attempt to deal with ingrown hairs and irritation associated with shaving, AmLactin is the best adjunct treatment I&#x27;ve used so far! It stings and warms and initially makes the redness look worse. After that subsides skin tone is much more even and redness associated with irritation is either much lessened or gone! It seems best used the evening after shaving, and both morning and evening on the following day. It isn&#x27;t perfect, however: not all ingrown hairs are prevented. Those that do appear look much less like ingrown hairs and more like random bumps, which is a lot better (in my opinion) as the bumps are far less obvious than red bumps. I would definitely recommend it, but I will be trying other things, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED: First day, Khiel&#x27;s Razor Bump Relief. Second day and subsequent days: Tend Skin applied in one stroke all over shaved area; wait a little for it to absorb; AmLactin over the Tend Skin. Results have been very good.</li>
            <li> I used this in the prescription form for over 10 years and this is just as effective. By the time I go to the doctor and pay a  co-pay then have the prescription filled this probably saves me money. No other body moisturizer can compare. So if you have dry skin put this on after your shower or bath-no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product!!!  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for many, many years</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion for my 2 year old who has terrible eczema.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried seems to keep him from scratching his red, cracked (and sometimes bleeding) skin.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I thought maybe this was the miracle I was waiting for.  Unfortunately, it was not.  The first time I put it on his skin, he screamed &amp;#34;OW, OW, OW!&amp;#34; and cried for several minutes after I&#x27;d finished.  Having read the reviews, I knew to expect that it would sting the first few times, so I kept going twice a day for about 10 days until I just couldn&#x27;t take his screaming anymore.  He was so traumatized by it that every time we went into his room, he would say, &amp;#34;No lotion.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m giving this 2 stars only because I don&#x27;t know if it actually works since I stopped using it, but anything that painful is deserving of a poor review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to help other eczema sufferers, I&#x27;ve tried all of the following, and they haven&#x27;t worked:  Aveeno Baby Eczema, Eucerin Eczema, Metaderm (made it worse), Aveeno oatmeal baths (undecided on whether or not this helps), Aquaphor (good to put on top of steroids as a moisturizer, but does not help the actual eczema), and Vaseline.  I&#x27;ve just started using Vanicream on him today, which I bought based on reviews.  He did not scream, so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a good start.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Been using it to combat my KP (keratosis pilaris) on my arms. Using it for about 2 weeks. I have seen a dramatic difference in the texture and bumps. However its not a total miracle. I can still see redness (which never seems to go away)</li>
            <li> I use this for my pompholyx on my feet and it works wonders. It does sting a little if you have an open cut.</li>
            <li> I have never smelled any moisturizer that smells this bad.  After my shower I used the product and went to bed.  I felt like I needed another shower to get rid of the odor.  I now use it only occasionally during the day on my hands.  Do not like this product at all.</li>
            <li> The product goes on more or less &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, but the operative chemicals in it can develop on your skin over the following hours, be absorbed into your system through the skin, and the resulting horrible scent can be overwhelming.  The resulting scent effect may depend on your personal chemistry.  I had to throw the product out, the scent effect was so bad and took 3 days to clear out of my system.  Also the robust pump dispenses a lot of product, so the temptation would be to over-apply to use up what came out, compounding the scent problem.</li>
            <li> smell isn&#x27;t great but not offensive.  it definitely helps with the KP.  i&#x27;ve started adding some essential oil to make it smell prettier.</li>
            <li> Really helps my hands in the winter it is fragrance free.  I did notice a scar I had on my leg getting lighter, nice bonus!</li>
            <li> Yep- this stuff works!! When used daily for a weeks, thise annoying small bumps on the back of your arms simply dissappear- its like magic! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> We always use Amlactin lotion. It is the best!! Specifically in the cold winter times when the skin is so dry</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has keratosis pilaris. It works if he uses it twice a day consistently(of course he did that for a few weeks and then forgot!). I actually use it for my underarms after shaving. Because it exfoliates, it prevents ingrown hair!</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth!</li>
            <li> I had developed little bumps on my upper arms. I read reviews about the AmLactin and decided to give it a try. It took care of those bumps in less than a week. I had tried exfoliates and nothing else worked.</li>
            <li> Gave me terrible rash and eczema!</li>
            <li> It helps to remove the dry, dead skin cells from my body.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed this lotion in the past.  Now that it is OTC, I find it difficult if not impossible to locate---especially this &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; version of the brand &amp;#34;LacHydrin&amp;#34;.  This is a MUCH less expensive version, which is treated to take some of the &amp;#34;sour milk&amp;#34; odor away.</li>
            <li> GOOD  PRODUCT  USE  IT  ALL  THE  TIME  FOR  MY  SKIN  PROBLEMS  RELIEVES  ITCHING  AND  SKIN  DRYNESS  RECOMEND  TO  ALL  WITH  SEVERE  ISSUES FOR  DRY  SKIN.</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and this brand is what my dermatologist recommended I&#x27;ve use this for many years, makes your body feel soft and very well protected it is not greasy in any way, another thing about this product is you don&#x27;t have to use a lot it goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t have an odor to it like some do if you have never used it give a try you&#x27;ll love how your body feels after using this another excellent product from AmLactin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC.  I have had keratosis pelaris for years, mostly on my arms, and my doctor recommended a similar lotion.  This year, I noticed I was getting KP on my legs - really bad!  I decided to hunt for that lotion I used years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  When I googled it, AmLactin popped up as an alternative.  I was skeptical, but read many reviews saying it had helped with KP.  I was AMAZED at how quickly it helped the KP on my legs, it disappeared (almost completely!) within about 2-3 weeks (which is SUPER fast for KP) and the bumps on my arm are almost gone, too (they&#x27;re more stubborn as I&#x27;ve had them for decades).  Yes, it smells funky but that fades pretty quickly, and yes it burns like the dickens if you put it on immediately after shaving.  But, one hugely positive thing I can say for it (other than getting rid of my bumps) is that this stuff has yet to discolor any of my towels or clothes.  The other lotion I used to use would bleach the crap out of my towels and clothing!  If I even just barely touched something, you could kiss it goodbye.  I had to walk around naked for about 30 minutes to let it dry, and pray I didn&#x27;t bump into something.  I have just short of rubbed this lotion directly onto my dark towels with ZERO effect.  I will buy and use this product for years to come, no matter how much it costs.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft and I love it! Not the best smell, and a little greasy but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Was really great lotion.  However, not for the summer.  You cannot be in the sun after using it.  I got so burned.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and used to get lots of patches of itchy, bumpy skin.  This is great, as long as I don&#x27;t use it full-strength.  It will sting if it&#x27;s on even very slightly broken skin (you&#x27;ll find all your sore spots immediately!), so I mix equal parts of this, a 1% hydrocortsone lotion, and another dry skin moisturizer (D-ve Cream Oil for Extra Dry Skin) in my hands, then smooth it all over my itchy body.  My skin is SO much better!</li>
            <li> I read about this lotion in a blog that I was reading. It was recommended for Keratosis Pilaris, so I thought I would give it a try. It works wonders for me! It&#x27;s also very moisturizing, I would highly recommended this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my KP on my face and arms. It seemed to work in the beginning and then after continous use for about a week it went downhill. The product burned my skin and left an oily residue after application. I am upset I can&#x27;t return it because I am not going to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. I have mild Keratosis Pilaris on my thighs and after applying this nightly for a month they&#x27;ve visibly reduced. I don&#x27;t feel self conscious about wearing shorts this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: don&#x27;t use after shaving! It burns!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.  I use it on my entire body and it has changed my skin.  I run long distances and even with sunscreen I end up getting quite a bit of sun.  I have always had very dry skin on my legs. This really helps to even out tone and make my skin glow.  Over time it has even helped with old scars.  Now that I am in my 40s I am starting to pay attention to my neck - at first I was using my facial product but have actually found it looks better using this.  I can&#x27;t quite let myself use it on my face (I have sensitive skin and an elaborate routine for my face) but maybe I should!</li>
            <li> Good value.  This is expensive lotion and I got it cheaper per ounce than Wal Mart.</li>
            <li> I love this Amlactin lotion!  It has unbelievably cleared and healed my skin which had been plagued with breakouts.  I have terribly dry skin on my lower legs and usually with any other lotion, I would have dry flaky skin by the end of the day after applying my normal lotion in the morning. But with Amlactin, my skin is BABY SOFT ALL DAY LONG.  Even the next morning my lower legs are still soft and moisturized!  Once I was in a hurry and jumped out of the shower and dressed without applying the Amlactin and yet my legs were still moisturized as if I had, even that night.  This stuff is amazing and has even helped even out my skin tone on my chest where I had hypo-pigmentation from acne breakouts.  I was preparing to seek a dermatologist&#x27;s help prior to trying Amlactin, but it has really helped my skin!!  My skin has never looked so good, nor felt so good in all my life, and I am menopausal AND have Graves disease (auto-immune) so that is really saying something about how great this lotion is!</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching products for dry skin, especially after starting medication that only made my dry skin worse. Using this once a day has made my skin entirely smooth. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have found good results using this product, it needs to be used twice a day. If you stop using it, the bumps will come back as there isn&#x27;t a cure for chicken skin :)</li>
            <li> I use this lotion on my husband&#x27;s legs and feet.  I used Eucerin previously and it is so greasy.  I like Amlactin because it has no fragrance and absorbs very well.  A little of this lotion goes a long way.  This product has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Made my skin break out in red rash.</li>
            <li> Amlactin lotion keeps my summer sandal feet nicely smooth and moisturized like others didn&#x27;t.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  Nice lotion!</li>
            <li> Using Amlactin twice daily has improved my skin more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> This is extremely helpful lotion for very dry skin. It absorbs quickly and smoothes dry scaley skin. Especially useful for feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> My last derm recommended this for kertosis - tiny little bumps on my thigh.  It works!  Now I use it everywhere.  Another derm prescribed other products but they didn&#x27;t work.  Initially if you use it twice a day for about a week you will start to notice results.  Now I use it once/day or once every other day and it still does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little longer to dry than regular lotion and you may feel a little sticky for a few minutes but it&#x27;s totoally worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product for exfoliating your body &amp; face. My skin is softer! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It stings a little when you first apply but with the time you will get used to it</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to get this cream for the little bumps on the back of my arms.  This cream works amazingly.  It has smoothed out all my skin and make my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.  For KP and especially in the wintertime this is a life saver.  Not the best smell but not the worst.  Kind of smells like paint.</li>
            <li> Gave me terrible rash and eczema! Do NOT GET!!!! Horrible, SO DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> Decent, still has to be something better out there.  Kinda runny too</li>
            <li> Works better than any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This lotion has kept my hands and body moist and, I credit it with repairing my after chill birth streatch marks ----my skin always feels hydrated</li>
            <li> Better price than stores plus bigger.</li>
            <li> Using the lotion ( with Keri as a companion), can help avoid the nusance of delicate skin tissue tears!!  This is a wondorous  lotion with a great formula that works well.  It is documenred thar the best  and first line of defense is intact skin!  Keeping moisturizer onthe skin helps to prevent skin tears especially for diabetics, or anyone for whom a skin tear could be dangerous.  It is NEVER ro late to start grear skin care, ao start it wirh this product!  Human anatomy and physiology 101!  Massagimg the lotion on, in itself promotes circularion and  comfort.  Just try it!!!  In patient care, the back rub should be uses more often.</li>
            <li> I am a 29-year-old male with mild adult acne. Or should I say: I WAS a 29-year-old male with mild adult acne. Finally, after a decade of fighting irritating and embarrassing skin blemishes, I found AmLactin. My face is smooth and clear, and the product does not burn when I put it on. I cannot recommend this highly enough.</li>
            <li> Whenever I shave my legs, I get red bumps on my thighs the very next day.  It was very unpleasant looking and feeling, so I had to look for something to help cure this.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion almost always helps.  I get very few red bumps on my thighs now.  It will sting a bit if you apply it after shaving, but it&#x27;s worth the small pain.&lt;br /&gt;I also have KP on my legs and upper arms, but it doesn&#x27;t really help much for that, in my case.  I&#x27;m not as bothered by that, but just know that this lotion&#x27;s results will vary depending on your skin.</li>
            <li> good lotion for dry skin. bit smelly and fells sticky for a little bit after putting on but works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old male with (what I believe is) KP on my thighs, butt, and lower back for most of my life. I applied this lotion after showering every day, sometimes twice a day if I remembered. After a week I could tell my skin was getting softer (not exactly the result I was after), but about 1 1/2 - 2 months of daily applications finally made a difference. It&#x27;s not 100% gone, but pretty darn close. Now I have years of mooning people to catch up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, it helps to let your skin dry after showering before you apply this, otherwise it takes much longer to absorb and kind of creates a white film. The odor is not nearly as bad as some people claim.</li>
            <li> Bought on a suggestion from a dry skin forum, but it isn&#x27;t really doing it for me. It would be a nice daily moisturizer for someone who just wants to keep their skin hydrated, but unfortunately it is too watery for me, and it doesn&#x27;t really have a lasting effect. That said, I do live in the desert, so my needs are a little more than most folks.  Updated 8/17/15: Okay, so I think I hadn&#x27;t given it a proper chance when I first tried it. I gave it another go because I ran out of my usual lotion and it was all I had on hand. The first thing I noticed was that it kind of burned my skin. I saw that reported by others but hadn&#x27;t experienced it in my first try. Amazingly, though, the softness of my legs was undeniable, even after several hours and overnight. I tried it again and started using it for a few days, and the burning eventually went away. I guess I got used to it?  Anyway, I was pretty impressed with it and have changed my review from 2 stars to 4 stars because I definitely think it is better than I originally gave it credit for.</li>
            <li> Helped to smooth skin and lessened my arm bumps a bit. Not gone completely, but certainly made less noticeable.</li>
            <li> If this product doesn&#x27;t cure dryness then you need to see an M.D.  It makes your skin feel like a newborn.</li>
            <li> It really helps to smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> Really softens skin, but the smell made me feel like I was back in my high school chem lab. It&#x27;s a very strong, ammonium smell (the &amp;#34;lactic acid&amp;#34; is in the form of the ammonium lactate salt). Not for sensitive noses - it makes me feel kind of nauseous. Won&#x27;t be purchasing this again, unfortunately. Will stick to my Glytone.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time which is always a great start. I purchased this because I get little red bumps on my upper arms and this was recommended to treat those. I have used 2-3 times so far and have not seen any clearing of the bumps but the lotion is incredibly thick and seems to work great as a moisturizer as I only have to apply once after showering and my skin stays soft for two or three days even after showering without re-applying. If my little bumps go away I will update this to show that it worked!</li>
            <li> I use a great face moisturizer for my face, but it was so expensive.  AmLactin is pretty much all body lotion except on lips and in certain more sensitive areas.  It works better than any other product that I have used on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I suggest not to do......................If you are going to be in alot of sun, then skip the areas expose to the sun for your will get a red rash.  Then I use my other product; however, at night I use only AmLactin.  I love what it  does to my skin...feels like silk.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t but this, it smells horrible.  I thought I took a bath in pure ammonia!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product. I have KP on the backs of my arms and areas of my legs. I have been applying twice a day for weeks, and have noticed in the last 2 weeks that an itchy rash developed on my arms. I do not have sensitive skin, in fact, my skin is very tolerant. I have not seen any beneficial results on my legs either. A waste of money, this is not a cheap product so I&#x27;m quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> My KP got worse with this product. It did not work for me at all, it didn&#x27;t even moisturize my skin. My KP got really red the next morning, I&#x27;m very disappointed. The smell of this lotion is not very good either. Overall not a good experience, I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Bought this at the recommendation of my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to moisturize sun damaged skin, and this is one of the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> Has worked wonders on my skin. I added a scented lotion to help with slight smell. Love it.</li>
            <li> i like this lotion, it does really works well, it heals dry skin, it is very essential to have it against dry or aging problems or for treating itchy damaged skin, its very light and not greasy, i like also treat scars and i like its sense,</li>
            <li> Yeaaaaa this doesn&#x27;t work for keratosis pilaris (the red arm bumps on the backs of my arms).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this 2x daily for about 25 days straight and there was no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that has really helped the bumps is just getting natural sun. Come winter, I&#x27;m pretty screwed. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS on my legs &amp; arms and this lotion didn&#x27;t help it much. Yeah it did help with my cracked heels to recover but that was it. Hydration wise- it&#x27;s kinda ok.</li>
            <li> Had a bad case of keratosis after spending days walking in my jeans during a vacation.  For 10 days I couldn&#x27;t even sleep well as the itch was so bad.  My doctor couldn&#x27;t prescribe something that helped, and I turn to this product after some research told me that I needed a lotion with lactic acid.  It&#x27;s the third day since using this and I&#x27;m all healed and I finally had a full night sleep yesterday.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fabulous! Used it often....ordered more!!</li>
            <li> I a member of a few online skincare forums. I came across AmLactin while browsing those sites. This is a wonderful product for women (and men) who have ignored the skin on their bodies for awhile. Growing up in Florida, I spent far too much time in the sun. My chest and arms are sun damaged but have dramatically improved in appearance and texture since using AmLactin. I use it all over my body. It will make your skin VERY soft in a very short amount of time. As far as a quality dermatology product, it&#x27;s wonderful. Skip right over everything else in the drugstore and go straight for the AmLactin. If you have sensitive skin, it may burn initially as it contains glycolic acid. Hang in there. That tingle will go away in a matter of days. The only reason for minus a star is the smell. It does smell like ammonia, but it mostly goes away after a few hours. It&#x27;s not a strong ammonia scent but it&#x27;s definitely there. For me, it&#x27;s worth it so I can have lovely skin.</li>
            <li> The product is very effective on dry skin.  This fragrance free product seems to work better for me than the product with fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does wonders for dry skin and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Recommended to us by a nurse. She was correct. It&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion for KP. Also use on my face and doesn&#x27;t break me out (really sensitive skin). Tad expensive but a little goes a long way this this.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is my second bottle of this stuff. I have very dry diabetic skin, and nothing seems to work. I use this product, but also mix in a bit of a conventional moisturizer, and it seems to do the trick. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by a physician for my dry skin. It is hard to find in my area, and I was happy to find this product on your site. I would recommend this lotion to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived right when it said it would. Nice lotion</li>
            <li> Better than the offbrands, but not as good as Lachydron was, but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected when something is over the counter versus prescription.</li>
            <li> My husband loves for his extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this for my sister because she has KP but it didn&#x27;t do anything. I did like how it made her arms way softer. Other lotions wouldn&#x27;t work for her rough skin but this one did.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scent but the product works well.</li>
            <li> got it for mom, she swears it works miracles on her skin without all the harmful chemicals other lotions have</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat the keratosis pilaris (aka chicken bumps) on my arms. I&#x27;ve used a lactic acid moisturizer before with no problems, but this made my skin break out in a rash. I used it for two weeks hoping my skin was just going through an adjustment period, but the rash only got worse. I&#x27;m prone to eczema so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s related.</li>
            <li> This really works well for my skin. I have noticed a great improvement and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet ... Still using</li>
            <li> I was researching products to help with the Keratosis Pilaris I have on the backs of my legs and came across a site that recommended AmLactin in conjunction with chemical peels.  I decided to try to AmLactin first and have been blown away by the results on my skin.  At first I only used it on the areas that are affected by the KP, but after feeling how soft my skin was after just one or two applications I started using it on my whole body.  After about two weeks of use my skin is softer than it has even been.  I am so thrilled!  The KP is definitely improving but I may still do a chemical peel or on the worst areas to hurry things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin is very sensitive and I used to get razor bumps on my underarms and bikini area.  Though it can sting a bit when applied over freshly shaven skin it keeps irritation and razor bumps away so I consider the stinging to be a small price to pay.  I&#x27;ve started spot testing this on areas of my face to see how it reacts.  So far the areas I&#x27;ve used it on have had no bad reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this lotion isn&#x27;t that great but as others have said it disappears pretty quickly and can be covered with perfume.  The positive effects, however, last ALL day. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to expose my skin to the sun in quite some time so I don&#x27;t know how photo sensitive it will be while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is a great lotion and well worth the cost as well as the few minor cons.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this with less than zero stars then I would.  I bought it at Costco, where a sales person was pushing it, stressing how it does exceptionally well with moisturizing the skin.  Having a pump on the bottle, I responded that for my hands I usually keep a pump bottle at each sink and more places.  She gave no warning regarding sun exposure nor mentioned need to shake the bottle. (Either of those warnings alone would have prevented me from purchasing it.)  So, I bought a bottle and put it by my kitchen sink, near the Eucerin pump lotion that I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;Right away I disliked the smell, plus I thought it was too watery, and that it did not moisturize my hands nearly as well as the Eucerin pump lotion.  Occasionally I tired it again on my hands, but each time was disappointed in the odor, the excess watery level, and lack of feeling as moisturized as most other hand lotions/creams I&#x27;ve used over the decades.&lt;br /&gt;Finally my bottle of Eucerin was empty, so then for at least a couple of days I was frequently using this lotion from this bottle of AmLactin which was near my kitchen sink.&lt;br /&gt;Within just a couple or three days or so, the top of my right hand had a significant rash, and I immediately stopped using this lotion, wondering whether this lotion had caused it, or fearing that I might be having a reaction to a medication.&lt;br /&gt;When I awoke the following morning, my left hand also had a serious rash on it too.&lt;br /&gt;Since then I&#x27;ve found that any lotion, or any soap, and even just water further irritates this rash.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this lotion caused it, and I highly suspect that the sunshine had further aggravated matters. My hands were repeatedly exposed to sunshine when I repeatedly stepped outside briefly with my dog during these sunny days of July.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recall the salesperson mentioning anything regarding sunshine, and I&#x27;ve had the bottle so many months now, that I don&#x27;t recall seeing mention of the &amp;#34;sun alert&amp;#34; on the bottom of the backside of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;They should have &amp;#34;SUN ALERT&amp;#34; written in large red print on the top of the front and backsides of this bottle, rather than barely mentioning it last thing in tiny print on the lower backside of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been several days now, and the rash has not yet improved at all, despite my avoidance of putting ANY kind of lotion on it, and hardly touching the backside of my hand with infrequent use of Cetaphil mild hand soap.  I&#x27;ve delayed/avoided doing many chores/other things, to prevent need for frequent hand-washing.&lt;br /&gt;Reading many of these reviews, I have not seen any mention of how long it took for others to recover from rashes caused by this Amlactin lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Responses?&lt;br /&gt;SUN ALERT!</li>
            <li> Just what the dermatologist suggested.</li>
            <li> Good enough but not quite as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever used. My doctor recommended this to me after complaining about horrible KP on my legs. After applying this 2x per day for a week I see a significant difference. Then k started to notice KP on my neck/jaw line and was worried about using this lotion there as it does sting a bit. I ended up trying it anyway and had no problems. Only clear skin. I have heard of people using this all over their face and I am going to start doing that as well. There are some drawbacks to this lotion which is the smell as well as a sticky like film it leaves on your skin. This does go away so just be patient!</li>
            <li> I have KP and for the most part I would say it helps but it&#x27;s no cure. It does make your skin sensitive to the sun. I have a sunburn on both my arms from wearing short sleeves driving my car. I haven&#x27;t been to the pool all summer. It would be best to use in the winter when your skin is covered up.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon after searching for anything to help with my Ichytosos Vulgaris (very, very dry skin condition - characterized by scaling), and I&#x27;ve been using it for at least two weeks.  I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results, but it keeps my skin moisturized so it looks less dry and scaly</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a lotion that will moisturizer your skin, use Amlactin. Really moisturizers your skin and removes chicken skin. Love the product! Though the smell is not that appealing.</li>
            <li> This really help dry dry skin.  I love results. Was tempted to buy another but I&#x27;ll use this up first</li>
            <li> I researched online and chose this product for those pesky red or skin-colored bumps that have emerged on the backs of my upper arms. I have delicate skin and this lotion quickly removed most of the bumps within a couple of weeks without stinging or irritating my skin. If there is a fragrance or odor to this lotion, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and I have an annoyingly keen sense of smell. I have used this also on razor rash on my legs, and it clears it. Glad I chose it.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended this product . After first applying, it felt great but then it wouldn&#x27;t dry and was sticky and greasy . At the same time, I also purchases Cera Ve and love that. The AmLActin is in the closet....</li>
            <li> Very good for dry flaky skin and the best thing I&#x27;ve found for wrinkles, really!  It is hard to find in stores, more expensive and only comes in small bottles with no pump.  I am so happy I found this on Amazon.  It was shipped in a timely manner. I will keep ordering this from Amazon!</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves a sticky gooey feeling to your skin. That&#x27;s probably how it keeps your skin moisturized. If you don&#x27;t like that , do find some other lotion. The bumps on my skin are reduced though.</li>
            <li> For me it was very sticky.... Didn&#x27;t like the feel of it..</li>
            <li> Order this over and over.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the itchy, dry skin on my legs.  I used it daily for a few weeks.  It didn&#x27;t do anything special for me.  I have other lotions that seem to help my skin more.  I was hoping this would be the answer to my itchy, dry skin problems.  Sadly, it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I keep a bottle in the car.  Got it at Costco but don&#x27;t remember the price or ounces.  Great for dry skin.  But never used it on the spots on my arm or back.  After reading the reviews here I might just try that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and there is no smell or burning or stinging.  Not sure what everyone else is complaining about.</li>
            <li> Ah relief for dried out skin after a shower in the winter wonderland up here. The wife and kids use it too!</li>
            <li> I have terrible dry skin and this is the only moisturizer I use. It exfoiliates dry skin and if you use it on damp skin- right after you towel off after your shower- it isn&#x27;t sticky. If you use it on dry skin it is. I use it on my face every morning. Retin-A at night. My skin looks great!</li>
            <li> If you can tolerate the smell (synthetic urine) which goes away 20 minutes later - I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. This is a tremendous product for removing dead skin. I&#x27;ve commented on this product before. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really did not see any difference with this lotion. Its thin, liquidy, and smells like ammonia. Eww! Not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have been using AmLactin for several years now.  In my opinion, It is the best lotion available, suggested to me by my doctor.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body lotion with AHA and the reviews were very good for this one.  I was going to order it, but found it at my Costco for $13.99.  I have a new favorite, I don&#x27;t usually use body lotions but this one is amazing.  I have only been using it for a few weeks.  My skin is baby soft to the touch, my tone is evening out.  It makes my feet soft and smooth.  It is a large bottle and I am so happy to have the pump for dispensing.  I really don&#x27;t notice a smell per se and it absorbs pretty quickly.  In addition it is not greasy and I haven&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity to the AHA (no tingling). When I run out, and if I can&#x27;t find it at Costco I will definitely order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry, alligator skin. It does not need reapplied nearly as frequently as regular lotions. Feels different on the hands, but it works.</li>
            <li> Living in Idaho, one absolutely requires serious dry skin medicine.&lt;br /&gt;And, purchasing it from Amazon with its great shipping makes it easy to shop for AmLactin.</li>
            <li> I love the product, know my sister uses it too!&lt;br /&gt;The alpha-hydroxy therapy makes all the difference for me personally.  Hopes this helps you :)</li>
            <li> AmLactin 12%  Moisturizing Lotion  is good on dry skin. Saw it on The View and decided to order and try it,</li>
            <li> great product for staph prone skin.</li>
            <li> This is excellent stuff, a diluted form of something prescribed by my dermatologist</li>
            <li> This helps with KP I had for so many years that I didn&#x27;t thought anything can help. My legs has been visibly improved. Been using it for little over a year,. and planning on using it until KP is all gone!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  I have KP so that is why I bought it.  It does have a smell to it- but nothing horrible.  I got used to it.  My skin is definitely much softer then it was and I 100% will buy again....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a year or more now.  I really like it.  I was looking for an AHA lotion to exfoliate the dry, flaky skin on my legs and feet.  This lotion is perfect for me.  I needed to apply it twice daily for a while to get rid of all the dead skin cells causing all the flakiness.  After that, once a day keeps the skin moist but not greasy.  It takes a good while for it to soak into the skin, but once you reap the benefits, this lotion really is wonderful.  It does have a bit of a  &#x27;plastic&#x27; smell to it, but it&#x27;s not offensive to me.  I look for more of a remedy-type lotion than a nice smell girly cream that doesn&#x27;t do much in the long run.  This one is it.  It&#x27;s a bit runny, not thick, but it does restore the skin to a nice, non-greasy, moist-feel-to-the-touch with regular use.  Now to find something similar for my face.  I highly recommend this body lotion with AHA&#x27;s.  I will most likely buy it in the bigger bottle since I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> This stuff has saved my skin from the winter. No more itchiness and flakiness. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s also gotten rid of those ugly red bumps on the back of my arms and legs. The smell is not so great but I put up with it for the great results.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for which I&#x27;m crediting the Hyaluronic Acid component.  It leaves a sticky coating on the skin but it certainly does it&#x27;s job and fast.</li>
            <li> It is great to be able to buy this product without a prescription.</li>
            <li> Made my skin baby smooth all day and even on days I forget to use it</li>
            <li> Works wonders on hard cracked skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work very well, and I have not complaints about it.  The only thing is the smell or ammonia (I know that not it), but it does go away pretty fast.  Amlactin has saved my life when it come to summer, I can&#x27;t wait to wear tanks this year, and it makes the skin nice and even too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion. I think any product that has many purposes saves me time and money. This lotion exfoliates and moisturizes my sensitive and at times dry skin. I let my sister use it, and sometimes she thinks it is too exfoliating, so I guess it is not for everyone. I suggest for people who have not ordered this, get a small amount and try it out. If you like it, then order the large amount from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased at the recommendation of my Dermatologist.  It is the best lotion I have every used.  I cannot believe how much better my \\&quot;old\\&quot; skin looks!  It is hydrated, no dry patches, absorbs great, does not have an ordor, and a little goes a long way.  I will also say it is much cheaper at Amazon that my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Has helped me reduce/remove my Keratosis Pilaris. I have also had success getting rid of dry, scaly skin on my feet as well. Just use 2x a day and watch your skin repair itself!</li>
            <li> This lotion works well for me. I have tried others in the past and this one is by far the best that I have tried for extremely dry skin.  Thanks from a happy customer!!</li>
            <li> When my skin is so dry it hurts, this speeds recovery better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s exfoliating, in fact seems to eat into dead skin, so it&#x27;s possible to overuse it.  (I wouldn&#x27;t ever recommend putting it on broken skin--it stings and leaves it a bit sore--and people who react to alpha hydroxy compounds, even if their skin isn&#x27;t normally oversensitive, will probably break out with this.)  It seems to help with hard KP bumps, if they haven&#x27;t been loofahed (save that for your next shower) or irritated beforehand.  I don&#x27;t use it nearly as often as they say (twice a day) except when a therapeutic regimen seems called for, but when I need it it practically works miracles.  The scent is neither horrible nor pleasant, probably smells just like its component chemicals, but anyway it goes away soon enough.</li>
            <li> No more cracked fingers when I use it. PZ</li>
            <li> It actually works my skin has gotten better than it was I mean its not completely gone but hopefully with more time it&#x27;ll be better.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended --- received very quickly...</li>
            <li> I am a 86 year old man, drove a truck most of my work life and now my HANDS  HURT.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff to see if it would help.....IT REALLY DOES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU ARE OLD...like me.....try it ...really works on me...BOB</li>
            <li> Not as good as Amlactin foot cream, which is excellent. This seems like any other lotion to me.</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps me moist longer than most. I&#x27;ve grown up with eczema and keratosis pilaris. Paired with exfoliation, it keeps my arms and legs smooth from my keratosis. I can&#x27;t say this does much for my eczema other than keep me moist longer, but it hasn&#x27;t gotten worse so that&#x27;s a plus. There&#x27;s a warning to limit sun exposure because of the lactic acid but my skin does not feel any more delicate than it used to, perhaps I just have tough skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion, a lot cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I&#x27;ve a mild case of Ichthyosis vulgaris, but by using this lotion religiously, my skin feels almost normal.  It&#x27;s a must during Winter months!</li>
            <li> I applied everyday after showering and shaving.  It has a slight sour dairy odor but it is very slight and dissipates fast.  My skin was extremely smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li> Great lotion if you have dry skin like me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have to use this 1 time a week and the lactic acid in there keeps working...this lotion is really good for slight exfoliation/brightening/holding in moisture and helping enhance other beauty prodct one might be using.....but what won me over was how this lotion got rid of my feet calluses!! I have tried dermabrasion/brillo board/blow torch(just kiddin, lol) but seriously I wear stillettos/high heels allot and thats why I had &#x27;rough&#x27; unfeminine feet. But not now, thanks to this God Sent lotion from heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, its a staple in my never ending quest for all things beauty!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have some really bad upper arm skin and keratosis pilaris on the back of my arms.&lt;br /&gt;In some reviews of this product I read you have to use it about a month to see keratosis pilaris disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Well I have to say after using it 20-days now I really see a noticeable skin difference. The keratosis pilaris on the back of my arms&lt;br /&gt;seems slowly to fade away. Really happy about this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the nice results I also started the use it on my bacne, hope it does wonders to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells the first two minutes after applying, but then this kind of acid smell fades away.&lt;br /&gt;Really recommend this product for people with difficult skin like mine!</li>
            <li> its lotion and it does its job as lotion. Good stuff honestly. But you don&#x27;t have to take my word for it. Just buy you some lotion</li>
            <li> I like this lotion. I got a free sample of another product from this company. My wife was on vacation so I got to use it.&lt;br /&gt;My review reading led me here and I bought this. I am a 59 tear old male and my skin is moving to old man skin&lt;br /&gt;and I wanted to see what this would do, if anything. I use it on my face and arms only. I have always bought the Wal-Mart brand lotions cause they work and are cheap. This stuff is better. It works but keep it out of your mouth as it tastes real bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It also works nicely on my wifes eczema. A little goes a long way and makes her skin less itchy and softer. Nothing works on eczema forever so she uses it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that after several weeks of using twice daily (recommended on package) that skin started peeling almost  in sheets. Scary.  Just know this can happen and be careful. Maybe start with once daily. Internet photos of bad reactions are also scary.</li>
            <li> We use this on our feet.  they get so dry. we try to soak our feet at least twice a week. it helps exfoliate the callus in between scrubbings.</li>
            <li> Although this product has tons of great reviews, I have to be honest with my experience as well. I bought this product for KP and I have extremely sensitive skin. I thought this would help or at least moisturize it good enough to where it would get even a tiny bit better, but it made my skin break out into itchy bumps which then aggravated the KP and made it worse. It was a huge let down because I was really thinking it was going to work, and I definitely did not think that it would make matters worse. I&#x27;m sure it works for a lot of people, but for me, it unfortunately made it a lot worse. :( However, still up to you to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Wow! I had horrible dry feet since I had diabetes during my pregnancy. After I had her my feet couldn&#x27;t recover. They were so bad on heel cracked! Yup..that bad. I bought this lotion, and I can&#x27;t believe how well it worked for me. I would apply it every night after a bath, and put on socks. In a week my feet were like new! My crack mended, and the peeling had stopped. So happy! I&#x27;ve spent so much money on lotions for my feet, and nothing compares to this!</li>
            <li> Works well, but smells like vinegar when you initially put it on.</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and have battled two ulcers on my heel.  My biggest problem is keeping my skin moisturized enough to not crack.  Well, I am coming near the end of healing the second ulcer and I found this lotion and I have been amazed.  It not only takes off the dead skin but moisturizes the layer underneath and it comes up healthy looking.  I cannot tell you how bad the dead callused skin has been and nothing would seem to help.  I was wrapping my feet at night in plastic and putting Vaseline on them. But I find with this lotion I can apply it and it does wonders and is more convenient to use.  I am on my second bottle.  I will definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a skin condition called ichthyosis all my life, and my skin has been dry and awful. Other members of my family and myself saw many doctors and dermatologists, to little avail. Then my GP suggested this, called it an old remedy, but it worked unbelievably. For the first time my skin cleared up and was normally soft. I passed it on to my mother, who was in her 70s, and it did the same miracle for her. Now I couldn&#x27;t live without it. This is a product that actually changed my life.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from very dry feet all my life. Expensive lotions and creams didn&#x27;t work. I tried everything. Finally a doctor recommended that I try AmLactin for a dry elbow issue I was having so I used it for my elbow and my feet and could not believe it. The key to this lotion is that it really is the only product over the counter that turns over skin cell production quickly. Which is the key to fighting dry, scaly skin. This bottle will last you forever, so don&#x27;t balk at the price. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This stuff takes about 3 weeks to see dramatic results, but once you do, you will buy this product over and over again. I have never had results that were so drastic that I should have taken a before and after picture.  I could be an elbow model now, whereas before if no sand paper was on hand...well you get the point. This stuff is amazing, worth the money!</li>
            <li> If you like this product buy it on Amazon. Great price and more for your money then the drug store</li>
            <li> The Lotion has transformed my skin.. Did learn the hard way that a small amount is better for my skin</li>
            <li> Has been making skin feel smoother after just a few applications.Keratosis Pilaris</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly to improve the bumps on the back of my arms.  I&#x27;ve been using it with great success when I remember to use it regularly!  It doesn&#x27;t rub in super well though.  Also, it leaves a slight burning feeling (I hope that&#x27;s normal!?)  And lastly, you are supposed to avoid too much sun on the area you are using it.  That&#x27;s kind of hard in the summer, so beware!</li>
            <li> got this product as my doctor told me about it .....kinda pricey ...but it does all it says ...I don&#x27;t use it daily ..would cost a fortune if I used it daily ...but it does WORK</li>
            <li> good product.  I go to Sams now, and buy the generic brand.  much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily &amp; nightly for about three weeks now with no improvement of my pilaris keratosis. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as others have mentioned. Not a lotion I&#x27;d use anywhere but the back of my upper arms (where my pilaris keratosis is) so I am hoping to see results soon as it adds an extra step to getting ready for the day or to go to bed...one I am happy to incorporate as long as it works. Hoping to see results sooner than later. Will update in a few months to report back.</li>
            <li> Good as always. One if my favorite moisturizing lotions. A must have for the winter</li>
            <li> My KP never really bothered me before (very light, looks more like little freckles only on my arms) until two weeks ago. Not sure what caused this to happen, but my KP spread all over my legs and became a lot more noticeable on my arms. They were like goosebumps 24/7... Very itchy, irritating and gross goosebumps. They made my skin feel so clogged and disgusting even if I had already showered and exfoliated my body a few hours before. Did I mention itchy? I scratched so much without noticing until I saw my legs at the end of the day. Bruised from the knee down. It even hurt to stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reluctant to purchase it because of the price (poor college student), but I&#x27;m glad I decided to give it a chance. I applied it on immediately after showering and headed to school. When I got home, the KP was still visible but the itching lightened a bit. I applied it on again before going to bed and woke up amazed. My arms and legs were returning to their previous state and shade. This is my third day using it and my arms are almost back to normal. No more itching either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very strong. Reminds me of hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the recommendation-- cover up when you go out in the sun! I somehow got some on my upper chest the first day and now I have a huge sunburn. I barely went outside also.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any broken skin, it will sting the crap out of it. It tingles when you apply it on normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s a little more pricey than usual lotions, I&#x27;d buy it again if my KP decides to go crazy again. Works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Dry patch of red on my chest wasn&#x27;t a burn :( It went on my arms as well. Although it worked, it also dried my skin out really bad... I&#x27;ve never had flaky skin until now! Stopped using it immediately and purchased a humidifier; it helped a lot, so now my skin is silky smooth and my KP is back to being barely visible :) Just know when to stop using or youmight end up with flaky, dry skin!</li>
            <li> It does its job. I used it for a few months and you can definitely feel the peel the medicine gives, but I think I need something stronger, personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also quite expensive, but Amazon has a much better price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Love Amlactin products... They exfoliate quickly but without the flaking. This exfoliates and is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product! Keeps your skin moist all day long.</li>
            <li> Got this for KP. After a month of use, not seeing any changes on my arms.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and nothing works on my dry skin and KP like this product.</li>
            <li> Best moisture body lotion ever! I have tried many kinds of high-end and affordable body lotions and finally found favorite one. Definitely keep using it!!!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Stopped using this lotion about 4 days ago and I still have a vicious, itchy rash on every part of my body where I applied this stuff.  It isn&#x27;t going away.  I would highly recommend spot testing this stuff before you spread it all over your body.  It has severely irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and legs.  I have been using this lotion for about a week on those areas and it has made me insanely itchy literally everywhere I&#x27;ve applied it.  Instead of simply clearing up an ugly but ultimately non-itchy skin condition (KP), this has made my skin raw and itchy all day long.  I have no idea why it&#x27;s effecting me this way since few other reviews seem to reflect this reaction, but it has definitely made things much worse for me so far.  I&#x27;m going to try it for another week and see if it gets better, but so far I would say this stuff is nowhere near as good as a simple body lotion from Cerave or Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> A good product; however I do not use it regularly.  It sometimes irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Does very well moisturizing dry skin exacerbated by winter air. I was impressed by how quickly it worked when I had been using other lotions that still hadn&#x27;t done the trick after several weeks of repeated use. Originally I purchased this after hearing from a dermatologist that it would help treat my Acanthosis Nigricans (I have PCOS and AN is one of the symptoms) as well as small red bumps on my arms. While Amlactin hasn&#x27;t helped get rid of either of the affected areas after two months of use, it has at least slightly approved its appearance now that the skin stays so much more hydrated than before (both conditions look much worse with dry skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have two complaints about the product: if your skin is quite sensitive, the product can sting on contact and there is a burning sensation afterward for 10 - 15 minutes. Also, the lotion bleaches fabric. Wash your hands with soap afterward or you will bleach anything you touch, and make sure to let your skin dry a few moments before putting on clothing. I learned this the hard way... ruined a brand new hand towel and shirt.</li>
            <li> I am a brown skinned African American woman and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that&#x27;s helped fade my old light colored stretch marks. It also leaves my skin really soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for months now and it seems to definitely have helped clear up the blemishes on my skin. Not entirely 100% but enough that I definitely feel better about my overall appearance. It also keeps my skin from becoming too dry in this harsh winter weather. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say enough good about this stuff.  I&#x27;m terrified they are going to stop selling it and I won&#x27;t be able to find it anymore.  After I gave birth to my son, I had the nastiest red bumps all over my arms (keratosis pilaris) for months.  I thought it was going to be a new, permanent condition.  I bought this cream at the drug store and after about 3 weeks of using it, my old arms were back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to try it for other issues.  I&#x27;ve been fighting that red, raw nasty dry skin on the sides of my nose for years.  My dermatologist said it is seborrheic dermatitis and prescribed a bunch of different creams.  I tried so many things but the only thing that worked at all was steroid creams and I didn&#x27;t want to use them over and over again on my face.  So I tried Amlactin for the heck of it and seriously, like a week after using it, my skin looks like it did when I was 20 years old.  No more red, raw patches.  No more flakes.  It&#x27;s hydrated and smooth.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying like a billion bottles of this stuff and storing it away.  It&#x27;s my favorite beauty product.  Better than all of the prescription creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> gets rid of / significantly reduces Keratosis pilaris, as well as any body acne.  Also makes you skin soft and supple.  I also use it after my retinoid cream the next day to assist with the sloughing process.  This stuff is amazing.  It has made my skin very  supple and smooth.  It smells though!  Has a  faint chemical odour almost like  hair dye/ amonia smell-  but putting up with that  to get great results is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this lotion. Previously, to control skin flaking/cracking, I would have to use lotion and oil on my skin after showering and daily. Now I&#x27;m using Amlactin every day or two just in the areas where my skin tends to be the most dry and where the KP tends to pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on my KP for about a week now. I started out with red, blotchy skin, obvious bumps, and cracked skin, especially at/around the elbow area. After the first day I saw improvement, second day the red, blotchy skin was replaced by healthy, even coloration. A week into use, I only have a few small, almost unnoticeable bumps left in the area, and I might pumice them to expedite their departure, though I&#x27;m certain they&#x27;ll be gone in a few more days while I&#x27;m using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it on my legs- on my knees and the backs of my thighs, where I believe I also had some slight KP. Everything feels smooth and healthy, and I can see no discoloration. I love the way my legs feel.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just started using this on my feet. Having suffered with dry, flaky skin on the bottom of my feet, blisters, and cracking heels, I can attest to what a joy it is to get some almost instant relief from these conditions. A few days in and most of the problems have mostly cleared up, and my feet feel much better, and I am less embarrassed by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products for these symptoms, from lotions to oils, and all of them provided only very temporary solutions, and even then never came close to completely clearing up the issues. You may think Amlactin expensive, but for me I go through regular oils and lotions so fast that it is actually less expensive for me to just pony up for a big bottle of Amlactin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some friends using this product as well, and though their results vary, they all see great results from this product. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you are suffering with any of the aforementioned skin conditions.</li>
            <li> Nice and effective treatment! Works after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The lactic acid in this Amlactin lotion keeps your skin from being so dry and flaky during the winter months.  The acid sloughs off dead skin and leaves your skin so nice and smooth.  I heartily recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband couldn&#x27;t believe it. I have had KP on my thighs and on the back of my arms for as long as I can remember.&lt;br /&gt;He touched my legs and asked what was wrong with them-- they were that soft! He was in shock!&lt;br /&gt;My sister flipped out when she looked at my arms- the redness has improved drastically! My skin has NEVER been this good!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every single night after my shower!</li>
            <li> Work great to alleviate my ketiosis sorosis. I apply the lotion thickly where needed and apply a layer of coconut oil on top of the lotion after it soaks in. Best value for product. Will defiantly purchase again. :)</li>
            <li> A great product I&#x27;ve been using for years that does wonders for the dry areas of my skin - silky soft. At one point, I thought I could get the same results with regular, quality lotions. Not so. I went back to Amlactin a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> Its gives my skin the softness that last the whole day  +</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 2 weeks. While it does leave my skin feeling soft, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in the texture or reduction of KP bumps. What I HAVE noticed is the overwhelming odor - it isn&#x27;t pleasant. So much so that I actually have to put on perfume to cover it up. If I don&#x27;t, I catch whiffs of it for hours after application.</li>
            <li> The research is not positive on whether parabens are actually harmful in cosmetic products, but they are found in breast tumors.  If someone told me that something was found in breast cancer tumors, I wouldn&#x27;t voluntarily slather it on my body to have it soak in.  No thank you!  This makes your skin soft so, if you don&#x27;t mind the potential harm, go for it.  THere are other lotions out there with AHA in them that do NOT have parabens, which are only a preservative and not a necessity.  If Amlactin would clean up their products, I&#x27;d be a faithful user.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> A miracle worker on dry skin with eczema.  I mix it with shea butter and coconut oil,  and a little bit of my Bath and Body Works products. Still the same benefits, but with an awesome smell. Works like a charm every time! I just pour out half the bottle (save for later) and mix my fragrant oil, body butter or lotion right in. Still the same benefits, but without the strong Amlactin odor.</li>
            <li> After much research on lotion that can help soothe skin from chlorine and salt water (avid swimmer) I read that this lotion does the trick - and it does!  The lotion seems kind of running when you squirt it into your hand, but as you massage it into your skin it appears to get thicker and &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; for a bit, but absorbs all the way and you can feel it working immediately.  I was having very itchy and irritated skin on my arms and legs to the point it&#x27;d itch them raw while sleeping - this helps and it&#x27;s no longer an issue at all!</li>
            <li> Recently moved back to the Northeast from the south and this dry cold air has been wreaking havoc on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried body butters, Aveeno, Shea butter, oils everything but no relief. Until this. This is the first and only product that moisturizes for the whole day. It doesn&#x27;t sit on top of my skin. I imagine it would be even better layered up with a thicker emollient. I&#x27;m just mad I waited till winter was almost over to get this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip, it smells like straight up chemicals but the smell fades after it dries down.</li>
            <li> Used a whole bottle. I have moderate kp on my arms, legs, and face. Also I have significant redness and extremely dry skin. My skin is very sensitive and it took a long time to get used to this product. I used it for several weeks straight, twice a day, saw no results other than chemical burns/rashes in the inner creases of my elbows. I guess the product accumulated there the most and that&#x27;s why I got the rashes. I gave up several times and then used it again for several more weeks just to be disappointed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I&#x27;ve mentioned my skin is VERY dry, and although this lotion has a nice consistency and smooths on easily, it just doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin. It just sits there. So I have a tacky, cold, and clammy feeling on my skin all day long until I shower... Then put it back on after the shower. It drove me nuts. I really wanted it to work. It didn&#x27;t matter how little product I used, I got that very uncomfortable, not supple, sticky feeling on my skin. I didn&#x27;t mind the strong chemical smell too much, but ultimately no results, despite the glowing reviews on Amazon. My dermatologist reccomended this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, even if it did work, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d have to continue putting it on for maintenance, keeping the kp at bay. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like to put this on daily if it makes me this uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t bring significant results.</li>
            <li> I cannot fully express how much this lotion has saved my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always, always had gross, bumpy chicken skin on my legs. I always jealous of girls with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; legs that just looked like good, smooth skin. Ever since I started using this lotion, my skin has gotten better and better. I now get COMPLIMENTS on how nice my skin is (especially my legs!). My skin on my legs was always, always a huge insecurity, but after using AmLactin I love wearing shorts, skirts, and showing my legs. I LOVE AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE SUFFERING FROM DRY/BUMPY SKIN.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 3 weeks now and it seems to have helped with KP in some areas but not others. However, I can&#x27;t use it as often as I&#x27;m supposed to because I have eczema on my hands and this causes flareups. I&#x27;ve had moisturizers that just didn&#x27;t help eczema before, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve come across that actually makes it worse. Also, it says you&#x27;ve got to put suncream on everywhere you apply this, which to me almost completely defeats the purpose because suncream makes my skin disgusting all over again. Only way I know it helps KP at all is that it&#x27;s made the skin on my bum nicer, since obviously there&#x27;s no need to put suncream there.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, my dermatologist recommended too me. My skin is very dry and sometimes scales can appear if I don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly, this is the only lotion that works for me.  I have a difficult  time finding this in stores.  When I found it on Amazon I was relieved, no more unnecessary trips and frustration. Also has lightened dark spots and moisturises!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and with winter approaching I&#x27;m always open to new moisturizing ideas. So, despite the extremely exorbitant price,  I purchased this lotion based on reviews. Unfortunately, I ended up tossing it out. First of all, a lotion that must be shaken before use? Really? That&#x27;s just annoying. And even when shaken the consistency, while very light, almost milky, seems a little pasty when applied.  It was a huge disappointment and I remain baffled over the rave reviews. I would recommend Gold Bond Lotion for Diabetics.  I don&#x27;t have Diabetes but this lotion is amazing. It&#x27;s not greasy and truly moisturizes your skin.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR THE SKIN, KEEPS IT SOFT.</li>
            <li> Use this after a good exfoliation session in the shower. Put it on while skin is still wet and air dry. This is great for feet too. It&#x27;s too strong for my face though.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin! Using for over a year, and I restock each winter</li>
            <li> Treats super dry skin</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have a severe case of eczema on my arms and I use this along with Prescription steroid cream.  I can feel my skin immediately becoming hydrated.  I use it in the am and at night.  Made a big difference on my legs also that get dry during the cold weather.  Do not use this after shaving because it will sting for a few minutes.  I spent so much money on lotions and this one is the best so the cost was worth it.</li>
            <li> It is great lotion for the cold winter chaffing.  I use this product for troublesome skin and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer on the market!</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps with my KP. I have never tried KP Derma Doctor, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this is a huge bottle for the same price as DD&#x27;s small bottle, so ill stick with Amlactin.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t review products, but I have to say that this lotion has made a world of a difference for me!  I have medium brown skin that was too dry and developing light spots.  While the spots are not completely gone, they are no longer noticeable.  My skin tone on my legs has evened out and my heals are no longer dry and cracking!  The only downside is the heaviness of the lotion, slight stickiness and slight smell.  However, it is worth it for the results!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion. I tried EVERYTHING for my keratosis pili, spent so much money but nothing really worked. This will be my to go lotion for life. Yes it does have a not so pleasant smell but it fades away really fast. Do not spend your money on other products for keratosis pili. This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading so many reviews about it. I have kp and I thought I would give this a try. I have been using it twice a day for 2 weeks now, my skin is soooo smooth, My kp dark dots are still there, maybe i need to way a bit more... The smell is not very pleasant but it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- very light texture, non greasy. (very fluid - hence not very moisturising)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- very difficult to be absorbed into the skin, even after rubbing the lotion for few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- smells like chemicals. STRONG chemical smell (like the smell of hair dye).&lt;br /&gt;- stings when you have small wounds like mosquito bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because of the above reasons and I don&#x27;t see any improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> works great on my skin</li>
            <li> I am 56 and already have &amp;#34;old skin&amp;#34; on my arms, and legs.  My friend told me about this and I ordered it.  I have been using this lotion for about a month, and my age spots on have disappeared, along with some red spots I was experiencing.  My arms look 20 years younger.  I would recommend this for anyone who has old looking skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it works so well, I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m not especially sensitive to odors, so I don&#x27;t notice it after a few minutes, even on my face. But very sensitive or allergic people might find it too strong. Still, love this stuff for its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by my dermatologist.  The lotion goes on smooth -- not greasy -- and I was amazed at how long my skin stays moisturized.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best lotion I have ever used. I have very dry skin and also suffer with &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;. This lotion has my skin incredibly smooth, the bumps on the back of my legs and arms are gone and even the discolouration is greatly improved... Results were visible in one week! And as I continue use, it has just gotten better and better. I don&#x27;t even use it everyday anymore and my skin remains silky smooth...Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion. lives up to it&#x27;s expectations. I never have to re-lotion during the day.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but the vendor did a terrible job of packing it.  It was sent in a padded envelope and arrived with almost 1/2 cup of the lotion squeezed out of the bottles.  So I lost a substantial portion of expensive product, and also had a big mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> Just fine, no problems at all, will buy from again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does what is promised because it makes me feel so sticky, even for hours afterward, I can&#x27;t use it. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I first used this lotion I thought it was working fine. I noticed a slight change in my KP,some of it disappeared slightly.The smell was not great but not too bad that I couldn&#x27;t handle it. Then a few days later I noticed huge red bulgy bumps! They were all over my arms, a few on my legs but not as bad as my arms. My elbows were all swollen and itchy too. So  I figured my skin was just too sensitive for this product, so i gave the rest to my mother who has normal non sensitive skin, at first she too also loved it  but then soon after also had the same reaction. The same large itchy red bump welts. I shouldn&#x27;t have ignored the other customers who said it gave them rashes. What a waste of money!!  I wish I could get my money back too because I really didn&#x27;t want to pay 20 bucks for a bottle of lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I get nasty ashyness on my mouth and nose sides and this helps more than anything else</li>
            <li> Oh My God!!! This stuff is MAGIC!!! Keratosis Pilaris be gone!!! I have tried EVERYTHING and came across this product by complete accident. I could cry, it&#x27;s so amazing! If you&#x27;re a KP sufferer and have put up with the kind of struggle to find something that works that I have, you know I&#x27;m not exaggerating. The smell takes some getting used to, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. I put it on first thing in the am and last thing at night. The smell fades after a couple of minutes and is completely drowned out by the other products I use. I can&#x27;t stress enough how well it works!</li>
            <li> i use it on my hands in winter. it keeps them from being dry. most lotions make my hands itch. this lotion does not.</li>
            <li> Best winter lotion.  Recommended by Dr. at Emory Hospital in Atlanta.</li>
            <li> Contains parabens. Contains , Methylparaben,and  Propylparaben These are Cancer causing agents.. Be careful of the ingredients before you purchase cosmetics.</li>
            <li> burns my face, but it is a potent product.</li>
            <li> This product worked effectively on Keratosis pilaris (Dry, slightly red, bumpy skin). Results were clearly seen within two weeks of use. This lotion does not leave skin feeling or looking oily. This product worked better than any other treatment that was tried. This product is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> just started to use it, so far it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> Have been using AMLACTIN 12% for 3 years. I was using the 7.9oz bottle. Just went to a larger bottle</li>
            <li> Do your hands and fingers crack all winter?  This is your answer.  I use it at night before bed, and layer a thicker cream over it.  The AHA in this gently removes the dry skin while attracting moisture into your skin.  I had ZERO cracks all winter, and it was a doozy of a winter here in Pennsylvania.  Highly recommended.  I also use in on my feet to keep them scale-free.  You can use it all over, though if your skin is dry, it might sting the first few times.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best stuff for dry skin.  It makes skin look so much better and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, especially for rough, dry heels/feet.  Works wonders on heels/feet in about a week of daily application.  Once heels are smooth, application every few days will be sufficient for maintaining smooth heels.  Foot doctor recommended it to me and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> TheAm Lactin is a wonderful product. I could see a difference after two weeks and my skin feels so soft this I noticed after a couple days of using the lotion a great product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a must have for me. I use it once or twice a week all over, including my feet; it really helps with dry skin and KP. It is a bit sticky when you put it on so I prefer to use it at night. I also can&#x27;t get over the price here, the small bottle of this runs about $15 where I live so this price for 20oz is a steal.</li>
            <li> Seen a difference in my extra dry skin. Tried the store brand and it didn&#x27;t help,  so I went back to the name brand and it is working.</li>
            <li> I am using too help with  skin condition and it is leaving my skin very soft. I do like the silkiness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly unbelievable! My 11 year old son has suffered with KP since he was little. We tries several other things including prescriptions from dermatologist and nothing has come close to this. For the first time in his life his KP is pretty much gone. It works really fast!! I would highly recommend this to those with KP</li>
            <li> Best lotion every. Perfect for dry skin</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer for skin that is unable to retain moisture.  Tried hundreds of brands over 35 years and have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> I just have a few points to make about this product in comparison to the other reviews which helped me decide to purchase it in the first place. (A bit of background, I was suffering from what I guess you would term adult-onset acne due to a change in hormone levels and was dealing particularly with crazy breakouts on my face and upper shoulders only.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell: it&#x27;s NOT a chemical smell; it&#x27;s simply a true fragrance-free product. I&#x27;ve used pure Vitamin E cream in the past and it smells exactly the same, so don&#x27;t let this concern you. Plus any &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;2. It helped with the breakouts...at first. Unfortunately it seemed to make my issues worse with continual use, despite being designed for acne. I had more pimples pop up after the first couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is a great moisturizer! I&#x27;ve continued using it for the rest of my body since my skin drys out so badly during the fall/winter. It absolutely helps with that, so my overall assessment is that if you&#x27;re looking for something to get you through dry months definitely get this. It helps with overall skin texture, smoothing and making you feel soft after it fully absorbs. In regards to absorption, it&#x27;s lightweight but definitely &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; to you for a bit. The first use, I&#x27;d recommend having at least a couple hours to let it set; after using it a couple times, though, it absorbs faster--in about 15-20 minutes (probably because it&#x27;s repaired the top level of skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, you&#x27;ll want your skin to be mostly dry when using it.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin, but I didn&#x27;t noticed a big difference in skin appearance after starting using lotion. I will keep going to see changes</li>
            <li> I like this product, I saw a huge difference in my KP within a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER... I strongly suggest NOT using this in the summer if you&#x27;re going out in the sun. I, being young and dumb, failed to read all of the label and am currently not able to function properly because I have burns covering a large part of my body from being outside for two hours. This is my own fault, I am well aware but, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it in the middle of May if I had seen this somewhere online which is why I don&#x27;t think I paid any attention to it once it arrived at my doorstep.</li>
            <li> Being post menopausal, my skin has dried out to the point of being painful.  I&#x27;ve tried allot of different lotions and upon recommendation from my OBGYN, tried this one.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and can&#x27;t say enough about how good it is.  I have very thin Irish skin that is so sensitive and sun wrecked (outdoorsy) I can say this product made a huge difference.  I can put in on after a morning shower and at days end I am not akin to a reptile.  Even the next day I still see no signs.  My skin even has a little &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; going on.  My feet and hand cuticles look and feel so much healthier than the dried up mess I began with. My skin no longer &amp;#34;hurts&amp;#34;  All of this and not $150.00 bucks.  It&#x27;s a little smelly but that dissipates.  Finally something that works!  Ahhhhh</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while but cant always find it at the store that sells it. I love that I can order it and have it in 2 days or less. This is an excellent product for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> great for your feet etc</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft!!! It also cleared up those tiny bumps on the backs of my arms! I dont like the smell much, but it disappears once dry. My feet are like butter, and they are always dry in winter.</li>
            <li> This cream works when nothing else will ... Last a long time because u only have to use a small amount..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for years, and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for KP (keratosis polaris). When used as directed, I noticed a big improvement, especially during the dry winter months. That&#x27;s priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Too many to list, but most importantly, it helped my KP a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to feel a little thick and sticky&lt;br /&gt;It can create a slight burning sensation when first applied&lt;br /&gt;Probably shouldn&#x27;t get it on children&#x27;s or babies skin- so you might want to wear long cotton sleeves if you use it during the day while you&#x27;re holding an infant.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell (which is not overwhelming) it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This size is avery good buy.</li>
            <li> this lotion works well for very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to get mild hyperkeratinization. My hair is very fine, so this does not tend to affect the appearance of my skin, except that I find it itchy and scratch at it. I bought Amlactin after reading in a beauty magazine that lotions with lactic acid can help alleviate this condition. I have been using the lotion for two weeks now on my arms and legs and notice a big difference. There is some alcohol in the formulation so it stings a bit if I put it on right after shaving. The lotion soaks in quickly and the texture is pretty good. It is not as sticky as other lotions. I am not sure how it will hold up in the winter by itself, but I like that it boosts cell turnover and exfoliation which seems to be helping my skin. I am in my 30s and wish I had known about this lotion earlier.</li>
            <li> Got rid of my keratosis pilaris within a week.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!  I suffered from Ichthyosis since birth.  I have been to dermatologists, used expensive lotions, ointments, and have been told that it would never clear up or would get better as I got older.  I have been called alligator skin or reptile skin all of my life.  I discovered AmLactin last year and the first bottle cleared my legs 80%!!!! I cried when I actually paid attention to my legs.  I am on my second bottle now and love this product.  My Ichthyosis is almost cleared.</li>
            <li> I used to be an avid sun-worshipper (Why why why, young-self?  Why?!), and am reaping the results in my mid-30s.  I am a beauty addict, and product junkie and have tried many moisturizer options for my slightly crepey skin (mostly back-of-hands, lower arms, chest and neck areas).  After about 4 weeks of steady use, AmLactin 12% has made a very noticeable improvement in overall skin texture.  The backs of my hands and my neck are most improved by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star for three smallish reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) I develop little what look like little skin polyps when using this without a break (though they disappear if I discontinue use for a couple of days, and I feel like the benefits outweigh the occasional tiny bumps)&lt;br /&gt;2) This does not have a pretty smell (at all).  But a spritz of after-bath scent can take care of that.&lt;br /&gt;3) I bought this for my mother who developed a rash on neck and chest (though not anywhere else on her body) after a week&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, pretty great results with this stuff, and a nice amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this product for it&#x27;s lactic acid content. The first time I used lactic acid, it was in the form of a chemical peel solution that you apply and wash off in a few minutes. It took a while to apply the solution and it my opinion it just wasn&#x27;t efficient enough. With this lotion, you can apply it anywhere and you don&#x27;t have to wash it off. The only negative thing I have to say is that its a bit oily. That doesn&#x27;t bother me too much but it may bother some of you.</li>
            <li> You know those little red bumps you sometimes get on your arms- that&#x27;s keratosis pilaris or keratin build up. I tried a million different moisturizers after exfoliating in the shower and nothing worked on my arms until I found Amlactin. So happy with this cream! It actually gets rid of these nagging little bumps (while you use it). If you stop using the cream for a few weeks, the bumps come back as it&#x27;s not a cure, however it&#x27;s a great treatment. The cream doesn&#x27;t smell very good as the alpha hydroxy level is 12%. But the odor goes away within 10 minutes or so, you can also place a scented cream on top once it&#x27;s dry to cover up the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream also works well on rough skin like feet, literally makes your feet super smooth in the summer when you&#x27;re walking around in your flip flops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take a few applications to see results on your keratosis pilaris and rough skin, maybe 2-3 days, using it 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this cream on young children! It&#x27;s way too strong for their sensitive skin! Also anyone with sensitive skin I would either not use this cream, be really careful (spot test), or not use it on your face, especially around the eyes. I have gotten it in my eyes before and it burned BAD, worse than any other cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It works really, really works well for those with keratosis pilaris and any rough skin! Highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> After FIRST day of using this lotion I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. Some other reviews stated the same type of results and I was very skeptical. But now that I&#x27;ve tried it first hand I can honestly say it works. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and my skin has definitely improved.</li>
            <li> My derm recommended this after I commented that I used Eucerin. She said Amlactin was better for my dry itchy skin. Not true! Exfoliate yes but does not moisturize as less expensive EUCERIN.</li>
            <li> As good as it is, I won&#x27;t buy it again unless they do something about the smell.</li>
            <li> it really helps moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have really dry skin. It will burn and flake if you have a lot of dead skin cells but with continued use my skin on my face is actually not as wrinkled as I thought. It was just so much dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bottle was broken and cream was all over</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend after learning he has Keratosis Pilaris, which for the longest time we thought was back and butt acne. This product, along with Glytone exfoliating body wash has cleared his back and butt up in a matter of weeks. He said his back hasn&#x27;t looked this good since 5th grade. He is very happy with the product and we will by again.</li>
            <li> Very different from regular lotion. Leaves an excellent feel on your skin. Seems to soak instead of sit on top of your skin</li>
            <li> Listen to everyone else. If you have kp, this will fix it. After 2 months of 3 day a week use, it&#x27;s almost completely gone. If I had used it every day it probably would have been gone more quickly.</li>
            <li> Love my food saver. Using it on everything. My family is afraid to move too slowly for fear of ending up in the freezer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good, but it WORKS.  My skin has never felt softer.</li>
            <li> as described,will purchase from again, very happy with vendor. I have used&lt;br /&gt;this product in the past and it really helps the dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day. It was prescriber by the doctor. It works for dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better even though I don&#x27;t have dry skin.  The lactic acid makes cell turnover time quicker making your skin smoother.</li>
            <li> I use this product a couple of times a week to get rid of dry skin on my feet and keep them feeling smooth.  I find it works best if I apply it immediately after a shower.  I just apply a generous amount of it all over the tops and bottoms of my feet and then put on a pair of thick cotton socks to keep the lotion on my feet and not all over the floor.  The socks can be removed after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about one month and have really noticed a reduction in the keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms.  It isn&#x27;t completely gone, but is much improved with softer, smoother skin.  The product smells a bit like sunless tanner when applied and leaves your skin slightly sticky for awhile after application, but this is a small inconvenience for a product that works.</li>
            <li> This works great for dry skin, and I love the pump feature.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion but kind of expensive, it really works for my dry arm, it had reduced the redness and dry, however, you have to keep using it even the redness is all gone...</li>
            <li> works well, nice that it is not very scented</li>
            <li> Works great, hate the smell. Wish they could make it smell pretty js</li>
            <li> . .I had moderate acne which I more or less kept under control using acne.orgs regimenThis product worked much better and was much easier than applying BP and waiting for it to dry and then putting on a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading raves from a magazine...what a mistake!  This lotion actually contains alcohol!  It burns my skin - wasted my money</li>
            <li> So far i haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin. I have scaly, bumpy skin on my arms and stomach. It moisturizes well but hasn&#x27;t really done much for the issue. Maybe i&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks. Been using for over a month.</li>
            <li> I have the most severe dry skin I have ever encountered on anybody. This is a product I have used for a long time, in conjunction with other lotions that do not have urea.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream yet, it took away most of my skin bumps..called KP skin. I will order again.</li>
            <li> The BEST moisturizer for dry skin.  Keeps my skin soft and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great skin treatment for my family!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and upper arms for a year now, and it has cleared up 95% of those pesky little bumps that I&#x27;ve had for ages. This is an effective moisturizer and is unscented, which I really appreciate since I use a little bit of a scented lotion on my lower arms and chest (just because I like to smell pretty).</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for a little over a week twice a day in hopes of curing my chicken skin. I have previously tried coconut oil and scrubbing in the shower to no avail. After being fed up with the bumps on my arm I decided I would spend a little on this possible solution. While I haven&#x27;t seen immediate results, it has made my arms softer even if visibally I can still see the red spots. I&#x27;m hoping over time it will improve but I will just have to update you guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;skin definitely feels softer than with my previous normal lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible cure for chicken skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this lotion doesn&#x27;t smell good, the scent isn&#x27;t bothersome in any way. Some have said ammonia which is true but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and goes away within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly pricey compared to normal lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have said it will bleach clothing, I have not experienced this, but I&#x27;ve also rubbed it in fully before putting on clothes/ touching fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does burn cuts, and I have learned this the hard way. However it&#x27;s not a deadly burn, just the normal pain you get when some type of chemical goes into a cut that causes the stinging sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m relatively pleased with the product, if in time I notice a major improvement in my chicken skin, I will happily give 5 stars as nothing else has cured it. Time will tell!</li>
            <li> I saw this on Good Morning America to tighten skin on arms and legs and help with dry skin.  I am very fair and have had dry scaly patches on my hands for 15 years.  I love rings and quit wearing them so I wouldn&#x27;t bring attention to my hands.  Within 2 weeks of using, my hands were back to normal.  So happy, painted my nails and put on my rings.  Also using on my face and noticed it exfoliates the skin.  I just bought a bottle just to use on my arms and legs.  Excited to see what it does for them.  The smell is not bad and I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This lotion sits on the skin and goes on like a 99 cent bottle of lotion.  There is no fragrance and I was duped  by a famous dermatologist on tv.  Never again.</li>
            <li> This is the brand name.  The generic is also great--it really helps skin stay moist, even in the desert.</li>
            <li> As someone with normal skin, this lotion makes my skin feel permanently &#x27;wet&#x27;. So I use it at night and wake up in the morning with moist smooth skin. It seems to be making my skin smoother after just 3 uses. I bought it to help with some small bumps I get on the back of my arms and inside of my knees. I think this will prove to be very effective with longer use. The smell is medicinal when first applied and mellows out after it&#x27;s absorbed. The bottle has a warning to stay out of the sunlight/use sun protection. I live in ridiculously sunny hot AZ and worry if this lotion will make my skin super-sensitive to sunlight but so far no ill effects.</li>
            <li> Good buy for this expensive lotion</li>
            <li> My legs used to look like alligator skin.  Amlactin solved that problem.</li>
            <li> This is a most soothing lotion.  I live on the desert and my skin itches at times this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that will&lt;br /&gt;relieve the problem.  Originally I purchased a similar lotion at a well known drugstore the price was $100.00. Amlactin&lt;br /&gt;is a great bargain!</li>
            <li> I suffer from keratosis pilaris on the back of my upper arms. I always moisturize after a shower, and I have been doing so for ages. I have also tried exfoliating, but nothing seemed to work until I found this lotion. I have been using AmLactin for about 2 weeks now, and I have noticed a difference. My skin became smoother, and the keratosis pilaris has become less noticeable. I just started exfoliating again during a shower before applying this product, and it seems to be helping a little, too. I also just started using it on my knee where I have a little keratosis pilaris, and my knees are much smoother now. I use this twice a day; once in the morning when I get up, and once before I go to sleep or after I shower. I&#x27;ll keep using AmLactin, and I hope to have even better and better results in the coming days. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for really dry skin</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to return this item to Amazon. My skin reacted to it poorly which doesn&#x27;t mean it is not a quality lotion. I felt an uncomfortable tingling and almost itchy dryness when using it. May work great for others just not for me and especially during winter time when my skin is drier than normal. I am going to go back to using Aveeno since its cheap and effective for all over body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel very silky and does help to exfoliate. You can also use it on your face if your skin is not super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my arms for my keratosis pilaris.  I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in redness and bumps after about a week of use.  My skin is also noticeably smoother after using this and exfoliating.  Be careful though.  If you apply this product on any broken or scratched skin it will burn!</li>
            <li> Anyone who suffers from dry, itchy skin, then I recommend this product!  I have problems with my legs being dry, scaly and the more I scratch, the more they itch and irritate me.  This product completely takes care of the problem.  Thanks for having such on the market.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that gets rid of my keratosis pilaris, but I had to detract one star because it has a bit of a sour smell.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. If you have very dry skin this stuff is the bomb! I bought it for my husband back in the winter because he was working in the garage a lot and his hands were very dry and cracked and just wouldn&#x27;t heal. After the first use he could tell a difference and within just a few days he was good as new. This is the same strength that used to be sold by prescription and works great for eczema.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! A little goes a long way. One application literally lasts ALL day.  This was recommended to me by my dermatologist years ago and I am hooked.  I have sensitive dry skin.  Everything else I have tried is so thick and goopy.  Amlactin is fantastic in the winter and even better after swimming in the summer.  I recommend it for all skin types.</li>
            <li> NO USE AT ALL. Smell terrible.</li>
            <li> Soaks into very dry, scratchy skin and itching disappears!</li>
            <li> Every year, I inevitably break down and buy AmLactin in the winter. I&#x27;m oovy groovy and use more natural products the rest of the year. I&#x27;ve been using AmLactin for over 25 years, since my hematologist wrote me a prescription for it in 1989 when he saw how dry my skin was. I suffer from a mild form of ichthyosis which creates a &#x27;scaling&#x27; on my legs. Overall, my skin becomes painfully dry in the winter and mimics the appearance of stretch-marks due to irritated, red, dry patches on my upper dermis. Miserable, my winter skin makes me miserable. Upon my first use of AmLactin I feel immediate relief (and a tiny sting). *Immediate.* Then the shedding begins--the inside of my clothes become a flaky mess for about 2 weeks while AmLactin works its magic, but then my skin normalizes and becomes smooth and soft. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how soft my skin is when I use this product. One of the best, best, best most useful products in my life. A soothing balm and modern miracle!</li>
            <li> So glad I found this in a big size. Really helps with my KP (keratosis pilaris)</li>
            <li> WOW. I absolutely live by this lotion now. My skin, ALL my LIFE, had been SUPER dry, and flaky. Eczema, KP, chicken skin, alligator skin. Everything, I had it. I tried so many Walmart products claiming to give me great, soft, moisturized skin; Vaseline, Ponds, Ceravae, Gold Bond, Eucerin, Plastic Wrap, Suave, Aveeno. AHHH. I tried ALOT of products. Amlactin has been the ONE and ONLY lotion that has truly worked for me! I LOVE it! I have been using this stuff for about 7 months now. My skin used to be crunchy. And now its soft. Flaky, but now no flakes. Full of lil hard bumps, now no bumps! I used to not be able to grow hair on my DRY legs, now they&#x27;re full of hair!  Omg. I can now step out of the shower and not turn into a dried out alligator, immediately. Today, I actually skipped putting on the lotion, and no ill effects. My skin STILL feels soft and smooth hours later, WITHOUT any LOtion. So yea, I know this stuff has totally REJUVENATED MY SKIN!!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very unpleasant smell and is heavy and greasy when you first put it on then turns sticky as it dries. However, it has worked wonders for my dry heels and elbows.  They were noticeably softer and less ashy after the first use. I will just have to use a different lotion for my arms and legs because this smells awful!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and bought this thinking it might help.  Well, not really and not for the price!  I&#x27;ll probably return to my Eucerin lotion.  Cheaper and worked better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this cream as good as other lotions on the market for a lot less money.  I don&#x27;t know if it is an advantage to use this if one has skin rashes as I was just looking for a very good moisture lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and have not noticed anything different with my skin than with other lotions. I&#x27;ve decided to give the entire bottle a try given some of the glowing reviews on this site. I&#x27;m specifically looking for a treatment for KP. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me too much - it certainly doesn&#x27;t smell great but I don&#x27;t find that it lingers or smells like cat pee as others have described. But one big warning - don&#x27;t apply any time near you may be kissing your significant other, specifically on the face or neck. It tastes HORRIBLE and your tongue goes numb for hours if it comes in contact with it. This is a lesser-known side effect I hadn&#x27;t read here.</li>
            <li> It really has helped my skin, but I can&#x27;t get over the ammonia scent it leaves on my hands..</li>
            <li> This lotion has done wonders for my skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I had suffered from dark spots all over my torso for years, using this product coupled with my daily veggie shake has almost eliminated that problem. Yay!</li>
            <li> Just started using it a couple weeks ago, so can&#x27;t say much except that it feels good and I know it&#x27;s very healthy for your skin.  I would have to check back with a review as time goes by in order to give more information.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently and saw no improvements. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very good deal  for the price.  Received as described.  Will probably do business again.  Would recommend to others.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best product for the cracks in my wifes heels.  She has tried other more expensive remedies but this works better than any other alternative.  We will stick with amlactin.  I believe it used to be prescription but is now otc.  I use it on my dry scaly elbows with success.  If you&#x27;ve never tried this you are cheating yourself!  Should be in every home!</li>
            <li> I tried everything and my skin still had a dry crepey look. This is also a great price on this</li>
            <li> Love this, keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I am someone who always had KP (for 10 yrs), Ive noticed them in my middle school but never bothered until my undergraduation. I would get people (friends, cousins aunts) asking me about what is wrong with my skin and I felt overly conscious. I&#x27;ve tried everything right from doctor&#x27;s prescribed stuff to home remedies and nothing worked out. The past month was really bad for some reason it got frenzy, that was when I started looking for that miracle online searched through many sites and finally I decided to try AMLACTIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, after a month&#x27;s regular usage( ONCE RIGHT BEFORE I SLEEP), It is runny and no fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;My KP has reduced and my skin has recovered for about 60 to 70% of it. 10 years of agony  has finally subsided. I am happy I found AMLACTIN. For the results it gave, I would definitely pay the price it is up for since I wasted a hell lot of money over prescribed stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with KP try it, I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously to treat the bumps on the back of my arms known as keratosis Pilaris. I&#x27;ve read it helps even gets rid of the condition completely from the reviews but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference at all. It&#x27;s been over a month of using this product</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing Lotion - my doctor recommended this product for rough feet</li>
            <li> I have been using AmLactin 12% for 24 years (I originally used it in prescription form). My fingers and the heels of my feet would dry, crack and bleed! It was terribly painful and inconvenient. As a teacher I could barely hold chalk or a pen much less use them! I would put individual bandages on each of my fingers. After an appointment with a dermatologist, he prescribed lac-hydrin 12% and after using two times a day everyday, my skin was totally healed within 6 weeks. I have continued using Amlactin since becoming OTC and have the smoothest, softest hands. My hands remain hydrated and soft even through the coldest weather. In the winter, when my skin dries and itches, I use Amlactin for my entire body! This lotion has truly been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Great dry skin lotion!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for dry skin. I needed a script a few years ago before it became available over the counter. Give it a week and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> I think this lotion is working, but it is just so sticky. My KP is slowly going away, but it is hard to find the right time to put this on. It is so sticky that it sticks to my pajamas, work clothes, or jeans. Even after I apply it, I feel like I need to wash my hands. But it works!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as most of us with excess keratin and chicken skin are.  I just want smooth skin.  Well, I&#x27;ll be a monkey&#x27;s uncle...this stuff is working!!!  I&#x27;ve never, and I mean never, had smooth thighs and back of arms....but after two weeks...I&#x27;m getting there!  This is working better on my thighs than my arms (not sure why).  I only use it once a day, right after my shower, because it does leave you kinda sticky.  Take a bit of time before I want to get dressed.  Yesterday, for the first time, my husband commented on my soft skin.  I about cried I was so happy!  Try it, I think it&#x27;s worth the money and will absolutely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it but haven&#x27;t seen too much of an improvement. Maybe it takes longer....on another note I don&#x27;t smell anything like other people have said. Was delivered fast and packaging was great!</li>
            <li> I just started using it feels good does not sting and it is starting to take the redness out  AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> This product will make your skin smoother and hydrated. You need to give it time, it doesn&#x27;t work overnight.</li>
            <li> Mixed with other lotions to extend the use. Love it.</li>
            <li> Is a little on the sticky side and takes a while to absorb into the skin.  I don/t think it did anything for my keritosis pilaris.  The best treatment for that remains dedicated exfoliation when you shower.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  My skin is noticeably softer and my KP seems to be clearing up.  Heck, I didn&#x27;t know that KP was a thing!  Just thought I had bumpy legs.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and based on my results, I&#x27;ll never go without it.  No, the KP isn&#x27;t entirely gone, but my legs are much smoother and the darker spots seem to be lightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it smells like ammonia when you first apply it - but that&#x27;s a small price to pay, imo!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist actually recommended this as a good overall lotion. It moisturizes and exfoliates at the same time.  It smells very clearn.</li>
            <li> This product is so trash didn&#x27;t see any result at all in my skin and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now it only burn my skin and left me with burnt marks on my neck.</li>
            <li> I have had keratosis pilaris on the backs of my arms and legs for pretty much my whole life. It&#x27;s not especially painful, but it looks awful and feels gross. I saw lots of good reviews for this product and gave it a try. Here is my experience...&lt;br /&gt;1. I started out using this product but not being on top of it. I didn&#x27;t apply it every day. So, there were little to no changes!&lt;br /&gt;2. Once I started using it EVERY SINGLE TIME I got out of the shower (so, just about daily!) I noticed an improvement after a few weeks. You have to just stick with it and put it on often.&lt;br /&gt;3. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me that much at all. After I shower, I put it on the backs of my arms/legs, then use regular lotion on the rest of my body. By the time it dries, the smell is barely there. I don&#x27;t have a sensitive sense of smell, so I disagree with reviews dramatically stating it smells terrible. It smells like medical lotion, not flowers, but it&#x27;s AIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;4. By now I have nearly used the entire bottle, probably 3/4 or more of it during my time of &amp;#34;religious use.&amp;#34; The backs of my arms are FAR softer, though they are still a bit red/splotchy. The bumps are 90% gone, though I still get a few here and there. The backs of my legs have a few bumps, but way less. They were never red/splotchy to begin with, so nothing changed there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is a good for a non-prescription, cheap-ish fix. Use it daily and stick with it, and you will enjoy some great results!</li>
            <li> The result is unquestionable, but..man!..the smell.....  It smells like urine, like I had been living on the street for at least 3 months and never seen shower since. It smell so offensive I can&#x27;t put it on unless I know for sure I won&#x27;t leave my room afterward.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have oily skin but it works great for me as well. Not oily or sticky at all. I don&#x27;t have any issue with my skin, and was told many times that my skin is soft anyway, but after using this lotion my skin feels noticeably smoother and softer after one use.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and this works great!</li>
            <li> I has the smell of ammonia. I tried several times. Ended putting in the dustbin</li>
            <li> I am using this for my body and also for my face, fantastic results, have to scrub skin about every 4 days.</li>
            <li> best lotion ever!!  I have eczema and very dry skin and with this lotion...you wouldn&#x27;t even know it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST lotion I have ever used, and there are not many that I haven&#x27;t tried.  My dermatologist recommended it and it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a five star review, but I think I&#x27;m going to wait a bit more time on that.  I first applied this to my feet then wore socks to bed.  I woke up the next morning with the softest heels ever!  I moved on to my legs, abdomen, and arms over the course of a few days.  I never felt and warming or burning.  The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is softer skin.  I&#x27;ve been using the Le Edge Full Body Exfoliator with along with this, and really only had skin peel off from my feet (top and bottom).  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the lotion being sticky or messy.  I normally apply this after taking a shower at night or before getting dressed in the morning.  I tried a little on my jawline and had no issue, this weekend I&#x27;m going to try it on my face.  I&#x27;m a caramel colored Black woman, and I am looking for ways to even out the tone of my skin color and hope that this will help. I&#x27;ll try and follow up with updates later.</li>
            <li> This preparation came highly recommended by different doctors but is not working that well for me and it&#x27;s very expensive. However, I&#x27;ll keep using it as it&#x27;s better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> Have fought with KP all my life.  The doc said to use Carmol Cream, and I did, for about 20 years.  It never seemed to do anything to heal it, just helped it from getting out of control.  But THIS stuff worked great!  I used it the first night, and in the morning it was soooo much better!!!  I have been using it over a month now and there is just one stubborn strip left down each arm. Otherwise, the rest of my arms are finally smooth and the redness mostly gone!  I will probably use a peel for that stubborn strip but I would recommend everyone try this before doing a total peel.</li>
            <li> This a fabulous lotion. It takes a small amount to give you smooth and moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> This has cured my excessively dry skin unlike any other moisture lotions I have tried in 30 years.  Once your skin heals and hydrates one can mix in other products to daily routine if you like (such as using another lotion with fragrance for one of twice daily treatments).</li>
            <li> while it might work for dry skin and stuff, this lotion does not help for the keratosis.....</li>
            <li> leaves a sticky feeling film on your skin</li>
            <li> AmLactin was recommended by our skin doctor.  Just a little once or twice a day does wonders for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my skin doctor. When I had my following appt. I showed him how soft and silky my skin stays when I use it after showering:)</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter, has been struggling with red, bumpy skin (can&#x27;t remember the medical term used), for many years now. We have tried numerous products, with no success. I just recently ordered this product for her, and within ONE use, there was a noticeable difference. We both are excited! Her self esteem has declined over this skin condition, yet boosted over night, with the initial results. So I rate this product 5 stars, out of 5. If anyone else is having similar skin issues, I highly recommend this product. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> 3 months of use...I read the reviews before purchasing the product and none of the people I knew enough to respect their opinion which is something I should&#x27;ve considered before purchasing a jar of chemicals OVER &amp;#34;ALL natural products&amp;#34; since our body is an organic system created to heal it self anyway! Pros and Cons: It did NOT leave my skin too oily. Which is a PLUS. The smell is okay..somewhat pleasant because it&#x27;s not too LOUD unless you apply it right under your nose -lbs. Cons: This is over priced. nothing natural about this. All in all, I will NOT BUY again simply because it&#x27;s nothing special than any other lotion with tons of chemicals. Try to cut down on damaging your body with tanning and every other unnatural thing then hopefully it wouldn&#x27;t be TOO bad for the rest health in the long run. Once again, personally I really should&#x27;ve reconsidered purchasing this product from the start because NATURAL is always the most beneficial when it comes to heeling psychologically, BUT in this case physically.</li>
            <li> Email from Amazon e-mail asks that I review this - one day after receiving the product to I don&#x27;t know how effective it is.  The first time I used the lotion it seemed very runny.  I expected something a bit thicker in consistency.  It did soak into my legs and arms.  I have only used it ONE day so not sure how great it is.  Note for Amazon - please don&#x27;t e-mail within a few days time to Review.  I cannot give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Really helped improve my keratosis pilaris on my arms and thighs! I&#x27;ve suffered from these bumps for years and so glad to find an OTC product that works. Only gave 4 stars bc it hasn&#x27;t completely cured my KP and it does my arms a little red, but overall I&#x27;m impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Impacting was recommended to me by two of my friends in two separate occasions, it helps with cracking and heavy dryness of the skin.</li>
            <li> I have ben using this product for about 5 days now. For a year now I have been trying to get rid of a &amp;#34;rash&amp;#34; on my neck that looks like tiny bumps (looks like chicken skin) that are heaviest along the creases on my neck, but milder on the rest of my neck. I went to my Doctor who prescribed a medication for general eczema but two tubes later it had just gotten worse. She referred me to a dermatologist who couldn&#x27;t tell me for sure what it is , maybe Poikiloderma of Civatte. Recommended treatment is IPL or a chemical peel, which may or may not work (expensive by the way and not covered by insurance).&lt;br /&gt;  I did some research on-line and ran across several websites that recommended various treatments over the counter, one of which is the AmLactin 12%. I used it twice a day at first but my neck was irritated and blotchy red, so I cut back to once a day. The little bumps are noticeably reduced and the actual texture of my skin is getting better on my neck as well. I&#x27;m pretty excited about the results so far and plan on continuing use even after the bumps completely disappear, just for maintenance (cut back to 2 or 3 times a week then).</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well on the tough areas: feet, knees , elbows etc.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOT DO THE JOB IT PROMISED FOR ME, HOPE YOU HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH IT</li>
            <li> Only moisturizer that I can find to help my dry skin . Helps exfoliate any dead skin buildup I have anywhere</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with the texture of my skin especially this time of year.</li>
            <li> Topnotes of glue give way to a base of cloying ammonia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people viscerally hate the word \\&quot;moist.\\&quot; After feeling this moisturize your skin for hours on end, you will understand why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m gladly slathering it head-to-toe twice daily. It&#x27;s done more for my skin in a few days than salicylic acid did in... ever. My elbows are now as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom, so I don&#x27;t even know what my bottom is soft as.</li>
            <li> Working fine on my very dry skin. I&#x27;m not goin to say that it&#x27;s the best thing out there for dry skin, but this may be the most affordable therapeutic lotion for dry skin so that work s for me. My skin does stay moistened throughout the day and night, but I do notice that if my skin is exposed to extremely cold weather, I can see the dryness breaking through. Overall, I am satisfied with the lotion since it&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> defective. very watery. used for many years but this shipment was not creamy as a lotion should be.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend because he has really bad keratosis pilaris. Like, really really bad. On his forearms, upper arms, legs, etc. So I got this and he used it twice a day along with some gold bond mens lotion to avoid the drying aspect of it, and in a week there was already a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m sure that within a month or two, it will be completely gone. I highly recommend this to anyone with this skin condition.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin that requires constant moisturizing (especially during the winter). This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found so far that makes my skin feel soft. After using it only a few times, my skin is smoother than it&#x27;s ever been. The lotion feels &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; and smells a bit like plastic which may turn some away. However, I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because of the results. This lotion is more costly than other products that I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion has pretty much eradicated my arm bumps after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything with my KP, I hate the smell too.  I used this for almost two months, hoping and hoping but nothing happened.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me.  You can never really see if a product works for you unless you try it.  Try it, it might work for you.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I had hoped for.  Skin does feel good at first but not for more than a day</li>
            <li> I have used Amlactin for years and am told I look 10 years younger than I am.  (Even my doctor recently said that!)  I don&#x27;t want to change from this moisturing cream.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best moisturizer with no fragrance.  It works as well as the prescription strength.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and soaks in.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion.  It moisturizes quite well.</li>
            <li> AmLactin is the very best moisturizer I have ever used.  My hands, elbows, feet and arms are wonderfully soft and hydrated.  And, although this is a body lotion, I started using it on my face about 6 weeks ago.  I&#x27;m 43 and have had cystic acne for the last 15 years- usually on my neck and lower half of my face.  I usually have 2-3 large blemishes on my face at any one time.  Since I started using this on my face, all of my blemishes have cleared up and right now I have no blemishes at all!  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a totally clear face.  I know it could be coincidence and tomorrow I could wake up with a major breakout, but so far, I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  I think that, for me, AmLactin provides the right amount of cell turnover to keep those blemishes from forming.  If you decide to try this on your face, test it in a small area first to make sure that your skin can take it.  It&#x27;s pretty strong stuff.  I&#x27;ll report back in a few months with an update.</li>
            <li> I was only able to apply AmLactin 12% Moisturizing Lotion once because I couldn&#x27;t stand the ammonia smell.  They say it is fragrance free, but it smells like ammonia.  Even after one use the lotion did make my skin feel smooth and silky, but the smell was too much for me to deal with</li>
            <li> This lotion has been prescribed by husband&#x27;s doctor to help relieve itching. He puts it on at night and it has lessened the itching</li>
            <li> I use the lotion twice a week on my entire body. The day after applying, lots of dead skin sloughs off in the shower when I scrub with a washcloth, especially on my legs. I seem to have a problem with shedding skin naturally so this is really helpful for that. I&#x27;ve been experimenting for 15 years and literally nothing else works on me but this lotion. My legs are wonderfully smooth. The skin isn&#x27;t thick and dull anymore, and there are no scales to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the horrible odor... it makes my eyes water and my whole bathroom reeks for about 10 minutes. The product is very effective for me, so I&#x27;m willing to deal with it.</li>
            <li> Why have I not tried this long ago.  My skin is much smoother and in just a week of use the goose pimply things on the back of my legs and arms are gone.  I have also noticed a difference in my hands and feet.  I tend to have very dry hands and feet and this has helped tremendously!  I apply it twice a day on my body and feet, then throughout the day on my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for over 20 years to get rid of the scaling that goes with ichthyosis vulgaris.  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion - great for smoothing out dry or &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> Great for helping &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on the arms. Can be a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s effective so I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Great product and it does EXACTLY what it is promoted as doing ! It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and deeply moisturized!</li>
            <li> I am an absolute believer!  I wish I had taken before and after pictures.  I have issues with KP as well as severe dry skin due to thyroid issues.  I have tried everything to no avail.  I finally tried Amlactin, and I am so grateful!  Within one day...ONE DAY!...the skin on my hands looks much healthier and is no longer cracked and bleeding.  The skin on my arms and thighs is even better.  Some others who reviewed said there is a strong chemical smell.  Be sure to read the instructions and shake it well before every use.  I did shake it the first day without issue; I forgot to shake it the second day, and I noticed an ammonia smell.  So I shook it and there was no problem, no smell.  It is amazing how quickly this lotion works.  I plan to continue using it from here on out.</li>
