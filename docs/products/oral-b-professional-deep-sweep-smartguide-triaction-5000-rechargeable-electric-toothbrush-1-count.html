            <li>Easy to use, works great!</li>
            <li>if you can figure out instructions its a good toothbrush</li>
            <li>And pressure warning is a good feature.</li>
            <li>Product arrive on time, and fair price.</li>
            <li>has turned out to be surprisingly helpful.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do a good job of cleaning</li>
            <li>I feel that I would get as good of a cleaning with one of the &amp;#34;el-cheapo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It gives teeth a good cleaning too.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for a better toothbrush works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK!</li>
            <li>They compete to see who can get the most stars!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but it could be quite handy for anyone who&#x27;s always on the go.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the one I have before, but it is OK.</li>
            <li>its nice brush somehow the moment</li>
            <li>I looked around for an electronic toothbrush for a while, to make sure I was getting a good deal as well as a quality product.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to be able to remove it when it isn&#x27;t being used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy so far with the Oral B been using it for about 3 weeks now-  </li>
            <li>The LCD display will smile at me when I do a good job brushing, which I really appreciate because I grew up with parents that always encouraged me to do my best.</li>
            <li>Excellent, you really feel your teeth are clean when you finish.</li>
            <li>Huge difference!  </li>
            <li>It was OK.</li>
            <li>Had to replace brush head that came with it for better one</li>
            <li>LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Oral B toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li>This one is even better.  </li>
            <li>This model is even better-</li>
            <li>Definitely not all it was advertised as being the best, etc....</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift and love it.</li>
            <li>His brother has one like this &amp; was so pleased with it</li>
            <li>He is totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t care for or have the time to get into it ur better off brushing by hand</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush makes brushing fun and more engaging.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>we all think they work better.</li>
            <li>I love Oral B electric toothbrushes, but this one will beat your gums to death.  </li>
            <li>Still love the brand not this model</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I had an Oral B Triumph for 15 years and enjoyed brushing with it</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know which one works better to remove food residue on teeth</li>
            <li>Was able to get a return shipped almost immediately and without putting a hold on my credit card.  </li>
            <li>Love the pause between quadrant.</li>
            <li>better</li>
            <li>replaced it with this one, feels just like I had my 6 month cleaning, just love it.</li>
            <li>and it does a much better job of cleaning my teeth and massaging my gums.  </li>
            <li>sweep 1000 may be better than this if you consider the cost.</li>
            <li>This is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned and is the BEST.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Time to move to the next quadrant&amp;#34; signal is not needed or heeded by me but is an excellent feature for anyone who needs to make sure ample brushing time is achieved.  </li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li>y teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, great quality, just what my husband wanted to replace his old one.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush as I upgraded from a cheaper Oral-B model to this one and can truly feel the difference in the clean with this more advanced brush.</li>
            <li>The other settings are wonderful as well.</li>
            <li>I tried to change the battery, thinking it was an easy process --</li>
            <li>It needs no manual intervention--the bluetooth makes it easy.  </li>
            <li>If I do the entire two minutes I get 4 stars and a happy face.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it make my teeth feel super clean after every brushing.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush well worth the price.</li>
            <li>the deep sweep brush does a great job cleaning your teeth..</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used these Oral-Bs for about 10 years now, like the orbital action, and have been getting good dental checkups.  </li>
            <li>so this was good enough motivation for me to make the switch, and boy am I glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very useful item</li>
            <li>With sensitive teeth and gums, this is the perfect deep cleaning toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li>But this brush covers a much wider area and seems to vibrate with more intensity.</li>
            <li>Good, deep cleaning</li>
            <li>Full charge takes almost 48 hours.</li>
            <li>and I know I never took the full 2 min to brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a Sonicare for several years and loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll end up keeping it for a while, but eventually I&#x27;ll go back to the Sonicare when I can find a good deal on one.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of cleaning back teeth.</li>
            <li>This product came quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>main complain is that it does not remain charged for more than six days so to take on a trip that lasts longer is not recommended.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has more bells and whistles than are really necessary for most people.  </li>
            <li>Oral B has always been a quality product, this one is replacing an older version which lasted many years.</li>
            <li>I rated it based on how thoroughly and quickly it cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I decided to transition back to an electric toothbrush from the good old-fashioned kind, and went with the Oral-B Deep Sweep on recommendation from my hygienist.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good so far I really like it</li>
            <li>works great must put just a little of toothpaste and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised Oral-B (Procter and Gamble) cheaped out on their top of the line</li>
            <li>Never disappointing.</li>
            <li>Two smaller heads are better fit for my mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>but this model came with the deep sweep head which I actually enjoy better.</li>
            <li>LCD reminder looks fancy, but in the end it is a lock with smile</li>
            <li>The brush works well, has way more power than my cheaper old Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>The carrying case is useful.    </li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t like a smile in the morning?</li>
            <li>I love the sweep action as it does a thorough job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>So much for being environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>not as good as sonic care toothbrush stops all the time and other things</li>
            <li>It keeps the time right in front of you</li>
            <li>the brush is charging right now</li>
            <li>I have had several electric toothbrushes and this one is the most full featured, although I seldom use some of the speeds.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that I&#x27;ve explored the different modes the toothbrush has, but I do love the external clock / tooth brushing display.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve been introduced to a whole new world of brushing (and I can&#x27;t help but to think my dentist and hygienist will be impressed when I go back for my next check up.</li>
            <li>Oral-B does give your teeth a nice clean feeling, would recommend, although it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li>Other wise the toothbrush cleans very well.</li>
            <li>The better quality is immediately obvious.</li>
            <li>You can adjust it to various time settings to make the most of your toothbrush  session.</li>
            <li>It is funny how the toothbrush talks to the timer.  </li>
            <li>Overall you get a better cleaning with an electric toothbrush and you can see the difference as well.</li>
            <li>I tried sonicare first</li>
            <li>Hope it stands up to being left in a puddle of water for 12 hours a day better than sonicare brushes did...</li>
            <li>Feels like coming out of dentist after a cleaning every time.&lt;br /&gt;Polishes really well!</li>
            <li>This is my first.</li>
            <li>Thanks LCD guy!</li>
            <li>Timer feature is more useful than I expected.</li>
            <li>B008I2IKJK Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 1 Count]] which I love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new, more compact timer displays 4 stars when you brush the full 2 minutes, but doesn&#x27;t have a low battery warning like its predecessor- the charge light in the handle blinks red instead.  </li>
            <li>typical first class service we&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon&#x27;s amazing logistics.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Positive:  </li>
            <li>The red feedback light is great for training you how hard to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I like the smart meter it comes with.</li>
            <li>because i use the daily mode every day, so it just works fine.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m a little nitpicky because I really liked the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, clock could be a little more useful though.</li>
            <li>The design is sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li>We have switched our whole family to Oral-B from SonicCare -</li>
            <li>Also, I really didn&#x27;t care for the pause every 30 seconds while brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The five modes doesn&#x27;t really give me anything.</li>
            <li>I was told by my hygienist that I was putting too much pressure when I brush.  </li>
            <li>A real powerhouse, but gentle on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I really like the Bluetooth monitor.  </li>
            <li>The brush pauses every 30 seconds to let you track the time you&#x27;re brushing, and the tracker visually displays both the time and a circle with 4 parts (the parts get filled in as the time passes).</li>
            <li>very good tooth brush, strong enough, smart enough, too much cleaner than your own hand work, you can feel the smooth and clean clearly after using it, it will take 24 hours to be fully recharged, a little bit slow, and each time you should change the brush mode unless you use the daily mode all the time, it can&#x27;t remember the mode you use last time.</li>
            <li>The other one did not hold the charge for more than four to five days.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>My mouth always feels clean , only when I use this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely brushing for a full 2 minutes now.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t interact with older model units.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend-</li>
            <li>It was well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works fine, but it came with only one head--a head shaped like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so it makes me very aware of how long that I am brushing.</li>
            <li>New product, but</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to use, I like the head much better than my previous (Oral-B, small circular head)</li>
            <li>For the first time, you&#x27;ll have to charge it for 24hrs before you can use it, then it takes the same time to recharge, the difference is you can use it before it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Finally, they are consistently brushing.  </li>
            <li>Would have rated it zero if possible at first.  </li>
            <li>First brush charged for 24 hours and only made it through 60 seconds of brush time.  </li>
            <li>Overall I would give it 4 stars, taking one away for the dud I received the first time around.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>it was new and it will work with display unit from old brush.</li>
            <li>Even new I don&#x27;t remember the action on the old one being this vigorous.</li>
            <li>The deep sweep heads seem to be way better than previous designs.  </li>
            <li>It was time to replace my old one</li>
            <li>I charge it when there&#x27;s one light left on the indicator, so I suppose it could last me an extra day or two, but I like to recharge before it&#x27;s fully</li>
            <li>but my teeth are too sensitive.</li>
            <li>The timer seemed strange at first</li>
            <li>One of them continue to give the warning sign for too much pressure even though the brush was only on but not on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I replaced a 10 year old Oral-B electric tooth brush with this unit.</li>
            <li>My old tooth brush didn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li>so far  I like it.</li>
            <li>It has a sensitive speed setting.</li>
            <li>Once I opened the toothbrush, I discovered that it was far more complex than what I was expecting, since I needed tools I don&#x27;t have at home.  </li>
            <li>Though it seem to operate with greater intensity it is not a course or as rough as my other Oral B was.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for an older model that finally stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I only use the main setting.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty large though and kind of difficult to hold on to, especially when its wet with toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I use the [[ASIN:B00ARTKAFO Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head 2 Count]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Deep Sweep series or professional ？</li>
            <li>The battery in the old one finally gave it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a few days to get used to it, but is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement for an older (similar) model that lasted over a decade (which is the reason I bought the same brand and comparable model - it was only warranted for a year!).</li>
            <li>It seems a little big and unwieldy in the hand while brushing and doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as powerful to me as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend especially if you have sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the display was kinda gimmicky.</li>
            <li>It also holds a charge much longer than the previous version.</li>
            <li>This little gadget that comes with it to notify when toothbrush needs to be charged I am ready to throw away and the tray that holds additional brushes is too big will not use this one.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very nice toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> great does a really good job of cleaning</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great!</li>
            <li> if you can figure out instructions its a good toothbrush</li>
            <li> And pressure warning is a good feature.</li>
            <li> Product arrive on time, and fair price.</li>
            <li> has turned out to be surprisingly helpful.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do a good job of cleaning</li>
            <li> I feel that I would get as good of a cleaning with one of the &amp;#34;el-cheapo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It gives teeth a good cleaning too.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for a better toothbrush works great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK!</li>
            <li> They compete to see who can get the most stars!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> but it could be quite handy for anyone who&#x27;s always on the go.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the one I have before, but it is OK.</li>
            <li> its nice brush somehow the moment</li>
            <li> I looked around for an electronic toothbrush for a while, to make sure I was getting a good deal as well as a quality product.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to be able to remove it when it isn&#x27;t being used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy so far with the Oral B been using it for about 3 weeks now-  </li>
            <li> The LCD display will smile at me when I do a good job brushing, which I really appreciate because I grew up with parents that always encouraged me to do my best.</li>
            <li> Excellent, you really feel your teeth are clean when you finish.</li>
            <li> Huge difference!  </li>
            <li> It was OK.</li>
            <li> Had to replace brush head that came with it for better one</li>
            <li> LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B toothbrushes for many years.  </li>
            <li> This one is even better.  </li>
            <li> This model is even better-</li>
            <li> Definitely not all it was advertised as being the best, etc....</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and love it.</li>
            <li> His brother has one like this &amp; was so pleased with it</li>
            <li> He is totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t care for or have the time to get into it ur better off brushing by hand</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush makes brushing fun and more engaging.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> we all think they work better.</li>
            <li> I love Oral B electric toothbrushes, but this one will beat your gums to death.  </li>
            <li> Still love the brand not this model</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B Triumph for 15 years and enjoyed brushing with it</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know which one works better to remove food residue on teeth</li>
            <li> Was able to get a return shipped almost immediately and without putting a hold on my credit card.  </li>
            <li> Love the pause between quadrant.</li>
            <li> better</li>
            <li> replaced it with this one, feels just like I had my 6 month cleaning, just love it.</li>
            <li> and it does a much better job of cleaning my teeth and massaging my gums.  </li>
            <li> sweep 1000 may be better than this if you consider the cost.</li>
            <li> This is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned and is the BEST.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Time to move to the next quadrant&amp;#34; signal is not needed or heeded by me but is an excellent feature for anyone who needs to make sure ample brushing time is achieved.  </li>
            <li> Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> y teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, great quality, just what my husband wanted to replace his old one.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush as I upgraded from a cheaper Oral-B model to this one and can truly feel the difference in the clean with this more advanced brush.</li>
            <li> The other settings are wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> I tried to change the battery, thinking it was an easy process --</li>
            <li> It needs no manual intervention--the bluetooth makes it easy.  </li>
            <li> If I do the entire two minutes I get 4 stars and a happy face.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, it make my teeth feel super clean after every brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush well worth the price.</li>
            <li> the deep sweep brush does a great job cleaning your teeth..</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these Oral-Bs for about 10 years now, like the orbital action, and have been getting good dental checkups.  </li>
            <li> so this was good enough motivation for me to make the switch, and boy am I glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very useful item</li>
            <li> With sensitive teeth and gums, this is the perfect deep cleaning toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li> But this brush covers a much wider area and seems to vibrate with more intensity.</li>
            <li> Good, deep cleaning</li>
            <li> Full charge takes almost 48 hours.</li>
            <li> and I know I never took the full 2 min to brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sonicare for several years and loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll end up keeping it for a while, but eventually I&#x27;ll go back to the Sonicare when I can find a good deal on one.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning back teeth.</li>
            <li> This product came quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> main complain is that it does not remain charged for more than six days so to take on a trip that lasts longer is not recommended.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has more bells and whistles than are really necessary for most people.  </li>
            <li> Oral B has always been a quality product, this one is replacing an older version which lasted many years.</li>
            <li> I rated it based on how thoroughly and quickly it cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I decided to transition back to an electric toothbrush from the good old-fashioned kind, and went with the Oral-B Deep Sweep on recommendation from my hygienist.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good so far I really like it</li>
            <li> works great must put just a little of toothpaste and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised Oral-B (Procter and Gamble) cheaped out on their top of the line</li>
            <li> Never disappointing.</li>
            <li> Two smaller heads are better fit for my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> but this model came with the deep sweep head which I actually enjoy better.</li>
            <li> LCD reminder looks fancy, but in the end it is a lock with smile</li>
            <li> The brush works well, has way more power than my cheaper old Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> The carrying case is useful.    </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like a smile in the morning?</li>
            <li> I love the sweep action as it does a thorough job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> So much for being environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> not as good as sonic care toothbrush stops all the time and other things</li>
            <li> It keeps the time right in front of you</li>
            <li> the brush is charging right now</li>
            <li> I have had several electric toothbrushes and this one is the most full featured, although I seldom use some of the speeds.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say that I&#x27;ve explored the different modes the toothbrush has, but I do love the external clock / tooth brushing display.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been introduced to a whole new world of brushing (and I can&#x27;t help but to think my dentist and hygienist will be impressed when I go back for my next check up.</li>
            <li> Oral-B does give your teeth a nice clean feeling, would recommend, although it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Other wise the toothbrush cleans very well.</li>
            <li> The better quality is immediately obvious.</li>
            <li> You can adjust it to various time settings to make the most of your toothbrush  session.</li>
            <li> It is funny how the toothbrush talks to the timer.  </li>
            <li> Overall you get a better cleaning with an electric toothbrush and you can see the difference as well.</li>
            <li> I tried sonicare first</li>
            <li> Hope it stands up to being left in a puddle of water for 12 hours a day better than sonicare brushes did...</li>
            <li> Feels like coming out of dentist after a cleaning every time.&lt;br /&gt;Polishes really well!</li>
            <li> This is my first.</li>
            <li> Thanks LCD guy!</li>
            <li> Timer feature is more useful than I expected.</li>
            <li> B008I2IKJK Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 1 Count]] which I love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new, more compact timer displays 4 stars when you brush the full 2 minutes, but doesn&#x27;t have a low battery warning like its predecessor- the charge light in the handle blinks red instead.  </li>
            <li> typical first class service we&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon&#x27;s amazing logistics.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Positive:  </li>
            <li> The red feedback light is great for training you how hard to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I like the smart meter it comes with.</li>
            <li> because i use the daily mode every day, so it just works fine.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m a little nitpicky because I really liked the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, clock could be a little more useful though.</li>
            <li> The design is sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li> We have switched our whole family to Oral-B from SonicCare -</li>
            <li> Also, I really didn&#x27;t care for the pause every 30 seconds while brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The five modes doesn&#x27;t really give me anything.</li>
            <li> I was told by my hygienist that I was putting too much pressure when I brush.  </li>
            <li> A real powerhouse, but gentle on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I really like the Bluetooth monitor.  </li>
            <li> The brush pauses every 30 seconds to let you track the time you&#x27;re brushing, and the tracker visually displays both the time and a circle with 4 parts (the parts get filled in as the time passes).</li>
            <li> very good tooth brush, strong enough, smart enough, too much cleaner than your own hand work, you can feel the smooth and clean clearly after using it, it will take 24 hours to be fully recharged, a little bit slow, and each time you should change the brush mode unless you use the daily mode all the time, it can&#x27;t remember the mode you use last time.</li>
            <li> The other one did not hold the charge for more than four to five days.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> My mouth always feels clean , only when I use this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely brushing for a full 2 minutes now.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t interact with older model units.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a decent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend-</li>
            <li> It was well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works fine, but it came with only one head--a head shaped like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so it makes me very aware of how long that I am brushing.</li>
            <li> New product, but</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use, I like the head much better than my previous (Oral-B, small circular head)</li>
            <li> For the first time, you&#x27;ll have to charge it for 24hrs before you can use it, then it takes the same time to recharge, the difference is you can use it before it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Finally, they are consistently brushing.  </li>
            <li> Would have rated it zero if possible at first.  </li>
            <li> First brush charged for 24 hours and only made it through 60 seconds of brush time.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would give it 4 stars, taking one away for the dud I received the first time around.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> it was new and it will work with display unit from old brush.</li>
            <li> Even new I don&#x27;t remember the action on the old one being this vigorous.</li>
            <li> The deep sweep heads seem to be way better than previous designs.  </li>
            <li> It was time to replace my old one</li>
            <li> I charge it when there&#x27;s one light left on the indicator, so I suppose it could last me an extra day or two, but I like to recharge before it&#x27;s fully</li>
            <li> but my teeth are too sensitive.</li>
            <li> The timer seemed strange at first</li>
            <li> One of them continue to give the warning sign for too much pressure even though the brush was only on but not on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 10 year old Oral-B electric tooth brush with this unit.</li>
            <li> My old tooth brush didn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li> so far  I like it.</li>
            <li> It has a sensitive speed setting.</li>
            <li> Once I opened the toothbrush, I discovered that it was far more complex than what I was expecting, since I needed tools I don&#x27;t have at home.  </li>
            <li> Though it seem to operate with greater intensity it is not a course or as rough as my other Oral B was.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an older model that finally stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I only use the main setting.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty large though and kind of difficult to hold on to, especially when its wet with toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I use the [[ASIN:B00ARTKAFO Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head 2 Count]] and [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Deep Sweep series or professional ？</li>
            <li> The battery in the old one finally gave it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a few days to get used to it, but is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for an older (similar) model that lasted over a decade (which is the reason I bought the same brand and comparable model - it was only warranted for a year!).</li>
            <li> It seems a little big and unwieldy in the hand while brushing and doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as powerful to me as the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend especially if you have sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the display was kinda gimmicky.</li>
            <li> It also holds a charge much longer than the previous version.</li>
            <li> This little gadget that comes with it to notify when toothbrush needs to be charged I am ready to throw away and the tray that holds additional brushes is too big will not use this one.</li>
            <li> I got this with an additional $20 coupon so for $70 I got the exact same thing minus bluetooth, black brush, and a tongue brush function.</li>
            <li> I took a chance in ordering this because it was a little cheaper and had decent reviews.</li>
            <li> My other oral B was 10 years old</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not sure my teeth are any whiter (I do use it with the [[ASIN:B001S2PYQO Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head]]), they do feel cleaner and very polished.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is how long it takes to fully charge.</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush holder, but the little smiley face timer was not necessary unless you have little children to help keep track of how much time you have left on brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work like the other one i purchased battery time a little short, unit came on time and in the condition i seen it which is new the LED of stars that she progress of where you are it</li>
            <li> The pressure sensor really helps prevent brushing to hard.</li>
            <li> It has adjustable speeds and a timer to help track how long I am brushing.  </li>
            <li> It takes a really long time to charge.</li>
            <li> We ordered two of these brushes recently in separate orders, and Prime delivered one overnight, the other in the promised 2 days-</li>
            <li> This will take almost 24 hours to charge fully from a low battery state, where my Sonicare took about 8 to charge on average.</li>
            <li> Not enough &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; material on the handle, so sometimes hard to hold on to and control a large slick handle.  </li>
            <li> And both last about a week &amp; a half between charges.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is a little lacking and does not seem to last the amount of time given on the package.  </li>
            <li> I expected that it would.</li>
            <li> Handle is too big and heavy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The bluetooth feature of the black and more expensive one is completely pointless in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have notices much less tartar now, and also I was clearly brushing too hard with my manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I was not aware there was one.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, no complain!</li>
            <li> i like other features</li>
            <li> I just got my toothbrush, but it missing the little blue thing between the brush and the holder.</li>
            <li> It is an extremely active brush.  </li>
            <li> Other device makers have moved on to Lithium Ion batteries, which charge faster, last longer, and don&#x27;t suffer from the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; (shortened life with age) common to NiCad and NiMH.  </li>
            <li> It hits too hard and the brushes are too big.  </li>
            <li> it signals me when to brush a different part of my mouth, and when to stop brushing so hard, which I have a tendency to do.</li>
            <li> one complaint is that the 30 second beep does not always happen.  </li>
            <li> It holds battery life well, about two weeks for me brushing twice a day on average.</li>
            <li> and the count down clock is efficient.</li>
            <li> Predecessor&#x27;s NiCad battery charged in half that time.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like my all previous Oral-B brushes.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush to make my trips to the dentist a bit less onerous.  </li>
            <li> My wife went to the dentist the other day, the hygienist had very little work to do.</li>
            <li> Those are not worth the $140 price tag!</li>
            <li> I, nevertheless, like the toothbrush, just wish it was a little easier to hold on to.</li>
            <li> I bought my toothbrush about seven months ago, but the battery it came with is already dead.  </li>
            <li> I had to go to a store to buy ($20) a round shaped, rotary brush.</li>
            <li> the display has few lines missing.</li>
            <li> I get pretty bad tartar buildup, even though I never get cavities.</li>
            <li> Now I am stuck with extra brushes, a smartguide and a useless toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Only coming with one head is lame.  </li>
            <li> The add-on functions like external timer, clock is basically useless.</li>
            <li> I find this ridiculous and a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> It shows you if you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> I notice someone made a comment about Bluetooth, what does that mean?</li>
            <li> I like how it works but instructions to set it up are very confusing.</li>
            <li> The bluetooth timer is a bit unnecessary since the brush itself pauses every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> The long pause every 30 seconds is annoying, as is the beep.  </li>
            <li> If I press on my teeth too hard I get a unhappy face.  </li>
            <li> Wrong toothbrush head was sent and item was received as not working because of it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Random thoughts on the brush:  </li>
            <li> Can be annoying</li>

            <li> I bought my toothbrush about seven months ago, but the battery it came with is already dead.  I tried to change the battery, thinking it was an easy process -- wrong!!!  There are no instructions, only pictures that were not helpful. I had to google to see how to do it.  Once I opened the toothbrush, I discovered that it was far more complex than what I was expecting, since I needed tools I don&#x27;t have at home.  I ended up calling Oral B to learn that they can&#x27;t do anything since I broke a seal.  I was not aware there was one.  To make my story short, they offered a $10 rebate for the purchase of another brush.  I just don&#x27;t understand whom they are trying to kid.  There&#x27;s no way I will get another toothbrush when I can&#x27;t change the battery myself.  I find this ridiculous and a waste of time and money.  Now I am stuck with extra brushes, a smartguide and a useless toothbrush.  So much for being environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush.  This is my second one.  Battery life is a little lacking and does not seem to last the amount of time given on the package.  My last one died after about 2 years.</li>
            <li> Excellent, you really feel your teeth are clean when you finish. My wife went to the dentist the other day, the hygienist had very little work to do. The hygienist said &amp;#34;your gums look the best I ever seen!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The better quality is immediately obvious. I use to have a cheaper Oral B toothbrush. It was OK. But this brush covers a much wider area and seems to vibrate with more intensity. Though it seem to operate with greater intensity it is not a course or as rough as my other Oral B was. It was well worth the extra money. And I like the smart meter it comes with. You can adjust it to various time settings to make the most of your toothbrush  session.</li>
            <li> I like how it works but instructions to set it up are very confusing.This little gadget that comes with it to notify when toothbrush needs to be charged I am ready to throw away and the tray that holds additional brushes is too big will not use this one.Had to replace brush head that came with it for better one and it works great .Overall if you can figure out instructions its a good toothbrush</li>
            <li> very good tooth brush, strong enough, smart enough, too much cleaner than your own hand work, you can feel the smooth and clean clearly after using it, it will take 24 hours to be fully recharged, a little bit slow, and each time you should change the brush mode unless you use the daily mode all the time, it can&#x27;t remember the mode you use last time. because i use the daily mode every day, so it just works fine.</li>
            <li> LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my son who has braces</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It has a timer that shows when 30 seconds passes up till 2 minutes.  It also holds a charge for about 3 weeks.  MMy y teeth feel so clean!</li>
            <li> Positive:  We&#x27;ve used these Oral-Bs for about 10 years now, like the orbital action, and have been getting good dental checkups.  We ordered two of these brushes recently in separate orders, and Prime delivered one overnight, the other in the promised 2 days- typical first class service we&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon&#x27;s amazing logistics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Major drawback:  &amp;#34;Upgraded&amp;#34; NiMH battery in this model takes a staggering 24 hours to charge. Predecessor&#x27;s NiCad battery charged in half that time.  And both last about a week &amp; a half between charges.  Other device makers have moved on to Lithium Ion batteries, which charge faster, last longer, and don&#x27;t suffer from the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; (shortened life with age) common to NiCad and NiMH.  I&#x27;m surprised Oral-B (Procter and Gamble) cheaped out on their top of the line toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new, more compact timer displays 4 stars when you brush the full 2 minutes, but doesn&#x27;t have a low battery warning like its predecessor- the charge light in the handle blinks red instead.  And then you have to put the brush to bed in its charger for 24(!) hours.</li>
            <li> My shipment did not include the brush head. I expected that it would. Perhaps I did not read the offer throughly.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B toothbrushes for many years.  It was time to replace my old one so I bought this one.  I am very happy with it.  It has a lot of power and I do not have to charge it all the time.  What I get a kick out of is the timer.  It is funny how the toothbrush talks to the timer.  If I press on my teeth too hard I get a unhappy face.  If I do the entire two minutes I get 4 stars and a happy face.  It keeps the time right in front of you so it makes me very aware of how long that I am brushing.</li>
            <li> My last Oral B electric toothbrush lasted 6-7 years.  So when it died, I got another.  This one is even better.  It has adjustable speeds and a timer to help track how long I am brushing.  It also holds a charge much longer than the previous version.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is awesome, it gets the food out of my teeth as if were flossing simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my wife a believer of electric toothbrushes whos from the manual toothbrush school</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, clock could be a little more useful though. Doesn&#x27;t interact with older model units.</li>
            <li> I just got my toothbrush, but it missing the little blue thing between the brush and the holder. And the Bluetooth, I can&#x27;t set the time. It is not working. I don&#x27;t know how to contact the seller...the brush is charging right now, I hope it can work....</li>
            <li> very good for my wife!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for an older model that finally stopped working.  This model is even better- and the count down clock is efficient. The design is sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK! Definitely not all it was advertised as being the best, etc....</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and love it. Good, deep cleaning</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my son.  His brother has one like this &amp; was so pleased with it I knew this would be perfect.  And, it was.  He is totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. My mouth feels so clean !!!!!!!! Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> not as good as sonic care toothbrush stops all the time and other things I just don&#x27;t care for or have the time to get into it ur better off brushing by hand</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work like the other one i purchased battery time a little short, unit came on time and in the condition i seen it which is new the LED of stars that she progress of where you are it only come on when your done. it was new and it will work with display unit from old brush.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, no complain!</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use, I like the head much better than my previous (Oral-B, small circular head)</li>
            <li> The tooth brush works great. The Bluetooth timing feature takes some getting used to. Can be annoying but you can disable it. The one tooth brush feature I don&#x27;t care for is the brush mode button. It&#x27;s location is such that you can hit accidentally while brushing which screws up the timing function a bit. Other wise the toothbrush cleans very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent toothbrush, does everything as advertised. Although I&#x27;m not sure my teeth are any whiter (I do use it with the [[ASIN:B001S2PYQO Oral-B Pro White Replacement Brush Head]]), they do feel cleaner and very polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package advertises the battery should last around 10 days with 2-minute use, twice a day. Sometimes I use it longer than that, so I notice that I need to recharge it every 5 days or so. I charge it when there&#x27;s one light left on the indicator, so I suppose it could last me an extra day or two, but I like to recharge before it&#x27;s fully empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is how long it takes to fully charge. For the first time, you&#x27;ll have to charge it for 24hrs before you can use it, then it takes the same time to recharge, the difference is you can use it before it&#x27;s fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush comes with a tray that holds 4 additional brush heads. I do recommend that you get additional brush heads to explore its potential. Personally, I use the [[ASIN:B00ARTKAFO Oral-B Professional Prowhite Replacement Brush Head 2 Count]] and [[ASIN:B008I2IKJK Oral-B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head 1 Count]] which I love. It also comes with a plastic travel case that holds the brush handle and 2 brush heads, I haven&#x27;t use it yet but it could be quite handy for anyone who&#x27;s always on the go.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for an older (similar) model that lasted over a decade (which is the reason I bought the same brand and comparable model - it was only warranted for a year!). This one works just as well!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush makes brushing fun and more engaging.  The only gripe is the tooth brush head does not come with a colored ring for identification</li>
            <li> works great must put just a little of toothpaste and the oral-b will do the job</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is wonderful.  Package was incomplete and opened.  Wrong toothbrush head was sent and item was received as not working because of it.  Great brush oral-B!!  Horrible job amazaon.</li>
            <li> I never received the brush heads, no wonder I got it at a discounted price. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Great item for a great price.  Oral-B Never disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is very useful item</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Timer feature is more useful than I expected. Two smaller heads are better fit for my mouth. And pressure warning is a good feature.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great!</li>
            <li> I decided to transition back to an electric toothbrush from the good old-fashioned kind, and went with the Oral-B Deep Sweep on recommendation from my hygienist. I was never a fan of the circular electric brushes so this was good enough motivation for me to make the switch, and boy am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a clock/timer (with wall/mirror mount if needed) if you want to pay close attention to your brushing, but it also buzzes/pauses when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants. Most importantly, it make my teeth feel super clean after every brushing. I feel like I&#x27;ve been introduced to a whole new world of brushing (and I can&#x27;t help but to think my dentist and hygienist will be impressed when I go back for my next check up.</li>
            <li> Works great - the timer has been an excellent motivator for my children.  They compete to see who can get the most stars!  Finally, they are consistently brushing.  We have switched our whole family to Oral-B from SonicCare - we all think they work better.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the one I have before, but it is OK.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my electric toothbrush and decided to stick with Oral B. You can actually tell the difference when using an electric tooth brush versus a manual toothbrush. I like the toothbrush holder, but the little smiley face timer was not necessary unless you have little children to help keep track of how much time you have left on brushing your teeth. Also, I really didn&#x27;t care for the pause every 30 seconds while brushing my teeth. Overall you get a better cleaning with an electric toothbrush and you can see the difference as well. I have been an Oral B user for over 15 years and I am very pleased with the product. It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Oral-B does give your teeth a nice clean feeling, would recommend, although it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I love Oral B electric toothbrushes, but this one will beat your gums to death.  It hits too hard and the brushes are too big.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Product arrive on time, and fair price.</li>
            <li> Full charge takes almost 48 hours. Handle is too big and heavy. Nothing like my all previous Oral-B brushes. Still love the brand not this model</li>
            <li> Great Seller and Product</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush well worth the price. I tried sonicare first but my teeth are too sensitive. This one is perfect. The timer seemed strange at first but it&#x27;s actually awesome. I&#x27;m always in a hurry and I know I never took the full 2 min to brush but with the timer it keeps me accountable and I love it.</li>
            <li> Deep Sweep series or professional ？</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B Triumph for 15 years and enjoyed brushing with it but I felt like it was time for an upgrade. This product came quickly and was packaged well. I&#x27;ve been using the floss head but this model came with the deep sweep head which I actually enjoy better. I would definitely recommend especially if you have sensitive teeth and gums. The trick to making these last is to fully discharge about every 6 months before recharging.</li>
            <li> Item was returned. It was shipped without any brushes. Totally disappinted.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  My teeth feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist and just got a cleaning.  It takes a few days to get used to it, but is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for a better toothbrush works great.  Hope it stands up to being left in a puddle of water for 12 hours a day better than sonicare brushes did...time will tell</li>
            <li> the best product. recommended by my dentist.. had no dental problems  since  using  this..  this is my second time I  bot this product..</li>
            <li> This is second oral-b toothbrush I have, it works in a different way than the pulse sonic.&lt;br /&gt;This model has a much larger amplitude of vibration than the pulse sonic models, but the vibration frequency seems lower.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know which one works better to remove food residue on teeth, personally, I look the pulse sonic better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD reminder looks fancy, but in the end it is a lock with smile face.&lt;br /&gt;The five modes doesn&#x27;t really give me anything. I use the default mode, and i don&#x27;t see any difference among these mode in terms of cleaning effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a decent toothbrush.I would get a one without some of the fancy functions for a lower price one.</li>
            <li> Would have rated it zero if possible at first.  First brush charged for 24 hours and only made it through 60 seconds of brush time.  Was able to get a return shipped almost immediately and without putting a hold on my credit card.  Random thoughts on the brush:  The brush works well, has way more power than my cheaper old Oral-B.  The long pause every 30 seconds is annoying, as is the beep.  The wireless timer clock thing is unneeded.  The deep sweep heads seem to be way better than previous designs.  Only coming with one head is lame.  The carrying case is useful.    Overall I would give it 4 stars, taking one away for the dud I received the first time around.</li>
            <li> It is an extremely active brush.  I was told by my hygienist that I was putting too much pressure when I brush.  The head turns red when I do.  A great feature</li>
            <li> I had to have it replaced twice after which I gave up. One of them continue to give the warning sign for too much pressure even though the brush was only on but not on my teeth. The other one did not hold the charge for more than four to five days.&lt;br /&gt;My main complain is that it does not remain charged for more than six days so to take on a trip that lasts longer is not recommended.</li>
            <li> Having a timer that lets me know when 30 seconds is up so I can move on to the next section has turned out to be surprisingly helpful.  I&#x27;m definitely brushing for a full 2 minutes now.  This toothbrush has more bells and whistles than are really necessary for most people.  I only use the main setting.  Didn&#x27;t see the value of the bluetooth part so threw it away.  Amazon had this on sale for $65 and at that price it&#x27;s an excellent electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The Oral B Professional turned out to be everything that I expected. A real powerhouse, but gentle on teeth and gums. My husband commented on it, which in itself, is impressive! The Oral B 5000 has great choices in its use, as well as additional choices for variable brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the cord. It would be nice to be able to remove it when it isn&#x27;t being used.</li>
            <li> I am generally happy with the product.  I get pretty bad tartar buildup, even though I never get cavities. I got this toothbrush to make my trips to the dentist a bit less onerous.  I have notices much less tartar now, and also I was clearly brushing too hard with my manual toothbrush.  The red feedback light is great for training you how hard to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that the 30 second beep does not always happen.  The pause in brushing happens as planned, but maybe 20% of the time there is no beep.  Just a bug I suspect/</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Love the pause between quadrant.</li>
            <li> Oral B has always been a quality product, this one is replacing an older version which lasted many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy so far with the Oral B been using it for about 3 weeks now-  I had been using a sonicare and I like the Oral B better the deep sweep brush does a great job cleaning your teeth.. Highly recommend-</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, great quality, just what my husband wanted to replace his old one.</li>
            <li> My other oral B was 10 years old replaced it with this one, feels just like I had my 6 month cleaning, just love it.</li>
            <li> Huge difference!  Feels like coming out of dentist after a cleaning every time.&lt;br /&gt;Polishes really well!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do! Great product from oral-b!</li>
            <li> I have never owned an electronic toothbrush before. This is my first. I bought it because it was on sale, and my dentist is always busting my balls about buying one. I still think that all dentists are getting some sort of kickback for recommending these things to all there clients. Anyway, this brush works well. I like that it signals me when to brush a different part of my mouth, and when to stop brushing so hard, which I have a tendency to do. The LCD display will smile at me when I do a good job brushing, which I really appreciate because I grew up with parents that always encouraged me to do my best. Thanks LCD guy!</li>
            <li> I have been using thus for 2 weeks and it does a much better job of cleaning my teeth and massaging my gums.  Also the charge last 2 to 3 times longer.</li>
            <li> I notice someone made a comment about Bluetooth, what does that mean?</li>
            <li> My mouth always feels clean , only when I use this toothbrush.  I have been using Oral-B toothbrush for l20 years.</li>
            <li> The wife loves this thing.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good so far I really like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Sonicare for several years and loved it. I took a chance in ordering this because it was a little cheaper and had decent reviews. It seems to do a good job of cleaning but it&#x27;s not what I expected. Maybe I&#x27;m a little nitpicky because I really liked the Sonicare. It seems a little big and unwieldy in the hand while brushing and doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as powerful to me as the Sonicare. I feel that I would get as good of a cleaning with one of the &amp;#34;el-cheapo&amp;#34; mechanical brushes that run on double-A batteries that you can buy in the store for 10 bucks. It takes a really long time to charge. This will take almost 24 hours to charge fully from a low battery state, where my Sonicare took about 8 to charge on average. It holds battery life well, about two weeks for me brushing twice a day on average. The bluetooth timer is a bit unnecessary since the brush itself pauses every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch quadrants. I wouldn&#x27;t pay extra for that feature. I&#x27;ll end up keeping it for a while, but eventually I&#x27;ll go back to the Sonicare when I can find a good deal on one.</li>
            <li> Great! For 1 week, found that the teeth is white!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works fine, but it came with only one head--a head shaped like a regular toothbrush. I had to go to a store to buy ($20) a round shaped, rotary brush. Somewhat disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;Marvin Case</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush as I upgraded from a cheaper Oral-B model to this one and can truly feel the difference in the clean with this more advanced brush.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 10 year old Oral-B electric tooth brush with this unit. The battery in the old one finally gave it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has some power. Even new I don&#x27;t remember the action on the old one being this vigorous. At first I thought the display was kinda gimmicky. Now I like it. It shows you if you are pressing too hard. My old tooth brush didn&#x27;t have that. Then when you are done brushing, the display smiles at you. Who doesn&#x27;t like a smile in the morning? lol.</li>
            <li> What a great brush! Yes, it does take forever to charge, but the charge lasts quite a while. So unless you need it for 3 weeks of camping with no source of electricity, then definitely get this brush. The bluetooth feature of the black and more expensive one is completely pointless in my opinion. I got this with an additional $20 coupon so for $70 I got the exact same thing minus bluetooth, black brush, and a tongue brush function. Those are not worth the $140 price tag!</li>
            <li> New product, but so far  I like it. Does a good job of cleaning back teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had several electric toothbrushes and this one is the most full featured, although I seldom use some of the speeds.  I think Oral B brand is the best.  I really like the Bluetooth monitor.  It keeps you on track with pressure and time brushed.  Great idea for kids!  I love the sweep action as it does a thorough job of cleaning your teeth.  It is pretty large though and kind of difficult to hold on to, especially when its wet with toothpaste.  Not enough &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; material on the handle, so sometimes hard to hold on to and control a large slick handle.  I, nevertheless, like the toothbrush, just wish it was a little easier to hold on to.</li>
            <li> Amazing! With sensitive teeth and gums, this is the perfect deep cleaning toothbrush for me. It has a sensitive speed setting. The other settings are wonderful as well. The pressure sensor really helps prevent brushing to hard. The brush head is designed for maximum cleaning and 3-D movement. I wish I had found this sooner!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works well, and lasts about two weeks for a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep sweep 1000 may be better than this if you consider the cost. The add-on functions like external timer, clock is basically useless.</li>
            <li> it  is great would buy again</li>
            <li> its nice brush somehow the moment i got it the timer does not work essentially the display has few lines missing. i changed the batteries  overall i like other features</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised! It feels like a quality care dentist. Two months later, and now I can say that my teeth are cleaner, prettier and whiter!</li>
            <li> This is the third Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned and is the BEST.  I rated it based on how thoroughly and quickly it cleans my teeth.  The number of changeable brush heads gives it an extra star in my book.  The &amp;#34;Time to move to the next quadrant&amp;#34; signal is not needed or heeded by me but is an excellent feature for anyone who needs to make sure ample brushing time is achieved.  I do, however, like the storage compartment for the extra brush heads.  Now they can&#x27;t be lost in some drawer when I need one.  Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The timer is great!  It needs no manual intervention--the bluetooth makes it easy.  It gives teeth a good cleaning too.</li>
            <li> great does a really good job of cleaning</li>
            <li> Love it! I looked around for an electronic toothbrush for a while, to make sure I was getting a good deal as well as a quality product. I can&#x27;t honestly say that I&#x27;ve explored the different modes the toothbrush has, but I do love the external clock / tooth brushing display. The brush pauses every 30 seconds to let you track the time you&#x27;re brushing, and the tracker visually displays both the time and a circle with 4 parts (the parts get filled in as the time passes). Plus it comes with a travel case and the brush holds a charge for about a week. So it can come along on your trips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough about the toothbrush itself; let&#x27;s get to the point. My teeth are way cleaner now than they were with a manual toothbrush, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Go for it- I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
