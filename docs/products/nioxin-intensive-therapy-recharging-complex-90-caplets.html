    <ol>
            <li>so happy I found this product!</li>
            <li>Nioxin vitamins are the best around for improved hair growth.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve made start collecting nail polish! :D</li>
            <li>and im impressed with the texture and managabilitty.</li>
            <li>I dont know about skin and nail since ive always had excellent skin and nails.</li>
            <li>, THIS IS A REALLY AWESOME PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t care how good they are, until they change the price, I&#x27;m going to look else where!</li>
            <li>and you will be so happy.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, they&#x27;re great for your skin and nails too.  </li>
            <li>: You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
            <li>ALSO, I HAVE BEEN TAKING SOLORAY HAIR SUPPLEMENTS WITH GREAT RESULTS...</li>
            <li>This was a great product.  </li>
            <li>I love them though!!</li>
            <li>These WORK and were priced fairly at one time.</li>
            <li>Used to pay about $40.00 for a 90 day supply of this product and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It worked OK, but not that great.  </li>
            <li>so I switched to a equally effective, fairly priced brand.</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy now, so you can be another satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>The price is also consistent and the best that I have found.</li>
            <li>and i really liked two things about this product:</li>
            <li>Thanks for chatting with us, have a great day!</li>
            <li>Well, I had a good run with Nioxin, but not any more when the price increases $100 every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>now they are very strong...</li>
            <li>I love this product and my skin is glowing too.  </li>
            <li>I got the start up kit and started buying more products after that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure if this stuff works or not although I am taking these along with the Nioxin system 1</li>
            <li>I know for a fact the Nioxin system 1 works for sure.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not any more noticeable for me</li>
            <li>The system 2 made my hair fall out even more.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to see what this does in a couple more months</li>
            <li>but it gives my hair strength and a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will never stop taking these vitamins</li>
            <li>I will go about purchasing some more type of hair vitamins</li>
            <li>Love the vitamin, but not the price.....</li>
            <li>This company could sell a lote more if they were not so greedy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pills are great but why the high price ?</li>
            <li>i was a avid user and loved the product.</li>
            <li>Loved product but the price is too high now.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and it consistently performs superbly.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>I notice improvement mostly on the fast growth &amp; strength of my nails, they&#x27;re healthy and shiny; never will I ever get acrylic nails again.</li>
            <li>If my hair gets thinner and falls out more, then I know this product is really helpful for me.</li>
            <li>I am an african american women and have tried many hair pills to get my hair in good condition and to grow</li>
            <li>Make sure the product is not expired because I once got an old batch which made me nauseous and my hair shed dramatically.</li>
            <li>Great stuff guys,  My hair is full and thick.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and you don&#x27;t need to double up just one a day for amazing results!</li>
            <li>: The concern with that is that most likely all the vitamins out there would be expired at this</li>
            <li>I PURCHASED THIS EXACT PRODUCT THREE MONTHS AGO FOR 28.00 DOLLARS......</li>
            <li>not sure what its doing to my skin yet, but all and all....very good product</li>
            <li>that is healthy and full of life and full and thick...</li>
            <li>Certain system works for certain people.</li>
            <li>I really think they are miracle products.</li>
            <li>I must say I really like these vitamins.</li>
            <li>I will just switch to another comparable brand at a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about 9 months and feel it really helps with hair loss.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sorry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used this product now for a couple of years and my hair and nails have improved so much , I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>I order nioxin product for three months ,I really don&#x27;t see nothing it&#x27;s done for my hair, I ordered another 90 days supply</li>
            <li>It really worked well and no side affects that I noticed.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely stopped hair loss for me--but that was at $29 for 90 tabs.  </li>
            <li>my nails were always so soft they would peel right off...</li>
            <li>Lets just say i think i really put this product to the test because i had HUGE empty bald patches all over my head.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend nioxin.</li>
            <li>After i finished my bottle, came here to buy the prices were jacked up so high its unbelieveable.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend that anyone pay those high prices.  </li>
            <li>They have a Live Chat there that you can use and this is what i did.</li>
            <li>:  is Nioxin going to make new ones or why of the discontinue.</li>
            <li>When I went to my hair stylist in December she absolutely told me that it is like i have an entire new head of hair on my head</li>
            <li>complete (cleanser, scalp therapy, scalp treatment).</li>
            <li>A COMPLETE RIP OFF PEOPLE.</li>
            <li>I had no idea they would nearly triple in cost.</li>
            <li>I didnt experience any break outs and my nails, as usual grow super fast.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately we do not have any other vitamins within the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, when I was going to order more, the price had gone sky high, and I could not afford it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> : ok, very sad about the product</li>
            <li> My hair got a lot thicker per strand, only a few hair fall out during shower each day instead of a handful.</li>
            <li> I find this extremely insulting,greedy, and unethical.</li>
            <li> I would like to get my  money back for those nioxin intensive recharging complex 90 caplets.</li>
            <li> There happens to be less hair in my bathtub and in my brush, Im</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was thicker and healthier, it was shedding less</li>
            <li> It also seemed to shed less but did not grow any faster.</li>
            <li> I bought them at the price of a little over $20 for a 90 count bottle.  </li>
            <li> I came to buy it again and the price was unbelievably raised.</li>
            <li> : Nioxin has discontinued the Recharging Complex multivitamin and mineral supplements as a part of the Nioxin portfolio.  </li>
            <li> No more breakage or splits on hair or nails!  </li>
            <li> this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> How typical and disappointing.  </li>
            <li> They have literally saved me and my poor hair.</li>
            <li> and i noticed growth where my hair was broken off</li>
            <li> The exposure that they have been getting from youtube hair fanatics is what caused this dramatic price increase.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and growing like mad after using their products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad though because I have been using these for 9 months.</li>
            <li> It is sad that these sellers which target faithful buyers like us and its sad that faithful buyers will resort to buying it though of the price increase.</li>
            <li> Now sellers are absurdly PRICE GOUGING on them</li>
            <li> This is beyond sad.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that the company would do this to consumers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item a year ago and It was 2 bottles for $30.00 or 1 for $19.00 now they are just being stupid with the price.</li>
            <li> JUST LAME!!!</li>
            <li> Even though i did see results, I will not contribute to the insane, price gouging of $399.99.  </li>
            <li> I am outraged!...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i have taken these vitamins for over 2 years.  It did take close to a year before i start seeing results, taking one tablet a day.  I bought them at the price of a little over $20 for a 90 count bottle.  Even though i did see results, I will not contribute to the insane, price gouging of $399.99.  Shame on these sellers!!!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about Nioxin products. They have literally saved me and my poor hair. My hair is thick and growing like mad after using their products. I really think they are miracle products. If you struggle with a lot of lost hair and have no clue why, just start using these vitamins and the shampoo/conditoner for a while and you will be so happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for about a month now....my nails were always so soft they would peel right off...now they are very strong...my friend asked me just last night if i had acrylic on them...nope just polish....my hair is thicker...not sure what its doing to my skin yet, but all and all....very good product</li>
            <li> Love the product! I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for about 3 months now and I\\&quot;ve noticed the difference in my hair. There happens to be less hair in my bathtub and in my brush, Im so happy I found this product! I wont be purchasing from the vendor Costsell again tho! I share the tablets with my mom and decided to count the tablets on both Nioxin bottles.........it turned out that both bottles only had 87 tablets and NOT 90! This made me upset because I thought I was getting a deal. Btw they also made a mistake with my order and sent in 2 instead of 1 thats how I got the 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> Great stuff guys,  My hair is full and thick.  It is just shiny and does not break.  I love this product and my skin is glowing too.  This is my second bottle and you don&#x27;t need to double up just one a day for amazing results! Enjoy</li>
            <li> Nioxin vitamins are the best around for improved hair growth.  As a bonus, they&#x27;re great for your skin and nails too.  No more breakage or splits on hair or nails!  Amazon has the lowest price on the internet OR in the store.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy now, so you can be another satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I must say I really like these vitamins. My hair growth is a lot faster. Your hair will grow faster all over so if you don&#x27;t like to shave a lot then it&#x27;s not for you. I love them though!! I purchased 2 bottles of the 90ct for $24/ea on Jan. 30th. Now the price is jacked up to $50/ea???? No way I&#x27;m paying that for vitamins. I will just switch to another comparable brand at a much cheaper price. It&#x27;s sad though because I have been using these for 9 months.</li>
            <li> I like all the nioxin products that I have used. I am an African American woman with Thyroid issues. My hair has grown alot since the use of these products. This stuff really works. I got the start up kit and started buying more products after that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 9 months and feel it really helps with hair loss. Will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for any products online but after using this vitamin I have to share with everyone. After probably about three weeks of taking this vitamin ( I took two a day) I noticed my hair was thicker and healthier, it was shedding less and i noticed growth where my hair was broken off it&#x27;s growing faster than ever. I have my mom and sister hooked on this vitamin as well. I call it the miracle pill haha. I am an african american women and have tried many hair pills to get my hair in good condition and to grow and I have finally found the product and I&#x27;m sticking with it. I would highly recommend nioxin.</li>
            <li> Love these! I notice improvement mostly on the fast growth &amp; strength of my nails, they&#x27;re healthy and shiny; never will I ever get acrylic nails again. They&#x27;ve made start collecting nail polish! :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure if this stuff works or not although I am taking these along with the Nioxin system 1 complete (cleanser, scalp therapy, scalp treatment). I know for a fact the Nioxin system 1 works for sure. My hair got a lot thicker per strand, only a few hair fall out during shower each day instead of a handful. I&#x27;m thinking these work as others have claimed them to be but it&#x27;s not any more noticeable for me cause the shampoo system I&#x27;m using is already working. After I&#x27;m done with this bottle, I will stop for about 1 month to see if I see a difference. If my hair gets thinner and falls out more, then I know this product is really helpful for me. Certain system works for certain people. While my friend claims the Nioxin system 2 works for him, the system 1 works for me. The system 2 made my hair fall out even more.</li>
            <li> Lets just say i think i really put this product to the test because i had HUGE empty bald patches all over my head. Doctor called it stress and all that. Regardless, i wanted to support my hair growth in anyway i could and i really liked two things about this product: The price, and the effect. Its been about a month now and i only have two patches left as oppose to four. My head is ALOT fuller and im impressed with the texture and managabilitty. I dont know about skin and nail since ive always had excellent skin and nails. I didnt experience any break outs and my nails, as usual grow super fast. This cant hurt :) Give it time and you wont be sorry. I cant wait to see what this does in a couple more months, i may even stop wearing hats all the time and get a pixie cut if all goes well! Fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> Dear readers, I was a repeated user of this product at one time. I used it for years and did wonders for my hair. After i finished my bottle, came here to buy the prices were jacked up so high its unbelieveable. I use to buy a 90CT for about 30.00. So i went on Nioxin.Com to search for answers. They have a Live Chat there that you can use and this is what i did. I am posting the conversation on here so you all can see why it was discontinued and what they had to say about buying these overpriced bottles on Amazon. It is sad that these sellers which target faithful buyers like us and its sad that faithful buyers will resort to buying it though of the price increase. Which that is making these buyers jack up the prices even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey: Hello, how can I help you today?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You: hello, i wanted to ask whatever  happened to the nioxin therapy vitamins that Nioxin use to make?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey: Nioxin has discontinued the Recharging Complex multivitamin and mineral supplements as a part of the Nioxin portfolio.  Unfortunately we do not have any other vitamins within the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You:  is Nioxin going to make new ones or why of the discontinue. i was a avid user and loved the product. now i cant find anything close to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey: Have not heard of any plans to replace them, it was a marketing decision. I&#x27;m very sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You: Also Amazon has sellers that are selling  a 90 day supply for almost $300.00, can those be trusted if Nioxin has discontinued them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey: The concern with that is that most likely all the vitamins out there would be expired at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You: ok, very sad about the product but i have been looking for answers. Thank you for your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Audrey: You&#x27;re welcome. Thanks for chatting with us, have a great day!</li>
            <li> These WORK and were priced fairly at one time. Now sellers are absurdly PRICE GOUGING on them so I switched to a equally effective, fairly priced brand.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it consistently performs superbly.  Not only has it helped my hair grow back after chemotherapy treatments took all my hair out but it gives my hair strength and a healthy glow.  I recommend this product without hesitation. The price is also consistent and the best that I have found.</li>
            <li> Have used this product now for a couple of years and my hair and nails have improved so much , I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED MY ITEMS AS LABELED AND IN 2 BUSINESS DAYS. I HAVE NEVER TRIED BEFORE, SHOPPING ONLINE SAVES ME MONEY ON VITAMINS. WORD ON THE STREET, THIS IS A REALLY AWESOME PRODUCT. WISH ME LUCK. ALSO, I HAVE BEEN TAKING SOLORAY HAIR SUPPLEMENTS WITH GREAT RESULTS... MY HAIR IS THICKER. I RECOMMEND THAT ONE.</li>
            <li> I have been taking nioxin since August 1st. When I went to my hair stylist in December she absolutely told me that it is like i have an entire new head of hair on my head that is healthy and full of life and full and thick...I love it and will never stop taking these vitamins</li>
            <li> I order nioxin product for three months ,I really don&#x27;t see nothing it&#x27;s done for my hair, I ordered another 90 days supply and I haven&#x27;t used them.I would like to get my  money back for those nioxin intensive recharging complex 90 caplets.It&#x27;s suppose, to be if you don&#x27;t like them, you can get your money back.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS EXACT PRODUCT THREE MONTHS AGO FOR 28.00 DOLLARS......LOOK AT THE PRICE YOU ARE ASKED TO PAY NOW!!!.......UR,LET ME SEE......NO I WON&#x27;T BE PURCHASING THESE ANYMORE!!! WHAT A COMPLETE RIP OFF PEOPLE. I&#x27;D RATHER FILL MY GAS TANK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: NOTE TO SELLERS: YOU CAN FOOL SOME OF THE PEOPLE SOME OF THE TIME.............</li>
            <li> Look the vitamins are beyond awesoe, they make my hair and nails grow like weed, but I&#x27;ll darned if I&#x27;m going to pay $299 for a bottle of vitamins, I don&#x27;t care how good they are, until they change the price, I&#x27;m going to look else where!</li>
            <li> Used to pay about $40.00 for a 90 day supply of this product and loved it.  It really worked well and no side affects that I noticed.  Several months ago they literally QUINTUPLED the price over night without notice.  I find this extremely insulting,greedy, and unethical. How typical and disappointing.  I will not buy this product again unless this company changes their ways.</li>
            <li> My hair looked shinier and healthier with in days of starting the vitamins. It also seemed to shed less but did not grow any faster. Make sure the product is not expired because I once got an old batch which made me nauseous and my hair shed dramatically.</li>
            <li> 300 DOLLARS FOR HAIR VITAMINS THAT DONT WORK LOLOLOLOLOL i bought thses vitamin a year ago for 25 dollars for a 90 count didnt do NOTHING for my hair, my nails grew though</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and I have been refereing my client to purchase these vitamins. I had no idea they would nearly triple in cost. I just ordered them in January paying only $28, now they are $79. I will go about purchasing some more type of hair vitamins this is ridiculous. Love the vitamin, but not the price.....</li>
            <li> Loved product but the price is too high now. Seems like a substantial increase in price.  Was $21.00 for 90 tabs in January, 2012, now it&#x27;s $139.00.  Why????  Will go back to using Biotin, was going to try the 500,000 mcg dosage but the stories of the severe acne scared me so I&#x27;ll go back to the smaller dosage I was using before.</li>
            <li> I took the tablets for several months and I did notice some improvement.  Unfortunately, when I was going to order more, the price had gone sky high, and I could not afford it.  After a while without taking the pills, my hair started falling off again.  This company could sell a lote more if they were not so greedy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this. I just got it for $77 2 weeks ago. I came to buy it again and the price was unbelievably raised. Why ?????&lt;br /&gt;The pills are great but why the high price ?</li>
            <li> I have been buying the nioxin vitamins for 2 years now and the price has JUMPED from $25+ to $60+...I am outraged!...I would not recommend that anyone pay those high prices.  The exposure that they have been getting from youtube hair fanatics is what caused this dramatic price increase.  I am disappointed that the company would do this to consumers.  This is beyond sad.</li>
            <li> I choose this item because I was looking for a present. The item was just as it was described in picture. I would definitely recommend this item to my friends and family</li>
            <li> This was a great product.  It absolutely stopped hair loss for me--but that was at $29 for 90 tabs.  To see 90 tabs going for $299 is crazy--because once you stop, the loss just starts again.  Well, I had a good run with Nioxin, but not any more when the price increases $100 every couple of weeks. Sayonara.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a year ago and It was 2 bottles for $30.00 or 1 for $19.00 now they are just being stupid with the price. It worked OK, but not that great.  I will NEVER pay this $299.99 price. JUST LAME!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any growth after one bottle, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Is this product for hair growth?  Do you still sell it?  If so, I would like to buy a couple of bottles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin vitamins for over 7 years and have never...ever paid $300.  I only pay about $25 in the store for 90 count and about $17.99 when they are on sale.  Don&#x27;t get taken!</li>
