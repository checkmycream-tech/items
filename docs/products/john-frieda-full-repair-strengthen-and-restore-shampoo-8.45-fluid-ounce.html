            <li>but not as good a deal,</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because the smell is good, my mom loves it so does my sister.</li>
            <li>Has a strong scent, which I could do with out ,but does make your hair look good.</li>
            <li>This is pretty great for drugstore shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love john Frieda hair products they make my hair feel and smell great and look pretty</li>
            <li>I was able to score this shampoo and it&#x27;s matching conditioner for very cheap.</li>
            <li>and I think with continued use a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Love all the John Frieda products.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It feels like salon quality and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I feel like this shampoo has helped restore that, and prevent me from getting more.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much better after using this.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feel of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been pairing this shampoo with a more moisturizing and heavier conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did notice a difference, for the better.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a year and love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s probably why I used more than I needed to --</li>
            <li>Many people with color-treated hair are told to avoid sulfates in shampoo products, in order to preserve the color.  </li>
            <li>So I think this shampoo is directed more at people *without* color-treated hair, although it doesn&#x27;t specifically say so on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many, including paul mitchell and biolage.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>She just had me get more at Safeway,</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is easily damaged and tangles if the wind blows.  </li>
            <li>Gives full, clean hair and keeps it in good condition.</li>
            <li>Works great, definitely thickens and protects my hair even with daily use, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling great, and soft.</li>
            <li>if they cant package it more securely</li>
            <li>I would pick it up in store and not through mail-order because the caps twist off too easily during transit.</li>
            <li>Full full full hair!!</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>and it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Great for hair repair - Only used once</li>
            <li>This is actually a great price too, especially if you have Amazon prime.</li>
            <li>Not only do I think this is a good price, this product is my favorite at the moment within the brand.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore at any store in the Houston area was excited to find it at Amazon..</li>
            <li>Moisturizing and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably really good for hair that only has heat styling damage.</li>
            <li>This shampoo \\&quot;Full repair\\&quot; does do the trick.  </li>
            <li>I am using the full line.</li>
            <li>Much more manageable and very soft.</li>
            <li>Really makes my hair pretty with body, but still very clean.</li>
            <li>I get full rich lather with jut a small amount of this shampoo, it smells great, and it&#x27;s really working to repair my hair!</li>
            <li>If you have heat-damaged hair, this may be worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that the fragrance is strong, so much so that my husband won&#x27;t use (he feels like he&#x27;s wearing perfume).  </li>
            <li>This product helps to keep it soft, smooth, and tangle free at a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it to get your hair clean, which is a plus because 8 1/2 oz.</li>
            <li>Soft, manageable, shinny strong hair.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for some more.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is the scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just coating the hair exactly like cheaper shampoos.</li>
            <li>My hair was noticeably healthier after using it for a while, and despite daily blowdrying/straightening, the shampoo helped my hair still feel healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I was born with hair that looks consistently frizzy.</li>
            <li>I think for that minimum level of damage, this shampoo works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They most definitely deserve awards and accolades for this one.</li>
            <li>The final selling point to this shampoo was how long the scent lingered in my hair -- hours later my hair would still smell as wonderful as the shampoo!</li>
            <li>I have also tried the conditioner and while it&#x27;s not bad, I don&#x27;t actually use it because I found that the combo of Full Repair shampoo/conditioner made my hair</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair soft &amp; full.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was great, but switching to a new a new shampoo usually has a positive effect.</li>
            <li>Living in a dry climate, my hair takes a beating &amp; keeping it healthy now that I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s has been a challenge.  </li>
            <li>I notice there is fragrance listed among the ingredients (zoom in on the final product image), although I don&#x27;t remember this having a strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i constantly buy new kinds in search of something I love.  </li>
            <li>I was so sad that this wasn&#x27;t being sold in my local stores anymore, but super happy when I found it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li>These products have really made a difference</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in your hair.</li>
            <li>It also lathers really well and cleans without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li>I am really conditioned to expect a lather.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank goodness that we have Amazon, haha.</li>
            <li>As you can imagine, that was very damaging to my hair</li>
            <li>As a side note, I also tried the conditioner that goes with this and didn&#x27;t care for it too much.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was very moisturizing, but I would recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>straw-like no matter what I used &amp; now my hair texture is much improved &amp; now manageable.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this shampoo and conditioner because I have very dry hair that is very long and tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>I have long, curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>shampoo definitely got my hair and scalp clean after workouts, exposure to outdoor pollen, etc.  </li>
            <li>(I have very light hair that I dye black, and fading is often an issue.  </li>
            <li>Will buy it as long as it available.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it didn&#x27;t make me greasy or dry me</li>
            <li>Full Repair shampoo and conditioner remedy my lackluster curls almost daily.</li>
            <li>B005MIFEME John Frieda Full Repair Strengthen and Restore Shampoo ,8.45 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li>I actually went through a full-sized tube of this shampoo fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, in addition to using this shampoo and the conditioner from the same product line, I was using a conditioning detangler most days, a leave-in treatment once or twice a week, and I was deep conditioning my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li>If you have heat-damaged hair, this may be worth a try.y that this wows me, but it is a serviceable shampoo that does not dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li>After shampooing and conditioning, I could barely get a brush through my hair because it was so dry, and my hair seemed to be more damaged after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>In other words, it breaks easily.</li>
            <li>and really leaves my hair feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s pretty good for the price, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; any kind of damage.</li>
            <li>Even salon products with lower sulfates and high quality cremes leave too much build up for my hair to curl properly (including Wen).</li>
            <li>I have to blow dry, use a hot iron or a curling iron to make it look like normal hair.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be washed with cheap shampoo, or whatever I could get on sale as money has always been tight.</li>
            <li>I read on the John Frieda site that this shampoo and conditioner would help my hair more because I&#x27;ve started using other products such as the 3-Day straight, and then blow drying my hair and even sometimes using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and manageable..</li>
            <li>have bought two batches so far.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this fixed all my problems in just one use, but I did see a noticable difference after one use.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has really helped moisturize my hair and put the shine back in.  </li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo and conditioner that has given my hair a new life!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s seriously chemically damaged and drugstore shampoos cannot coat it with silicone and make it all better.</li>
            <li>I would definitely pay full price for this, if it came down to it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few months after I fried my hair with a crimper that got WAY too hot!</li>
            <li>When I stopped using it for a while because I couldn&#x27;t find it, my hair went back to being dry, and very brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say that this wows me, but it is a serviceable shampoo that does not dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out a few years ago.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I have seen a huge improvement and will continue to use it!</li>

            <li> At first I thought it was great, but switching to a new a new shampoo usually has a positive effect.</li>
            <li> Living in a dry climate, my hair takes a beating &amp; keeping it healthy now that I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s has been a challenge.  </li>
            <li> I notice there is fragrance listed among the ingredients (zoom in on the final product image), although I don&#x27;t remember this having a strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i constantly buy new kinds in search of something I love.  </li>
            <li> I was so sad that this wasn&#x27;t being sold in my local stores anymore, but super happy when I found it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> These products have really made a difference</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> It also lathers really well and cleans without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> I am really conditioned to expect a lather.)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank goodness that we have Amazon, haha.</li>
            <li> As you can imagine, that was very damaging to my hair</li>
            <li> As a side note, I also tried the conditioner that goes with this and didn&#x27;t care for it too much.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was very moisturizing, but I would recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> straw-like no matter what I used &amp; now my hair texture is much improved &amp; now manageable.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this shampoo and conditioner because I have very dry hair that is very long and tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li> shampoo definitely got my hair and scalp clean after workouts, exposure to outdoor pollen, etc.  </li>
            <li> (I have very light hair that I dye black, and fading is often an issue.  </li>

            <li> I actually went through a full-sized tube of this shampoo fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, in addition to using this shampoo and the conditioner from the same product line, I was using a conditioning detangler most days, a leave-in treatment once or twice a week, and I was deep conditioning my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li> If you have heat-damaged hair, this may be worth a try.y that this wows me, but it is a serviceable shampoo that does not dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> After shampooing and conditioning, I could barely get a brush through my hair because it was so dry, and my hair seemed to be more damaged after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> In other words, it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> and really leaves my hair feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s pretty good for the price, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; any kind of damage.</li>
            <li> Even salon products with lower sulfates and high quality cremes leave too much build up for my hair to curl properly (including Wen).</li>
            <li> I have to blow dry, use a hot iron or a curling iron to make it look like normal hair.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be washed with cheap shampoo, or whatever I could get on sale as money has always been tight.</li>
            <li> I read on the John Frieda site that this shampoo and conditioner would help my hair more because I&#x27;ve started using other products such as the 3-Day straight, and then blow drying my hair and even sometimes using a flat iron.</li>

            <li> This shampoo has really helped moisturize my hair and put the shine back in.  </li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s seriously chemically damaged and drugstore shampoos cannot coat it with silicone and make it all better.</li>
            <li> I would definitely pay full price for this, if it came down to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months after I fried my hair with a crimper that got WAY too hot!</li>
            <li> When I stopped using it for a while because I couldn&#x27;t find it, my hair went back to being dry, and very brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I have seen a huge improvement and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat dry and damaged from color treatments and daily shampooing; I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer or heat style.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> like to use this product</li>
            <li> I am chronically ill and I have tried so many hair products lately for my sick, lifeless, falling out hair. These products have really made a difference and I think with continued use a huge difference! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love all the John Frieda products.</li>
            <li> Works great, definitely thickens and protects my hair even with daily use, and smells wonderful. Fantastic product!!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and clean hair without stripping it. I will definitely be back for some more.  It is a great product</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, curly hair. All the other restorative shampoos I&#x27;ve used weighed my hair down and/or made my hair too soft to style my curls and get the volume I want. This is the BEST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells great. It does leave my hair soft &amp; full. And my curls have definition.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, fine hair. In other words, it breaks easily. But I also have to wash my hair every day or it gets oily and starts looking like something out of Medusa: Hairstyles for the Angry Gorgon. This stuff does the trick and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or cause weird build-up. It smells great. And you don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it to get your hair clean, which is a plus because 8 1/2 oz. isn&#x27;t a huge bottle. You should know that it doesn&#x27;t foam up a lot. So if you like a shampoo that turns your hair into a mound of whipped cream, this is not the one for you. I have also tried the conditioner and while it&#x27;s not bad, I don&#x27;t actually use it because I found that the combo of Full Repair shampoo/conditioner made my hair *So* silky that it didn&#x27;t have any body left. Drowned rat is not a good look. So I stick with the shampoo and a little glossing cream and it works a treat.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore at any store in the Houston area was excited to find it at Amazon.. It leaves your hair soft and manageable..</li>
            <li> I love this product because the smell is good, my mom loves it so does my sister. Niice product to care ur hair</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product</li>
            <li> This triggered an allergic reaction in my scalp and gave me bleeding sores.  I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling great, and soft. It is great for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;After you blow dryer your hair look like it was don at the salon.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo!!  Moisturizing and rinses clean.  Great for fine and frizzy hair.....I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so ordered it!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!  I have very fine hair that is easily damaged and tangles if the wind blows.  This product helps to keep it soft, smooth, and tangle free at a reasonable price!  The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it is the scent.  It isn&#x27;t bad... just not good.</li>
            <li> I purchased the gift set with shampoo, conditioner and bonus mask. At first I thought it was great, but switching to a new a new shampoo usually has a positive effect. After using it for a week, my hair became very dry and the ends look frizzy and damaged. No amount of my usual styling cream will help. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s pretty good for the price, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;repairing\\&quot; any kind of damage. It&#x27;s just coating the hair exactly like cheaper shampoos. It&#x27;s probably really good for hair that only has heat styling damage. I went through bleaching my hair after dying it black for years so it&#x27;s seriously chemically damaged and drugstore shampoos cannot coat it with silicone and make it all better.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo.  The packaging is poor.  Half of one of the shampoos leaked in the overwrap,  Not worth it if they cant package it more securely</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! I have been using it for a few months after I fried my hair with a crimper that got WAY too hot! Needless to say I have seen a huge improvement and will continue to use it! Love the conditioner too!</li>
            <li> Full full full hair!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner set. It smells delicious too :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have fine limp hair. This gives me fullness and body. Will buy it as long as it available.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for a great price.  It feels like salon quality and smells fantastic! have bought two batches so far.</li>
            <li> My wife just loves this product, makes her hair shine !!! Much more manageable and very soft. will buy again.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this product and we will continue to buy it for her.  She loves all the other products, as well.</li>
            <li> I get split ends really bad and I feel like this shampoo has helped restore that, and prevent me from getting more. My hair feels so much better after using this.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. It has helped to make my hair softer and stronger. Love IT! Buy It. You Will Like IT!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this shampoo and conditioner. It really makes a difference in your hair.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. My hair was noticeably healthier after using it for a while, and despite daily blowdrying/straightening, the shampoo helped my hair still feel healthy and moisturized. The final selling point to this shampoo was how long the scent lingered in my hair -- hours later my hair would still smell as wonderful as the shampoo!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well with my hair type. It dried it out</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting my naturally wavy hair to curl. It doesn&#x27;t help that I dye it regularly. I&#x27;ve tried a myriad of products meant for curly and died hair. Even salon products with lower sulfates and high quality cremes leave too much build up for my hair to curl properly (including Wen). Full Repair shampoo and conditioner remedy my lackluster curls almost daily. I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out a few years ago. I&#x27;m happy to see Amazon sells it in a two pack. As an added bonus, it happens to be the best-smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old with thin hair.  This shampoo adds body and strength to my hair.  I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be washed with cheap shampoo, or whatever I could get on sale as money has always been tight. Once I became to coupon (yes people, I coupon)... I was able to score this shampoo and it&#x27;s matching conditioner for very cheap. I was excited, as my hair felt horrible from daily abuse. I wouldn&#x27;t say this fixed all my problems in just one use, but I did see a noticable difference after one use. I absolutely LOVE the way it smells! I would definitely pay full price for this, if it came down to it.</li>
            <li> Great for hair repair - Only used once and  can already feel / see a difference...</li>
            <li> I love john Frieda hair products they make my hair feel and smell great and look pretty I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used John Frieda products for years.  I always find that they are a good product for the price.  I was looking forward to adding a little depth to my hair which has recently begun to thin.  This shampoo \\&quot;Full repair\\&quot; does do the trick.  My hair is fuller after every wash.  It&#x27;s got bounce and shine.  My hair looks especially nice after styling. However, I&#x27;m not as sold on the conditioner which seems to leave my hair drier.  So I&#x27;ve been pairing this shampoo with a more moisturizing and heavier conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that the fragrance is strong, so much so that my husband won&#x27;t use (he feels like he&#x27;s wearing perfume).  It doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Did notice a difference, for the better.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use this and think it is great !</li>
            <li> This is pretty great for drugstore shampoo. The scent is heavenly! It also lathers really well and cleans without drying out my hair. I can&#x27;t speak to any &amp;#34;repairing&amp;#34; effect since I don&#x27;t heat style my hair, but I think it would be good for any hair type. I have fine hair and it didn&#x27;t make me greasy or dry me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the packaging. I would pick it up in store and not through mail-order because the caps twist off too easily during transit. Amazon put it in a plastic bag and it still ended up leaking everywhere. You also don&#x27;t want to keep this shampoo in the shower. If the caps get wet, mold starts to grow in the interior of the caps.</li>
            <li> For years every shampoo I used shredded my hair though I do not color it. This stuff is amazing.  I have used it for a year and love it.</li>
            <li> I have thick and coarse hair that has been chemically processed. This shampoo has helped repair damage and made my hair shiny again. I love the smell and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this shampoo and conditioner because I have very dry hair that is very long and tangles very easily. I saw this product, and I figured I would try it because it claims to repair and strengthen damaged hair like I have. This shampoo and conditioner actually made my hair WORSE. After shampooing and conditioning, I could barely get a brush through my hair because it was so dry, and my hair seemed to be more damaged after using this shampoo and conditioner. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was born with hair that looks consistently frizzy. I have to blow dry, use a hot iron or a curling iron to make it look like normal hair. As you can guess all of this processing damages the hair. I decided to try this line of products and my hair looks shiny again. I love it. I am using the full line. Shampoo, conditioner and the deep conditioner once a week.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005MIFEME John Frieda Full Repair Strengthen and Restore Shampoo ,8.45 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I actually went through a full-sized tube of this shampoo fairly quickly.  I think this is because the tubes are somewhat small and also, I just had to use a lot of this.  (In fairness, I have a lot of hair.)  My hair is somewhat dry and damaged from color treatments and daily shampooing; I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer or heat style.  I think for that minimum level of damage, this shampoo works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did not dry my hair out.  However, in addition to using this shampoo and the conditioner from the same product line, I was using a conditioning detangler most days, a leave-in treatment once or twice a week, and I was deep conditioning my hair once a week.  If you&#x27;re like me and use a lot of products, then, you probably won&#x27;t notice any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo definitely got my hair and scalp clean after workouts, exposure to outdoor pollen, etc.  (I shampoo at night.)  It lathered a little, but not a ton.  (That&#x27;s probably why I used more than I needed to -- I am really conditioned to expect a lather.)  It was non-irritating and washed out without leaving residue.  I notice there is fragrance listed among the ingredients (zoom in on the final product image), although I don&#x27;t remember this having a strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: this contains sodium laureth sulfate.  Many people with color-treated hair are told to avoid sulfates in shampoo products, in order to preserve the color.  So I think this shampoo is directed more at people *without* color-treated hair, although it doesn&#x27;t specifically say so on the bottle.  I suspect the damage being referred to on the container is heat damage.  The language could definitely be a little clearer.  In all fairness, though, my color did not appreciably fade in the several weeks I used this shampoo and the accompanying conditioner.  (I have very light hair that I dye black, and fading is often an issue.  This certainly did not accelerate any negative processes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I can&#x27;t say that this wows me, but it is a serviceable shampoo that does not dry my hair out.  If you have heat-damaged hair, this may be worth a try.y that this wows me, but it is a serviceable shampoo that does not dry my hair out.  If you have heat-damaged hair, this may be worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that has given my hair a new life! I&#x27;ve tried so many, including paul mitchell and biolage. I was so sad that this wasn&#x27;t being sold in my local stores anymore, but super happy when I found it here on Amazon! I hope they never stop selling it! When I stopped using it for a while because I couldn&#x27;t find it, my hair went back to being dry, and very brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness that we have Amazon, haha. This is actually a great price too, especially if you have Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I made a stupid decision to dye my hair twice in one weekend.  As you can imagine, that was very damaging to my hair and I&#x27;ve been trying to restore it ever since.  This shampoo has really helped moisturize my hair and put the shine back in.  As a side note, I also tried the conditioner that goes with this and didn&#x27;t care for it too much.  I didn&#x27;t think it was very moisturizing, but I would recommend this shampoo.  I also heat style my hair almost everyday and I think this helps protect it from that too.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Heartbreaking work by the John Freida Team. They most definitely deserve awards and accolades for this one. Genius! Love it!</li>
            <li> Living in a dry climate, my hair takes a beating &amp; keeping it healthy now that I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s has been a challenge.  I&#x27;ve found this is the best champoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;d gotten so my hair was almost straw-like no matter what I used &amp; now my hair texture is much improved &amp; now manageable.</li>
            <li> I had been using the John Frieda shampoo &amp; conditioner for brunette hair. I read on the John Frieda site that this shampoo and conditioner would help my hair more because I&#x27;ve started using other products such as the 3-Day straight, and then blow drying my hair and even sometimes using a flat iron. I ordered this off the Amazon site. I got a 2 pack for just less that $10. In the store you  pay almost $10 for 1! I get full rich lather with jut a small amount of this shampoo, it smells great, and it&#x27;s really working to repair my hair!</li>
            <li> Really makes my hair pretty with body, but still very clean. Has a strong scent, which I could do with out ,but does make your hair look good.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for my chemically treated hair. Just a little bit and it makes a huge difference. Soft, manageable, shinny strong hair.</li>
            <li> I am soooo picky about finding a great shampoo...i constantly buy new kinds in search of something I love.  This stuff is GREAT!!  Smells super good!!!!  and really leaves my hair feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for my hair.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> My wife gets this and she loves it. She just had me get more at Safeway, but not as good a deal, so yeah for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been happy with all the John Frieda products I have tried. Not only do I think this is a good price, this product is my favorite at the moment within the brand. Gives full, clean hair and keeps it in good condition.</li>
