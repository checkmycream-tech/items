            <li>I love this stuff for my curly hair, I just wish it was organic and Non GMO</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>The product itself was okay, but I just can&#x27;t stand how it smells.</li>
            <li>This worked perfectly as a co-wash on mixed bi-racial (latino/black) curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>This product is great came with 2 didn&#x27;t even know shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I will purchase more of this.</li>
            <li>they are so watery that they kind of just slide out of your hand right after you squeeze it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li>It moisturized my hair without making it super frizzy and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>But this conditioner works so great to keep my hair soft and detangled!</li>
            <li>Great scent, works well on naturally curly or permed hair.</li>
            <li>This is an okay, cheap, conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is prone to static, so when I saw the claim of 20 frizz free hours, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>(it was easy to comb and detangle at this point).</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smelling great and silky smooth even after hair coming back curly after chemotherapy.</li>
            <li>She loves the light scent,</li>
            <li>Such a great product</li>
            <li>The conditioner didn&#x27;t provide as much slip as I would&#x27;ve liked</li>
            <li>The conditioner is a good condition that makes my hair feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, great price, it works well on my daughters extremely thick hair,</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this</li>
            <li>After I did that, my curls are full and bouncy, and my hair is so shiny.</li>
            <li>Why not change the name to Sweet Fruity Essences?</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad; just not for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this conditioner, it was fabulous for my curls and the only brand I would use -- I was very loyal --</li>
            <li>Bottle design is great because you can get all of it out since its.natural position is down, gravity isn&#x27;t working against you.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells and always make my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I like the smell - not too powerful.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth purchasing on amazon though,  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and was delivered right to my door!  </li>
            <li>I have been hooked on Herbal Essences since my first try years and years</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first sectioned the hair in six pieces.</li>
            <li>The hair was clean and the curls were defined and very soft.</li>
            <li>Super long, curly and thick, this conditioner worked great!</li>
            <li>While the other reviewers liked the smell of this, I did not.</li>
            <li>After only two uses my hair looks and feels amazing, soft and</li>
            <li>This type of conditioner is also best if you can leave it in your hair for at least three to five minutes (if possible).</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this particular product</li>
            <li>syrup)and actually adds a little kick start to my curls :) love it.</li>
            <li>my hair is straight, the rest is curly.</li>
            <li>It works really well though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truthfully, it is hard to find a nice conditioner with a good price that will work on my ridiculously thick hair.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair sooooo soft ;)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t make your&lt;br /&gt;hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida (humidity!)</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s used this for a couple of years now and when our local store stopped carrying it, I was glad to find it on Amazon at the same price.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes it enough that I can actually comb it, and then my hair has pretty smooth curls in the morning.</li>
            <li>The herbal essences line of totally twisted curl products is great for my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>At least once a week I am asked what kind of perfume I am wearing, it&#x27;s not perfume</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick product, so you know you aren&#x27;t getting a ton of water...</li>
            <li>Puts the spring back in my curls &amp; leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>and I do NOT like the new sticky-sweet-candy smell.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very long, very thick, very curly hair--it&#x27;s beautiful when it&#x27;s properly conditioned and a nightmare when it isn&#x27;t!  </li>
            <li>Totally Twisted curl conditioner does leave the hair feeling soft with a pleasant and fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and have already been using this product.</li>
            <li>It didnt leave my hair as soft as another product I use.  </li>
            <li>I guess this is only good on curly hair; I used it on straight hair, unfortunately the results were abysmal.</li>
            <li>Previously it had a true &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; lavender scent, now it is a sugary-sweet-candy odor --</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li>However, I was lucky that the scent faded once my hair dried.</li>
            <li>Especially thru subscribe and save got this.product for an amazing deal paid at least half the price of in-store deals with a coupon!</li>
            <li>but it really was a let down.</li>
            <li>I then applied this conditioner to dry, unwashed hair and saturated it completely</li>
            <li>Let me first explain very long:  mid thigh when dry, almost to my knees when wet.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This creates a whole frizzy mess!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of the few things that will tame my hair and keep it soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared this particular conditioner to other brands, and even other types of Herbal Essences conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair and have been trying to find a conditioner that actually works and this is it.  </li>
            <li> I would think someone that reaches for a product called &amp;#34;Herbal Essences&amp;#34; is looking for a natural herbal fragrance, not a sweet fruity scent.</li>
            <li> This conditioner didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry at all.</li>
            <li> It does not help with my friz once dry.</li>
            <li> It works as well if not better than more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> We have a well for water, and is very very hard water, which makes it very drying to our skin and hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my curly hair and it works well but is somewhat thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I also use this for my 4 year old girls they have long thin wavy curls</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is normal to oily</li>
            <li> I usually get it on Amazon for cheaper than a big box store.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick somewhat dry hair.  </li>
            <li> The only conditioner that works for my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Totally Twisted seems to help tame those frizzies and give me a normal looking head of hair!</li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned my hair once I received the product, because the curls were a little dull, and my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> It does control frizz for a little while, however I did still have flyaways.  </li>
            <li> But then a few years ago they changed the fragrance</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Herbal Essences totally screwed up Totally Twisted Curl Shampoo when they changed the fragrance.</li>
            <li> no more 25 minute brush out sessions after her shower!</li>
            <li> the font on this shampoo and conditioner is way too small, i can&#x27;t see when i&#x27;m in the shower which is what!</li>
            <li> I suppose it was designed for wavy thin hair.</li>
            <li> I got a purple bottle of Herbal Essences (23.7 ounces)  Totally Twisted curl conditioner (with avec Berry Essences) from my job.</li>
            <li> but I have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> Cheaper conditioners seem to be a very thin product...</li>
            <li> and it was horrible.</li>
            <li> One of the worst conditioners I have ever used!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great scent, works well on naturally curly or permed hair. We love HH products!</li>
            <li> This is an okay, cheap, conditioner.  I have thin hair that is normal to oily and I have lots of it.  My hair is prone to static, so when I saw the claim of 20 frizz free hours, I was hooked.  The conditioner is a good condition that makes my hair feel soft and smooth.  It does control frizz for a little while, however I did still have flyaways.  The problem with the conditioner, is the scent.  The package it came in, smelled of smoke like someone smoking scent.  Thinking it may have just been that factory I didnt worry about it.  But the actual conditioner smelled like someone smoking.  SO GROSS!!!!  However, I was lucky that the scent faded once my hair dried.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner for curly, fine hair - one of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and always make my hair so soft and manageable. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair and have been trying to find a conditioner that actually works and this is it.  Let me first explain very long:  mid thigh when dry, almost to my knees when wet.  This conditioner didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry at all. After only two uses my hair looks and feels amazing, soft and my curls are more defined.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long, very thick, very curly hair--it&#x27;s beautiful when it&#x27;s properly conditioned and a nightmare when it isn&#x27;t!  She uses this conditioner and just loves the results.  It&#x27;s the only one that seems to work for her on a continual basis.  We live in Florida (humidity!) and this tames the frizz, without losing the curls.  She loves the light scent, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s used this for a couple of years now and when our local store stopped carrying it, I was glad to find it on Amazon at the same price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t make your&lt;br /&gt;hair feel weighed down. Keeps the curls and waves in.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Pantene girl but this has changed me. It&#x27;s weightless, smells yummy(not like berry cough syrup)and actually adds a little kick start to my curls :) love it. Perfect product.</li>
            <li> I got a purple bottle of Herbal Essences (23.7 ounces)  Totally Twisted curl conditioner (with avec Berry Essences) from my job. The Herbal Essences Totally Twisted curl conditioner does leave the hair feeling soft with a pleasant and fruity scent. This type of conditioner is also best if you can leave it in your hair for at least three to five minutes (if possible).</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have already been using this product. The price was reasonable and was delivered right to my door!  What could be better?</li>
            <li> Love it.  I like the smell - not too powerful.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this but it really was a let down. The price was okay but found it at the dollar store after this purchase and it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I got these with a coupon, which made it a super great price!  It also makes my curls more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have been hooked on Herbal Essences since my first try years and years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully, it is hard to find a nice conditioner with a good price that will work on my ridiculously thick hair. Cheaper conditioners seem to be a very thin product...they are so watery that they kind of just slide out of your hand right after you squeeze it out of the bottle! But not Herbal Essences! It is nice and thick product, so you know you aren&#x27;t getting a ton of water...you are getting what you paid for! Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half my hair is straight, the rest is curly. This creates a whole frizzy mess! Totally Twisted seems to help tame those frizzies and give me a normal looking head of hair! And they smell is so fruity! Such a great product ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the best prices - it seems they are always offering a coupon or a great subscribe and save price. I usually get it on Amazon for cheaper than a big box store. SO happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this particular product and I was not disappointed at all. I really love Herbal Essences as a brand anyway but I have difficult hair. Super long, curly and thick, this conditioner worked great! It moisturized my hair without making it super frizzy and it smells amazing. I also use this for my 4 year old girls they have long thin wavy curls and it does a wonderful job in their hair as well. Bottle design is great because you can get all of it out since its.natural position is down, gravity isn&#x27;t working against you. Love this product and will be purchasing it again. Especially thru subscribe and save got this.product for an amazing deal paid at least half the price of in-store deals with a coupon!</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and the conditioners they make. And love the prize</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product that was at a great price. I purchased for my curly hair and it works well but is somewhat thinner than I expected. It works really well though. I recommend giving it a try as not all  curly hair is the same.</li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned my hair once I received the product, because the curls were a little dull, and my hair was dry. After I did that, my curls are full and bouncy, and my hair is so shiny. I love this, and would definately recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works for my curly hair</li>
            <li> i HAVE curls and this is not the shampoo for me .. it is longer&lt;br /&gt; and straighter than ever .not doing this again</li>
            <li> I co-wash my hair a lot I really love the smell of this , when I bought  this product I did not pay attention that you received two bottles so when I opened the package and received two bottles , I was so excited and considered my self lucky lol. Great amount for price.</li>
            <li> I used to love this conditioner, it was fabulous for my curls and the only brand I would use -- I was very loyal -- But then a few years ago they changed the fragrance and I do NOT like the new sticky-sweet-candy smell. Previously it had a true &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; lavender scent, now it is a sugary-sweet-candy odor -- Makes me feel like I need to wash my hair again to get out the sticky sugar. I would think someone that reaches for a product called &amp;#34;Herbal Essences&amp;#34; is looking for a natural herbal fragrance, not a sweet fruity scent. Why not change the name to Sweet Fruity Essences? In my opinion, Herbal Essences totally screwed up Totally Twisted Curl Shampoo when they changed the fragrance. Every time I go to the store, I check to see if maybe they switched it back. Nope. Until they do, I won&#x27;t be buying it, because the smell makes me gag.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my curly hair, I just wish it was organic and Non GMO</li>
            <li> This has been the best conditioner so far for my curly, frizzy hair! We have a well for water, and is very very hard water, which makes it very drying to our skin and hair. But this conditioner works so great to keep my hair soft and detangled!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared this particular conditioner to other brands, and even other types of Herbal Essences conditioner. It definitely does leave my hair noticeably curlier and lighter than others. The scent is great, too. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Smells good, great price, it works well on my daughters extremely thick hair, no more 25 minute brush out sessions after her shower!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner for my fine wavy hair. Cleansing without stripping; moisturizing without weight. Puts the spring back in my curls &amp; leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I love the way these Herbal Essence products smell and they work great on my hair.</li>
            <li> While the other reviewers liked the smell of this, I did not. The product itself was okay, but I just can&#x27;t stand how it smells. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Great deal and had a coupon.. ON AMAZON!!  Who would have thought!!  Will definitely buy again if they keep the coupon!</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair feel like straw. I have coarse 3C hair and it was horrible. I suppose it was designed for wavy thin hair. One of the worst conditioners I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly as a co-wash on mixed bi-racial (latino/black) curly hair. I first sectioned the hair in six pieces. I then applied this conditioner to dry, unwashed hair and saturated it completely (it was easy to comb and detangle at this point). I then rinsed out the conditioner with warm water. The hair was clean and the curls were defined and very soft. I guess this is only good on curly hair; I used it on straight hair, unfortunately the results were abysmal.</li>
            <li> The only conditioner that works for my thick, curly hair. Moisturizes it enough that I can actually comb it, and then my hair has pretty smooth curls in the morning. Thank goodness I found this stuff. It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  I have very long thick somewhat dry hair.  I like a conditioner that makes my hair feel like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; in my hands when I apply it to my hair.  This doesn&#x27;t quite do it but it&#x27;s not bad; just not for my hair type.  My wet hair is somewhat &amp;#34;easier&amp;#34; to comb through and my hair is soft.  It does not help with my friz once dry.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smelling great and silky smooth even after hair coming back curly after chemotherapy. Great price too !</li>
            <li> This product is great came with 2 didn&#x27;t even know shipping was fast and it smells great can&#x27;t wait to use it on my hair</li>
            <li> It smells great.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> I chose to give this product 4 stars because it smells really good.  I like products that once rinsed, you can still smell the product in your hair. It didnt leave my hair as soft as another product I use.  I will purchase more of this.</li>
            <li> The herbal essences line of totally twisted curl products is great for my curly hair.  It works as well if not better than more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The conditioner didn&#x27;t provide as much slip as I would&#x27;ve liked but it did leave my hair feeling soft copy and smelling great!  It isn&#x27;t worth purchasing on amazon though,  it&#x27;s actually $1.50 cheaper for the big size than the two smaller sized bottles offered on here.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of the few things that will tame my hair and keep it soft and pretty. At least once a week I am asked what kind of perfume I am wearing, it&#x27;s not perfume it&#x27;s this shampoo and conditioner. I have bought much more expensive brands that leave me with tangles and frizz. I highly recommend this for coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> the font on this shampoo and conditioner is way too small, i can&#x27;t see when i&#x27;m in the shower which is what!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair sooooo soft ;)</li>
