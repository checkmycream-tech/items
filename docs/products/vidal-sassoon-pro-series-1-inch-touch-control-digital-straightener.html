    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Considering I can be scatterbrained on occasion, a feature that is highly favored to me is  the auto off after use!</li>
            <li>There is however a 2 year warranty to be happy about!</li>
            <li>Is it perfect?</li>
            <li>(Infusium 23 Leave In and Tresemme Renewal Hair &amp; Scalp spray are both excellent).  </li>
            <li>The automatic shut off after an hour is a great idea, because my step daughter is notorious for forgetting to turn the flatiron off.  </li>
            <li>I also tried a curling style which worked great with the length of my hair (about 2-3 inches below my shoulders).  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice looking straightener.  </li>
            <li>There are a couple good features about this straightener</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Good temperature range</li>
            <li>The swivel chord is nice and works well.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll kind of need to figure out your preference on your own though do note that the highest temperature is 400 F.</li>
            <li>and it has a nice swivel for the power</li>
            <li>Nice swivel AC power cord connector</li>
            <li>hair is fine-med texture so it was very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>The features that are appealing are many!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s great - buy if the price is right.</li>
            <li>I do have very fine hair, so users with thicker hair may not experience this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I found what worked best for my hair, I used the the locking feature to keep my preferred preferences and it remembers them for later use too!</li>
            <li>Not GFCI protected, so be sure your plug is up to code</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to see some of the lower end salon appliances are now making that a standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the straightener is rounded on the sides, so it won&#x27;t sit on a counter top; it rolls&lt;br /&gt;over.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s not awful.....</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly, got nice and hot, and did a great job straightening her hair.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with how quickly this flat iron heated up</li>
            <li>All the switches and temp adjusters are easy to use and don&#x27;t get in the way when you use the iron.</li>
            <li>Unit heats up very quickly, maximum temp is 400 degrees.  </li>
            <li>unlock easily when needed, and then is too easy to unlock in use.</li>
            <li>It feels well made and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The user can easily unlock and inadvertently change temperature of the device while in use.  </li>
            <li>I found this straightener lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and has a modern (touch-based) control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did a nice job of giving me smooth, straight hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re all about your hair, this isn&#x27;t the best choice, but for occasional use or for a cheaper flatiron for your travel-kit, this one is decent.</li>
            <li>This item would be passable at a very, very bargain price but there are better units available for the money.</li>
            <li>that said, a basic straightener at a good price.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it was too cool and didn&#x27;t straighten good enough.  </li>
            <li>This straightener does what it should - heats quickly &amp; straightens well.</li>
            <li>I like the swiveling cord, and it heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Offsetting those two minor good points, here&#x27;s the bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>section my hair off first, then straighten smaller sections in order to get good results.</li>
            <li>my hair is fairly gray/bleached, so it&#x27;s very dry and resistant to coloring/straightening.  </li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t do a very good job of straitening.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if accompanying literature was specific about heat</li>
            <li>Better designed irons have completely smoothed edges, so the plates glide through your hair without any resistance or breakage.  </li>
            <li>All in all, this is a nice quality straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t have the added features to replace my current favorites.</li>
            <li>And even then, the results were not as good as I&#x27;ve had using other straighteners.  </li>
            <li>The controls sit right under my thumb when holding the straightener.</li>
            <li>The looks are very professional and it’s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly and does a reasonable job of straightening.</li>
            <li>It has an auto&lt;br /&gt;shut-off which I like very much.</li>
            <li>Actually, that&#x27;s not true, it does a good job of straightening my hair, but it does a better job of pulling hair out of my head.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure to mention this comes in one of those pain to open plastic packages and there&#x27;s no storage pouch to put the straightner in when not in use.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, and remembers your desired temperature so you don&#x27;t end up frying your ends by overheating the iron!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it was too hot.  </li>
            <li>Packaging insert recommends first using on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it - this iron doesn&#x27;t get all that hot.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using it daily for over a month now, has dropped it off the bathroom counter many times, and it is still working just like it did the first day.  </li>
            <li>] if you&#x27;re interested in checking it</li>
            <li>The straightener works well at straightening without getting so hot that it burns hair.</li>
            <li>Better products are available for less money, keep looking</li>
            <li>I have another straightener that gets my hair perfectly straight right away (and it was cheaper than this one).</li>
            <li>This product does do the job it is intended for, but overall has many shortcomings that any reasonable user focus group would have found in ~15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain this particular feature will ease the minds of many wondering if they&#x27;ve left their straighter plugged in.</li>
            <li>One that I certainly appreciate is that the cord swivels preventing all those unwanted kinks of a cord wrapping up on itself when you are trying to style your hair.</li>
            <li>This is a decent hair straightener at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I always try to find some good to go with the bad when I&#x27;m reviewing a new product, but I honestly can&#x27;t find a single nice thing to say about this straightener.</li>
            <li>The swivel cord prevents those snarly messes that straighteners seem to create over time, and the grip is comfortable even with reaching the back sections of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I really felt like this straightener didn&#x27;t maintain an even temperature.  </li>
            <li>Note: the more damaged your hair is, the harder it is to style.  </li>
            <li>Hesitated to use the hottest setting because not looking for pin straight hair, and don&#x27;t want additional damage, frankly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really doesn’t show when it’s up to temperature</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats very quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t straighten very hot/fast, and comes packaged in one of those hateful plastic clamshells that takes a lot of effort to cut open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The digital slide controls are meant to be innovative, but frankly I&#x27;d rather know the actual heat setting more than seeing a sliding digital bar.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly so it is ready when you need it and will get the hair portion of your preparation for work or social event managed quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly so I am able to style and be on my way in a matter of a few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally use a product that does a much better job, and on sale it was the same price as the retail price of this one.</li>
            <li>I have a more expensive straightener that is my go-to item, but (having learned from past experience) it&#x27;s always good to have some kind of back up if need be.  </li>
            <li>To change the setting or to turn it off, you have to hold the lock/unlock button for 3 seconds and then it’s ready for a new setting and be locked in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it gets to 400 degrees in less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Clever swivel for the power cord keeps it from twisting around itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s high tech</li>
            <li>([[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE GLOVE + POUCH AND travel size Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment.</li>
            <li>A good, but not great, product.</li>
            <li>unnecessarily fussy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would put up with crummy controls if the straightener did a good job, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is because the controls sit just under your thumb when holding the straightener (both left or right handed).</li>
            <li>It won’t get hot enough and it won’t slide down so easily.  </li>
            <li>digital aspect is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>There are a few design features that make this straightener a good choice - long cord, swivel base, slightly unique interface to control temperature settings, stylish looks, quick heating, auto-shutoff.  </li>
            <li>Hair gets easily caught between the wand and the heated blades, and then is trapped.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super curly, just a little wavy, so it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>These sprays make you hair much more manageable, and cut down on styling time and protect from further damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also keeps its heat really well, so I can move on to the next section of hair without waiting for iron to heat up.</li>
            <li>It straightened my hair well, and I do have naturally curly hair, so it passed the test.</li>
            <li>but I could tell that it only took a couple of minutes to get ready.  </li>
            <li>but these are far out weighed by the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;a)</li>
            <li>If they fixed the hair snagging problem it would probably be a serviceable straightener.</li>
            <li>She is 14 and found the settings confusing at first, but quickly adjusted.  </li>
            <li>didnt experience the issues with snags or tangles that others did but will be going back to using an older straightener.</li>
            <li>For optimal results, highly recommend using a styling spray prior to ironing</li>
            <li>Overall, an OK choice, but hard to definitively assess/predict its long-term performance.  </li>
            <li>I really like this iron, and it is sturdy enough that I know it will last for years!</li>
            <li>cannot really recommend this product for all users, but I know that for some it will work and can be used in multiple countries as it has a built-in automatic adjustment for different voltages.  </li>
            <li>The lowest setting worked fine on my bangs, which are the least damaged portion of your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair&lt;br /&gt;is slightly thick and fine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as high quality as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series 1 Inch Touch Control Digital Straightener works considerably well considering the price range.</li>
            <li>Probably only those who have thin, relatively straight hair, who want to smooth out the frizzies.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t get as hot as what I&#x27;m used to, and it takes me a few tries to actually get my hair straight, but if you have thin to normal hair, it will probably work better for you.  </li>
            <li>I have very course hair and often go to 425F or even 450F on my other straighteners.  </li>
            <li>It definitely heats up quickly and I appreciate the auto shut-off feature, as I am usually in a hurry in the morning.</li>
            <li>The heating plates are too small only about 4-5 inches long and 1&amp;#34; wide and using only the top 1/2 of the straightener</li>
            <li>Mainly I was holding the straighter a bit low and pinched my hand on the lower area where you would squeeze the straightener to glide down the hair to flatten.</li>

            <li> To change the setting or to turn it off, you have to hold the lock/unlock button for 3 seconds and then it’s ready for a new setting and be locked in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The straightening is about equal to other straighteners in the same price range.  It&#x27;s not &#x27;amazing&#x27; but it&#x27;s alright.  The touch screen heat control......pain in the keester.  You can&#x27;t tell the temp.  It seems like it&#x27;s high tech......but it&#x27;s not....it&#x27;s frustrating to control the heat setting.  The swivel chord is nice and works well.  The automatic shut off after an hour is a great idea, because my step daughter is notorious for forgetting to turn the flatiron off.  Overall, it&#x27;s average, but the control slider just annoyed me tremendously.</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series 1 Inch Touch Control Digital Straightener works considerably well considering the price range. The features that are appealing are many! One that I certainly appreciate is that the cord swivels preventing all those unwanted kinks of a cord wrapping up on itself when you are trying to style your hair. There&#x27;s almost nothing more annoying than that, let me tell you! There is no off and on switch, the straightener is on as soon as you plug it in. Considering I can be scatterbrained on occasion, a feature that is highly favored to me is  the auto off after use! I&#x27;m certain this particular feature will ease the minds of many wondering if they&#x27;ve left their straighter plugged in. You &amp; I can worry no more with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The digital aspect is pretty neat. You simply slide your finger up and down a scale to set the the heat temperature that you desire. There&#x27;s no numbers so you&#x27;ll kind of need to figure out your preference on your own though do note that the highest temperature is 400 F. After I found what worked best for my hair, I used the the locking feature to keep my preferred preferences and it remembers them for later use too! My hair is long, thick, and wavy and I found this straighter to work well on my hair. It gets hot quickly so I am able to style and be on my way in a matter of a few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that I did pinch myself a couple of time while using it. Mainly I was holding the straighter a bit low and pinched my hand on the lower area where you would squeeze the straightener to glide down the hair to flatten. I haven&#x27;t bumped or unlocked the digital heating settings that I put in at all when using. I wanted to make sure to mention this comes in one of those pain to open plastic packages and there&#x27;s no storage pouch to put the straightner in when not in use. There is however a 2 year warranty to be happy about!</li>
            <li> This straightener does what it should - heats quickly &amp; straightens well. The only thing to note, and I would give it 4.5 stars, is that you must remember to set the lock on the controls (and not touch it) while using the straightener. This is because the controls sit just under your thumb when holding the straightener (both left or right handed). Otherwise, it&#x27;s great - buy if the price is right.</li>
            <li> For the girl on the go, this 1&amp;#34; straightener by Vidal Sassoon is just the thing for getting the sleeping kinks out of a sleek hairdo before heading off to work. It heats up fast, and remembers your desired temperature so you don&#x27;t end up frying your ends by overheating the iron! The swivel cord prevents those snarly messes that straighteners seem to create over time, and the grip is comfortable even with reaching the back sections of the hair.  It heats up quickly so it is ready when you need it and will get the hair portion of your preparation for work or social event managed quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> The Pro Series straightener works really well with my thick, coarse hair. I love that it gets to 400 degrees in less than 30 seconds. It also keeps its heat really well, so I can move on to the next section of hair without waiting for iron to heat up. All the switches and temp adjusters are easy to use and don&#x27;t get in the way when you use the iron. I really like this iron, and it is sturdy enough that I know it will last for years!</li>
            <li> I really felt like this straightener didn&#x27;t maintain an even temperature.  Sometimes it was too hot.  Sometimes it was too cool and didn&#x27;t straighten good enough.  It&#x27;s not my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> This is a decent hair straightener at a very reasonable price. Is it perfect? No. I think the controls are more complicated than they need to be, and, my preference is for a 1.5 inch straightener. However, it did hold the heat well and my unit had even heat. It definitely heats up quickly and I appreciate the auto shut-off feature, as I am usually in a hurry in the morning. It straightened my hair well, and I do have naturally curly hair, so it passed the test. It is lightweight so it does not get my arm tired, either. A good, but not great, product.</li>
            <li> This just might be my fifth hair iron, and initially, found the controls a bit confusing.  They only seem to work immediately after you plug the unit in your wall socket, and then the setting locks in.  While display is blinking, choose setting by sliding your finger along the temperature bar.  Tap the lock symbol to set.  Unit heats up very quickly, maximum temp is 400 degrees.  So having three settings, assume they would be 200, 300 and 400.  Would have been nice if accompanying literature was specific about heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceramic plates are rough around the edges so they sometimes slightly snag at your hair.  Ouch.  Better designed irons have completely smoothed edges, so the plates glide through your hair without any resistance or breakage.  Packaging insert recommends first using on the lowest setting.  The lowest setting worked fine on my bangs, which are the least damaged portion of your hair.  Note: the more damaged your hair is, the harder it is to style.  For optimal results, highly recommend using a styling spray prior to ironing (Infusium 23 Leave In and Tresemme Renewal Hair &amp; Scalp spray are both excellent).  These sprays make you hair much more manageable, and cut down on styling time and protect from further damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference my hair is fairly gray/bleached, so it&#x27;s very dry and resistant to coloring/straightening.  The low setting hardly worked at all for the rest of my hair which has minimal damage.  To do the bulk of my mop, had to punch it up to medium.  And even then, the results were not as good as I&#x27;ve had using other straighteners.  Let&#x27;s face it - this iron doesn&#x27;t get all that hot.  Hesitated to use the hottest setting because not looking for pin straight hair, and don&#x27;t want additional damage, frankly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict:  NOT recommended for hair that&#x27;s medium or coarsely textured/damaged and/or hard to manage because the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Digital Straightener just WON&#x27;T cut it.  Pro?  Not really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three and a half stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Tresemme-Renewal-Scalp-Leave-In-Conditioning/dp/B00GYB1AUI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1400799425&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;tresemme+hair+and+scalp+renewal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Infusium-23-Repair-Renew-Treatment/dp/B003VUAOOI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1400799510&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;infusium+23&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three and a half stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Tresemme-Renewal-Scalp-Leave-In-Conditioning/dp/B00GYB1AUI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1400799425&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;tresemme+hair+and+scalp+renewal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Infusium-23-Repair-Renew-Treatment/dp/B003VUAOOI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1400799510&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;infusium+23</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking straightener.  The looks are very professional and it’s easy to use.  The straightener has a long cord (six feet) and it swivels at the base.  It really doesn’t show when it’s up to temperature but I could tell that it only took a couple of minutes to get ready.  The temperature is shown in bars but the description paper describes the range of degrees.  Once you lock in the desired temperature, you can go ahead and use the straightener without having to worry about turning it off or changing a setting.  To change the setting or to turn it off, you have to hold the lock/unlock button for 3 seconds and then it’s ready for a new setting and be locked in again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine-med texture so it was very easy to work with.  The iron glided down without a problem.  This straightener is not suitable for very coarse or rebellious hair.  It won’t get hot enough and it won’t slide down so easily.  I also tried a curling style which worked great with the length of my hair (about 2-3 inches below my shoulders).  It cools off in about 10 minutes once it’s turned off.  Recommended for fine-med hair (texture) and shoulder length + or - a couple of inches.</li>
            <li> There are a few design features that make this straightener a good choice - long cord, swivel base, slightly unique interface to control temperature settings, stylish looks, quick heating, auto-shutoff.  However, the results were not consistent for the two experimenters in the house... Overall, an OK choice, but hard to definitively assess/predict its long-term performance.  (will update after 6-12 months)</li>
            <li> There are a couple good features about this straightener but these are far out weighed by the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;a) Clever swivel for the power cord keeps it from twisting around itself.&lt;br /&gt;b) Has automatic shutoff after 1hr of non use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;a) When closing and sliding through hair, it caught in the lower half (below the heating plates)  where there is a bump and a corresponding depression to house the electronics.  So fundamentally it doesn&#x27;t work as a hair straightener.&lt;br /&gt;b)  The heating plates are too small only about 4-5 inches long and 1&amp;#34; wide and using only the top 1/2 of the straightener blade.&lt;br /&gt;c)  No lock to keep the plates closed for packing in a suitcase for example.&lt;br /&gt;d)  The heat control is in an awkward location and since it uses a touch sensitive electronic screen, I found myself inadvertently changing the heat settings during use.&lt;br /&gt;e)  Its delivered sealed in heavy hard plastic requiring a knife or heavy scissors to extract it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only took me one or two tries to to realize this unit wont work.  I have shoulder length hair.  If they fixed the hair snagging problem it would probably be a serviceable straightener.</li>
            <li> I always try to find some good to go with the bad when I&#x27;m reviewing a new product, but I honestly can&#x27;t find a single nice thing to say about this straightener. Well, I take that back, I like the color and it has a nice swivel for the power cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offsetting those two minor good points, here&#x27;s the bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls suck. The lock feature is impossible to lock/unlock easily when needed, and then is too easy to unlock in use. The stupid slider heat control is difficult to work and unnecessarily fussy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would put up with crummy controls if the straightener did a good job, but it doesn&#x27;t. Actually, that&#x27;s not true, it does a good job of straightening my hair, but it does a better job of pulling hair out of my head. Hair gets easily caught between the wand and the heated blades, and then is trapped. Removing trapped hair is difficult to near impossible, especially if you&#x27;re working at the back of your head. I do have very fine hair, so users with thicker hair may not experience this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to all this a bulky foot-long design and tiny heating plates that are only 3.5&amp;#34; long. I have a travel straightener that&#x27;s a diminutive 6&amp;#34; long with generous 3&amp;#34; plates, why would I want all this bulk for only an extra 1/2&amp;#34; of heating surface? No thanks.</li>
            <li> I love the way I can control the heat settings on this hair straightener, since I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;m going to burn myself on these things. I like the auto shut-off, too. My hair isn&#x27;t super curly, just a little wavy, so it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how quickly this flat iron heated up but that&#x27;s about it. I have thick wavy hair and it didn&#x27;t do a very good job of straitening. I have another straightener that gets my hair perfectly straight right away (and it was cheaper than this one).</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who is forever wanting to straighten her hair.  She is 14 and found the settings confusing at first, but quickly adjusted.  It heated up quickly, got nice and hot, and did a great job straightening her hair.  She&#x27;s been using it daily for over a month now, has dropped it off the bathroom counter many times, and it is still working just like it did the first day.  No real complaints from us!</li>
            <li> The cons outweigh the pros on this one.  I like the swiveling cord, and it heats quickly.  However, it snagged my hair, and seemed to heat unevenly sometimes.  The heat switch is hard to handle, it moves up and down on it&#x27;s on, and is just not reliable.  Better products are available for less money, keep looking</li>
            <li> This Vidal Sassoon Pro Series 1 Inch Touch Control Digital Straightener is a quality product.  It feels well made and is easy to use.  I like the design.  But there are a few features that could be improved upon.  I wish there was a temperature option above 400F.  I have very course hair and often go to 425F or even 450F on my other straighteners.  A wet to dry feature would also be welcomed.  All in all, this is a nice quality straightener, but it doesn&#x27;t have the added features to replace my current favorites.</li>
            <li> This product does do the job it is intended for, but overall has many shortcomings that any reasonable user focus group would have found in ~15 minutes.  The largest problem is the touch screen, which is a fine idea, but very poorly executed.  The user can easily unlock and inadvertently change temperature of the device while in use.  A design failure, but acceptable construction quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats very quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Good temperature range&lt;br /&gt;- Nice swivel AC power cord connector&lt;br /&gt;- Aesthetically appealing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Touch screen inadvertently changes settings during use.  Does have a lock that accidentally unlocks as well.&lt;br /&gt;- Construction feels slightly flimsy, leaving durability a question&lt;br /&gt;- Not GFCI protected, so be sure your plug is up to code</li>
            <li> This item would be passable at a very, very bargain price but there are better units available for the money. The most annoying part is the &amp;#34;Touch slider control.&amp;#34; Where some simple buttons would do, the makers chose instead to use a finicky touch system that doesn&#x27;t register input half the time, this was enough to knock it down to three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didnt experience the issues with snags or tangles that others did but will be going back to using an older straightener.</li>
            <li> A lightweight basic straightener. It heats quickly and does a reasonable job of straightening. It looks nice and has a modern (touch-based) control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative, the controls are awkwardly placed where the user&#x27;s hands go (and easy to reset). As others have noted, hair can get caught where the bump housing the electronics sits. It doesn&#x27;t straighten very hot/fast, and comes packaged in one of those hateful plastic clamshells that takes a lot of effort to cut open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, a basic straightener at a good price. If you&#x27;re all about your hair, this isn&#x27;t the best choice, but for occasional use or for a cheaper flatiron for your travel-kit, this one is decent.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2N7W5FCA07UWM]]Not &#x27;Pro&#x27; quality, but on par with the price point, the Vidal Sasson Pro Series 1 Inch Touch Control Digital Straightener isn&#x27;t a hair styling appliance I&#x27;d recommend for those with coarse, thick, wavy or curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So who is it for? Probably only those who have thin, relatively straight hair, who want to smooth out the frizzies. Maybe for little girls with &#x27;virgin&#x27; hair that&#x27;s not color treated or processed in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the iron&#x27;s design, it&#x27;s not one I like. The digital slide controls are meant to be innovative, but frankly I&#x27;d rather know the actual heat setting more than seeing a sliding digital bar. I also inadvertently unlocked the setting I&#x27;d used initially and had to re-lock the straightener at one point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up in 30 seconds and has 1\\&quot; thick plates. The swivel cord is a design I prefer and I&#x27;m glad to see some of the lower end salon appliances are now making that a standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my test with this iron I followed the directions and my results (as shown in the video) were poor on my hair. I generally use a product that does a much better job, and on sale it was the same price as the retail price of this one. ([[ASIN:B001MA0QY2 HSI PROFESSIONAL 1 CERAMIC TOURMALINE IONIC FLAT IRON HAIR STRAIGHTENER FREE GLOVE + POUCH AND travel size Argan Oil Leave In Hair Treatment. WORLDWIDE DUAL VOLTAGE 110v-220v]] if you&#x27;re interested in checking it out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot really recommend this product for all users, but I know that for some it will work and can be used in multiple countries as it has a built-in automatic adjustment for different voltages.  Thus I give this product a 3 star review, but in all honesty it was tough to decide whether to stay with the 3 star or go lower based upon the performance on my hair.</li>
            <li> I found this straightener lightweight and easy to use. It heats up sufficiently. It has an auto&lt;br /&gt;shut-off which I like very much. It did a nice job of giving me smooth, straight hair. I did  ve&lt;br /&gt;to section my hair off first, then straighten smaller sections in order to get good results. If you&lt;br /&gt;have very heavy or corse hair, this may not work for you or it will just take too long. My hair&lt;br /&gt;is slightly thick and fine. Also, I had to remember to set the lock on the controls while using&lt;br /&gt;the straightener. The controls sit right under my thumb when holding the straightener. One&lt;br /&gt;other point - the straightener is rounded on the sides, so it won&#x27;t sit on a counter top; it rolls&lt;br /&gt;over.</li>
            <li> The straightener works well at straightening without getting so hot that it burns hair. The only negative is that it squeaks when you press the two arms together.</li>
            <li> I have this as my back-up straightener.  I have a more expensive straightener that is my go-to item, but (having learned from past experience) it&#x27;s always good to have some kind of back up if need be.  Straighteners seem to always want to die half way through doing your hair.  This one doesn&#x27;t get as hot as what I&#x27;m used to, and it takes me a few tries to actually get my hair straight, but if you have thin to normal hair, it will probably work better for you.  Occasionally it will snag my hair, but it is what it is.  For the price, it&#x27;s not awful..... but it&#x27;s not as high quality as the more expensive brands.</li>
