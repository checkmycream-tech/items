            <li>After mining the interwebs for information on what a good brush should feel like, I came across the forums describing the varying types of badger hair and how wonderful they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It has great water retention and is a good entry badger brush.</li>
            <li>&amp; it still feels nice on my cheeks!  </li>
            <li>I had forgotten what a good shaving brush can do.</li>
            <li>find a good inexpensive one.  </li>
            <li>This brush is good.  </li>
            <li>so I know a good one.  </li>
            <li>I used to use this lots when I could find a good shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It takes time to use and I loved it, but times and soaps change,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The quality is good.</li>
            <li>Good quality badger hair brush.</li>
            <li>it was a good step up.</li>
            <li>It helps create a good lather</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Good price and good quality, what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>This was perfect for what I wanted, has lasted with a novice for over a year and still looks as good as new.  </li>
            <li>the smell goes away and it works amazing.  </li>
            <li>No smell, no loss of hairs, it&#x27;s been amazing.</li>
            <li>- it works, it will create a good lather with a good soap, but for a Col. Conk branded brush that is not any better in fit and finish and the badger bristle quality used than the $12 Escali</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaving brush that will help any guy get a good shave, especially with shaving gels and creams.</li>
            <li>The badger hairs are soft and workable and give an excellent lather.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!!  </li>
            <li>It works up a great lather, and it is the right balance of softness and firmness for me.</li>
            <li>Although it worked great for the first five weeks, I&#x27;d say I now find about seven hairs per use</li>
            <li>in all this is not a bad product, its just not as good as the one that it replaces.</li>
            <li>It is a very light plastic maybe injection molded.</li>
            <li>Very light weight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a good stiffness and softness combination and quickly makes a lather.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and the tips are soft and durable.  </li>
            <li>The water retention is alright for what it is, but no comparison to a better grade brush.</li>
            <li>This brush feels great on your skin and really holds onto water and soap.</li>
            <li>It works for me and will use it for awhile until I decide to spend a bit more for one of those lathe turned handles with a bit more bulk/weight to them.</li>
            <li>i dont know how this could be much better    </li>
            <li>: shaving is nothing more than a way to remove unwanted hair.    </li>
            <li>I would not subtract stars for items of this nature, I am using the brush on my face, not the handle, but it just looks cheap in my nice chromed stand along side by Edwin Jagger and Merkur DE razors.  </li>
            <li>It is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>great brush  really holds up well after over a year and a hallf.  </li>
            <li>I am , however, not the most aggressive at brushing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using mine for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving up on it and moving to something better, perhaps the edwin jagger</li>
            <li>If you buy this thing, make sure you comb out any tangles after you&#x27;re through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The badger bristles are preferred for a softer shave, boar for more rugged.  </li>
            <li>On higher-grade badgers - finest, best, super, silvertip - the bristles are set to length so the tips are soft.</li>
            <li>The brush is obviously of very high quality, and feels good on my face.</li>
            <li>the price point on this brush is just too high.oap, but for a Col. Conk branded brush that is not any better in fit and finish and the badger bristle quality used than the $12 Escali</li>
            <li>I am happy with purchase so far.</li>
            <li>This is a good reasonable priced brush.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t want to spend as much as i did on mine, but he loved the look of this one.</li>
            <li>Way better than my original $15 dollar brush.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to wash.</li>
            <li>It picks up lather really easily and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>The bristles will eventually break and fall out of the brush so be easy on it.  </li>
            <li>It came in very quickly.</li>
            <li>This brush is pretty amazing when you take the price and grade of badger hair into account.</li>
            <li>I have read about some brushes that have a smell to them, this one is fine, no offending smells here.</li>
            <li>working end of the brush is fine, the badger hairs are cut to fit</li>
            <li>He really loved that old shaving brush..  </li>
            <li>He loved how soft the Badger hair was and wanted one also.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Does a much better job at creating lather than my first, cheap brush.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping for higher standards to be able to use their name or endorsement,</li>
            <li>the original brush had.</li>
            <li>Though this is a decent first brush, I can&#x27;t justify the price compared to value when looking at either a finest or $15 boar from a good</li>
            <li>They are far better than the Conk brush, and more forgiving to boot.</li>
            <li>That way the brush doesn&#x27;t sink to the bottom of my sink when it&#x27;s full of water and touch the \\&quot;clean</li>
            <li>This is a great brush and produces good amount of foam specially when used with a high quality soap, such as Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap.</li>
            <li>On top of the inability to bloom beyond the width of the handle, (I was hoping for a full fan-shape), it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the soap very well.</li>
            <li>Good solid brush.  </li>
            <li>; it is much softer than the Tweezerman, and it fits better in the Colonel Conk stand.  </li>
            <li>This was a good solid purchase.  </li>
            <li>Great brush for beginners or even people who have been wet shaving for a while!</li>
            <li>and it has performed exceptionally the entire time.</li>
            <li>This is a decent starter brush, but when one gets the knack of brush lathering, whether that is bowl, hand, or face, they should move on to a better brush.</li>
            <li>Having used the brush several times now, I can say that it creates a good rich lather and holds water very well.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very well, and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>I use this when I shave and it gives a nice lather of cream, essential for getting those hairs to stand up</li>
            <li>Using this brush allows one to massage the shaving soap into a nice lather that gets deep into my pores lifting my beard for easier shaving.  </li>
            <li>Trying to froth up a proper lather with this wimpy brush proved to be the making of its own doom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a few days and refining my technique with the help of Badger &amp; Blade forums tutorials this brush whips up a nice lather easily on these soaps.     </li>
            <li>This is my first badger brush and for the money it was well worth it to me.  </li>
            <li>though this brush is capable and adequate for its original intention, I suggest one spends a few extra dollars ($30-$35) on a Parker Pure Badger or Best Badger.</li>
            <li>The weight is where the change is extremely apparent as the original Vulfix version had a nice and heavy handle, this one is very light.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this brush is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>rubber handle perhaps doesn&#x27;t look as nice as some other materials, but has always been comfortable and doesn&#x27;t get particularly slippery,</li>
            <li>the price, I&#x27;d highly recommend spending a few more dollars for a finest or best grade brush or spending less for something like an Omega or Semogue boar brush.</li>
            <li>So far the hairs have not bloomed out, and I have noticed any of the bristles falling out in great quantity other than what I would</li>
            <li>I had better hope for this brush, even with the mixed reviews - it is a Col. Conk branded brush</li>
            <li>What a difference real badger hair makes over synthetic hair!  </li>
            <li>This is the first badger hair brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>After having this product for 4 months I can report that within the past two months after every shave I find more and more brush hairs falling out of the&lt;br /&gt;brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>a pretty fancy hand turned brush with Badger hair.</li>
            <li>I actually consider it more of a travel brush.</li>
            <li>My husband had one of these when we married 32 years ago.  </li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it is meant to do.  </li>
            <li>Plenty of good backbone, but it&#x27;s pretty scratchy as pure badger usually is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first brush, so I can&#x27;t say too much aside from that it works for me</li>
            <li>Pure brushes are set and the tips are trimmed to shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The bristles are pure badger through and through, with the defining scratchy, cut tips.</li>
            <li>This was my first high quality brush purchase, after shaving with run of the mill brushes for a couple of years</li>
            <li>many people are very pretentious about shaving and love to waste money and argue that there is some kind of Zen and art to shaving.</li>
            <li>I ordered this same brush a few years ago and it was great.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really hold or apply lather as well as others either.</li>
            <li>Rating changed to 2 stars as it is of alright build quality and doesn&#x27;t shed much at all.</li>
            <li>The handle has buoyancy so when I soak it in my mug it wants to float the brush horizontally which exposes some bristles out of the water.</li>
            <li>Much of that is just from being in the learning phase.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be very well made</li>
            <li>In talking with vendor they were very gracious and helpful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody who wants the benefits of a badger brush but doesn&#x27;t want to shell out a lot of money on something fancy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been straight razor shaving for about 4 months now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handle is mediocre at best - molded plastic complete with seems and</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it since it&#x27;s made in England, had mostly positive reviews, and carries the Colonel Conk brand name on it.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to shaving with safety razor and this is my first brush.</li>
            <li>It is way better than those other $10-$20 budget brushes you see on here.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m ready to throw the darn thing out and will be buying a new brush very soon.</li>
            <li>For the money, this is a really nice brush and should last a very long time if one follows the tips on brush care.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great brush if you are starting out with wet shaving or just not wanting to spend big money on a silvertip brush.  </li>
            <li>All natural brushes will smell at first until the soap washes it away.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to make them smooth, but then you end of scratching the finish on the handle if you are not very careful - use an old razor blade or Xacto knife to carefully cut the mold marks away.  </li>
            <li>When this new one appeared on his bathroom vanity, vavoom!  </li>
            <li>My biggest issue with this particular brush is the handle weight.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product for the money that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>the price point on this brush is just too high.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found it to be comfortable, and it gets a nice lather with the shaving soap I use because I&#x27;ve never been afraid to really stir it around because of the quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush itself is fairly small, which is why I suggest moving on to another, more capable brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close to normal.</li>
            <li>As long as you are good about cleaning it after every use, it&#x27;ll last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I guess this is probably normal for a new brush at this price point.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement brush for his &#x27;old one&#x27; that finally got too bald to be useful.  </li>
            <li>This replaced a very old brush I had been using.</li>
            <li>The year-old one I got to use was very soft.</li>
            <li>It retains water decently for being pure badger and it creates later well if you work it correctly.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty solid brush.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the shape and weight of the handle is different.  </li>
            <li>guy.this is my 2nd brush.comparing it to my first one...</li>
            <li>It is badger hair, so the quality of the actual bristles are there, but I wish the density of them was higher.  </li>
            <li>I still have an old boar brush but have used this new one off and on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic little brush for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>this one has lasted me about a year so far.</li>
            <li>Old brush was history!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used soap, but now I use shaving cream from Lush Cosmetics &amp; this brush handles/cleans well.</li>
            <li>I like this one so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this information, I decided that this brush seemed to fit in the narrow area where my budget and my tastes in shaving products intersect.</li>
            <li>They were certainly soft (as I&#x27;d hoped), but they didn&#x27;t have any backbone.</li>
            <li>I do make sure I hang it upside down to dry.  </li>
            <li>Brush works fine as far as I can tell, has lost some hairs, but not many.</li>
            <li>I expected big things from this brush; my first brush was the VDH brush set from Wal-Mart with the texture of a grill-cleaner and just about as much girth to the bristles (when they could stay attached).</li>
            <li>Yes, a small part of the bristles are exposed out of the water but they will all get soaked just fine.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this brush for my first foray into using traditional soaps and a DE razor.</li>
            <li>In my limited experience, I would have to say that you&#x27;d need to spend at least twice as much to get a better brush.  </li>
            <li>I find the bristles to be somewhat stiff, but that may be normal (remember it&#x27;s my first badger brush).  </li>
            <li>You need a brush stand to air dry with bristles facing down after every use and light pressure when applying lather.  </li>
            <li>So soft that I initially mistook it for a Silvertip, which it is not.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, I was surprised by how short the bristles were.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has continually lost hairs throughout and has developed matting deep inside the knot.</li>
            <li>will tell how much it will soften and bloom, currently I use the dry brush technique (pre-soak brush, shake or squeeze excess water out, and apply to the soap to make lather -</li>
            <li>The hairs are a bit prickly at first but soften up after a month and a half or so but all brushes have a break-in period.</li>
            <li>My recommendation from earlier stands: find a boar for the same or less money or go for a finest/best badger for a little more.</li>
            <li>Anyone who starts with this brush may have trouble at first getting the hang of lathering.</li>
            <li>but it does not have much of a &amp;#34;spine&amp;#34; and it is a little floppy.</li>

            <li> It works up a great lather, and it is the right balance of softness and firmness for me.</li>
            <li> Although it worked great for the first five weeks, I&#x27;d say I now find about seven hairs per use</li>
            <li> in all this is not a bad product, its just not as good as the one that it replaces.</li>
            <li> It is a very light plastic maybe injection molded.</li>
            <li> Very light weight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a good stiffness and softness combination and quickly makes a lather.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and the tips are soft and durable.  </li>
            <li> The water retention is alright for what it is, but no comparison to a better grade brush.</li>
            <li> This brush feels great on your skin and really holds onto water and soap.</li>
            <li> It works for me and will use it for awhile until I decide to spend a bit more for one of those lathe turned handles with a bit more bulk/weight to them.</li>
            <li> i dont know how this could be much better    </li>
            <li> : shaving is nothing more than a way to remove unwanted hair.    </li>
            <li> I would not subtract stars for items of this nature, I am using the brush on my face, not the handle, but it just looks cheap in my nice chromed stand along side by Edwin Jagger and Merkur DE razors.  </li>
            <li> It is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> great brush  really holds up well after over a year and a hallf.  </li>
            <li> I am , however, not the most aggressive at brushing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using mine for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving up on it and moving to something better, perhaps the edwin jagger</li>
            <li> If you buy this thing, make sure you comb out any tangles after you&#x27;re through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The badger bristles are preferred for a softer shave, boar for more rugged.  </li>
            <li> On higher-grade badgers - finest, best, super, silvertip - the bristles are set to length so the tips are soft.</li>
            <li> The brush is obviously of very high quality, and feels good on my face.</li>
            <li> the price point on this brush is just too high.oap, but for a Col. Conk branded brush that is not any better in fit and finish and the badger bristle quality used than the $12 Escali</li>
            <li> I am happy with purchase so far.</li>
            <li> This is a good reasonable priced brush.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t want to spend as much as i did on mine, but he loved the look of this one.</li>
            <li> Way better than my original $15 dollar brush.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to wash.</li>
            <li> It picks up lather really easily and is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The bristles will eventually break and fall out of the brush so be easy on it.  </li>
            <li> It came in very quickly.</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty amazing when you take the price and grade of badger hair into account.</li>
            <li> I have read about some brushes that have a smell to them, this one is fine, no offending smells here.</li>
            <li> working end of the brush is fine, the badger hairs are cut to fit</li>
            <li> He really loved that old shaving brush..  </li>
            <li> He loved how soft the Badger hair was and wanted one also.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Does a much better job at creating lather than my first, cheap brush.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping for higher standards to be able to use their name or endorsement,</li>
            <li> the original brush had.</li>
            <li> Though this is a decent first brush, I can&#x27;t justify the price compared to value when looking at either a finest or $15 boar from a good</li>
            <li> They are far better than the Conk brush, and more forgiving to boot.</li>
            <li> That way the brush doesn&#x27;t sink to the bottom of my sink when it&#x27;s full of water and touch the \\&quot;clean</li>
            <li> This is a great brush and produces good amount of foam specially when used with a high quality soap, such as Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap.</li>
            <li> On top of the inability to bloom beyond the width of the handle, (I was hoping for a full fan-shape), it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the soap very well.</li>
            <li> Good solid brush.  </li>
            <li> ; it is much softer than the Tweezerman, and it fits better in the Colonel Conk stand.  </li>
            <li> This was a good solid purchase.  </li>
            <li> Great brush for beginners or even people who have been wet shaving for a while!</li>
            <li> and it has performed exceptionally the entire time.</li>
            <li> This is a decent starter brush, but when one gets the knack of brush lathering, whether that is bowl, hand, or face, they should move on to a better brush.</li>
            <li> Having used the brush several times now, I can say that it creates a good rich lather and holds water very well.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very well, and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I use this when I shave and it gives a nice lather of cream, essential for getting those hairs to stand up</li>
            <li> Using this brush allows one to massage the shaving soap into a nice lather that gets deep into my pores lifting my beard for easier shaving.  </li>
            <li> Trying to froth up a proper lather with this wimpy brush proved to be the making of its own doom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days and refining my technique with the help of Badger &amp; Blade forums tutorials this brush whips up a nice lather easily on these soaps.     </li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush and for the money it was well worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> though this brush is capable and adequate for its original intention, I suggest one spends a few extra dollars ($30-$35) on a Parker Pure Badger or Best Badger.</li>
            <li> The weight is where the change is extremely apparent as the original Vulfix version had a nice and heavy handle, this one is very light.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this brush is nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> rubber handle perhaps doesn&#x27;t look as nice as some other materials, but has always been comfortable and doesn&#x27;t get particularly slippery,</li>
            <li> the price, I&#x27;d highly recommend spending a few more dollars for a finest or best grade brush or spending less for something like an Omega or Semogue boar brush.</li>
            <li> So far the hairs have not bloomed out, and I have noticed any of the bristles falling out in great quantity other than what I would</li>
            <li> I had better hope for this brush, even with the mixed reviews - it is a Col. Conk branded brush</li>
            <li> What a difference real badger hair makes over synthetic hair!  </li>
            <li> This is the first badger hair brush I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> After having this product for 4 months I can report that within the past two months after every shave I find more and more brush hairs falling out of the&lt;br /&gt;brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> a pretty fancy hand turned brush with Badger hair.</li>
            <li> I actually consider it more of a travel brush.</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these when we married 32 years ago.  </li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it is meant to do.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of good backbone, but it&#x27;s pretty scratchy as pure badger usually is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first brush, so I can&#x27;t say too much aside from that it works for me</li>
            <li> Pure brushes are set and the tips are trimmed to shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The bristles are pure badger through and through, with the defining scratchy, cut tips.</li>
            <li> This was my first high quality brush purchase, after shaving with run of the mill brushes for a couple of years</li>
            <li> many people are very pretentious about shaving and love to waste money and argue that there is some kind of Zen and art to shaving.</li>
            <li> I ordered this same brush a few years ago and it was great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hold or apply lather as well as others either.</li>
            <li> Rating changed to 2 stars as it is of alright build quality and doesn&#x27;t shed much at all.</li>
            <li> The handle has buoyancy so when I soak it in my mug it wants to float the brush horizontally which exposes some bristles out of the water.</li>
            <li> Much of that is just from being in the learning phase.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be very well made</li>
            <li> In talking with vendor they were very gracious and helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody who wants the benefits of a badger brush but doesn&#x27;t want to shell out a lot of money on something fancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straight razor shaving for about 4 months now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handle is mediocre at best - molded plastic complete with seems and</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it since it&#x27;s made in England, had mostly positive reviews, and carries the Colonel Conk brand name on it.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to shaving with safety razor and this is my first brush.</li>
            <li> It is way better than those other $10-$20 budget brushes you see on here.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m ready to throw the darn thing out and will be buying a new brush very soon.</li>
            <li> For the money, this is a really nice brush and should last a very long time if one follows the tips on brush care.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great brush if you are starting out with wet shaving or just not wanting to spend big money on a silvertip brush.  </li>
            <li> All natural brushes will smell at first until the soap washes it away.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to make them smooth, but then you end of scratching the finish on the handle if you are not very careful - use an old razor blade or Xacto knife to carefully cut the mold marks away.  </li>
            <li> When this new one appeared on his bathroom vanity, vavoom!  </li>
            <li> My biggest issue with this particular brush is the handle weight.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product for the money that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> the price point on this brush is just too high.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found it to be comfortable, and it gets a nice lather with the shaving soap I use because I&#x27;ve never been afraid to really stir it around because of the quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush itself is fairly small, which is why I suggest moving on to another, more capable brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close to normal.</li>
            <li> As long as you are good about cleaning it after every use, it&#x27;ll last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I guess this is probably normal for a new brush at this price point.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement brush for his &#x27;old one&#x27; that finally got too bald to be useful.  </li>
            <li> This replaced a very old brush I had been using.</li>
            <li> The year-old one I got to use was very soft.</li>
            <li> It retains water decently for being pure badger and it creates later well if you work it correctly.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty solid brush.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the shape and weight of the handle is different.  </li>
            <li> guy.this is my 2nd brush.comparing it to my first one...</li>
            <li> It is badger hair, so the quality of the actual bristles are there, but I wish the density of them was higher.  </li>
            <li> I still have an old boar brush but have used this new one off and on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic little brush for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> this one has lasted me about a year so far.</li>
            <li> Old brush was history!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used soap, but now I use shaving cream from Lush Cosmetics &amp; this brush handles/cleans well.</li>
            <li> I like this one so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this information, I decided that this brush seemed to fit in the narrow area where my budget and my tastes in shaving products intersect.</li>
            <li> They were certainly soft (as I&#x27;d hoped), but they didn&#x27;t have any backbone.</li>
            <li> I do make sure I hang it upside down to dry.  </li>
            <li> Brush works fine as far as I can tell, has lost some hairs, but not many.</li>
            <li> I expected big things from this brush; my first brush was the VDH brush set from Wal-Mart with the texture of a grill-cleaner and just about as much girth to the bristles (when they could stay attached).</li>
            <li> Yes, a small part of the bristles are exposed out of the water but they will all get soaked just fine.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this brush for my first foray into using traditional soaps and a DE razor.</li>
            <li> In my limited experience, I would have to say that you&#x27;d need to spend at least twice as much to get a better brush.  </li>
            <li> I find the bristles to be somewhat stiff, but that may be normal (remember it&#x27;s my first badger brush).  </li>
            <li> You need a brush stand to air dry with bristles facing down after every use and light pressure when applying lather.  </li>
            <li> So soft that I initially mistook it for a Silvertip, which it is not.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I was surprised by how short the bristles were.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has continually lost hairs throughout and has developed matting deep inside the knot.</li>
            <li> will tell how much it will soften and bloom, currently I use the dry brush technique (pre-soak brush, shake or squeeze excess water out, and apply to the soap to make lather -</li>
            <li> The hairs are a bit prickly at first but soften up after a month and a half or so but all brushes have a break-in period.</li>
            <li> My recommendation from earlier stands: find a boar for the same or less money or go for a finest/best badger for a little more.</li>
            <li> Anyone who starts with this brush may have trouble at first getting the hang of lathering.</li>
            <li> but it does not have much of a &amp;#34;spine&amp;#34; and it is a little floppy.</li>
            <li> (Merkur Double Edge Razor with Extra Long Handle, Black).&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li> Looks like it will last a long time if taken care of.</li>
            <li> Some tips since they can be expensive be sure to treat it carefully.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve lost minimal hairs, fewer than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Other than that for this price it gets the job done for me and only time will tell on break in and longevity of the product.    </li>
            <li> I bought this for my son along with all the other accouterments that go with luxury shaving and it was a big hit.  </li>
            <li> This brush seems to be pretty well-made, but it does take some time to get used to and to get it broken in.</li>
            <li> then drip water onto the brush with the lather on it to create the additional moisture necessary to make the lather slick on the surface of your face), and this brush works well for that method - the ONLY reason it gets 3 stars vs 2 star</li>
            <li> The black handle is understated with the somewhat fancy logo to add a bit of English flair.   </li>
            <li> Only shed a few hairs.</li>
            <li> It lost bristles at an alarming rate.  </li>
            <li> It does smell once it gets wet but</li>
            <li> so he could get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The brush felt a little stiff and slightly irritated my skin the first few times that I used it.</li>
            <li> Two other positives to mention</li>
            <li> Other issues still stand.</li>
            <li> Other than the bristle density</li>
            <li> I first purchased the less expensive Tweezerman</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> The handle shows the mold marks, and not all of those lines were buffed or polished down</li>
            <li> Other reviewers might think it is because of how I stored it, but I assure you it was always dried in a stand facing downward.  </li>
            <li> Its great but too bad its made in England by the dirty red-coats.</li>
            <li> The badger bristles do hold the lather firmer with less drippies off the face.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t Buy, not worth the money!</li>
            <li> i like this little brush.sure beats spending $100.i am a beginer safety razor</li>
            <li> It begins to feel noticeably softer with a few uses and the irritation goes away.</li>
            <li> Used this with Proraso green tub soap and two of Mama Bears soaps.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> One note - a little late in the delivery, but I don&#x27;t count that against the vendor as they didn&#x27;t set delivery time; Amazon did and it was during the holidays.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this off my wish list for me this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> Very few hairs lost.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s become quite frustrating to use due to the amount of badger hair it sheds.</li>
            <li> The bristles seem to get stale after a long period of use.</li>
            <li> it appears that they have made a few changes that are for the worse (IMHO).  </li>
            <li> This thing STINKS bad at first... just soak it and use it a handful of times...</li>
            <li> Just revisited this brush and was shocked at how bad it really is.</li>
            <li> the ink on it is poor.</li>
            <li> The cut tips are terrible unless you&#x27;re looking for a VERY scratch brush.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give him something nostalgic for Christmas</li>
            <li> The change in the shape is not too bad, but they seem to have changed the grade of the badger hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s horrible to find it on my face or on the razor.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this when I shave and it gives a nice lather of cream, essential for getting those hairs to stand up so when they&#x27;re cut, they don&#x27;t grow back into the skin (which causes bumps). Easy to use, easy to wash.</li>
            <li> This shaving brush was recommended to me by a friend and I am very satisfied with it.  Good price and good quality, what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> This brush seems to be pretty well-made, but it does take some time to get used to and to get it broken in. The brush felt a little stiff and slightly irritated my skin the first few times that I used it. I&#x27;ve heard that this may be caused by some residual oils on the brush. It begins to feel noticeably softer with a few uses and the irritation goes away.</li>
            <li> Used this brush for over a month now. It has great water retention and is a good entry badger brush. Only shed a few hairs. It&#x27;s handle is mediocre at best - molded plastic complete with seems and the ink on it is poor. Thought the ink doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off, it wasn&#x27;t well-applied and is blurry on the brand side. From what I&#x27;ve read, this is a Vulfix brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great brush for bowl lathering soaps or creams, but too scratchy for face lathering. Plenty of good backbone, but it&#x27;s pretty scratchy as pure badger usually is. On higher-grade badgers - finest, best, super, silvertip - the bristles are set to length so the tips are soft. Pure brushes are set and the tips are trimmed to shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I&#x27;d highly recommend spending a few more dollars for a finest or best grade brush or spending less for something like an Omega or Semogue boar brush. Though this is a decent first brush, I can&#x27;t justify the price compared to value when looking at either a finest or $15 boar from a good company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE April 3, 2012. Just revisited this brush and was shocked at how bad it really is. The cut tips are terrible unless you&#x27;re looking for a VERY scratch brush. The water retention is alright for what it is, but no comparison to a better grade brush. It doesn&#x27;t really hold or apply lather as well as others either. My recommendation from earlier stands: find a boar for the same or less money or go for a finest/best badger for a little more. Rating changed to 2 stars as it is of alright build quality and doesn&#x27;t shed much at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this off my wish list for me this past Christmas. I&#x27;ve been a lather and brush man for 50 years. This replaced a very old brush I had been using. I had forgotten what a good shaving brush can do. Great brush. I like the glycerin soap that came with it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for about three months and it&#x27;s become quite frustrating to use due to the amount of badger hair it sheds. Although it worked great for the first five weeks, I&#x27;d say I now find about seven hairs per use and it&#x27;s horrible to find it on my face or on the razor. I&#x27;ve handled the brush properly by rinsing it before and after use and hanging it on a combo razor/brush holder. I had high hopes for it since it&#x27;s made in England, had mostly positive reviews, and carries the Colonel Conk brand name on it. Now, I&#x27;m ready to throw the darn thing out and will be buying a new brush very soon.</li>
            <li> This is my first badger brush and for the money it was well worth it to me.  The handle is plastic and it does float if you try to soak it in your mug, but it is still doable.  I think this is a great brush if you are starting out with wet shaving or just not wanting to spend big money on a silvertip brush.  It retains water decently for being pure badger and it creates later well if you work it correctly.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now. This brush feels great on your skin and really holds onto water and soap. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this brush for my first foray into using traditional soaps and a DE razor. Used this with Proraso green tub soap and two of Mama Bears soaps. After a few days and refining my technique with the help of Badger &amp; Blade forums tutorials this brush whips up a nice lather easily on these soaps.     When applying lather in circular motions on my face it is a tad prickly on my face which I hope will lessen over time as the brush breaks in and the tips soften up a bit. It lost about 3-4 hairs during my initial uses. I guess this is probably normal for a new brush at this price point. My biggest issue with this particular brush is the handle weight. It is a very light plastic maybe injection molded. The handle has buoyancy so when I soak it in my mug it wants to float the brush horizontally which exposes some bristles out of the water. I wish they could have used a heavier plastic or inserted some sort of weight into the plastic mold to counter this issue. Other than that for this price it gets the job done for me and only time will tell on break in and longevity of the product.    It works for me and will use it for awhile until I decide to spend a bit more for one of those lathe turned handles with a bit more bulk/weight to them.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty solid brush. It&#x27;s my first brush, so I can&#x27;t say too much aside from that it works for me and I like it!</li>
            <li> This was my first high quality brush purchase, after shaving with run of the mill brushes for a couple of years and I can&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. This is a great brush and produces good amount of foam specially when used with a high quality soap, such as Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap. I recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> i dont know how this could be much better    many people are very pretentious about shaving and love to waste money and argue that there is some kind of Zen and art to shaving. the truth is; there isnt    dont believe the hype: shaving is nothing more than a way to remove unwanted hair.    this brush does everything i need it to.    dont bother buying a 1000$ brush. find a good inexpensive one.  this one has lasted me about a year so far. no complaints</li>
            <li> This is a replacement brush for his &#x27;old one&#x27; that finally got too bald to be useful.  He really loved that old shaving brush..  BUT!  When this new one appeared on his bathroom vanity, vavoom!  Old brush was history!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price for a Badger Brush.</li>
            <li> I had better hope for this brush, even with the mixed reviews - it is a Col. Conk branded brush and I was hoping for higher standards to be able to use their name or endorsement, but it just misses on several features and just seems to be massed produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a shave bowl, so the length of the brush (4 inches from tip of brush to end of handle) is not a problem, if you use a mug or a deep bowl you definitely  will have problems trying to use a brush of this length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit and finish - horrid.  Generaly I would not subtract stars for items of this nature, I am using the brush on my face, not the handle, but it just looks cheap in my nice chromed stand along side by Edwin Jagger and Merkur DE razors.  The handle shows the mold marks, and not all of those lines were buffed or polished down so there is a bit of an edge to them.  It is easy to make them smooth, but then you end of scratching the finish on the handle if you are not very careful - use an old razor blade or Xacto knife to carefully cut the mold marks away.  Something you should not have to do but with this one you must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The working end of the brush is fine, the badger hairs are cut to fit so you will have a bit of a scratchy texture to deal with for awhile, they will soften.  So far the hairs have not bloomed out, and I have noticed any of the bristles falling out in great quantity other than what I would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how much it will soften and bloom, currently I use the dry brush technique (pre-soak brush, shake or squeeze excess water out, and apply to the soap to make lather - then drip water onto the brush with the lather on it to create the additional moisture necessary to make the lather slick on the surface of your face), and this brush works well for that method - the ONLY reason it gets 3 stars vs 2 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures show reference to size and mold marks.  I would not purchase this again, do not recommend it for others either - it works, it will create a good lather with a good soap, but for a Col. Conk branded brush that is not any better in fit and finish and the badger bristle quality used than the $12 Escali the price point on this brush is just too high.oap, but for a Col. Conk branded brush that is not any better in fit and finish and the badger bristle quality used than the $12 Escali the price point on this brush is just too high.</li>
            <li> This was one of the lower priced badger shaving brushes that were out there. I have zero complaints about it. I have been using it for almost a year now and it has performed exceptionally the entire time. As long as you are good about cleaning it after every use, it&#x27;ll last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I still have an old boar brush but have used this new one off and on.  It pays to read, and even download, the advice on brush care from the various vendors.  The badger bristles do hold the lather firmer with less drippies off the face.  Much of that is just from being in the learning phase.  For the money, this is a really nice brush and should last a very long time if one follows the tips on brush care.</li>
            <li> What a difference real badger hair makes over synthetic hair!  Using this brush allows one to massage the shaving soap into a nice lather that gets deep into my pores lifting my beard for easier shaving.  It appears to be very well made and I like that it&#x27;s made in England too.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaving brush that will help any guy get a good shave, especially with shaving gels and creams. The brush is obviously of very high quality, and feels good on my face. It lathers very well, and washes out easily. I would recommend to any guy who is looking into getting a shaving brush. Don&#x27;t buy the cheapo ones, this brush is your best bet.</li>
            <li> This is the first badger hair brush I have ever used.  Before this I always used boar hair brushes.  Having used the brush several times now, I can say that it creates a good rich lather and holds water very well.  I find the bristles to be somewhat stiff, but that may be normal (remember it&#x27;s my first badger brush).  Haven&#x27;t had any problems with losing hair from the brush, which was always a problem with the boar hair brushes I used.      Good solid brush.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this brush is nice and soft.  Its great but too bad its made in England by the dirty red-coats.</li>
            <li> This brush is good.  In my limited experience, I would have to say that you&#x27;d need to spend at least twice as much to get a better brush.  I don&#x27;t think it can be beat, at its price point.  It is way better than those other $10-$20 budget brushes you see on here.</li>
            <li> I have a Vulfix 1000 brush which I bought in England in 2007.  It has worked out great and I wanted to ensure that I had a replacement so I got this after reading that this was essentially the same thing.  But by upgrading to \\&quot;1\\&quot; level it appears that they have made a few changes that are for the worse (IMHO).  Firstly, the shape and weight of the handle is different.  The weight is where the change is extremely apparent as the original Vulfix version had a nice and heavy handle, this one is very light.  The change in the shape is not too bad, but they seem to have changed the grade of the badger hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is not a bad product, its just not as good as the one that it replaces.</li>
            <li> This is my second badger brush purchased.  I first purchased the less expensive Tweezerman brush.[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the tweezerman.  It lost bristles at an alarming rate.  Other reviewers might think it is because of how I stored it, but I assure you it was always dried in a stand facing downward.  Pay the additional $10 and get this brush.  It is outstanding.  It has not lost a bristle yet that I have noticed.  Two other positives to mention; it is much softer than the Tweezerman, and it fits better in the Colonel Conk stand.  [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]]</li>
            <li> For the price you are paying for it, I thought the product was Very good.  Very good quality and the tips are soft and durable.  It picks up lather really easily and is easy to hold.  Very light weight as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, if you are on a budget but still want to have a badger brush.</li>
            <li> After having this product for 4 months I can report that within the past two months after every shave I find more and more brush hairs falling out of the&lt;br /&gt;brush. Don&#x27;t Buy, not worth the money!</li>
            <li> great brush  really holds up well after over a year and a hallf.  Colonel Conk is the bomb</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving brushes for over twenty years so I know a good one.  This is a good reasonable priced brush.  The badger hairs are soft and workable and give an excellent lather.  I&#x27;ve had larger brushes and smaller ones and this is about in the middle or smaller.  Some tips since they can be expensive be sure to treat it carefully.  You need a brush stand to air dry with bristles facing down after every use and light pressure when applying lather.  The bristles will eventually break and fall out of the brush so be easy on it.  My old ones have lasted for years and if you treat this one carefully should last the same.  I should add the Kingsly on this site for about the same price is of equal quality.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his shaving brush!</li>
            <li> This thing STINKS bad at first... just soak it and use it a handful of times... the smell goes away and it works amazing.  It&#x27;s a fantastic little brush for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I use this brush just about every day.  It has not lost many bristles and the smell that some people complained about faded after a few shaves.  All natural brushes will smell at first until the soap washes it away.  I do make sure I hang it upside down to dry.  It has a good stiffness and softness combination and quickly makes a lather. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to shaving with safety razor and this is my first brush. Brush works fine as far as I can tell, has lost some hairs, but not many. I am happy with purchase so far. I have read about some brushes that have a smell to them, this one is fine, no offending smells here.</li>
            <li> I got a chance to use this model brush after a year of use so I know where the experience with it is heading. This brush is pretty amazing when you take the price and grade of badger hair into account. The hairs are a bit prickly at first but soften up after a month and a half or so but all brushes have a break-in period. It does smell once it gets wet but a diluted vinegar or borax solution clears that up after a couple soaks.   Personally, I&#x27;ve lost minimal hairs, fewer than I was expecting. I am , however, not the most aggressive at brushing so this might contribute to the fact but still. Very few hairs lost.  Someone made a comment about how it floats and I kinda like that. That way the brush doesn&#x27;t sink to the bottom of my sink when it&#x27;s full of water and touch the \\&quot;clean but you never know\\&quot; surface of the sink. Yes, a small part of the bristles are exposed out of the water but they will all get soaked just fine. The black handle is understated with the somewhat fancy logo to add a bit of English flair.   The year-old one I got to use was very soft. So soft that I initially mistook it for a Silvertip, which it is not. This displays the quality of the bristles.  Overall, a good product for the money that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I used to use this lots when I could find a good shaving soap. It takes time to use and I loved it, but times and soaps change,&lt;br /&gt;I used my to death, and considered getting another, but didn&#x27;t I changed and so did the soaps. Maybe again when I have a place to put it, recommend a stand for it, so it keeps it&#x27;s shape,</li>
            <li> I do feel like i need to replace this product towards the end of the year though. The bristles seem to get stale after a long period of use.</li>
            <li> Does a much better job at creating lather than my first, cheap brush. The bristles are soft and comfortable. No issues with hairs falling out.</li>
            <li> I bought my father a brush so he could get into wet shaving. I have a pretty fancy hand turned brush with Badger hair. I let my father try my brush and my synthetic brush i had lying around. He loved how soft the Badger hair was and wanted one also. He didn&#x27;t want to spend as much as i did on mine, but he loved the look of this one. It came in very quickly. The size was perfect, he thinks it&#x27;s just as fancy as my brush. It lathered great. The quality is good. It&#x27;s lasted a while now too. Great brush for beginners or even people who have been wet shaving for a while!</li>
            <li> This has been holding up well for me and I haven&#x27;t had any noticeable loss of hairs yet. It works up a great lather, and it is the right balance of softness and firmness for me.</li>
            <li> This is a decent starter brush, but when one gets the knack of brush lathering, whether that is bowl, hand, or face, they should move on to a better brush. The brush itself is fairly small, which is why I suggest moving on to another, more capable brush. I actually consider it more of a travel brush. The bristles are pure badger through and through, with the defining scratchy, cut tips. Anyone who starts with this brush may have trouble at first getting the hang of lathering. Partly because of its size and partly because of what one uses: soap or creams. I suggest creams because the brush simply didn&#x27;t lather soaps as I&#x27;ve come to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is this: though this brush is capable and adequate for its original intention, I suggest one spends a few extra dollars ($30-$35) on a Parker Pure Badger or Best Badger. They are far better than the Conk brush, and more forgiving to boot. I&#x27;ll use the Conk here and there, but I doubt it&#x27;ll ever make the rotation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and have only lost one hair from this brush during its initial use. Since then it&#x27;s been great shaving. Looks like it will last a long time if taken care of. One note - a little late in the delivery, but I don&#x27;t count that against the vendor as they didn&#x27;t set delivery time; Amazon did and it was during the holidays. In talking with vendor they were very gracious and helpful. I would deal with then again and I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a shave brush that was 100% badger hair but many of them are just too expensive. This brush is an excellent value in regards to quality and price. I&#x27;ve been using mine daily for several weeks now and haven&#x27;t had any problems and the brush is a pleasure to use. I&#x27;d recommend this to anybody who wants the benefits of a badger brush but doesn&#x27;t want to shell out a lot of money on something fancy. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using mine for years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in March of 2011 &amp; it still feels nice on my cheeks!  I shave 3-4 times/wk.  I have used soap, but now I use shaving cream from Lush Cosmetics &amp; this brush handles/cleans well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straight razor shaving for about 4 months now so I&#x27;ve been using this about twice a week. No smell, no loss of hairs, it&#x27;s been amazing. I would buy another one of these if I needed one, without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this same brush a few years ago and it was great. Re-ordered and it came with flimsy hair, and probably 1/10th the amount of badger hair the original brush had. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So far so good. This is my second shave brush. My last one fell apart. I like this one so far. Lathers up well. Looks like it might hold up for awhile. I&#x27;m satisfied with this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush for about two years (though I don&#x27;t shave every day), and I&#x27;ve had no problems. It does lose bristles into my shaving cream, but not enough to make it look or work any differently. I&#x27;ve always found it to be comfortable, and it gets a nice lather with the shaving soap I use because I&#x27;ve never been afraid to really stir it around because of the quality.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber handle perhaps doesn&#x27;t look as nice as some other materials, but has always been comfortable and doesn&#x27;t get particularly slippery, even when wet.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> owned for almost 2 years and still works great</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these when we married 32 years ago.  I wanted to give him something nostalgic for Christmas and this was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I expected big things from this brush; my first brush was the VDH brush set from Wal-Mart with the texture of a grill-cleaner and just about as much girth to the bristles (when they could stay attached). After mining the interwebs for information on what a good brush should feel like, I came across the forums describing the varying types of badger hair and how wonderful they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this information, I decided that this brush seemed to fit in the narrow area where my budget and my tastes in shaving products intersect. When I opened it, I was surprised by how short the bristles were. They were certainly soft (as I&#x27;d hoped), but they didn&#x27;t have any backbone. Trying to froth up a proper lather with this wimpy brush proved to be the making of its own doom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has continually lost hairs throughout and has developed matting deep inside the knot. On top of the inability to bloom beyond the width of the handle, (I was hoping for a full fan-shape), it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;grab\\&quot; the soap very well. I&#x27;m giving up on it and moving to something better, perhaps the edwin jagger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;It fits inside my shave stand beside my razor&lt;br /&gt;  (Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand)&lt;br /&gt;  (Merkur Double Edge Razor with Extra Long Handle, Black).&lt;br /&gt;Cost-acceptable&lt;br /&gt;Soft&lt;br /&gt;Decent entry-level badger brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;No backbone&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t grab soap&lt;br /&gt;Too short&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t bloom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Save another 20-30 bucks and get something nicer. You won&#x27;t regret that decision. If you buy this thing, make sure you comb out any tangles after you&#x27;re through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** EDIT ** After spending some time combing the brush I got about 90% of the matting out. It&#x27;s close to normal. Other issues still stand. Changing stars from 1 to 2.</li>
            <li> Good quality badger hair brush. Wish the handle were a tad longer for easier use in a mug.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but it does not have much of a &amp;#34;spine&amp;#34; and it is a little floppy.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!  After doing some research on brushes I came across this one.  Way better than my original $15 dollar brush.  This brush is great to work with, creates a great lather, and is fairly priced.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son along with all the other accouterments that go with luxury shaving and it was a big hit.  The badger bristles are preferred for a softer shave, boar for more rugged.  This was perfect for what I wanted, has lasted with a novice for over a year and still looks as good as new.  Excellent product</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it is meant to do.  It makes a great lather with every type of soap I like to use.  I have been using this brush for over a year.</li>
            <li> i like this little brush.sure beats spending $100.i am a beginer safety razor guy.this is my 2nd brush.comparing it to my first one...it was a good step up.</li>
            <li> 4 years and this has not lost its hairs</li>
            <li> This was a good solid purchase.  It is badger hair, so the quality of the actual bristles are there, but I wish the density of them was higher.  That is my only complaint.  Other than the bristle density, this works great.  It helps create a good lather and I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out, so I am working under the assumption that it&#x27;s well-made.</li>
