            <li>Great for travel and keeping in my purse for kids.</li>
            <li>My dentist had some disposable toothbrushes which had toothpaste and were great.  </li>
            <li>These are great for one-the-go mornings or travel.</li>
            <li>They are a great product for someone like her</li>
            <li>The idea of  a portable disposable toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li>These are a great idea</li>
            <li>Very handy to use and toss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so impressed by this innovative idea that I went home and searched for them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>50 PIECES IN BOX, GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to take when traveling or if  you need to have a toothbrush handy where you are.</li>
            <li>When conditions are more ideal, I have used the brush twice.</li>
            <li>But, they do taste good, and its a help to me.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>These are a perfect solution for camping or any time you want a quick disposable toothbrush without having to deal with a funky brush stored in a septic plastic tube.</li>
            <li>Effective paste with a good taste.</li>
            <li>just good to know that i have them handy</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Nicely wrapped and I would buy again.  </li>
            <li>These were so nice to just grab and toss.</li>
            <li>The concept is nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are super handy and very effective disposable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I have been able to use a singular one for about 5 days before I need another (just use your own toothpaste).</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is mild flavored, but when water is added it bubbles up when brushing and has a pleasant flavor.  </li>
            <li>It works though, and seems like the best solution as the Zylitol is the most natural type of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to the Happy Morning Toothbrush with Xylitol while at my dentist.</li>
            <li>The paste is very light</li>
            <li>Brushes are great, though and loved that they are individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>Was expecting a better quality product.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Wish there was more of a mint toothpaste flavor.</li>
            <li>Bristles should be more &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Really pleased.</li>
            <li>There are better one out there.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Sometimes traveling doesn&#x27;t allow for the most sanitary conditions.</li>
            <li>I love that these are wrapped so I can carry them without concern.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Better there than in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>and I love that they&#x27;re using Xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging could be better.</li>
            <li>and I love to have the brushes around.  </li>
            <li>needed something to easily get fresh breath at work and these seem perfect, not messy and very effective at giving me a clean mouth after coffee</li>
            <li>The Xylitol coated bristles quickly foam up like toothpaste, and allows you to effectively brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is perfect for our toy hauler as water is limited.  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no taste to the built in toothpaste, perfect for those with a dislike of mint.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution without having a wet brush and paste to carry around</li>
            <li>It is fine.</li>
            <li>These are great guest tooth brushes, especially since they are infused with toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>so need to keep my teeth tartar/plaque free.  </li>
            <li>They are about a medium bristle (and importantly, the bristles do not fall out.  </li>
            <li>They would be perfect for travel or just carry a few around in purse.  </li>
            <li>Very handy to stick a couple of these brushes in your purse as they are individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>A box full of cheap toothbrushes</li>
            <li>I would purchase these again because they do what I need them to do, clean my teeth and freshen my breath while being inexpensive and disposible.</li>
            <li>but my teeth feel incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to carry in handbag, but wish the toothbrush had more paste solution.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes are actually pretty strong for a disposable product</li>
            <li>My teeth are fresh and clean without over of suds and paste.</li>
            <li>My dentist hands these toothbrushes out to each patient, to quickly brush their teeth before sitting in the dental chair.</li>
            <li>This is perfect, if I can&#x27;t make it to the bathroom (I live in a cube farm), I can swish it in a cup of water and lean down over the trash can and do a quick brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought these over others because there were individually wrapped for easy on-the-go use, but love the benefits of xylitol as well.</li>
            <li>Its fresh tasting and</li>
            <li>So overall I think the idea was nice, but reality is it does not work well.  </li>
            <li>but when you are on the go or traveling, it is useful</li>
            <li>you feel this review was useful, please click the &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; button below.</li>
            <li>So many felt they did not properly brush and ended up having to put tooth paste on the brush to get the clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, too.</li>
            <li>A prepasted disposable toothbrush is ideal at work, as the single use reduces the likelihood of the toothbrush carrying germs when used in a public bathroom.  </li>
            <li>These are good, my mouth feels fresh after brushing but the brushes themselves are a little cheaper made than ones</li>
            <li>With two teens in braces, I feel a little more confident that they brush their teeth at school.</li>
            <li>I would prefer these were packaged smaller, like half the size, and able to fit nicely in a jean pocket.</li>
            <li>I received my order super fast.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they are individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps and make it more convenient to brush in restaurants.</li>
            <li>When I first used these, I did not know that you have to squeeze the bristles in order to release the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>&amp; she really liked them also, just wet brush &amp; throw away, she has even shared them with her friends who are also going to buy these package of 50 Pre-Pasted toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I am glad to no longer carry my regular toothbrush and paste around in a soggy ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd box of these, I love them.</li>
            <li>There is enough paste on these dudes to get my teeth clean and clean the trays without over-foaming.  </li>
            <li>They are all sturdy, strong bristles, regular handles, and easy to open.</li>
            <li>Individually packaged so they are easy to carry out to dinner and freshen up.</li>
            <li>Very hard brushes, but they are useful to have handy when you need a quick brush.</li>
            <li>It is like a real toothbrush and very durable.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing so much easier.</li>
            <li>Bought them for granddaughters who just had braces removed and they don&#x27;t work very well for them.</li>
            <li>These work very well for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had to use them yet, so can&#x27;t really comment on them.  </li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much &#x27;paste&#x27; included.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very abrasive.</li>
            <li>So much better than pulling out the toothbrush that you packed wet the morning before.</li>
            <li>It does not give the cool minty feeling you get with a regular tooth brush and paste.  </li>
            <li>I love these little guys so much that I use them myself from time to time.</li>
            <li>I am mainly writing this because some reviewers made me hesitant about the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Still, they are individually packaged which makes them super convenient to go anywhere and use anytime.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is quickly run these toothbrushes under the faucet for a second and start brushing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>dentist says these are high quality, like that they don&#x27;t foam when using them</li>
            <li>Could use a little more paste</li>
            <li>I keep a few more in my purse.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s aesthetically better looking than conventional braces, it is a major inconvenience.</li>
            <li>I was very happy when I found that Cutting Edge International, LLC was selling these disposable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>She does not love them, but I guess not too many people &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are not stiff but i can use the toothbrush for travel</li>
            <li>Light weight,nicely packaged,  but feels a little hard on tooth, needs more paste.</li>
            <li>The only thing was I felt the toothpaste ran out too fast.</li>
            <li>Capable of multiple brushings.</li>
            <li>should they ever have a patient who can&#x27;t find their toothbrush which happens frequently where in ALF&#x27;s &amp; nursing homes.</li>
            <li>bought these to keep on hand for unexpected guests.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft as the dentist recommends and already have Xylitol on them</li>
            <li>so they are complete as they are.</li>
            <li>I need to use a medium or soft brush.  </li>
            <li>Not a ton of suds/bubbles action (for lack of a better term) and only a faint mint flavor, but your teeth feel so clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Unless the supplier gives you the brushed for free, this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li>they are ok - bristles are a little rough and there is not enough paste in the toothebrush</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s barely any toothpaste on them.  </li>
            <li>My son has Invisilign and must brush frequently, so I pack one of these in his lunchbox daily.</li>
            <li>They work well when dipped in a cup of water and have a minimum of toothpaste, so are not messy when used out in public.  </li>
            <li>The only downside of these brushes is that they really have a minimal amount of toothpaste</li>
            <li>The second issue is the bristle break very fast about 30 seconds into brushing, the bristles are worn down and you feel like you need to use a second brush.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not like regular brushing with real toothpaste, Zylitol or other type.  </li>

            <li> Bought them for granddaughters who just had braces removed and they don&#x27;t work very well for them.</li>
            <li> These work very well for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had to use them yet, so can&#x27;t really comment on them.  </li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much &#x27;paste&#x27; included.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very abrasive.</li>
            <li> So much better than pulling out the toothbrush that you packed wet the morning before.</li>
            <li> It does not give the cool minty feeling you get with a regular tooth brush and paste.  </li>
            <li> I love these little guys so much that I use them myself from time to time.</li>
            <li> I am mainly writing this because some reviewers made me hesitant about the toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Still, they are individually packaged which makes them super convenient to go anywhere and use anytime.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is quickly run these toothbrushes under the faucet for a second and start brushing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> dentist says these are high quality, like that they don&#x27;t foam when using them</li>
            <li> Could use a little more paste</li>
            <li> I keep a few more in my purse.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s aesthetically better looking than conventional braces, it is a major inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I was very happy when I found that Cutting Edge International, LLC was selling these disposable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> She does not love them, but I guess not too many people &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are not stiff but i can use the toothbrush for travel</li>
            <li> Light weight,nicely packaged,  but feels a little hard on tooth, needs more paste.</li>
            <li> The only thing was I felt the toothpaste ran out too fast.</li>
            <li> Capable of multiple brushings.</li>
            <li> should they ever have a patient who can&#x27;t find their toothbrush which happens frequently where in ALF&#x27;s &amp; nursing homes.</li>
            <li> bought these to keep on hand for unexpected guests.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft as the dentist recommends and already have Xylitol on them</li>
            <li> so they are complete as they are.</li>
            <li> I need to use a medium or soft brush.  </li>
            <li> Not a ton of suds/bubbles action (for lack of a better term) and only a faint mint flavor, but your teeth feel so clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Unless the supplier gives you the brushed for free, this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> they are ok - bristles are a little rough and there is not enough paste in the toothebrush</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s barely any toothpaste on them.  </li>
            <li> My son has Invisilign and must brush frequently, so I pack one of these in his lunchbox daily.</li>
            <li> They work well when dipped in a cup of water and have a minimum of toothpaste, so are not messy when used out in public.  </li>
            <li> The only downside of these brushes is that they really have a minimal amount of toothpaste</li>
            <li> The second issue is the bristle break very fast about 30 seconds into brushing, the bristles are worn down and you feel like you need to use a second brush.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not like regular brushing with real toothpaste, Zylitol or other type.  </li>
            <li> The coating on the toothbrushes doesn&#x27;t lather, but provides a thin, mild coating on the teeth as you brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are far too stiff and should not be used in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I use them several times a week and its less hassle than a travel toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> When I wet the brush and begin the rushing motion, I feel as if I am brushing with a dry toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a bid harsh and only for single use.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tooth brushes for my 89 year old mother lives in a assisted living facility &amp; who has a hard time taking a cop off of toothpaste, getting the paste out of the tube &amp; getting it on her toothbrush with out getting it all over.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you use them not to damage gums and tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> Beats the wisps and other products like that.  </li>
            <li> The prepasted brush doesn&#x27;t last much past my teeth and by the time I&#x27;m washing my liners</li>
            <li> Mine had absolutely no paste!</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that there is not much toothpaste on the brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased previously, and they seem to have less toothpaste imbedded.</li>
            <li> Slight mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Just add a little water and brush away.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes are firm.</li>
            <li> I also always have a few in my purse and at work.</li>
            <li> I now keep a few of these with me at all times.</li>
            <li> I leave a few in the glove box of my car, if you at work, in my gym bag, and I put a few in my inside coat pocket before going out for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> No need to waste water cleaning the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these instead of my usual brand because of the their use of less packaging.</li>
            <li> But, there is very little toothpaste and the bristles are stiff.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried other pre-pasteds</li>
            <li> There is very little toothpaste on each brush.  </li>
            <li> However, a small amount of fluoride needs to be added.</li>
            <li> They are just the thing when you are out and unable to use your regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using this product since I have no other options, but this product is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> To me, the bristles are too hard.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the brush is hard.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes have hard bristles.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I now keep some in my diaper bag for those crazy mornings</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if we just got a bad box, but purchased them for a band trip and had to purchase toothpaste at the truck stop</li>
            <li> After my snacks, I run my tongue over my teeth and feel bad.  </li>
            <li> I hate to taste lunch all afternoon.</li>
            <li> With all the nasty germs going around hospitals, I felt safer using a sterile wrapped brush.  </li>

            <li> These did not have any toothpaste on them as advertised. I don&#x27;t know if we just got a bad box, but purchased them for a band trip and had to purchase toothpaste at the truck stop so kids could brush their teeth. Brushes are great, though and loved that they are individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> they are ok - bristles are a little rough and there is not enough paste in the toothebrush but they work in a pinch with my braces</li>
            <li> There is very little toothpaste on each brush.  Was expecting a better quality product.</li>
            <li> I brought these with me to the hospital when I had my c section. It was great not to have to get up to brush my teeth. All I had to do was unwrap and brush. The only thing was I felt the toothpaste ran out too fast. I now keep some in my diaper bag for those crazy mornings I forget to brush with a newborn!</li>
            <li> These are great guest tooth brushes, especially since they are infused with toothpaste.  It seems no one shows up at the house with their toothbrushes.  Great for guests and travel as well.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for the purpose I&#x27;ll be using them for.</li>
            <li> Use these when I travel and they work perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product. it does not foam in your mouth. Its fresh tasting and it is so great with all the kids. I love i can put them in your purse and go. stick them in the bathroom for guest or travel with them in your suit case. I will order again.</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  I&#x27;m doing invisalign so need to keep my teeth tartar/plaque free.  There is enough paste on these dudes to get my teeth clean and clean the trays without over-foaming.  In addition, the xylitol is a great anti-plaque agent and breath freshener but you can swallow it if necessary.  Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried other pre-pasteds but this is my fave!</li>
            <li> It is like a real toothbrush and very durable. Does not have a lot of paste on it, but serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> I like taking pre-pasted, disposible toothbrushes when I travel. These are good, my mouth feels fresh after brushing but the brushes themselves are a little cheaper made than ones I&#x27;ve purchased previously, and they seem to have less toothpaste imbedded. I would purchase these again because they do what I need them to do, clean my teeth and freshen my breath while being inexpensive and disposible.</li>
            <li> Wish there was more of a mint toothpaste flavor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after seeing that my dentist had the same ones in his office. I love the fact that they are individually wrapped. It makes brushing so much easier. My only complaint would be that there is not much toothpaste on the brushes.</li>
            <li> I received my order super fast. Very convenient to carry in handbag, but wish the toothbrush had more paste solution. The toothbrushes are firm.</li>
            <li> these toothbrushes are perfect.  They are about a medium bristle (and importantly, the bristles do not fall out.  I have had some that do)  The toothpaste is mild flavored, but when water is added it bubbles up when brushing and has a pleasant flavor.  Nicely wrapped and I would buy again.  Beats the wisps and other products like that.  I am mainly writing this because some reviewers made me hesitant about the toothpaste.  It is fine.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THEM FOR TRAVEL, TAKING TO WORK. THEY&#x27;RE  SANITARY. DON&#x27;T NEED TOOTHPASTE. ONLY DRAWBACK., NOT ENOUGH TOOTHPASTE ON BRUSH. 50 PIECES IN BOX, GOOD BUY FOR THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> I started invisalign and got these to make it easier to brush with every meal. Definitely helps and make it more convenient to brush in restaurants. Slight mint flavor. The prepasted brush doesn&#x27;t last much past my teeth and by the time I&#x27;m washing my liners the paste is almost gone.</li>
            <li> Great for travel and keeping in my purse for kids.</li>
            <li> My dentist had some disposable toothbrushes which had toothpaste and were great.  When I first used these, I did not know that you have to squeeze the bristles in order to release the toothpaste.  But, there is very little toothpaste and the bristles are stiff.  They are O.K. but I would not order again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for our fish house which has no water in the winter months.  They serve the purpose that they are intended for.  Could use a little more paste but what is on there works.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to take when traveling or if  you need to have a toothbrush handy where you are.</li>
            <li> These are great for one-the-go mornings or travel. However, a small amount of fluoride needs to be added. I don&#x27;t know why the makers are not adding that--it needs just a tiny ingestable amount; nothing like fluoride toothpaste one spits out. Please add it, but with or without it Xylitol works well, and you&#x27;ll like what you get for your money here. They are all sturdy, strong bristles, regular handles, and easy to open.</li>
            <li> To me, the bristles are too hard.</li>
            <li> Bristles should be more &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;. Bought them for granddaughters who just had braces removed and they don&#x27;t work very well for them.</li>
            <li> Really pleased. Not a ton of suds/bubbles action (for lack of a better term) and only a faint mint flavor, but your teeth feel so clean afterwards. I bought these over others because there were individually wrapped for easy on-the-go use, but love the benefits of xylitol as well.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these brushes.  There&#x27;s barely any toothpaste on them.  There are better one out there.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat order for me. I love these toothbrushes. Sometimes traveling doesn&#x27;t allow for the most sanitary conditions. I love that these are wrapped so I can carry them without concern. Then I can toss a brush and move onto the next brush. When conditions are more ideal, I have used the brush twice. My teeth are fresh and clean without over of suds and paste. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Love these! They are so convenient. I have them all over the house!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a timely manner and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Mine had absolutely no paste!</li>
            <li> Capable of multiple brushings. I have been able to use a singular one for about 5 days before I need another (just use your own toothpaste). The coating on the toothbrushes doesn&#x27;t lather, but provides a thin, mild coating on the teeth as you brush. Still, they are individually packaged which makes them super convenient to go anywhere and use anytime.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I broke my ankle and required surgery.  These were so nice to just grab and toss. With all the nasty germs going around hospitals, I felt safer using a sterile wrapped brush.  At home I still keep some bedside for times when I can&#x27;t make it to bathroom. They would be perfect for travel or just carry a few around in purse.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> These are a perfect solution for camping or any time you want a quick disposable toothbrush without having to deal with a funky brush stored in a septic plastic tube.</li>
            <li> These are awesome to leave in car or in your purse to use before a meeting or while traveling. I use them several times a week and its less hassle than a travel toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes. Individually packaged so they are easy to carry out to dinner and freshen up. Effective paste with a good taste.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tooth brushes for my 89 year old mother lives in a assisted living facility &amp; who has a hard time taking a cop off of toothpaste, getting the paste out of the tube &amp; getting it on her toothbrush with out getting it all over. They are a great product for someone like her &amp; she really liked them also, just wet brush &amp; throw away, she has even shared them with her friends who are also going to buy these package of 50 Pre-Pasted toothbrushes. I am even going to recommend them to the facility she lives in should they ever have a patient who can&#x27;t find their toothbrush which happens frequently where in ALF&#x27;s &amp; nursing homes.</li>
            <li> We have these in our Corporate bathroom in my office. Everyone loves them and everyone uses them!&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the bristles are not stiff but i can use the toothbrush for travel</li>
            <li> Practically zero xylitol on these brushes.</li>
            <li> All of our guests like them.</li>
            <li> These work very well for my daughter.  I am keeping them in the car for those days she forgets to brush her teeth or runs out of time on the way to school.  She does not love them, but I guess not too many people &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; brushing their teeth.  But, they do taste good, and its a help to me.</li>
            <li> This is AWESOME.  I can put these in my work bag and use one each day after eating (I don&#x27;t take a lunch but snack at my desk) and am so happy!!!!  After my snacks, I run my tongue over my teeth and feel bad.  I literally eat a container of Altoids every day, I should buy stock  in that company.  This is perfect, if I can&#x27;t make it to the bathroom (I live in a cube farm), I can swish it in a cup of water and lean down over the trash can and do a quick brush.  Better there than in the bathroom.  I am a female and will say women don&#x27;t always wash their hands, ect.  ech......</li>
            <li> This is the best disposable toothbrush I&#x27;ve found.  It works great...just throw them in your bag and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I like these. The paste is very light but my teeth feel incredibly clean. I am glad to no longer carry my regular toothbrush and paste around in a soggy ziplock bag. With two teens in braces, I feel a little more confident that they brush their teeth at school.</li>
            <li> Very hard brushes, but they are useful to have handy when you need a quick brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes are actually pretty strong for a disposable product but I don&#x27;t feel like I have brushed with anything using them.  I have ended up also carrying toothpaste with me which I was hoping not to do.  Probably take me forever to use these up but will not reorder.</li>
            <li> I recently got Invisalign. Although it&#x27;s aesthetically better looking than conventional braces, it is a major inconvenience. I have to brush my teeth after EVERY meal. Since I can&#x27;t bring my personal toothbrush and toothpaste to a formal restaurant, I purchased this. The toothpaste doesn&#x27;t taste like toothpaste. In fact, I couldn&#x27;t even tell if it was working. Furthermore, the brush is hard. It&#x27;s like rubbing sandpaper against your teeth. It made my gums bleed. I&#x27;m going to keep using this product since I have no other options, but this product is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> My son has Invisilign and must brush frequently, so I pack one of these in his lunchbox daily. I keep a few more in my purse. Very handy to use and toss.</li>
            <li> bought these to keep on hand for unexpected guests.  haven&#x27;t had to use them yet, so can&#x27;t really comment on them.  just good to know that i have them handy</li>
            <li> The concept is nice.  But Patients don&#x27;t like them.  I did not like them.  The idea of  a portable disposable toothbrush is great. The feedback I got from patients is that it feels like your using a regular tooth brush with out any toothpaste.  It does not give the cool minty feeling you get with a regular tooth brush and paste.  So many felt they did not properly brush and ended up having to put tooth paste on the brush to get the clean feeling.  The second issue is the bristle break very fast about 30 seconds into brushing, the bristles are worn down and you feel like you need to use a second brush.  So overall I think the idea was nice, but reality is it does not work well.  Third issues is that its doesnt look like there is any tooth paste impregnated into the bristtle, when you brushing it looks like you foaming your saliva, and enforces the idea that your just using a tooth brush with no paste.  Unless the supplier gives you the brushed for free, this is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love these little guys so much that I use them myself from time to time. They last about 3 days before they become worn but that&#x27;s plenty of time for house guests.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for myself to take to work for shift work. Light weight,nicely packaged,  but feels a little hard on tooth, needs more paste.</li>
            <li> These are a great idea and I love that they&#x27;re using Xylitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,&lt;br /&gt;1) There really isn&#x27;t much &#x27;paste&#x27; included. It tasted like mint but felt like there was nothing but bristle.&lt;br /&gt;2) The bristles are very abrasive. They cause bleeding even if you brush lightly.&lt;br /&gt;3) The packaging could be better. These seem like they&#x27;re meant as individual use, possibly travel use. I would prefer these were packaged smaller, like half the size, and able to fit nicely in a jean pocket.</li>
            <li> So much better than pulling out the toothbrush that you packed wet the morning before. I also always have a few in my purse and at work.</li>
            <li> needed something to easily get fresh breath at work and these seem perfect, not messy and very effective at giving me a clean mouth after coffee</li>
            <li> Bristles are a bid harsh and only for single use. The taste is eh but when you are on the go or traveling, it is useful</li>
            <li> Very handy to stick a couple of these brushes in your purse as they are individually wrapped. They are just the thing when you are out and unable to use your regular toothbrush. The bristles are soft as the dentist recommends and already have Xylitol on them so they are complete as they are. Just add a little water and brush away.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes have hard bristles.  I need to use a medium or soft brush.  Will donate to local shelter.</li>
            <li> I purchased these instead of my usual brand because of the their use of less packaging. I will not purchase these again. When I wet the brush and begin the rushing motion, I feel as if I am brushing with a dry toothbrush. If you are not bothered by that feeling, these brushes may well be for you.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to the Happy Morning Toothbrush with Xylitol while at my dentist. My dentist hands these toothbrushes out to each patient, to quickly brush their teeth before sitting in the dental chair. All you have to do is quickly run these toothbrushes under the faucet for a second and start brushing. The Xylitol coated bristles quickly foam up like toothpaste, and allows you to effectively brush your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed by this innovative idea that I went home and searched for them on Amazon. I was very happy when I found that Cutting Edge International, LLC was selling these disposable toothbrushes. I now keep a few of these with me at all times. I leave a few in the glove box of my car, if you at work, in my gym bag, and I put a few in my inside coat pocket before going out for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are super handy and very effective disposable toothbrushes. The taste is just like what you would expect from toothpaste. I definitely recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you feel this review was useful, please click the &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; button below. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use these toothbrushes daily after lunch at work, as I now have Invisalign and must brush and floss before reinserting the braces after eating.  A prepasted disposable toothbrush is ideal at work, as the single use reduces the likelihood of the toothbrush carrying germs when used in a public bathroom.  They work well when dipped in a cup of water and have a minimum of toothpaste, so are not messy when used out in public.  The only downside of these brushes is that they really have a minimal amount of toothpaste so it&#x27;s not like regular brushing with real toothpaste, Zylitol or other type.  It works though, and seems like the best solution as the Zylitol is the most natural type of toothpaste.  Would recommend and will keep using these.  The price is right, too.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  A box full of cheap toothbrushes</li>
            <li> This is perfect for our toy hauler as water is limited.  No need to waste water cleaning the toothbrush.  There is absolutely no taste to the built in toothpaste, perfect for those with a dislike of mint.</li>
            <li> Bristles are far too stiff and should not be used in the mouth. I don&#x27;t understand why they aren&#x27;t softer bristles. Be careful if you use them not to damage gums and tooth enamel.</li>
            <li> I have invisalign and I carry these with me everywhere. They are perfect. There is just enough paste to freshen you up without foaming or needing to rinse. This is my 2nd box of these, I love them.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and I love to have the brushes around.  We also,  take the brushes on trips.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommend this product. to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I hate to taste lunch all afternoon. This is the perfect solution without having a wet brush and paste to carry around</li>
            <li> dentist says these are high quality, like that they don&#x27;t foam when using them</li>
