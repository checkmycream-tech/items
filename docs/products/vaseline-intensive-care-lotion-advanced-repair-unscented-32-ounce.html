            <li>I think it is a perfect all around product, and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>but the price is good.</li>
            <li>get a lotion to care for your skin, spend money on a good perfume (not cologne or body sprays) if you want to add scent.</li>
            <li>Good value, and a good product.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good lotion.</li>
            <li>And it smells good.</li>
            <li>it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>The smell is good, not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; or overly scented, which is good because I like to use it with body sprays and perfume, and I can put this on, and it doesn&#x27;t mask another smell.</li>
            <li>Price was good and they even gave me a $1.00 coupon to use towards it.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Not so healthy ingredients, dont knw if I should use it!</li>
            <li>I actually really love it!</li>
            <li>I used Amazon Prime for shipping,(which I love!)</li>
            <li>So i found this lotion and it is AMAZING</li>
            <li>I got to try a free from influenster and it was great.</li>
            <li>Loving this formula. .</li>
            <li>This stuff now replaces Lubrederm and Vaseline coco butter petroleum jelly (which I really liked).  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to start making my own lotion now or something because all the lotions in the store are trash.</li>
            <li>This lotion was surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>everything worked out nicely</li>
            <li>I liked this as a hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>Also nice for legs.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Dermatologist Tested kind before and can never find it in stores.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline is a very good lotion and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Why is it that every time I find a beauty product I love to death that works amazing, it either gets discontinued or they change the formula?</li>
            <li>Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder has a nice range, find one that fits you :)</li>
            <li>This lotion is good for someone who is looking for a moisturizing, fragrance free lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I just love how this lotion makes my skin feel after I use it.</li>
            <li>I like fact, that is family size it keeps our skin healthy.</li>
            <li>It felt like heaven going on and actally lasted most of the day.</li>
            <li>I would pay a lot more for this product, and the fact that it&#x27;s so inexpensive makes it all the more appealing.</li>
            <li>I added some coconut oil to it to moisturize my skin better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  generally more of a mall shop lotion product person</li>
            <li>but i love gergens</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product.</li>
            <li>Compared to Vaseline Men Fragrance Free, this product just wasn&#x27;t as effective for me.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I always buy the pump because it makes me use it more often than having to use the &amp;#34;squirting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products that were advertised for this problem, but this product is the one that has worked best.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for those of us with very dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li>and since I subscribe to it Amazon gives you a better price with free shipping</li>
            <li>Arrived as expected, great shipping!</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs fine and more importantly, quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>However, I can honestly say I would rather lather my child up in lotions with a more natural list of ingredients, even if I have to do it more often.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference the first day I used it and have found this is truly a wonderful daily body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle, too.</li>
            <li>this is the most economical way to do it.  </li>
            <li>but this lotion is odor free</li>
            <li>I guess they got cheap on the ingredients or something.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I ordered this on subscription delivery from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun, that I just love it.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason why it is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>I used to use Suave lotion because it was cheap</li>
            <li>and it is great to use on a daily basis..</li>
            <li>may give it another try, but for now I&#x27;m sticking with Vaseline Men Fragrance Free.</li>
            <li>This item is fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy on the skin, and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>where it is do dry and this spreads on nice, rubs into the skin nicely and yet doesn&#x27;t have a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>First lotion he&#x27;s been 100% satisfied with.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Thus far, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on clean and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I keep coming back to Vaseline lotions, the quality is great and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good lotion for dry skin, not so greasy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>(yes I saved the old bottle I liked that formula</li>
            <li>Use this stuff, and all your wildest dreams will come true.  </li>
            <li>This is only good for Summer.</li>
            <li>I found this lotion to perfect for my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>A lot better than many other lotions that cost more.</li>
            <li>and it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>Still a good lotion and helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>When this runs out, I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>I recently received this product to review in the mail from influenster in my latest VoxBox!</li>
            <li>by the way, it is also economical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never get enough, it&#x27;s just too fun!!!</li>
            <li>the effect is not as good as other users describe.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in, without leaving any stickiness, and seems to be helping my dryness.</li>
            <li>Excellent lotion for extreme dry conditions.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even find generic knockoffs in the old formula because all the generics went and changed their formulas to match the new Vaseline too.a beauty product I love to death that works amazing, it either gets discontinued or they change the formula?</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much for the effect.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!  </li>
            <li>This lotion really works miracles!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell but they than that I love this product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you would expect from Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time buying this brand</li>
            <li>It seems to moisturize my skin better and tends to last longer.</li>
            <li>It seems that the bigger the container, the more water they add.  </li>
            <li>Not the exact lotion I thought I was getting.  </li>
            <li>AND it lasts longer than most, especially if used just after washing or taking a shower and your skin is moist.</li>
            <li>So many lotions, so much the same results.</li>
            <li>It keeps his skin nice and soft and we use it only once a day.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin super soft, not to mention no scent!  </li>
            <li>The product came to me pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in, softens right away and keeps the skin soft for about 10 - 12 hours and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like the petroleum jelly</li>
            <li>I have read another review here by someone that prefers an older formulation, but for me, this works better than the \\&quot;Vaseline Intensive Care\\&quot; lotion of earlier decades.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily because of the price was pretty low.</li>
            <li>This lotion is good for my dry skin especially during winter.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so moist and makes your skin look really shiny.</li>
            <li>very well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Just a whole bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless and non-greasy, as well as very soothing.  </li>
            <li>It really heals your skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very moisturizing with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>The pump spout is really convenient.</li>
            <li>Reasonable too.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>However, I can really tell a difference with this Vaseline lotion.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This lotion is really moisturizing</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li>Works fast on all body parts, not just hands.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it, from ages 3 and</li>
            <li>It is nice everyday&#x27;s lotion.</li>
            <li>This fragrance free product works better than most other far more expensive products I have tried... and I have used over a dozen types.</li>
            <li>Great for those dry days in the Wild West.&lt;br /&gt;Moistens your skin, reduces itching and soothes away that dry</li>
            <li>Helps lock it in longer than most other products I have used.</li>
            <li>This lotion is excellent for dry or tough skin.</li>
            <li>main cause of worry is the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin looking fresh and not dry at all.</li>
            <li>I like that its fragrance free so it won&#x27;t dry out my skin, or make me smell like a high school girl in a fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this lotion.</li>
            <li>There is really nothing natural in there.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t buy unscented lotion</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using this product, my feet are much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(You can see it looks like they took out all the quality ingredients that actually worked and made the product so amazing like Sunflower Seed oil, Vitamin A and E, etc and rearranged others like adding way less petrolatum.</li>
            <li>Daily use, sometimes 2-3 times a day, heal all my winter dry skin..  Love it..</li>
            <li>new ingredient list is: Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Stearic Acid, Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Isostearate, Tapioca Starch, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer, Ethylene Brassylate, Triethanolamine, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents (even the scents of some \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; lotions bother me), but this one doesn&#x27;t bug me at all.</li>
            <li>As usual:)</li>
            <li>I usually use it twice for even more softness.  </li>
            <li>my skin is very soft from this but for it to be repairing lotion its kind of thin</li>
            <li>/&gt;the low price certainly assured us to  be content with our purchase&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use it on age old callouses on my hands from years of work, ect and my elbows that crack if I don&#x27;t keep them soft...</li>
            <li>This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that really coats the hand without being greasy or too &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>There is no perfume added, so my sensitive skin has no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and skin which can act allergicly to scents, perfumes, dyes, fragrances, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because they are not heavily scented.</li>
            <li>Purchased this in place of my beloved aloe formula, which has been sadly discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even find generic knockoffs in the old formula because all the generics went and changed their formulas to match the new Vaseline too.</li>
            <li>exactly what i had expected without having to go the store.</li>
            <li>Doesnt really help my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have used up multiple other huge bottles of Vaseline Intensive Care lotions in the past before, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve found to be sticky.</li>
            <li>I work in a medical office where I have to wash my hands frequently and then re-apply, so I&#x27;m careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy when applied sparingly, although if you apply too heavily it will take some time to be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>but it has this kind of weird smell to it that goes away after awhile</li>
            <li>I use it the first time and wait a half hour or so and use it again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple dozen other lotions and will say this one really works for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive,  and extremely dry especially my feet and elbows..</li>
            <li>It used to make my chronic dry skin feel so hydrated and soft.</li>

            <li> and since I subscribe to it Amazon gives you a better price with free shipping</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, great shipping!</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs fine and more importantly, quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> However, I can honestly say I would rather lather my child up in lotions with a more natural list of ingredients, even if I have to do it more often.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference the first day I used it and have found this is truly a wonderful daily body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge bottle, too.</li>
            <li> this is the most economical way to do it.  </li>
            <li> but this lotion is odor free</li>
            <li> I guess they got cheap on the ingredients or something.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I ordered this on subscription delivery from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun, that I just love it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason why it is so cheap.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Suave lotion because it was cheap</li>
            <li> and it is great to use on a daily basis..</li>
            <li> may give it another try, but for now I&#x27;m sticking with Vaseline Men Fragrance Free.</li>
            <li> This item is fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy on the skin, and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> where it is do dry and this spreads on nice, rubs into the skin nicely and yet doesn&#x27;t have a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> First lotion he&#x27;s been 100% satisfied with.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Thus far, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on clean and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I keep coming back to Vaseline lotions, the quality is great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good lotion for dry skin, not so greasy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> (yes I saved the old bottle I liked that formula</li>
            <li> Use this stuff, and all your wildest dreams will come true.  </li>
            <li> This is only good for Summer.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion to perfect for my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> A lot better than many other lotions that cost more.</li>
            <li> and it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Still a good lotion and helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> When this runs out, I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> I recently received this product to review in the mail from influenster in my latest VoxBox!</li>
            <li> by the way, it is also economical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never get enough, it&#x27;s just too fun!!!</li>
            <li> the effect is not as good as other users describe.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in, without leaving any stickiness, and seems to be helping my dryness.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion for extreme dry conditions.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even find generic knockoffs in the old formula because all the generics went and changed their formulas to match the new Vaseline too.a beauty product I love to death that works amazing, it either gets discontinued or they change the formula?</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much for the effect.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!  </li>
            <li> This lotion really works miracles!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell but they than that I love this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you would expect from Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time buying this brand</li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize my skin better and tends to last longer.</li>
            <li> It seems that the bigger the container, the more water they add.  </li>
            <li> Not the exact lotion I thought I was getting.  </li>
            <li> AND it lasts longer than most, especially if used just after washing or taking a shower and your skin is moist.</li>
            <li> So many lotions, so much the same results.</li>
            <li> It keeps his skin nice and soft and we use it only once a day.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin super soft, not to mention no scent!  </li>
            <li> The product came to me pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in, softens right away and keeps the skin soft for about 10 - 12 hours and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like the petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> I have read another review here by someone that prefers an older formulation, but for me, this works better than the \\&quot;Vaseline Intensive Care\\&quot; lotion of earlier decades.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily because of the price was pretty low.</li>
            <li> This lotion is good for my dry skin especially during winter.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moist and makes your skin look really shiny.</li>
            <li> very well moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Just a whole bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless and non-greasy, as well as very soothing.  </li>
            <li> It really heals your skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very moisturizing with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> The pump spout is really convenient.</li>
            <li> Reasonable too.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> However, I can really tell a difference with this Vaseline lotion.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really moisturizing</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li> Works fast on all body parts, not just hands.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it, from ages 3 and</li>
            <li> It is nice everyday&#x27;s lotion.</li>
            <li> This fragrance free product works better than most other far more expensive products I have tried... and I have used over a dozen types.</li>
            <li> Great for those dry days in the Wild West.&lt;br /&gt;Moistens your skin, reduces itching and soothes away that dry</li>
            <li> Helps lock it in longer than most other products I have used.</li>
            <li> This lotion is excellent for dry or tough skin.</li>
            <li> main cause of worry is the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin looking fresh and not dry at all.</li>
            <li> I like that its fragrance free so it won&#x27;t dry out my skin, or make me smell like a high school girl in a fruity scent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this lotion.</li>
            <li> There is really nothing natural in there.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy unscented lotion</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this product, my feet are much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(You can see it looks like they took out all the quality ingredients that actually worked and made the product so amazing like Sunflower Seed oil, Vitamin A and E, etc and rearranged others like adding way less petrolatum.</li>
            <li> Daily use, sometimes 2-3 times a day, heal all my winter dry skin..  Love it..</li>
            <li> new ingredient list is: Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Stearic Acid, Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Isostearate, Tapioca Starch, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer, Ethylene Brassylate, Triethanolamine, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents (even the scents of some \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; lotions bother me), but this one doesn&#x27;t bug me at all.</li>
            <li> As usual:)</li>
            <li> I usually use it twice for even more softness.  </li>
            <li> my skin is very soft from this but for it to be repairing lotion its kind of thin</li>
            <li> /&gt;the low price certainly assured us to  be content with our purchase&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use it on age old callouses on my hands from years of work, ect and my elbows that crack if I don&#x27;t keep them soft...</li>
            <li> This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that really coats the hand without being greasy or too &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> There is no perfume added, so my sensitive skin has no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose and skin which can act allergicly to scents, perfumes, dyes, fragrances, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s because they are not heavily scented.</li>
            <li> Purchased this in place of my beloved aloe formula, which has been sadly discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even find generic knockoffs in the old formula because all the generics went and changed their formulas to match the new Vaseline too.</li>
            <li> exactly what i had expected without having to go the store.</li>
            <li> Doesnt really help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used up multiple other huge bottles of Vaseline Intensive Care lotions in the past before, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve found to be sticky.</li>
            <li> I work in a medical office where I have to wash my hands frequently and then re-apply, so I&#x27;m careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy when applied sparingly, although if you apply too heavily it will take some time to be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> but it has this kind of weird smell to it that goes away after awhile</li>
            <li> I use it the first time and wait a half hour or so and use it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple dozen other lotions and will say this one really works for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive,  and extremely dry especially my feet and elbows..</li>
            <li> It used to make my chronic dry skin feel so hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I was a little taken aback at first because I didn&#x27;t realize it was unscented, but I actually like it because for especially dry skin it won&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> This is no better or no worse</li>
            <li> I use them all year long for all the different seasons.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion to be very greasy and to smell bad even though it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s 85 and uses it daily for dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble falling asleep with it on as I just feel so icky; I often have to rinse the lotion off before I can be comfortable again.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive and effective treatment and preventative for split skin on fingertips due to winter cold and dryness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a weird baby powderish smell to it now, when it&#x27;s supposed to be fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It keeps it from getting dried out and it makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t have to smell it all day long!  </li>
            <li> My skin has been dry so much especially during winter months with my skin cracking or even due to the heat stove but this works.</li>
            <li> I use it for my son because he has extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> they are always dry.</li>
            <li> and being in oklahoma the dry winters don&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> My job requires wearing latex gloves all day and that can really dry out my hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps my hands from getting dry and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it my hands are not as dry and do not crack.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin plus living in Arizona</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and the lotion I used to use is no longer manufactured, so I tried this.</li>
            <li> Compared to other more expensive lotions, you get the same results if not better.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and use this lotion every single morning.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my ashy winter skin and dry winter body parts!</li>
            <li> This lotion has been a miracle lotion for my dry rough hands.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure why my opinion of this product is so different than the vast majority of everyone else&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell, but that is simply the smell of the ingredients, not added perfume.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild fragrance which I don&#x27;t find annoying (and I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes).</li>
            <li> The moisturization lasts all day, even on rough patches.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way</li>
            <li> a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> then the 100&#x27;s of other brands and types of lotions out there.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and works extremely well</li>
            <li> and it came in a sealed bag with my other items.</li>
            <li> They just recently changed the formula and it completely sucks now.</li>
            <li> lotion itself has a faint smell, which I don&#x27;t mind much.</li>
            <li> It is sorta thick and can leave a slightly greasy feeling, but it works for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> so soft and had worked really well on that awful winter dry skin!</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for a non-sticky lotion as I have a few half-used bottles of Aveeno and Jergens that are sticky and wanted to replace them.</li>
            <li> I found it a little too thick for me.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t usually like an unscented body lotion, I do like this one.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my skin moist and prevent itchiness that my skin develops due to the cold and dry weather.</li>
            <li> I use the stuff on Dr.&#x27;s orders because I have both skin and circulation / vascular problems and need to keep dead skin and callouses on my feet under control as it can lead to serious issues.  </li>
            <li> and she complained of it being itchy for days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not greasy but not too thick you have to rub forever to get it in.</li>
            <li> It does have a VERY faint smell to it, not enough to call it scented though</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and hate putting on lotion so as infrequently as I do</li>
            <li> Combine swimming with dry, cold winter air</li>
            <li> My feet were in serious disrepair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had extremely dry skin, and in the winter my skin itches like mad.</li>
            <li> it is really big, but then again all those chemicals on me :(</li>
            <li> My hands were so rough and dry, I hated to shake hands with anyone!  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin dry and nasty feeling (almost chalky) like all the other lotions and doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> They charge so much for garbage that doesn&#x27;t even work with horrible ingredients like Glycerine and Mineral Oil.</li>
            <li> I gave her some Benadryl, so that prevented it from getting worse.  </li>
            <li> This is not as bad as some varieties, but I&#x27;m not thrilled.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it.\\&quot;!?</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it.\\&quot;!?</li>
            <li> Legs stayed moisturized for several hours - even in frigid Wisconsin weather!</li>
            <li> Maybe I picked the wrong season(Winter) to try something new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> lotions make my hands sweaty and well, I feel uncomfortable with greasy hands.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything in the hand lotion world, cheapest to very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad elbows.</li>
            <li> Edit:  when my hands are chapped it stings quite badly.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not because they smell bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when this was taken off of subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed with the watery feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Now it works like crap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loving this formula. . Non greasy, yet moisturizing. My skin is very sensitive,  and extremely dry especially my feet and elbows.. At night I apply the lotion to my feet after showering and apply socks.. I wake up and see a visible difference.. my feet were softer.  I got this product free to review and will be purchasing this product when my sample runs out!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff now replaces Lubrederm and Vaseline coco butter petroleum jelly (which I really liked).  I use the stuff on Dr.&#x27;s orders because I have both skin and circulation / vascular problems and need to keep dead skin and callouses on my feet under control as it can lead to serious issues.  I also use it on age old callouses on my hands from years of work, ect and my elbows that crack if I don&#x27;t keep them soft...yes men need to do this too.  It soaks right in, softens right away and keeps the skin soft for about 10 - 12 hours and does not leave my skin feeling greasy like the petroleum jelly did.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way so the size here should last 2 - 3 month and since I subscribe to it Amazon gives you a better price with free shipping so you always have it.  If you have to have this stuff this is the most economical way to do it.  Thanks Amazon!  As usual:)</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s 85 and uses it daily for dry, itchy skin.  He says it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and keeps his skin moisturized and itch-free all day. First lotion he&#x27;s been 100% satisfied with.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t usually like an unscented body lotion, I do like this one. It moisturizes very well and is not greasy at all. The moisturization lasts all day, even on rough patches. It does have a VERY faint smell to it, not enough to call it scented though and it is not a perfumey smell. The price was great here at Amazon, which is what prompted me to buy. I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this product about a month ago. This lotion really works miracles! You notice the change in your skin immediately. It&#x27;s so moist and makes your skin look really shiny. This is perfect for the winter. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell but they than that I love this product.</li>
            <li> So many lotions, so much the same results. This is no better or no worse then the 100&#x27;s of other brands and types of lotions out there. So just come to personal preferences. And at this time I have no preferences as all lotions seem to be the same.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t have any smell which I don&#x27;t care if it does anyways.  Leaves my skin very well moisturized.  I will definitely buy this lotion again.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion to perfect for my sensitive dry skin. I was disappointed when this was taken off of subscribe and save. The price couldn&#x27;t be beat for the quality and quantity of lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and use this lotion every single morning.  There are others that work just as well but this lotion is odor free and that&#x27;s a huge plus.  It don&#x27;t have to smell it all day long!  When this runs out, I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> A very nice lotion for a great price. I normally don&#x27;t buy unscented lotion but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the value. I have Now Foods peppermint and lavender oils so I used lavender in the lotion on my bedside table and peppermint in the bottle I keep on my desk! Perfect!</li>
            <li> The lotion seems work but the pump does not deliver the lotion. Never had defective pump before. You have to uncap, take out the pump, flip and shake/push the bottle to get the lotion out. It is more time consuming and tiresome to return but i do not think I will order again.</li>
            <li> the effect is not as good as other users describe. but the price is good. the effect matches the price</li>
            <li> Vaseline is a very good lotion and the price is very reasonable. Compared to other more expensive lotions, you get the same results if not better.</li>
            <li> This seems to moisturize well. You don&#x27;t need very much for the effect. It&#x27;s also reasonably priced. It has a neutral smell or none at all.</li>
            <li> I just love how this lotion makes my skin feel after I use it. It keeps it from getting dried out and it makes it so soft. a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Purchased this in place of my beloved aloe formula, which has been sadly discontinued.  This is not as bad as some varieties, but I&#x27;m not thrilled.  While it&#x27;s not sticky, there&#x27;s silicone in this, which tends to accumulate and create a slippery layer- after a couple of uses I often find myself having to rinse it off and start over.</li>
            <li> They just recently changed the formula and it completely sucks now. This used to be the best lotion in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list Used to read... Water, White Petrolatum, Glycerine, Steric Acid, Glycol Sterate, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Glycine Soya (Soybean) Sterols, Lechithin, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Urea, Collagen Amino Acids, Sodium Stearoyl Lactate, Mineral Water, Sodium PCA, Potassium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Sterate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer, Stearamide AMP, Ethylene Brassylate, Triethanolamine, Corn Oil, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, DMDM Hydantoin, BHT, Titanium Dioxide (yes I saved the old bottle I liked that formula so much)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new ingredient list is: Water, Glycerin, Petrolatum, Stearic Acid, Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Isopropyl Isostearate, Tapioca Starch, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer, Ethylene Brassylate, Triethanolamine, Disodium Edta, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You can see it looks like they took out all the quality ingredients that actually worked and made the product so amazing like Sunflower Seed oil, Vitamin A and E, etc and rearranged others like adding way less petrolatum. I&#x27;m going to assume to save money.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a weird baby powderish smell to it now, when it&#x27;s supposed to be fragrance free. It used to make my chronic dry skin feel so hydrated and soft. Now it works like crap. Leaves my skin dry and nasty feeling (almost chalky) like all the other lotions and doesn&#x27;t do a thing. I might as well have not even used lotion. I guess they got cheap on the ingredients or something. Shame on them! I guess I&#x27;ll have to start making my own lotion now or something because all the lotions in the store are trash. They charge so much for garbage that doesn&#x27;t even work with horrible ingredients like Glycerine and Mineral Oil. Why is it that every time I find a beauty product I love to death that works amazing, it either gets discontinued or they change the formula? Is there some unspoken rule in the beauty industry that a product actually working too well is not allowed??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have they never heard \\&quot;If it isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it.\\&quot;!? Not all change is progress!!! I can&#x27;t even find generic knockoffs in the old formula because all the generics went and changed their formulas to match the new Vaseline too.a beauty product I love to death that works amazing, it either gets discontinued or they change the formula?

            <li> Exactly what you would expect from Vaseline.  Not disappointed.  The smell discipates after 15 minutes or so and it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to Vaseline lotions, the quality is great and the price is right. Fancy scented lotions are a rip off in my opinion....get a lotion to care for your skin, spend money on a good perfume (not cologne or body sprays) if you want to add scent. Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder has a nice range, find one that fits you :)</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily because of the price was pretty low. Coupon + sub and save.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself has a faint smell, which I don&#x27;t mind much. I use it for my son because he has extremely dry skin. It works well. It keeps his skin nice and soft and we use it only once a day. I&#x27;m have not come across another lotion that does that.&lt;br /&gt;My main cause of worry is the ingredients list. There is really nothing natural in there. Just a whole bunch of chemicals. Perhaps that&#x27;s why it works so well. However, I can honestly say I would rather lather my child up in lotions with a more natural list of ingredients, even if I have to do it more often.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive and effective treatment and preventative for split skin on fingertips due to winter cold and dryness. I have tried many other products that were advertised for this problem, but this product is the one that has worked best. It is not greasy when applied sparingly, although if you apply too heavily it will take some time to be absorbed into the skin. I work in a medical office where I have to wash my hands frequently and then re-apply, so I&#x27;m careful not to use too much. It has a very mild fragrance which I don&#x27;t find annoying (and I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes). I have read another review here by someone that prefers an older formulation, but for me, this works better than the \\&quot;Vaseline Intensive Care\\&quot; lotion of earlier decades.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it and I bought a 32 oz bottle.  Not greasey. Does the job and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years for my daughter to use.  The recent formulation change caused my daughter to break out in a severe allergic reaction.  The skin on her legs that I applied the lotion to turned red and swelled up.  I gave her some Benadryl, so that prevented it from getting worse.  The reddened skin area thickened and she complained of it being itchy for days.&lt;br /&gt;I wished the label could have warned us of a &amp;#34;Big&amp;#34; change in the formulation.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product from a competitor&#x27;s product when it was discontinued.  I&#x27;m very happy with this lotion.  It&#x27;s odorless and non-greasy, as well as very soothing.  I use it daily after bathing.</li>
            <li> Good value, and a good product.  No scent no greasy feeling. A lot better than many other lotions that cost more.</li>
            <li> I like fact, that is family size it keeps our skin healthy. And I don&#x27;t have to run out so often.</li>
            <li> It really heals your skin. I have really bad elbows. they are always dry. and being in oklahoma the dry winters don&#x27;t help at all. So i found this lotion and it is AMAZING</li>
            <li> My job requires wearing latex gloves all day and that can really dry out my hands. This lotion is very moisturizing with no greasy residue. Love it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is good for someone who is looking for a moisturizing, fragrance free lotion.  I was a little taken aback at first because I didn&#x27;t realize it was unscented, but I actually like it because for especially dry skin it won&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> This lotion was surprisingly effective. It felt like heaven going on and actally lasted most of the day. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything in the hand lotion world, cheapest to very expensive.  This is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that really coats the hand without being greasy or too &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;.  The value from Amazon couldn&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> My hands were so rough and dry, I hated to shake hands with anyone!  This lotion has been a miracle lotion for my dry rough hands.  I usually use it twice for even more softness.  I use it the first time and wait a half hour or so and use it again.  I use it on my body and even my face too!  I never plan to use another lotion!</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Not greasy but not too thick you have to rub forever to get it in. The pump spout is really convenient.</li>
            <li> everything worked out nicely</li>
            <li> Great for those dry days in the Wild West.&lt;br /&gt;Moistens your skin, reduces itching and soothes away that dry feeling.&lt;br /&gt;(only Aveeno is better)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decant price. as well.</li>
            <li> I swim three to five days a week and my skin takes quite a beating from the exposure to chlorine so often. Combine swimming with dry, cold winter air and I felt like a sheet of walking sand paper. I&#x27;ve tried a couple dozen other lotions and will say this one really works for me. I noticed a huge difference the first day I used it and have found this is truly a wonderful daily body moisturizer. It goes on wonderfully, soaks in well and, most important to me, it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling residue afterwards. I liked it so much, I ordered this on subscription delivery from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it does its job on my wife&#x27;s cracked hands in the winter,&lt;br /&gt;the low price certainly assured us to  be content with our purchase&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a really good lotion. I&#x27;ve always had extremely dry skin, and in the winter my skin itches like mad. I started using this lotion daily last winter and I didn&#x27;t itch once. It completely healed the scaliness on my lower legs as well as my rough heels. I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents (even the scents of some \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; lotions bother me), but this one doesn&#x27;t bug me at all. I would pay a lot more for this product, and the fact that it&#x27;s so inexpensive makes it all the more appealing.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on clean and not greasy.  It moisturizes well and we have decided it is our preferred body lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years.  It is wonderful for those of us with very dry, itchy skin. Reasonable too.</li>
            <li> No overpowering smell, non greasy, and you get a lot in this container. This was my first time buying this brand and I&#x27;ll wind up doing it again.</li>
            <li> Not so healthy ingredients, dont knw if I should use it! it is really big, but then again all those chemicals on me :(</li>
            <li> Use this stuff, and all your wildest dreams will come true.  It&#x27;s so fun, that I just love it.  I&#x27;ll never get enough, it&#x27;s just too fun!!!</li>
            <li> It is nice everyday&#x27;s lotion. It is not greasy. And it smells good. by the way, it is also economical.</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves a sticky residue.  It&#x27;s awful.  There&#x27;s a reason why it is so cheap.  I definitely won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I liked this as a hand lotion.  Not too greasy.  Also nice for legs.  I like that its fragrance free so it won&#x27;t dry out my skin, or make me smell like a high school girl in a fruity scent. Legs stayed moisturized for several hours - even in frigid Wisconsin weather!</li>
            <li> Doesnt really help my dry skin. When I received it the bottle was busted as well. I added some coconut oil to it to moisturize my skin better.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have tried so many different lotions even expensive ones but this one does the trick. I got to try a free from influenster and it was great. I tried them all over my legs and arms and even my face. This product really works. It does the job. My skin has been dry so much especially during winter months with my skin cracking or even due to the heat stove but this works. It keeps my skin looking fresh and not dry at all. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product to review in the mail from influenster in my latest VoxBox! I actually really love it! I&#x27;m  generally more of a mall shop lotion product person but this has left my skin feeling  so soft and had worked really well on that awful winter dry skin!</li>
            <li> I used to use Suave lotion because it was cheap and I though all lotions were the same. However, I can really tell a difference with this Vaseline lotion. It seems to moisturize my skin better and tends to last longer. It is sorta thick and can leave a slightly greasy feeling, but it works for my dry skin. I am not a fan of the smell, so will try a different fragrance next time.</li>
            <li> This lotion is good for my dry skin especially during winter. It helps keep my skin moist and prevent itchiness that my skin develops due to the cold and dry weather.</li>
            <li> This lotion is sticky. It doesn&#x27;t absorb well. I was specifically looking for a non-sticky lotion as I have a few half-used bottles of Aveeno and Jergens that are sticky and wanted to replace them. I have used up multiple other huge bottles of Vaseline Intensive Care lotions in the past before, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve found to be sticky. I have trouble falling asleep with it on as I just feel so icky; I often have to rinse the lotion off before I can be comfortable again. What a disappointment. It&#x27;s a huge bottle, too.</li>
            <li> exactly what i had expected without having to go the store. The product came to me pretty fast. it was a good deal. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this lotion. I&#x27;ve used it for years and it is great to use on a daily basis..</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft from this but for it to be repairing lotion its kind of thin i like gergens its my fav but i wanted to give this a try i like it would buy again but i love gergens</li>
            <li> I think this is a good lotion for dry skin, not so greasy and easy to use. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Im not sure why my opinion of this product is so different than the vast majority of everyone else&#x27;s... I found this lotion to be very greasy and to smell bad even though it is fragrance free. I personally would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My feet were in serious disrepair.  After a few weeks of using this product, my feet are much better. Thank You, Vaseline.</li>
            <li> got this for my wife, it is all we use now and we have been using it for some time. It is not greasy and works extremely well</li>
            <li> Why spend a ton of money on fancy products, when this works great.  Leaves my skin super soft, not to mention no scent!  Love Love Love this product.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed with the watery feel of this lotion. Arrived as expected, great shipping!</li>
            <li> This lotion is excellent for dry or tough skin. I am always concerned that lotions will leave a greasy feeling, however this one rubs in well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or that greasy feeling. It also lasts for quite a while on the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really moisturizing but it has this kind of weird smell to it that goes away after awhile but it did the job so I don&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li> This is a very good unscented lotion. It does have a slight smell, but that is simply the smell of the ingredients, not added perfume.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the smell. Also it&#x27;s not very moisturizing. I found it a little too thick for me.</li>
            <li> Compared to Vaseline Men Fragrance Free, this product just wasn&#x27;t as effective for me.  Maybe I picked the wrong season(Winter) to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may give it another try, but for now I&#x27;m sticking with Vaseline Men Fragrance Free.</li>
            <li> It seems that the bigger the container, the more water they add.  It feels like water.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my hands from getting dry and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it my hands are not as dry and do not crack.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion for extreme dry conditions.  I used while I was in the Sinai region and it did not disappoint.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This item is fragrance free, doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy on the skin, and lasts throughout the day. I live in Arizona and hate putting on lotion so as infrequently as I do, I have to have a great lotion to fix my damage and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have extremely dry skin plus living in Arizona where it is do dry and this spreads on nice, rubs into the skin nicely and yet doesn&#x27;t have a greasy residue.  I rubs into the skin so well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my ashy winter skin and dry winter body parts! Works fast on all body parts, not just hands. I can layer it on after its been asborbed and it is not greasy at all. The smell is good, not &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; or overly scented, which is good because I like to use it with body sprays and perfume, and I can put this on, and it doesn&#x27;t mask another smell. The whole family uses it, from ages 3 and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always happy with Vaseline Intensive Care Product line, no matter which one I choose. I use them all year long for all the different seasons. I always buy the pump because it makes me use it more often than having to use the &amp;#34;squirting&amp;#34; kind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Price was good and they even gave me a $1.00 coupon to use towards it. I used Amazon Prime for shipping,(which I love!) and it came in a sealed bag with my other items. You don&#x27;t have to worry if it opened or not, it wouldn&#x27;t have damaged anything.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion everywhere even on my face. I think it is a perfect all around product, and easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> Well, the title says it all..  Daily use, sometimes 2-3 times a day, heal all my winter dry skin..  Love it..</li>
            <li> This is a good price and I like it for the guys in the office because it doesn&#x27;t have the flowery smell that a lot of lotions do.  Good value.  Edit:  when my hands are chapped it stings quite badly.  This is only good for Summer.</li>
            <li> Not the exact lotion I thought I was getting.  I have used the Dermatologist Tested kind before and can never find it in stores.  Thought that was what I was getting but it wasn&#x27;t.  Still a good lotion and helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and the lotion I used to use is no longer manufactured, so I tried this. It soaks right in, without leaving any stickiness, and seems to be helping my dryness. There is no perfume added, so my sensitive skin has no adverse reaction. Thus far, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This fragrance free product works better than most other far more expensive products I have tried... and I have used over a dozen types. I have a sensitive nose and skin which can act allergicly to scents, perfumes, dyes, fragrances, etc. This one does not trigger an allergic reaction in me. AND it lasts longer than most, especially if used just after washing or taking a shower and your skin is moist. Helps lock it in longer than most other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled when I got this but that&#x27;s not because they smell bad. It&#x27;s because they are not heavily scented. The lotion absorbs fine and more importantly, quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some lotions make my hands sweaty and well, I feel uncomfortable with greasy hands. This one doesn&#x27;t do that at all and that&#x27;s 5 stars in my case!</li>
