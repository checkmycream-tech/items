            <li>happy with product, easy to apply</li>
            <li>Knees, ankles and elbows are touch areas, but it you lightly apply it, it works great.  </li>
            <li>This sunless tanner is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I goes on even, has an amazing brown NOT orange color</li>
            <li>This product is amazing never thought it would work as well as it does been using for a month everyone comments on my tan.</li>
            <li>the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Gives nice colour without being obtrusive.</li>
            <li>NICE, EVEN COLOR.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product.  </li>
            <li>I can get a nice tan hue in one application....</li>
            <li>so putting on evenly causes you to hafta do it in two coats to make sure there is no streaking but was a good tan color, no orange to it at all.  </li>
            <li>Legs look nice and tan.  </li>
            <li>I must admit it didn&#x27;t work as I would have liked it too -</li>
            <li>i liked the bronze look, but i had to use it about every three days to keep the color.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best!  </li>
            <li>Smells good too : )</li>
            <li>It spreads on evenly and a nice color.</li>
            <li>nice smell</li>
            <li>Nice shade after just one application.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a nice brown tan either....</li>
            <li>this really is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Nice color, not Orange.  </li>
            <li>The tanner gives nice color but still has the awflul smell after applying.....  </li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it did not have an adverse ordor.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked it to add a deeper color in a shorter time.</li>
            <li>This is the ABSOLUTE best self-tanner EVER!  </li>
            <li>The pros- absorbs and drys quickly, nice smell.</li>
            <li>kind.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice to have a product that I can use in the summer to look tan.</li>

            <li>Give a nice glow and moisturizes too.  </li>
            <li>Kind of pricey but def</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of pineapple-y I guess?</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; feels great, but I&#x27;m not seeing much color change.</li>
            <li>This tanner is not for this kind of climate.  </li>
            <li>Produces a very nice tan and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the product,; great color, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with good results.</li>

            <li>Very strong smell and orange color.  </li>

            <li>Works great in the smell is awesome unlike other self Tanners at the smell I cannot stand .</li>
            <li>Smells pleasant when applying it, however, there&#x27;s a familiar self tanning lotion odor to it</li>

            <li>Prior to this one, I&#x27;d say the Josie Maran was the best.  </li>

            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>im a senior with such a wonderful colour on my face &amp; neck without the lines ..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>You have to exfoliate and make sure it&#x27;s we&#x27;ll blended around joints.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I have referred the product to many of my friends</li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE THE RESULT.</li>

            <li>YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find it any better then</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;ve used MANY over the years and this one worked ok but cost Much more than most (like 4X).  </li>
            <li>They have paid enormous amounts in advertising so that you will think that this is the best, newest innovation in self tanning..which it is NOT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it worked any better than some of the drug store brands.</li>
            <li>I do love the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li>If I had time to apply for about a month ahead of time I might like it better.</li>
            <li>It does have some odor, as with most tanners.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off with a tinted lotion or moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But many applications to the body for color and</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I got a better tan results from $8.00 lotion from Walmart.</li>

            <li>no return on top of that.</li>
            <li>I love this tanner.</li>
            <li>Just got two more bottles.</li>
            <li>You should have a hand mirror to look at places you can&#x27;t see and if you see blotches...just rub it in more.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>and we got a way better product... and a tan extender...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most every tanning product out there</li>

            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>on nicely, but two light coats are needed for me without streaking, one coat doesn&#x27;t seem to do it.  </li>
            <li>and i have tried many.</li>
            <li>cost way more than the stuff I had used before</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and</li>
            <li>I did not find this item to be any better than its competitors.</li>
            <li>and although i LOVE the sun - i have to stop tanning.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more when i am out of this.</li>

            <li>Tried many....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the darker you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li>Just have to make sure you distribute evenly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Should not be more than $30 for the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Telling all my friends, better buy 2 bottles at a time.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but, the tint is so light.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many OTC self tanning lotions, but they always seem to turn my skin orange.</li>
            <li>Wish I could say more.</li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite blend of tanning lotions. ?</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>okay on the body,but not on the face....</li>
            <li>satisfied &amp; would recommend both the product and the seller</li>
            <li>Love it  but pricy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome - the only self tanner I have ever come across</li>
            <li>and it was phenomenal....</li>
            <li>Then I read an online comparison that said the Tan Physics product was actually better than the Clarins, so I ordered two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hailed as the best in the business, it is no different than all the others...</li>
            <li>Very nice, real looking, haven&#x27;t had any streaks.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t smell great at first and stayed wet for a bit longer than i&#x27;d like, but the color results were awesome.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>great product highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Tan Physics as a great tanning product when used and applied correctly.</li>
            <li>Love it no mess on your hands looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is the best, completely NO SMELL, self tanner that I have found.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good value compared to others</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50-ish woman with pretty good skin (probably because I avoid the sun), and I&#x27;m fair-skinned.  </li>
            <li>It also does not have that strong odor most self tanners do.</li>
            <li>Works great and very natural.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair Irish skin</li>
            <li>Fresh, pure, powerful and perfect.</li>
            <li>There is no horrible self tanner smell and it wears off great but the end result of the tan you get is not a very dark.</li>
            <li>This product did not stick to my legs (most important), neck, bust, or belly.</li>
            <li>Love the color and a bottle lasts for many full body applications.</li>
            <li>Also, I did make sure that I scrubbed my skin smooth before I applied it.  </li>
            <li>Was nice but do not think it was worth the $40.  </li>
            <li>It (the smell) does wear off  after 2-3 days, so if you plan for something special, keep that in mind!  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply with great, natural color -- plus the benefit of a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>the results aren&#x27;t perfect but way better for way less money.</li>
            <li>This product did have a WONDERFUL scent to it, and I didn&#x27;t end up smelling that icky smell that most self tanners have!  </li>
            <li>The color does not have that orange cast like other tanners I have tried and the best thing I found about Tan Physics is that it does not get on your clothing, bedding, or towels.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t apply easily ankles</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Washed off easily from hands.... (bar soap is the way to go with this or any self tanner by the way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not have a strong smell and it is easy to rub on.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>No odor or streaking, making application easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Also, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply ...</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Gives you just the bronze color you want and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not orange, there&#x27;s a very mild inoffensive odor, and the lotion is tinted which helps with application.</li>
            <li>I hope this is easy to grasp for those who don&#x27;t have any exposure or experience.</li>
            <li>I hope this is easy to grasp for those who don&#x27;t have any exposure or experience.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and does not look like you have applied a tan lotion.</li>
            <li>easy to apply-</li>
            <li>it blends well on the skin and doesn&#x27;t streak easily.  </li>
            <li>I do not give out 5 stars easily, but this one would have been close.</li>
            <li>And the very mild citrus smell is a plus.</li>
            <li>My legs are not shockingly white anymore but still not the most attractive either.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li>Color fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tinted so you can see where it&#x27;s applied and washes off your hands easily.</li>
            <li>Has virtually no smell to it and is supper easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Ex-foliating beforehand is strongly advised.</li>
            <li>Great color, long lasting, goes on smooth, smells great!</li>
            <li>I liked the product very much</li>
            <li>This product gives me a nice healthy glow that I can build to a light to medium tan (I&#x27;ll never be really tan)</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s my preferred tanner because (1) its a foam easier to control exactly where it goes</li>
            <li>Clean and Clear makes the film product that I use to remove the sheen from my face and its a great product for oily skin.</li>
            <li>think the color is great and if you wash your hands with soap immediately afterward you won&#x27;t have any discoloration to your palms.&lt;br /&gt;Another way to apply is to wear gloves first when applying to large body parts like your legs and torso.  </li>
            <li>It look fine</li>
            <li>For me, a touch-up every five days is fine.  </li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smooth and it easy to spread.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>color quick!</li>
            <li>Luckily i was able to return mine.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>Makes you look healthy, not fake!</li>
            <li>The color is great and the very light to almost no smell makes it worth every penny if that is a big deciding factor.  </li>
            <li>I did minimal skin prepping and am very fair skinned.</li>
            <li>and i liked the way it looked because it looked more even and natural.</li>
            <li>If not applied precisely it will streak</li>
            <li>Always remember to exfoliate before and between and to smooth out ankles, feet, knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>I am light skinned, and doesn&#x27;t turn orange</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT STAINED MY BRA&#x27;S AND LIGHT COLORED/WHITE TOPS.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and has what I would describe as a light citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>The cost is more than worth every drop.</li>
            <li>, and now I have wrinkle free, tan skin.</li>
            <li>Great Lasting color.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel ridiculously smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>Turned me orange just like the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a color of its own which helps it to go on even and really helps out.</li>
            <li>and they offer u free shipping and discounts...</li>
            <li>I have tried many sunless tanners over the years, and Famous Dave&#x27;s has been, so far, the most consisent.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product and price.  </li>
            <li>It was light goldeny orange and splotchy.</li>
            <li>Great for starting your tan before you go to the beach.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was available in a spray, not just cream.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic even on weather damaged skin.</li>
            <li>A light sheen presents which I remove with a oil control film.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using Tan Physics because it is odorless.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say it doesn&#x27;t work, it does lightly tan you each time</li>
            <li>It does not smell and it&#x27;s more golden colored instead of tan as some pictures they show.</li>
            <li>There were no streaks or uneven spots and the tanner smells delicious like an orange creamcicle</li>
            <li>/&gt;Color: it&#x27;s actually a light shade of brown instead of a shade of orange.</li>
            <li>True, True tanning color!  </li>
            <li>Works great, better than any other tanners I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I have no Clothes transfer or funny smells!!</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell and the color is very realistic!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>As always you should exfoliate first for best results and carefully wash your hands afterwards to avoid tanning the palms.&lt;br /&gt;Kelli</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always drenched in sunscreen (I always burn), but this builds a nice, realistic color on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very nice...not greasy, absorbs quickly, very easy to apply , no odor...</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite self tan item!  </li>
            <li>Tan Physics was very easy to apply and was the first time trying instant tanners in over 10 years, therefore a good pick for a newbee,....</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and I love it!</li>
            <li>The shipment I got was not even close to the color that I had originally.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it the first couple days, but I love the color after using it a week, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any significant change.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>looks natural... smells good and makes her skin soft as silk... and the tan extender is nice...</li>
            <li>However, I found this product no more impressive than the $7 bottle I can get at the store.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>but I read an online review and excitedly purchased this product.</li>
            <li>and there wasn&#x27;t a significant change in color or tone to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize some many people weren&#x27;t aware of how a non-profit organization operates.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize some many people weren&#x27;t aware of how a non-profit organization operates.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to order this stuff</li>
            <li>however this product does not make you smell like the other tanning products, and that is what was  pleasant :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many self tanners and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li>so i have tried most of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brands of self tanners, and so far this one is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>color goes on smooth and developes quickly.</li>
            <li>and it is so clean and distinctive</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and has a fresh fruity smell</li>
            <li>Easy to apply (I use disposable gloves), smells great, dries fast, and leaves a natural looking golden tan.  </li>
            <li>Product goes on very easily and looks very natural!</li>
            <li>At first, I was pleased with the results and how quickly I started to show a hint of color.  </li>
            <li>But as far as a tan, it is very nice and looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>but when you get it down the tan it leaves is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this tanner at all.</li>
            <li>This self tanner is nothing special.</li>
            <li>Not as i expected from all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I feel st. Tropez is a much better product really did not get tan from this product</li>
            <li>The ads are true.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased this item and found it to not be as good as Jergen&#x27;s that is sold at the grocery store for a third of the price.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT TAN PHYSICS LAST YEAR AND LOVED IT.</li>
            <li>Sweet citrus smell rather than the obnoxious self tanner smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using Tan Physics and find all their product claims to be true.  </li>
            <li>No smell, good color and last for about 4 to 5 days.  </li>
            <li>the overal look is natural and nice color.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I ordered it, but I really do like it.</li>
            <li>The application is super clean and the smell is great-slightly citrus.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve reflected on this and decided I really thought this would be better.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product and that I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Product does not work any better that the much cheaper versions you can buy in the drugstore.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem like the bottle was full either.</li>
            <li>I found Tan Physics True Color and bought it with no hesitation.  </li>
            <li>No streaking and no bad smell.</li>
            <li>Really like this product for sunless tanning; looks very natural even on my fair and &amp;#34;older&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love the color, scent and super soft skin after the easy application</li>
            <li>I loved that it really did look natural!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply any looks natural!!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that is is a GREAT choice</li>
            <li>(quick tan)lotion from the 70s.</li>
            <li>I used Tan Physics before a trip to Bermuda and was very impressed by the overall appearance of my skin color especially in photographs.</li>
            <li>IT DRIES QUICKLY, BUT IT STILL DIDN&#x27;T STOP IT FROM GETTING ON MY CLOTHES.</li>
            <li>Amazon bottle was older, and smelled more.</li>
            <li>Use lightly every 4 to 5 days and the color was more natural.</li>
            <li>Used on a variety of friends with many shades of pale...looked natural and smooth on all.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbs so doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
            <li>looking tan - or has SUCH a nice smooth, non-sticky feeling without an odor.  </li>
            <li>Got this quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>It cam to me quickly</li>
            <li>I wish I would have seen more realistic reviews before I bought it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essentially odor free, and goes on nice.</li>
            <li>Great product that smells good buts doesn&#x27;t give you the orange or fake looking color.</li>
            <li>Luckily it scrubbed off after a bout 2 days.</li>
            <li>after 3 times or so my legs look the same, they may say I need to use more but at 30 plus dollars a bottle how many do I need.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, very natural!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery! A+++</li>
            <li>On me this is a nice rich tan with no orange or yellow undertones after 2 applications.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this barely changes your skin tone unless you apply three quarters of the bottle on at once.</li>
            <li>Great dark brown color to the lotion</li>
            <li>No unpleasant smell at all.  </li>
            <li>It glides on easily and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>It gives my reddish, Irish complexion a beautiful color, not too orange, it also makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, as I have had two bouts of skin cancer and try not to spend that much time in the sun for a nice tan.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a very creamy texture that spreads easily on your skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, color sets fast and does not come off.  </li>
            <li>This tanner is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li>the tan would last a bit more than three days !</li>
            <li>I am an avid self-tanner and do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE IT!!</li>
            <li>When I decided to return the product, I sent an email and this company was VERY PROMPT about instructions and processing the refund-no questions asked!!  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS~ looks natural and no streaks!</li>
            <li>First product that I have used that does not make you look like an &amp;#34;umpa loompa&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>I love it, it gives a real natural looking tan, right away.  </li>
            <li>Very good, has a pleasant citrus smell at first, but that old familiar fake tan odor sneaks thru.</li>
            <li>but it does the trick, great color after 2nd application and no small at all.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and tend to have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was tan physics or some other kind of make-up.</li>
            <li>A little light, but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>I thought for $30 per bottle I would actually see some amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Would use it all year round because it makes my legs  look  great.</li>
            <li>Gives great color, but dried my skin out a bit.  </li>
            <li>waste your money with this product and its disingenuous marketing and allow me to tell you how to achieve a great lotion tan.</li>
            <li>Just left a nice even tan.</li>
            <li>IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>Nice product; low odor but still DHA like !&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>My skin tone tans to a golden brown</li>
            <li>I have had many complements on the natural color.</li>
            <li>It gives the most natural tan that I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a self-tanner....</li>
            <li>I rarely post reviews</li>
            <li>Tan Physics not only covers well but has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.</li>
            <li>More of a natural color</li>
            <li>The color is nice, not yellow</li>
            <li>I ordered directly from Tan Physics (much better pricing); and received (3) bottles within a week.  </li>
            <li>Kind of wish I had bought a bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as expected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more natural.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t have a nice thing to say about this product ..</li>
            <li>I rarely write product reviews but the amount of money and shipping I paid for this item requires action.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I went searching, landed on Mayo&#x27;s site, and read this: \\&quot;Mayo Clinic maintains a distinct separation between advertising content and editorial content.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and citrus-like.  </li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s rare</li>
            <li>I ever get a zit, but I have never had the massive reindeer nose kind.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Do I think it is worth the price?</li>
            <li>The color is the most natural that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, dries quickly, and produces a very natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>It was great to use before going on vacation when we wanted to not look so pale.</li>
            <li>It streaked and didn&#x27;t really give me significant color ..</li>
            <li>gone right away.</li>
            <li>Consumer Report was right.  </li>
            <li>The color was not believable..even after I painstakingly applied the product the right way...can you say &amp;#34;ORANGE&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I called and was told they were taking care of it right away, but have nothing.</li>
            <li>I just use it for my face and arm right now.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s simple to apply, dries quickly and the color looks natural on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>As long as u spread the liquid good snuff tan looks real.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I should have been happy with the awesome Banana Boat Deep Dark Color Self Tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used for the past year</li>
            <li>Not good for very fair complexions.</li>
            <li>No streaks, quick dry and a beautiful deep tan.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used MANY self tanners over the years and have found much better tanners for less</li>
            <li>It really does give you a true suntan just like when you lay out.</li>
            <li>Nice as long as used per directions</li>
            <li>IT works about the same as other tanners even though it was advertised as the best tanner ever…it didn’t do much for me  .</li>
            <li>No fake bake smell and soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Always natural looking and easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li>Also works quickly and dries fast.</li>
            <li>It gives you a great instant tan and for added darkness, just apply the next day.</li>
            <li>This is particularly important if you have (like me) blonde hair and a light complexion.</li>
            <li>natural look and did not rub or wash off easily</li>
            <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li>The color is very natural which is extremely important to me.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural and it goes on smooth with no streaks.  </li>
            <li>only thing I didn&#x27;t see available was the application mit&#x27;s, I found those to be very useful, and also reduced the unwanted coloring of fingernails &amp; palms.</li>
            <li>Very real looking color, not orange, and no smell</li>
            <li>Definitely have to be very light with this stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is a very real looking tan</li>
            <li>And it dries very fast.  </li>
            <li>By far the most natural looking color!!</li>
            <li>Last a longer time than most I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li>so you can see exactly where you&#x27;re applying.  </li>
            <li>Did not find this product to be any better than the same product from Avon at 4.98,  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it with my fingers and didn&#x27;t like the look.</li>
            <li>at first.  </li>
            <li>I get a lot of complements on my color after the first application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I used product like this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even one star is too much for this product!</li>
            <li>They stink and slightly on more orange side... but definitely get you tanner</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what it says, odorless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several self tanners that are much better than this.  </li>
            <li>amazon is charging way more for it thru 3rd party sellers...</li>
            <li>I have not used this on my face, only mostly on my legs, sometimes arms and neck.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>It lasts well, fades evenly, does not rub off, does not have that distinctive odor that tanning creams have, and makes a very even golden tan.</li>
            <li>This is the first sunless tanner I have used that does NOT break my skin out.  </li>
            <li>Looks real and does not streak!  </li>
            <li>Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>It smells like a mix between cleaners and pee-- hot pee.</li>
            <li>you really have to keep rubbing in the lotion in until it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Does not last more than 1 day/</li>
            <li>That is the first impression my girlfriend had</li>
            <li>I just make sure I only use it at bedtime.</li>
            <li>First learned about it on one of the national morning shows.</li>
            <li>There is another brand I like better, get quicker results with longer lasting results.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have any funny smell either.</li>
            <li>I bought a second bottle:)</li>
            <li>this product actually does look like an authentic suntan, rather than an applied self tanner ..</li>
            <li>I went to work the next day and was asked many times :</li>
            <li>Also only smells okay at first...</li>
            <li>Like most veteran Prime Amazonians</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of applying a moisturizer first and should not have done that (blotchy).  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what it did.</li>
            <li>Pro: The product really works!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only used it on my legs.</li>
            <li>I have light olive skin and got a slight orange tint is all, not a tan by any means and it is just as streaky as most of the others.</li>
            <li>After 4 (yes FOUR) applications to the same spot, my skin color has changed exactly ZERO%!!!</li>
            <li>With all the conditioners and special ingredients, it also made my skin feel very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Product goes on easily but you can barely see the color.  </li>
            <li>The color is nice and I like that it dries without much of a tacky/sticky feeling, however, I had to do several applications to get a decent tan.</li>
            <li>: It goes on like a normal moisturizer and dries as quickly too.</li>
            <li>I simply state that I went to the trouble to apply it exactly as they said and the results have been very good.</li>
            <li>Moles and other skin markings, by the way, will also be &#x27;tanned&#x27; and get darker but this can be controlled with a damp tissue or Q-Tip handy to wipe these areas immediately.  </li>
            <li>Although I liked the product &amp; the results of self tanning, I would have to say I would not purchase it again due to the cost &amp; size.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice, unlike other stinky tanning products.  </li>
            <li>It can sit in your cupboard or on the shelves at a store for ever and still gives you an amazing natural color and instantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 yrs old and finally have a nice tanned appearance.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most natural and easiest to apply.</li>
            <li>Absolute waste of good money.</li>
            <li>Tan Physics turned me streaky orange and it has a strong odor - the exact opposite of what they claim.</li>
            <li>However, the color never really developed, no matter how many days in row I applied.</li>
            <li>That is pretty much it.</li>
            <li>and she was upset with me at first because she knows I&#x27;m not supposed to be out in the sun that much.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell like some of the comments.  </li>
            <li>Nice dark color</li>
            <li>Jergens is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>It was spendy, but goes on very smoothly and looks dark right away - lasts a while also.</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful putting this on, as it streaks very easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, tinted (so you can tell where&#x27;s it&#x27;s been applied and even over applied) and has no initial smell.</li>
            <li>If you want it darker, it is easier to do a second application but not so easy to reverse the process.  </li>
            <li>I then dry with a paper towel to be sure all color is off hands.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions on their website, exfoliating and shaving my legs before application, then making sure my skin was totally dry.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>Be smart, and forget this product.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty realistic..  </li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing a self tanner and it seems to be working out fairly decent.</li>
            <li>The product is a little pricey, no doubt, but I can&#x27;t honestly let that affect my rating as it works so well</li>
            <li>Im a redhead and used this and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It looks real and works well.</li>
            <li>Absolute satisfaction 👍</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it much.  </li>
            <li>I really like the color this tanner gives me.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>It works as it says it will and keeps me from having to spend too much time in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>BIOLOGY ALL-IN-ONE LIQUID FACELIFT&amp;#34; gently dabbed on twice a day and organic aloe is a must..</li>
            <li>I have talked to darker skin people that use this product and they really like it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very even no streaking.  </li>
            <li>Too much tint.</li>
            <li>For $40 I really thought this would have some staying power.</li>
            <li>just started using it, have applied it 3 times, don&#x27;t see much of a change yet,</li>
            <li>but I can tell you even after washing and scrubbing my hands they are still stained, I really don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>paid way too much</li>
            <li>but if you use too much skin becomes orange.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 3 weeks straight</li>
            <li>One bottle lasted me a whole season.  </li>
            <li>It had very little&lt;br /&gt;color.  </li>
            <li>VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I did really want to try Tan Physics, but for now I am going to pass.  </li>
            <li>I use it very sparingly.....</li>
            <li>I purchased this hoping I could have color fast.</li>
            <li>Works really well and has no odor.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This is the biggest rip-off I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Looks like a real tan without the sun spots and cancer.</li>
            <li>and I was really disaapointed considering the price I payed for it</li>
            <li>Really works well with no orange tinit</li>
            <li>Fades too fast.</li>
            <li>most I think just feel it is expected</li>
            <li>and she now wants to use it too.</li>
            <li>I find that it works really well</li>
            <li>It did not give me a tan as much as I paid for it</li>
            <li>Goes on with no streaking and looks like a real tan</li>
            <li>Turned orange  very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this product again - unless I could find it at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended!</li>
            <li>it looks so real.</li>
            <li>Also, the color is orangish, and you need 2 applications to really see the difference.</li>
            <li>Does not turn you orange either, just a very &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; glow.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Something that seems to help is after washing the palm of my hands I put lotion on the palm of my hands which prevents the tanning lotion from absorbing into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Apply a normal skin lotion first.</li>
            <li>Our clinicians are standing by and always ready to help (whether you are a customer or not) answer and questions you might have about skin care and anti-aging.</li>
            <li>I have been an amazon prime member for years and buy absolutely everything on amazon but never leave reviews.</li>
            <li>And, even though I was very reluctant to put it on my face, I gave it a try</li>
            <li>It really does not work that</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s me, however i find myself not using it much because i don&#x27;t want to smell that  odor at night.  </li>
            <li>When you sniff the product in the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
            <li>I have applied it for three days straight and don&#x27;t have much color.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship</li>
            <li>so I have to have a product that looks real.</li>
            <li>Looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li>I had to apply a very generous amount in order to get some color.</li>
            <li>like real sun shine...</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and you can begin to see the color change almost immediately on your skin; especially on your legs.  </li>
            <li>Fast turn around.  </li>
            <li>TOO MUCH MONEY FOR AMOUNT OF PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Even though I rubbed it in very well it still streaked on my legs.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a very timely manner as well</li>
            <li>Jergen&#x27;s natural glow worked better and it&#x27;s only $7 per bottle.  </li>
            <li>and it is a gentle, mildly golden tan that is even and natural looking.</li>
            <li>No smell, good color, lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li>Because it does dry quickly, you have to apply it quickly and wash your hands immediately.</li>
            <li>Not sure why majority of previous customers do not like this product, I find it to be the best sunless tanner on the market.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to use this product and have a tan without sun bathing, but it still gave an orange appearance like other sunless tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I live in hot humid Florida.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, no odor, dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than any other tanning cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It does smell better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Better than all the other spray on tanners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Tan Physics works for me, I find that it doesn&#x27;t leave the orange glow &amp; applies evenly, feel confident about using it with out other knowing the difference.</li>
            <li>yes it did, I have gone back to my original brand</li>
            <li>Lives up to its hype of no lingering smell and no streaking unlike many other tanning products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I got a deep rich tan from this product.  </li>
            <li>I did not like it--it had an odor like any other sunless tanning lotion--it also had streaks---not worth the money if it is the real thing--nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>so I can only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I think the more coats you put on the less real it looks.</li>
            <li>It does not streak at all, and has a very slight odor (as opposed to others I&#x27;ve used with a very strong odor).</li>
            <li>Even though is cost more than most others, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many self tanners and hands down</li>
            <li>You can get same kind of tan with other products out there that don&#x27;t cost so much</li>
            <li>It is better; however, it still gives a slight orange appearance.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there for less money.</li>
            <li>It is half the price with shipping and the results are better in my opinion..</li>
            <li>i looked like i had orange dirt on my legs and black pores, and it streaked on top of all that.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it dried nearly immediately and has virtually no odor.</li>
            <li>This produces a realistic tan and doesn&#x27;t smell offensive.</li>
            <li>I took the time to leave this one because I&#x27;m a 32 year-old female who always felt like she needed to tan outside or in tanning booths in order to look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>good nice base coloring</li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth with a little color right away</li>
            <li>I bought this in a moment of frustration with ALL the tanners (every single brand available off the shelf)</li>
            <li>I had color after the very 1st application, and looked natural!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone that doesn&#x27;t like to lay in the sun or tan.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Granted, my hopes for a sunless tanner that didn&#x27;t streak, wasn&#x27;t orange and didn&#x27;t make you smell like dirt weren&#x27;t too high.....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>took a chance on Tan Physics and would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Worked for 10 years in the cosmetic industry and sold high end brand names (including self tanners).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;High quality tanners perform at their peak levels when used as soon as they are blended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I researched and found this one to be highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I used it for 5 days prior to trip-- natural, golden, medium tan!  </li>
            <li>No bad smell that lingers aswith other brands, and looks like a real tan!  </li>
            <li>this by far is number one!!</li>
            <li>After my husband has several basil cell carcinomas removed, I became Leary of trying to get that pretty summer tan!</li>
            <li>: If you are sensitive to smell, then you need to know that this DOES have a slight smell to it, (as all sunless products seem to) and it is strong the first night, noticeably in bed, when i was going to sleep.  </li>
            <li>its so natural looking and very very little odour of any kind...</li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need to purchase the exfoliating and extending lotions to achieve the natural look.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but avoids skin cancer which I have experienced.</li>
            <li>Great self tanner &amp; doesnt leave you with that fake bake smell.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, can see where applied to get an even natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>However it works very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li>fast looks natural.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the browning color left on palms even after washing.</li>
            <li>I even used it a few times to make sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok except the smell after you have it on a few hours.</li>
            <li>SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]]</li>
            <li>Other tanners are so greasy you can never tell when you&#x27;re dry enough not to streak, but this stuff just feels velvety and dry but smooth like a good cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on faint and turns out very nice.  </li>
            <li>Has to be applied 2-3 times in order to achieve other than a light tan but lasts well.</li>
            <li>buy a cheap Buff Puff at the grocery store and exfoliate once and while due to</li>
            <li>and I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I read Q&#x27;s and A&#x27;s and compare pricing before purchasing a new product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dark right away, but since I&#x27;m pretty fair, I actually prefer that, so I don&#x27;t look fake.  </li>
            <li>Does dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>User Beware, if you are going to use this, keep it strictly to your arms, and legs, but keep it far, far, FAR away from your face!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried every brand; and when used sparingly and as directed, this one beats all, wih no streaks, a true, warm shade of tan, and the least odor of any other brand I have purchased.</li>
            <li>color is very natural.  </li>
            <li>The color looks very natural and there is no odor.</li>
            <li>The color was very natural looking.</li>
            <li>(I even use it on my face and I have very sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>A very natural looking product.</li>
            <li>Very naturally looking tone</li>
            <li>This is very natural looking with no</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Very Natural.</li>
            <li>A single layer goes on pretty light, which is frustrating if you&#x27;re just thinking bang for your buck, but it makes the tan look more natural</li>
            <li>it gives a very natural looking color, it also fades after a few days without becoming orange or patchy.</li>
            <li>It has a funny smell and the color didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I have checked the bottles and there is no indication that one has an indication of color (dark, medium, light).  </li>
            <li>In fact it looks like a natural tan!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other tanning products and I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li>It looks really natural!</li>
            <li>first thing that should&#x27;ve set off red flags was their website.</li>
            <li>Interested in Tan Physics Sunless Tanner after reading an AOL&#x27;s rave news review, I came to Amazon shortly after skimming through the Official Web Site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All self-tan products use exactly the same ingredient -- dihydroxyacetone (DHA)!  </li>
            <li>It would be preferable if they made, like the walmart brands and clarins and St Tropez, a light tanner and a dark tanner....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of running around looking pale, this is one of the best ways to get fairly natural looking color ...</li>
            <li>The color that develops is natural (even on my very fair skin) and the tanner smell that develops is very very faint.</li>
            <li>I live near the coast</li>
            <li>This gives just enough color to let me enjoy going out in shorts after a LONG winter.  </li>
            <li>but I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t come in light skin med skin or dark skim.</li>
            <li>The product certainly colors the skin; however the result looks like any other tanning product on the market and the price is significantly higher.  </li>
            <li>It turned my skin a little orange and didn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>ordering direct from tan physics is the only real option....</li>
            <li>BE CAREFUL IF YOU&#x27;RE WEARING WHITE OR LIGHT COLORED CLOTHES.</li>
            <li>All advertising content on Mayo Clinic&#x27;s health information website or in one of our newsletters is clearly labeled as an advertisement\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not like the old orange sunless tan lotions</li>
            <li>Natural tan.  </li>
            <li>Natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Natural glow.  </li>
            <li>The color is almost instantaneous and about as natural as your going to get with one of these products.  </li>
            <li>It far exceeded.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural.</li>
            <li>Everyone that has seen me thinks my tan is natural.</li>
            <li>Gives you a natural look.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, avoided ankle, knee and elbow areas directly and washed my hands after each application.  </li>
            <li>did some on line research and found this product for my girlfriend... got it directly on line from tan physics website...</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend to shake the bottle VERY well before using.  </li>
            <li>and WOW this goes on just like lotion</li>
            <li>Before I completed this latest order, I read the reviews and noticed a number of negative ones.</li>
            <li>It does work on my old skin.</li>
            <li>Absolutely none of it rubbed off on my white sheets and has no smell after its applied.</li>
            <li>and it does go on smoothly, lasts a few days</li>
            <li>Gives natural color, except on toes.  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat of a process and perhaps why so many posted negative comments if they did not apply correctly.</li>
            <li>was that I had gotten this tan naturally in the sun</li>
            <li>I bought it because it&#x27;s supposed to be more natural, but it&#x27;s a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li>The color looks even and natural, &amp;#34;not orange&amp;#34; even on the face.  </li>
            <li>does what it claims, Looks natural no streaking.</li>
            <li>I can actually skip tanning for awhile and it looks like a real tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I stopped using it completely, and I&#x27;ve never had that problem again.</li>
            <li>And my co-workers were amazed that it was a sunless tan and that it looked so natural.</li>
            <li>The look I get is surprisingly natural.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by some unsatisfied customer complaints, but it was an unanswered question as to why Amazon is charging twenty dollars more per bottle than the actual cost on Tan Physics official website which prompted me to investigate further.  </li>
            <li>That is what we can guarantee when we ship directly to you from our lab.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and have used it twice so far...</li>
            <li>this is for unblemished young skin.</li>
            <li>It gives an even, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>The color truly looks natural.</li>
            <li>A co-worker commented on how natural it looks.  </li>
            <li>but the color looks natural</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like natural tan.</li>
            <li>Goes on even and natural looking</li>
            <li>I had really hoped for a tanning product (especially given the price) that wouldn&#x27;t give me that orange look you often see from a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Good but too expensive.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it!  </li>
            <li>but my main thing I like is that its ingredients are better, not all the bad for you chemicals such as most store brands.</li>
            <li>Everybody always seems quick to throw out negative reviews in general no matter what the product, but less likely to make positive ones even when clearly appropriate.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and has a slight bronzer</li>
            <li>The ingredients in Fake Bake work with each individual person&#x27;s pigment to achieve color results that fit you, therefore the overall results seem more natural.  </li>
            <li>Smelled better when you first put it on but as soon as you start to sweat or put your clothes on, it started to have that weird smell.</li>
            <li>The first application I looked like I had been in the sun for several days; you&#x27;ll see instant results.</li>
            <li>Actually purchased a second bottle since the first was confiscated at airport security.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and will never go back to using anything else again.</li>
            <li>Have tried many of these sunless tanners (I am very pale and prefer to not expose my skin to the sun!)  </li>
            <li>It works very well but very expensive,  good for your face but too expensive to apply to the whole body, it only takes about 3 applications to the face for nice color and then after every-other day.  </li>
            <li>I have since read some reviews about Fake Bake and just started this product about one week ago which I am very pleased with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell for the line that Mayo Clinic endorsed this lotion and am now taking some of my very precious time to disclose that this product is useless.</li>
            <li>I ordered this due to the advertisement in a magazine I read and it gave this product the highest credit for even tanning, no streaks and not a yellow tone  like all the others and a true tan affect.  </li>
            <li>So - I&#x27;ve tried a few different self tanners and recently got Tan Physics - and i love it.  </li>
            <li>no dark spots</li>
            <li>Apply daily to get a rich dark tan.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the face but its just like all the others  not fantastic results as it says</li>
            <li>It astonished me, since my previous experience had been so positive (that&#x27;s why I ordered it again this time, despite its high price).</li>
            <li>Not a single hint of a color change to my skin, nothing, zilch, zero, nada!!!</li>
            <li>Everyone thinks I just came back from sunny vacation (I live in the North).  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product and goes on so smooth and even, it would get five stars but the price is crazy.  </li>
            <li>Great subtle, buildable color and the lotion doesn&#x27;t have a heavy metallic smell on your skin after just a short time.  </li>
            <li>Barely any odor!  </li>
            <li>I have no other options now - skin cancer is costing me a fortune</li>
            <li>Such a natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super pale.</li>
            <li>After using for 1 week I didn&#x27;t notice much color and my skin became very dry.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so my first bottle lasted me about 3 months (much cheaper than a tanning place)</li>
            <li>in this world, generally you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Its fast and no streaks, the only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li>NATURAL LOOKING, LIKE YOU JUST GOT BACK FROM THE ISLANDS.  </li>
            <li>barely tans.</li>
            <li>I apply this with a brush I received with a Bare Minerals product.  </li>
            <li>go to thetan physics website and start your order and then back out or dont complete</li>
            <li>It will streak if a person is not careful in the application.</li>
            <li>I paid the exorbitant amount for such a product with their claims of no streaking and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Still have to be careful about how much is applied at one time.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it.</li>
            <li>Color i barely got color from it.  </li>
            <li>It barely gives you any color no matter how often you apply it.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous self-tanners over the years and this surpasses any that I&#x27;ve used thus far.  </li>
            <li>, I copied the following statements verbatim for you directly from Tan Physics Official website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ordering directly through this page is the ONLY way to purchase Tan Physics.</li>
            <li>I used it over several days to build a natural looking tan before I went on vacation.  </li>
            <li>You could barely tell it worked at all.</li>
            <li>but it barely gives me any color results.  </li>
            <li>However, I desire to have somewhat of a tan, don&#x27;t have to be golden dark brown, just don&#x27;t want to go around as white as a sheet!</li>
            <li>It does add a nice color to my visage without a fake appearance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found much better results with Victoria&#x27;s Secret self tanner, which I have bought in-store for under $15.</li>
            <li>Product smells nice and gives instant color but turns skin blotchy and uneven after you shower and reapply a few times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a very natural looking color and does not have that fake tan smell that so many products have.</li>
            <li>Better than other self tanners I have purchase or tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking color (not orange) with no streaks or strange discoloration of knees and elbows and no stinky smell.</li>
            <li>Yes it does tan you a lot faster than other self tanners but who wants a streaky tan.</li>
            <li>I am a white female 59 years old.</li>
            <li>This is not worth it, any drugstore brand will work the same for 1/3 the cost, this product is all hype, all spawned by internet advertisements, the real truth is unless you are whiter than a ghost you will not tan at all using this!</li>
            <li>No other  sunless tanner I&#x27;ve tried gives a totally &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no more expensive than Clarins, which works well, but this dries more quickly and gives a more natural looking tan without any weird odor.</li>
            <li>No strange odor.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently for a few days.  </li>
            <li>but I felt compelled on this one because I was SOOOO excited when I heard of this product and really wanted it to be my &amp;#34;silver bullet&amp;#34; for fake tan since I am prone to skin cancer</li>
            <li>hardly any smell, and tans up quick.</li>
            <li>smells great dose not work well on a white girl like me :(</li>
            <li>Slight odor goes away fast.</li>
            <li>reference, I am naturally a medium/fair redhead with combination skin tone (dry patches and get pimples if I use an oily product).</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to wait long to have an instant natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>So after reading the numerous reviews - mostly &amp;#34;not so good&amp;#34; to a few &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34;, I think I am going to stick with what I have been using for the past 2 years</li>
            <li>I am back to my Jergens Glow and can purchase four of them for less than one mod the TP.  </li>
            <li>put it on my pale white skin, including my face, using only two fingers to rub it in at first.  </li>
            <li>My skin is older and I know some dark spots will show.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth the high price.  </li>
            <li>It has only been about one week, so it may be a little early to tell, but I am already seeing a shade of tan that is closer to how I naturally tan from the sun.  </li>

            <li> NICE, EVEN COLOR.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product.  </li>
            <li> I can get a nice tan hue in one application....</li>
            <li> so putting on evenly causes you to hafta do it in two coats to make sure there is no streaking but was a good tan color, no orange to it at all.  </li>
            <li> Legs look nice and tan.  </li>
            <li> I must admit it didn&#x27;t work as I would have liked it too -</li>
            <li> i liked the bronze look, but i had to use it about every three days to keep the color.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best!  </li>
            <li> Smells good too : )</li>
            <li> It spreads on evenly and a nice color.</li>
            <li> nice smell</li>
            <li> Nice shade after just one application.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a nice brown tan either....</li>
            <li> this really is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Nice color, not Orange.  </li>
            <li> The tanner gives nice color but still has the awflul smell after applying.....  </li>
            <li> I liked it.  </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it did not have an adverse ordor.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked it to add a deeper color in a shorter time.</li>

            <li> The smell is kind of pineapple-y I guess?</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; feels great, but I&#x27;m not seeing much color change.</li>
            <li> This tanner is not for this kind of climate.  </li>
            <li> Produces a very nice tan and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the product,; great color, easy to use.</li>

            <li> im a senior with such a wonderful colour on my face &amp; neck without the lines ..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> You have to exfoliate and make sure it&#x27;s we&#x27;ll blended around joints.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find it any better then</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve used MANY over the years and this one worked ok but cost Much more than most (like 4X).  </li>
            <li> They have paid enormous amounts in advertising so that you will think that this is the best, newest innovation in self tanning..which it is NOT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced it worked any better than some of the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I do love the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> If I had time to apply for about a month ahead of time I might like it better.</li>
            <li> It does have some odor, as with most tanners.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off with a tinted lotion or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But many applications to the body for color and</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>

            <li> I love this tanner.</li>
            <li> Just got two more bottles.</li>
            <li> You should have a hand mirror to look at places you can&#x27;t see and if you see blotches...just rub it in more.</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> and we got a way better product... and a tan extender...</li>

            <li> I knew better had I reflected.</li>
            <li> I ordered online through the Tan Physics website, after reading more reviews I decided to cancel.</li>

            <li> I have really been blessed, and have great skin</li>
            <li> So I stopped using it, and my face went back to perfect complexion.</li>
            <li> Tried many....</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash off your hands and in between your fingers after you put it on.</li>
            <li> was my favorite hobby ..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff no orange</li>
            <li> I was skeptic when I first bought this but very happy after my first application.</li>
            <li> It was better than anything else I ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Just okay.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>

            <li> The more you use it, the darker you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li> Just have to make sure you distribute evenly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Should not be more than $30 for the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Telling all my friends, better buy 2 bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but, the tint is so light.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many OTC self tanning lotions, but they always seem to turn my skin orange.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say more.</li>
            <li> i love it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite blend of tanning lotions. ?</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> okay on the body,but not on the face....</li>
            <li> satisfied &amp; would recommend both the product and the seller</li>
            <li> Love it  but pricy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome - the only self tanner I have ever come across</li>
            <li> and it was phenomenal....</li>
            <li> Then I read an online comparison that said the Tan Physics product was actually better than the Clarins, so I ordered two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hailed as the best in the business, it is no different than all the others...</li>
            <li> Very nice, real looking, haven&#x27;t had any streaks.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t smell great at first and stayed wet for a bit longer than i&#x27;d like, but the color results were awesome.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> great product highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Tan Physics as a great tanning product when used and applied correctly.</li>
            <li> Love it no mess on your hands looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is the best, completely NO SMELL, self tanner that I have found.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good value compared to others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50-ish woman with pretty good skin (probably because I avoid the sun), and I&#x27;m fair-skinned.  </li>
            <li> It also does not have that strong odor most self tanners do.</li>
            <li> Works great and very natural.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair Irish skin</li>
            <li> Fresh, pure, powerful and perfect.</li>
            <li> There is no horrible self tanner smell and it wears off great but the end result of the tan you get is not a very dark.</li>
            <li> This product did not stick to my legs (most important), neck, bust, or belly.</li>
            <li> Love the color and a bottle lasts for many full body applications.</li>
            <li> Also, I did make sure that I scrubbed my skin smooth before I applied it.  </li>
            <li> Was nice but do not think it was worth the $40.  </li>
            <li> It (the smell) does wear off  after 2-3 days, so if you plan for something special, keep that in mind!  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply with great, natural color -- plus the benefit of a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> the results aren&#x27;t perfect but way better for way less money.</li>
            <li> This product did have a WONDERFUL scent to it, and I didn&#x27;t end up smelling that icky smell that most self tanners have!  </li>
            <li> The color does not have that orange cast like other tanners I have tried and the best thing I found about Tan Physics is that it does not get on your clothing, bedding, or towels.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t apply easily ankles</li>
            <li> It is easy to put on.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Washed off easily from hands.... (bar soap is the way to go with this or any self tanner by the way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not have a strong smell and it is easy to rub on.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> No odor or streaking, making application easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Also, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply ...</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Gives you just the bronze color you want and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not orange, there&#x27;s a very mild inoffensive odor, and the lotion is tinted which helps with application.</li>
            <li> I hope this is easy to grasp for those who don&#x27;t have any exposure or experience.</li>
            <li> I hope this is easy to grasp for those who don&#x27;t have any exposure or experience.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and does not look like you have applied a tan lotion.</li>
            <li> easy to apply-</li>
            <li> it blends well on the skin and doesn&#x27;t streak easily.  </li>
            <li> I do not give out 5 stars easily, but this one would have been close.</li>
            <li> And the very mild citrus smell is a plus.</li>
            <li> My legs are not shockingly white anymore but still not the most attractive either.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Color fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tinted so you can see where it&#x27;s applied and washes off your hands easily.</li>
            <li> Has virtually no smell to it and is supper easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Ex-foliating beforehand is strongly advised.</li>
            <li> Great color, long lasting, goes on smooth, smells great!</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much</li>
            <li> This product gives me a nice healthy glow that I can build to a light to medium tan (I&#x27;ll never be really tan)</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s my preferred tanner because (1) its a foam easier to control exactly where it goes</li>
            <li> Clean and Clear makes the film product that I use to remove the sheen from my face and its a great product for oily skin.</li>
            <li> think the color is great and if you wash your hands with soap immediately afterward you won&#x27;t have any discoloration to your palms.&lt;br /&gt;Another way to apply is to wear gloves first when applying to large body parts like your legs and torso.  </li>
            <li> It look fine</li>
            <li> For me, a touch-up every five days is fine.  </li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smooth and it easy to spread.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> color quick!</li>
            <li> Luckily i was able to return mine.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Makes you look healthy, not fake!</li>
            <li> The color is great and the very light to almost no smell makes it worth every penny if that is a big deciding factor.  </li>
            <li> I did minimal skin prepping and am very fair skinned.</li>
            <li> and i liked the way it looked because it looked more even and natural.</li>
            <li> If not applied precisely it will streak</li>
            <li> Always remember to exfoliate before and between and to smooth out ankles, feet, knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> I am light skinned, and doesn&#x27;t turn orange</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT STAINED MY BRA&#x27;S AND LIGHT COLORED/WHITE TOPS.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and has what I would describe as a light citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> The cost is more than worth every drop.</li>
            <li> , and now I have wrinkle free, tan skin.</li>
            <li> Great Lasting color.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel ridiculously smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> Turned me orange just like the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a color of its own which helps it to go on even and really helps out.</li>
            <li> and they offer u free shipping and discounts...</li>
            <li> I have tried many sunless tanners over the years, and Famous Dave&#x27;s has been, so far, the most consisent.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product and price.  </li>
            <li> It was light goldeny orange and splotchy.</li>
            <li> Great for starting your tan before you go to the beach.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was available in a spray, not just cream.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic even on weather damaged skin.</li>
            <li> A light sheen presents which I remove with a oil control film.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using Tan Physics because it is odorless.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say it doesn&#x27;t work, it does lightly tan you each time</li>
            <li> It does not smell and it&#x27;s more golden colored instead of tan as some pictures they show.</li>
            <li> There were no streaks or uneven spots and the tanner smells delicious like an orange creamcicle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Color: it&#x27;s actually a light shade of brown instead of a shade of orange.</li>
            <li> True, True tanning color!  </li>
            <li> Works great, better than any other tanners I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> I have no Clothes transfer or funny smells!!</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell and the color is very realistic!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> As always you should exfoliate first for best results and carefully wash your hands afterwards to avoid tanning the palms.&lt;br /&gt;Kelli</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always drenched in sunscreen (I always burn), but this builds a nice, realistic color on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very nice...not greasy, absorbs quickly, very easy to apply , no odor...</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite self tan item!  </li>
            <li> Tan Physics was very easy to apply and was the first time trying instant tanners in over 10 years, therefore a good pick for a newbee,....</li>
            <li> It looks very natural and I love it!</li>
            <li> The shipment I got was not even close to the color that I had originally.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it the first couple days, but I love the color after using it a week, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any significant change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> looks natural... smells good and makes her skin soft as silk... and the tan extender is nice...</li>
            <li> However, I found this product no more impressive than the $7 bottle I can get at the store.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> but I read an online review and excitedly purchased this product.</li>
            <li> and there wasn&#x27;t a significant change in color or tone to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize some many people weren&#x27;t aware of how a non-profit organization operates.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize some many people weren&#x27;t aware of how a non-profit organization operates.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this stuff</li>
            <li> however this product does not make you smell like the other tanning products, and that is what was  pleasant :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many self tanners and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li> so i have tried most of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brands of self tanners, and so far this one is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> color goes on smooth and developes quickly.</li>
            <li> and it is so clean and distinctive</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and has a fresh fruity smell</li>
            <li> Easy to apply (I use disposable gloves), smells great, dries fast, and leaves a natural looking golden tan.  </li>
            <li> Product goes on very easily and looks very natural!</li>
            <li> At first, I was pleased with the results and how quickly I started to show a hint of color.  </li>
            <li> But as far as a tan, it is very nice and looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> but when you get it down the tan it leaves is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this tanner at all.</li>
            <li> This self tanner is nothing special.</li>
            <li> Not as i expected from all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> I feel st. Tropez is a much better product really did not get tan from this product</li>
            <li> The ads are true.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this item and found it to not be as good as Jergen&#x27;s that is sold at the grocery store for a third of the price.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT TAN PHYSICS LAST YEAR AND LOVED IT.</li>
            <li> Sweet citrus smell rather than the obnoxious self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using Tan Physics and find all their product claims to be true.  </li>
            <li> No smell, good color and last for about 4 to 5 days.  </li>
            <li> the overal look is natural and nice color.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I ordered it, but I really do like it.</li>
            <li> The application is super clean and the smell is great-slightly citrus.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reflected on this and decided I really thought this would be better.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product and that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Product does not work any better that the much cheaper versions you can buy in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem like the bottle was full either.</li>
            <li> I found Tan Physics True Color and bought it with no hesitation.  </li>
            <li> No streaking and no bad smell.</li>
            <li> Really like this product for sunless tanning; looks very natural even on my fair and &amp;#34;older&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love the color, scent and super soft skin after the easy application</li>
            <li> I loved that it really did look natural!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply any looks natural!!!!</li>
            <li> Other than that is is a GREAT choice</li>
            <li> (quick tan)lotion from the 70s.</li>
            <li> I used Tan Physics before a trip to Bermuda and was very impressed by the overall appearance of my skin color especially in photographs.</li>
            <li> IT DRIES QUICKLY, BUT IT STILL DIDN&#x27;T STOP IT FROM GETTING ON MY CLOTHES.</li>
            <li> Amazon bottle was older, and smelled more.</li>
            <li> Use lightly every 4 to 5 days and the color was more natural.</li>
            <li> Used on a variety of friends with many shades of pale...looked natural and smooth on all.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbs so doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
            <li> looking tan - or has SUCH a nice smooth, non-sticky feeling without an odor.  </li>
            <li> Got this quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> It cam to me quickly</li>
            <li> I wish I would have seen more realistic reviews before I bought it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially odor free, and goes on nice.</li>
            <li> Great product that smells good buts doesn&#x27;t give you the orange or fake looking color.</li>
            <li> Luckily it scrubbed off after a bout 2 days.</li>
            <li> after 3 times or so my legs look the same, they may say I need to use more but at 30 plus dollars a bottle how many do I need.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, very natural!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery! A+++</li>
            <li> On me this is a nice rich tan with no orange or yellow undertones after 2 applications.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, this barely changes your skin tone unless you apply three quarters of the bottle on at once.</li>
            <li> Great dark brown color to the lotion</li>
            <li> No unpleasant smell at all.  </li>
            <li> It glides on easily and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> It gives my reddish, Irish complexion a beautiful color, not too orange, it also makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, as I have had two bouts of skin cancer and try not to spend that much time in the sun for a nice tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very creamy texture that spreads easily on your skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, color sets fast and does not come off.  </li>
            <li> This tanner is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li> the tan would last a bit more than three days !</li>
            <li> I am an avid self-tanner and do not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE IT!!</li>
            <li> When I decided to return the product, I sent an email and this company was VERY PROMPT about instructions and processing the refund-no questions asked!!  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS~ looks natural and no streaks!</li>
            <li> First product that I have used that does not make you look like an &amp;#34;umpa loompa&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I love it, it gives a real natural looking tan, right away.  </li>
            <li> Very good, has a pleasant citrus smell at first, but that old familiar fake tan odor sneaks thru.</li>
            <li> but it does the trick, great color after 2nd application and no small at all.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and tend to have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was tan physics or some other kind of make-up.</li>
            <li> A little light, but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> I thought for $30 per bottle I would actually see some amazing results.  </li>
            <li> Would use it all year round because it makes my legs  look  great.</li>
            <li> Gives great color, but dried my skin out a bit.  </li>
            <li> waste your money with this product and its disingenuous marketing and allow me to tell you how to achieve a great lotion tan.</li>
            <li> Just left a nice even tan.</li>
            <li> IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Nice product; low odor but still DHA like !&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> My skin tone tans to a golden brown</li>
            <li> I have had many complements on the natural color.</li>
            <li> It gives the most natural tan that I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a self-tanner....</li>
            <li> I rarely post reviews</li>
            <li> Tan Physics not only covers well but has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> More of a natural color</li>
            <li> The color is nice, not yellow</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from Tan Physics (much better pricing); and received (3) bottles within a week.  </li>
            <li> Kind of wish I had bought a bigger bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more natural.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t have a nice thing to say about this product ..</li>
            <li> I rarely write product reviews but the amount of money and shipping I paid for this item requires action.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I went searching, landed on Mayo&#x27;s site, and read this: \\&quot;Mayo Clinic maintains a distinct separation between advertising content and editorial content.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and citrus-like.  </li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s rare</li>
            <li> I ever get a zit, but I have never had the massive reindeer nose kind.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Do I think it is worth the price?</li>
            <li> The color is the most natural that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, dries quickly, and produces a very natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> It was great to use before going on vacation when we wanted to not look so pale.</li>
            <li> It streaked and didn&#x27;t really give me significant color ..</li>
            <li> gone right away.</li>
            <li> Consumer Report was right.  </li>
            <li> The color was not believable..even after I painstakingly applied the product the right way...can you say &amp;#34;ORANGE&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I called and was told they were taking care of it right away, but have nothing.</li>
            <li> I just use it for my face and arm right now.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s simple to apply, dries quickly and the color looks natural on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> As long as u spread the liquid good snuff tan looks real.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I should have been happy with the awesome Banana Boat Deep Dark Color Self Tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used for the past year</li>
            <li> Not good for very fair complexions.</li>
            <li> No streaks, quick dry and a beautiful deep tan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MANY self tanners over the years and have found much better tanners for less</li>
            <li> It really does give you a true suntan just like when you lay out.</li>
            <li> Nice as long as used per directions</li>
            <li> IT works about the same as other tanners even though it was advertised as the best tanner ever…it didn’t do much for me  .</li>
            <li> No fake bake smell and soaks right in.</li>
            <li> Always natural looking and easy to apply and blend.</li>
            <li> Also works quickly and dries fast.</li>
            <li> It gives you a great instant tan and for added darkness, just apply the next day.</li>
            <li> This is particularly important if you have (like me) blonde hair and a light complexion.</li>
            <li> natural look and did not rub or wash off easily</li>
            <li> If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li> The color is very natural which is extremely important to me.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural and it goes on smooth with no streaks.  </li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t see available was the application mit&#x27;s, I found those to be very useful, and also reduced the unwanted coloring of fingernails &amp; palms.</li>
            <li> Very real looking color, not orange, and no smell</li>
            <li> Definitely have to be very light with this stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a very real looking tan</li>
            <li> And it dries very fast.  </li>
            <li> By far the most natural looking color!!</li>
            <li> Last a longer time than most I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li> so you can see exactly where you&#x27;re applying.  </li>
            <li> Did not find this product to be any better than the same product from Avon at 4.98,  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it with my fingers and didn&#x27;t like the look.</li>
            <li> at first.  </li>
            <li> I get a lot of complements on my color after the first application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I used product like this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even one star is too much for this product!</li>
            <li> They stink and slightly on more orange side... but definitely get you tanner</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what it says, odorless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several self tanners that are much better than this.  </li>
            <li> amazon is charging way more for it thru 3rd party sellers...</li>
            <li> I have not used this on my face, only mostly on my legs, sometimes arms and neck.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> It lasts well, fades evenly, does not rub off, does not have that distinctive odor that tanning creams have, and makes a very even golden tan.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunless tanner I have used that does NOT break my skin out.  </li>
            <li> Looks real and does not streak!  </li>
            <li> Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> It smells like a mix between cleaners and pee-- hot pee.</li>
            <li> you really have to keep rubbing in the lotion in until it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Does not last more than 1 day/</li>
            <li> That is the first impression my girlfriend had</li>
            <li> I just make sure I only use it at bedtime.</li>
            <li> First learned about it on one of the national morning shows.</li>
            <li> There is another brand I like better, get quicker results with longer lasting results.</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have any funny smell either.</li>
            <li> I bought a second bottle:)</li>
            <li> this product actually does look like an authentic suntan, rather than an applied self tanner ..</li>
            <li> I went to work the next day and was asked many times :</li>
            <li> Also only smells okay at first...</li>
            <li> Like most veteran Prime Amazonians</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of applying a moisturizer first and should not have done that (blotchy).  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what it did.</li>
            <li> Pro: The product really works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only used it on my legs.</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin and got a slight orange tint is all, not a tan by any means and it is just as streaky as most of the others.</li>
            <li> After 4 (yes FOUR) applications to the same spot, my skin color has changed exactly ZERO%!!!</li>
            <li> With all the conditioners and special ingredients, it also made my skin feel very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Product goes on easily but you can barely see the color.  </li>
            <li> The color is nice and I like that it dries without much of a tacky/sticky feeling, however, I had to do several applications to get a decent tan.</li>
            <li> : It goes on like a normal moisturizer and dries as quickly too.</li>
            <li> I simply state that I went to the trouble to apply it exactly as they said and the results have been very good.</li>
            <li> Moles and other skin markings, by the way, will also be &#x27;tanned&#x27; and get darker but this can be controlled with a damp tissue or Q-Tip handy to wipe these areas immediately.  </li>
            <li> Although I liked the product &amp; the results of self tanning, I would have to say I would not purchase it again due to the cost &amp; size.</li>
            <li> It also smells nice, unlike other stinky tanning products.  </li>
            <li> It can sit in your cupboard or on the shelves at a store for ever and still gives you an amazing natural color and instantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 yrs old and finally have a nice tanned appearance.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the most natural and easiest to apply.</li>
            <li> Absolute waste of good money.</li>
            <li> Tan Physics turned me streaky orange and it has a strong odor - the exact opposite of what they claim.</li>
            <li> However, the color never really developed, no matter how many days in row I applied.</li>
            <li> That is pretty much it.</li>
            <li> and she was upset with me at first because she knows I&#x27;m not supposed to be out in the sun that much.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell like some of the comments.  </li>
            <li> Nice dark color</li>
            <li> Jergens is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> It was spendy, but goes on very smoothly and looks dark right away - lasts a while also.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful putting this on, as it streaks very easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, tinted (so you can tell where&#x27;s it&#x27;s been applied and even over applied) and has no initial smell.</li>
            <li> If you want it darker, it is easier to do a second application but not so easy to reverse the process.  </li>
            <li> I then dry with a paper towel to be sure all color is off hands.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on their website, exfoliating and shaving my legs before application, then making sure my skin was totally dry.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Be smart, and forget this product.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty realistic..  </li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing a self tanner and it seems to be working out fairly decent.</li>
            <li> The product is a little pricey, no doubt, but I can&#x27;t honestly let that affect my rating as it works so well</li>
            <li> Im a redhead and used this and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It looks real and works well.</li>
            <li> Absolute satisfaction 👍</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it much.  </li>
            <li> I really like the color this tanner gives me.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> It works as it says it will and keeps me from having to spend too much time in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> BIOLOGY ALL-IN-ONE LIQUID FACELIFT&amp;#34; gently dabbed on twice a day and organic aloe is a must..</li>
            <li> I have talked to darker skin people that use this product and they really like it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very even no streaking.  </li>
            <li> Too much tint.</li>
            <li> For $40 I really thought this would have some staying power.</li>
            <li> just started using it, have applied it 3 times, don&#x27;t see much of a change yet,</li>
            <li> but I can tell you even after washing and scrubbing my hands they are still stained, I really don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> paid way too much</li>
            <li> but if you use too much skin becomes orange.  </li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks straight</li>
            <li> One bottle lasted me a whole season.  </li>
            <li> It had very little&lt;br /&gt;color.  </li>
            <li> VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I did really want to try Tan Physics, but for now I am going to pass.  </li>
            <li> I use it very sparingly.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping I could have color fast.</li>
            <li> Works really well and has no odor.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This is the biggest rip-off I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Looks like a real tan without the sun spots and cancer.</li>
            <li> and I was really disaapointed considering the price I payed for it</li>
            <li> Really works well with no orange tinit</li>
            <li> Fades too fast.</li>
            <li> most I think just feel it is expected</li>
            <li> and she now wants to use it too.</li>
            <li> I find that it works really well</li>
            <li> It did not give me a tan as much as I paid for it</li>
            <li> Goes on with no streaking and looks like a real tan</li>
            <li> Turned orange  very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this product again - unless I could find it at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended!</li>
            <li> it looks so real.</li>
            <li> Also, the color is orangish, and you need 2 applications to really see the difference.</li>
            <li> Does not turn you orange either, just a very &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; glow.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Something that seems to help is after washing the palm of my hands I put lotion on the palm of my hands which prevents the tanning lotion from absorbing into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Apply a normal skin lotion first.</li>
            <li> Our clinicians are standing by and always ready to help (whether you are a customer or not) answer and questions you might have about skin care and anti-aging.</li>
            <li> I have been an amazon prime member for years and buy absolutely everything on amazon but never leave reviews.</li>
            <li> And, even though I was very reluctant to put it on my face, I gave it a try</li>
            <li> It really does not work that</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s me, however i find myself not using it much because i don&#x27;t want to smell that  odor at night.  </li>
            <li> When you sniff the product in the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell.</li>
            <li> I have applied it for three days straight and don&#x27;t have much color.  </li>
            <li> Fast ship</li>
            <li> so I have to have a product that looks real.</li>
            <li> Looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> I had to apply a very generous amount in order to get some color.</li>
            <li> like real sun shine...</li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and you can begin to see the color change almost immediately on your skin; especially on your legs.  </li>
            <li> Fast turn around.  </li>
            <li> TOO MUCH MONEY FOR AMOUNT OF PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Even though I rubbed it in very well it still streaked on my legs.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a very timely manner as well</li>
            <li> Jergen&#x27;s natural glow worked better and it&#x27;s only $7 per bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it is a gentle, mildly golden tan that is even and natural looking.</li>
            <li> No smell, good color, lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li> Because it does dry quickly, you have to apply it quickly and wash your hands immediately.</li>
            <li> Not sure why majority of previous customers do not like this product, I find it to be the best sunless tanner on the market.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use this product and have a tan without sun bathing, but it still gave an orange appearance like other sunless tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I live in hot humid Florida.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, no odor, dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than any other tanning cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It does smell better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Better than all the other spray on tanners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Tan Physics works for me, I find that it doesn&#x27;t leave the orange glow &amp; applies evenly, feel confident about using it with out other knowing the difference.</li>
            <li> yes it did, I have gone back to my original brand</li>
            <li> Lives up to its hype of no lingering smell and no streaking unlike many other tanning products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I got a deep rich tan from this product.  </li>
            <li> I did not like it--it had an odor like any other sunless tanning lotion--it also had streaks---not worth the money if it is the real thing--nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> so I can only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I think the more coats you put on the less real it looks.</li>
            <li> It does not streak at all, and has a very slight odor (as opposed to others I&#x27;ve used with a very strong odor).</li>
            <li> Even though is cost more than most others, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many self tanners and hands down</li>
            <li> You can get same kind of tan with other products out there that don&#x27;t cost so much</li>
            <li> It is better; however, it still gives a slight orange appearance.</li>
            <li> There are better products out there for less money.</li>
            <li> It is half the price with shipping and the results are better in my opinion..</li>
            <li> i looked like i had orange dirt on my legs and black pores, and it streaked on top of all that.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it dried nearly immediately and has virtually no odor.</li>
            <li> This produces a realistic tan and doesn&#x27;t smell offensive.</li>
            <li> I took the time to leave this one because I&#x27;m a 32 year-old female who always felt like she needed to tan outside or in tanning booths in order to look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> good nice base coloring</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth with a little color right away</li>
            <li> I bought this in a moment of frustration with ALL the tanners (every single brand available off the shelf)</li>
            <li> I had color after the very 1st application, and looked natural!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone that doesn&#x27;t like to lay in the sun or tan.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Granted, my hopes for a sunless tanner that didn&#x27;t streak, wasn&#x27;t orange and didn&#x27;t make you smell like dirt weren&#x27;t too high.....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> took a chance on Tan Physics and would HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Worked for 10 years in the cosmetic industry and sold high end brand names (including self tanners).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;High quality tanners perform at their peak levels when used as soon as they are blended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I researched and found this one to be highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used it for 5 days prior to trip-- natural, golden, medium tan!  </li>
            <li> No bad smell that lingers aswith other brands, and looks like a real tan!  </li>
            <li> this by far is number one!!</li>
            <li> After my husband has several basil cell carcinomas removed, I became Leary of trying to get that pretty summer tan!</li>
            <li> : If you are sensitive to smell, then you need to know that this DOES have a slight smell to it, (as all sunless products seem to) and it is strong the first night, noticeably in bed, when i was going to sleep.  </li>
            <li> its so natural looking and very very little odour of any kind...</li>
            <li> but you really don&#x27;t need to purchase the exfoliating and extending lotions to achieve the natural look.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but avoids skin cancer which I have experienced.</li>
            <li> Great self tanner &amp; doesnt leave you with that fake bake smell.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, can see where applied to get an even natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> However it works very well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> fast looks natural.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the browning color left on palms even after washing.</li>
            <li> I even used it a few times to make sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok except the smell after you have it on a few hours.</li>
            <li> SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]]</li>
            <li> Other tanners are so greasy you can never tell when you&#x27;re dry enough not to streak, but this stuff just feels velvety and dry but smooth like a good cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on faint and turns out very nice.  </li>
            <li> Has to be applied 2-3 times in order to achieve other than a light tan but lasts well.</li>
            <li> buy a cheap Buff Puff at the grocery store and exfoliate once and while due to</li>
            <li> and I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I read Q&#x27;s and A&#x27;s and compare pricing before purchasing a new product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dark right away, but since I&#x27;m pretty fair, I actually prefer that, so I don&#x27;t look fake.  </li>
            <li> Does dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> User Beware, if you are going to use this, keep it strictly to your arms, and legs, but keep it far, far, FAR away from your face!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried every brand; and when used sparingly and as directed, this one beats all, wih no streaks, a true, warm shade of tan, and the least odor of any other brand I have purchased.</li>
            <li> color is very natural.  </li>
            <li> The color looks very natural and there is no odor.</li>
            <li> The color was very natural looking.</li>
            <li> (I even use it on my face and I have very sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> A very natural looking product.</li>
            <li> Very naturally looking tone</li>
            <li> This is very natural looking with no</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Very Natural.</li>
            <li> A single layer goes on pretty light, which is frustrating if you&#x27;re just thinking bang for your buck, but it makes the tan look more natural</li>
            <li> it gives a very natural looking color, it also fades after a few days without becoming orange or patchy.</li>
            <li> It has a funny smell and the color didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I have checked the bottles and there is no indication that one has an indication of color (dark, medium, light).  </li>
            <li> In fact it looks like a natural tan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other tanning products and I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> It looks really natural!</li>
            <li> first thing that should&#x27;ve set off red flags was their website.</li>
            <li> Interested in Tan Physics Sunless Tanner after reading an AOL&#x27;s rave news review, I came to Amazon shortly after skimming through the Official Web Site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All self-tan products use exactly the same ingredient -- dihydroxyacetone (DHA)!  </li>
            <li> It would be preferable if they made, like the walmart brands and clarins and St Tropez, a light tanner and a dark tanner....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of running around looking pale, this is one of the best ways to get fairly natural looking color ...</li>
            <li> The color that develops is natural (even on my very fair skin) and the tanner smell that develops is very very faint.</li>
            <li> I live near the coast</li>
            <li> This gives just enough color to let me enjoy going out in shorts after a LONG winter.  </li>
            <li> but I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t come in light skin med skin or dark skim.</li>
            <li> The product certainly colors the skin; however the result looks like any other tanning product on the market and the price is significantly higher.  </li>
            <li> It turned my skin a little orange and didn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> ordering direct from tan physics is the only real option....</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL IF YOU&#x27;RE WEARING WHITE OR LIGHT COLORED CLOTHES.</li>
            <li> All advertising content on Mayo Clinic&#x27;s health information website or in one of our newsletters is clearly labeled as an advertisement\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not like the old orange sunless tan lotions</li>
            <li> Natural tan.  </li>
            <li> Natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Natural glow.  </li>
            <li> The color is almost instantaneous and about as natural as your going to get with one of these products.  </li>
            <li> It far exceeded.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural.</li>
            <li> Everyone that has seen me thinks my tan is natural.</li>
            <li> Gives you a natural look.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, avoided ankle, knee and elbow areas directly and washed my hands after each application.  </li>
            <li> did some on line research and found this product for my girlfriend... got it directly on line from tan physics website...</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend to shake the bottle VERY well before using.  </li>
            <li> and WOW this goes on just like lotion</li>
            <li> Before I completed this latest order, I read the reviews and noticed a number of negative ones.</li>
            <li> It does work on my old skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely none of it rubbed off on my white sheets and has no smell after its applied.</li>
            <li> and it does go on smoothly, lasts a few days</li>
            <li> Gives natural color, except on toes.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat of a process and perhaps why so many posted negative comments if they did not apply correctly.</li>
            <li> was that I had gotten this tan naturally in the sun</li>
            <li> I bought it because it&#x27;s supposed to be more natural, but it&#x27;s a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> The color looks even and natural, &amp;#34;not orange&amp;#34; even on the face.  </li>
            <li> does what it claims, Looks natural no streaking.</li>
            <li> I can actually skip tanning for awhile and it looks like a real tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stopped using it completely, and I&#x27;ve never had that problem again.</li>
            <li> And my co-workers were amazed that it was a sunless tan and that it looked so natural.</li>
            <li> The look I get is surprisingly natural.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by some unsatisfied customer complaints, but it was an unanswered question as to why Amazon is charging twenty dollars more per bottle than the actual cost on Tan Physics official website which prompted me to investigate further.  </li>
            <li> That is what we can guarantee when we ship directly to you from our lab.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks natural.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and have used it twice so far...</li>
            <li> this is for unblemished young skin.</li>
            <li> It gives an even, natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> The color truly looks natural.</li>
            <li> A co-worker commented on how natural it looks.  </li>
            <li> but the color looks natural</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like natural tan.</li>
            <li> Goes on even and natural looking</li>
            <li> I had really hoped for a tanning product (especially given the price) that wouldn&#x27;t give me that orange look you often see from a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Good but too expensive.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it!  </li>
            <li> but my main thing I like is that its ingredients are better, not all the bad for you chemicals such as most store brands.</li>
            <li> Everybody always seems quick to throw out negative reviews in general no matter what the product, but less likely to make positive ones even when clearly appropriate.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and has a slight bronzer</li>
            <li> The ingredients in Fake Bake work with each individual person&#x27;s pigment to achieve color results that fit you, therefore the overall results seem more natural.  </li>
            <li> Smelled better when you first put it on but as soon as you start to sweat or put your clothes on, it started to have that weird smell.</li>
            <li> The first application I looked like I had been in the sun for several days; you&#x27;ll see instant results.</li>
            <li> Actually purchased a second bottle since the first was confiscated at airport security.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and will never go back to using anything else again.</li>
            <li> Have tried many of these sunless tanners (I am very pale and prefer to not expose my skin to the sun!)  </li>
            <li> It works very well but very expensive,  good for your face but too expensive to apply to the whole body, it only takes about 3 applications to the face for nice color and then after every-other day.  </li>
            <li> I have since read some reviews about Fake Bake and just started this product about one week ago which I am very pleased with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell for the line that Mayo Clinic endorsed this lotion and am now taking some of my very precious time to disclose that this product is useless.</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to the advertisement in a magazine I read and it gave this product the highest credit for even tanning, no streaks and not a yellow tone  like all the others and a true tan affect.  </li>
            <li> So - I&#x27;ve tried a few different self tanners and recently got Tan Physics - and i love it.  </li>
            <li> no dark spots</li>
            <li> Apply daily to get a rich dark tan.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the face but its just like all the others  not fantastic results as it says</li>
            <li> It astonished me, since my previous experience had been so positive (that&#x27;s why I ordered it again this time, despite its high price).</li>
            <li> Not a single hint of a color change to my skin, nothing, zilch, zero, nada!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone thinks I just came back from sunny vacation (I live in the North).  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and goes on so smooth and even, it would get five stars but the price is crazy.  </li>
            <li> Great subtle, buildable color and the lotion doesn&#x27;t have a heavy metallic smell on your skin after just a short time.  </li>
            <li> Barely any odor!  </li>
            <li> I have no other options now - skin cancer is costing me a fortune</li>
            <li> Such a natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super pale.</li>
            <li> After using for 1 week I didn&#x27;t notice much color and my skin became very dry.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so my first bottle lasted me about 3 months (much cheaper than a tanning place)</li>
            <li> in this world, generally you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Its fast and no streaks, the only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> NATURAL LOOKING, LIKE YOU JUST GOT BACK FROM THE ISLANDS.  </li>
            <li> barely tans.</li>
            <li> I apply this with a brush I received with a Bare Minerals product.  </li>
            <li> go to thetan physics website and start your order and then back out or dont complete</li>
            <li> It will streak if a person is not careful in the application.</li>
            <li> I paid the exorbitant amount for such a product with their claims of no streaking and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Still have to be careful about how much is applied at one time.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it.</li>
            <li> Color i barely got color from it.  </li>
            <li> It barely gives you any color no matter how often you apply it.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous self-tanners over the years and this surpasses any that I&#x27;ve used thus far.  </li>
            <li> , I copied the following statements verbatim for you directly from Tan Physics Official website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ordering directly through this page is the ONLY way to purchase Tan Physics.</li>
            <li> I used it over several days to build a natural looking tan before I went on vacation.  </li>
            <li> You could barely tell it worked at all.</li>
            <li> but it barely gives me any color results.  </li>
            <li> However, I desire to have somewhat of a tan, don&#x27;t have to be golden dark brown, just don&#x27;t want to go around as white as a sheet!</li>
            <li> It does add a nice color to my visage without a fake appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found much better results with Victoria&#x27;s Secret self tanner, which I have bought in-store for under $15.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and gives instant color but turns skin blotchy and uneven after you shower and reapply a few times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a very natural looking color and does not have that fake tan smell that so many products have.</li>
            <li> Better than other self tanners I have purchase or tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking color (not orange) with no streaks or strange discoloration of knees and elbows and no stinky smell.</li>
            <li> Yes it does tan you a lot faster than other self tanners but who wants a streaky tan.</li>
            <li> I am a white female 59 years old.</li>
            <li> This is not worth it, any drugstore brand will work the same for 1/3 the cost, this product is all hype, all spawned by internet advertisements, the real truth is unless you are whiter than a ghost you will not tan at all using this!</li>
            <li> No other  sunless tanner I&#x27;ve tried gives a totally &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no more expensive than Clarins, which works well, but this dries more quickly and gives a more natural looking tan without any weird odor.</li>
            <li> No strange odor.</li>
            <li> I used it consistently for a few days.  </li>
            <li> but I felt compelled on this one because I was SOOOO excited when I heard of this product and really wanted it to be my &amp;#34;silver bullet&amp;#34; for fake tan since I am prone to skin cancer</li>
            <li> hardly any smell, and tans up quick.</li>
            <li> smells great dose not work well on a white girl like me :(</li>
            <li> Slight odor goes away fast.</li>
            <li> reference, I am naturally a medium/fair redhead with combination skin tone (dry patches and get pimples if I use an oily product).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to wait long to have an instant natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li> So after reading the numerous reviews - mostly &amp;#34;not so good&amp;#34; to a few &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34;, I think I am going to stick with what I have been using for the past 2 years</li>
            <li> I am back to my Jergens Glow and can purchase four of them for less than one mod the TP.  </li>
            <li> put it on my pale white skin, including my face, using only two fingers to rub it in at first.  </li>
            <li> My skin is older and I know some dark spots will show.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the high price.  </li>
            <li> It has only been about one week, so it may be a little early to tell, but I am already seeing a shade of tan that is closer to how I naturally tan from the sun.  </li>
            <li> Other lotions leave a lingering scent all day but not this one and the color is natural looking.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and stays on longer than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I live at the beach &amp; typically use Jergens products in the spring to start the summer tanning regime.</li>
            <li> The bottle from Tan Physics was not as bad, but still wasn&#x27;t better than the store bought stuff I normally use.</li>
            <li> A much saver and healthier manner in which to add a little color to ones complexion!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and felt a slight irritation on my legs.  </li>
            <li> First of all, no matter how hard I scrubbed my hands after application, my palms are still darker than the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> guide is useful without being so dark it looks awkward on my super white skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very messy and washes right off as soon as you put it on so really not something your looking to buy for a color to stay on</li>
            <li> After about one week, I then started noticing streaks on the inside of my arms that were not completely covered with the lotion, as well as yellowing around my ankles and on my hands and fingernails (especially when I would be out in sunlight).  </li>
            <li> Tan doesn&#x27;t last that long though for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> This product by far is the most expensive waste of money I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Little expensive but nice color.</li>
            <li> I am always willing to try a new product but was sorry for spending the money on this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale, I have red hair and let me say this is the worse for sure, never again.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it does not last long at all and fades patchy, not even like other brands i have used.  </li>
            <li> As far as the price, a little product goes a long way, so one bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Tan Physics also does not endorse purchasing from any site other than their direct website due to freshness of ingredients.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it a 5-star is that I do not think it is dark enough.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, does have a yellow tint.</li>
            <li> People ask me in the office if i spent the weekend outside.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> + sunscreen doesn&#x27;t protect me for long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it on without streaking and the color is strange.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural looking tan year round try this product.  </li>
            <li> and the bottle lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as often...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to use every day for a long time</li>
            <li> If you are white with no real color to your skin please do not bother with this garbage..</li>
            <li> I can put it on in the morning and then get dressed for work 15 minutes later without it feeling wet.  </li>
            <li> My husband is using this product, personally I am seeing no real results in his tanning experience.  </li>
            <li> I have actually tried them all and this does rank at or near the top...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better result with less expensive sunless tanners you buy at convenience stores.</li>
            <li> I have a toddler and don&#x27;t have time for anything too fussy to apply, or too long to dry.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed after reading such great reviews.</li>
            <li> Most of the other tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past had an odor that was not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I used the product over a period of several days and it did give me a little color, but after about 5 applications my boyfriend said I was starting to look orange.</li>
            <li> The color stays for 2-3 days as long as you don&#x27;t exfoliate it off!</li>
            <li> Do you have any other questions related to your skin or beauty regimen?</li>
            <li> You are being scammed for your money when you fork over more than about $8 bucks for ANY of these silly self-tanners!  </li>
            <li> I only use self tanners and spray tans due to Lupus.</li>
            <li> Works the same as other products.</li>
            <li> A very minor smell</li>
            <li> This product did not break me out or dry me out.</li>
            <li> smelled and made her skin dry ...</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin just burns because it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin somewhat, so applying every couple of days and moisturizing in between seems to help.  </li>
            <li> and then it flakes off just like dry skin does.  </li>
            <li> Allow the lotion to dry on your skin 5 mins (while brushing your teeth.</li>
            <li> shower and dry off.</li>
            <li> I ordered the lightest because I am very fair-it is subtle orange.  </li>
            <li> The application is a bit tricky, but I am much happier with the results of Fake Bake, thus far and would recommend this product over Tan Physics.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Sun Laboratories Self Tanning Lotion for the last few months, and I am going to go back to using that.</li>
            <li> Tried with high hopes but this product is smelly and slow working....</li>
            <li> dry, apply the Banana Boat Deep Dark Color.</li>
            <li> when applying, let dry, went about my day only to look down and see orange streaky legs...</li>
            <li> To maintain it you only have to use once or twice a week depending how dark you want to look.</li>
            <li> True tan color, but too expensive</li>
            <li> and I simply dumped the rest down the drain.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my clothes, however, just a little bit on my bra if I don&#x27;t wait long enough.  </li>
            <li> I was hopeful this product would work, but the color was barely noted on my already pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> Only problem - comes off slightly when shaving legs.</li>
            <li> some products I&#x27;ve paid a lot less for in local stores.</li>
            <li> I typically order one bottle at a time and the last time I went ahead and bought 3</li>
            <li> This is my first and last try at a fake tan.</li>
            <li> It was a typical self tanner that left me orange.</li>
            <li> it was like any other-- except more expensive!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re less likely to have noticeable</li>
            <li> I found another product that does the same job for much less money</li>
            <li> The bottle is super hard and I have a hard time getting the lotion to come out.</li>
            <li> My skin is dark orange in some spots and other spots are white again.</li>
            <li> The only downfall for me is that it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Mixed with a little moisturizer for coverage..</li>
            <li> Pretty faint though, especially compared to other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the third day it was finally sunny in my area, and I walked out into the sunshine and found my skin was orange in the sunlight, and no matter how hard I avoided the ankle, knee and elbow areas</li>
            <li> Instructions were limited but just used what I remembered from other self-tanner instructions.</li>
            <li> It was still streaky, but again, not as bad as most.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s bad I&#x27;ll make sure I tell you</li>
            <li> This product did have an odor, although not as bad as most self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin real dry.</li>
            <li> I am sticking with Jergens Natural Glow as it works, least odor</li>
            <li> It is everything that I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not as expected</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do as well as expected, blotchy</li>
            <li> bottle was openned and partially used.</li>
            <li> Granted I have only used it a few days...</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> However, after a few hours on your skin, it does begin to have that same self-tanner smell.  </li>
            <li> A tad expensive, yes, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again when it becomes empty.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> what I expected thought I would get some sort of glow</li>
            <li> Just be careful how you apply it.</li>
            <li> Only areas where I have trouble is on the ankles and tops of feet.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> it starts to clog my pours on my face after several applications and gets uneven all over.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this faithfully as directed for 2 weeks and the results are minimal.  </li>
            <li> Minus the email address not permitted in posting</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> lasts as expected &#x60;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the $38.00 dollars because you can&#x27;t get it back, no paperwork comes with the bottle.</li>
            <li> so she would have a nice base tan to work on.</li>
            <li> Within hours, half of it had rubbed off, even though I had let it dry and wore loose clothing.</li>
            <li> was supposed to be so good very bad</li>
            <li> A little hard to see when putting on so coverage was uneven at first.</li>
            <li> This stuff does NOT smell bad like other tanners I&#x27;ve tried, it dries super-fast, and the colour is lovely, not orange.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong, but enough to make me notice it, and hope people around me didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The main &#x27;secret&#x27; I found is to use the MINIMAL amount smoothed on EVENLY to cover the area you want to &#x27;tan&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I expected, but will give it a try because I bought it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t worry about the cost.  </li>
            <li> using a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and is extremely forgiving with application.</li>
            <li> No funny smell like other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> For the price, this seemed to me to be an expensive product should I be interested in using it throughout the summer.  </li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> At this time I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product.  </li>
            <li> (Sounds like one of those reviews I&#x27;ve read on some other item and wonder if it is just &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried other stuff.</li>
            <li> yet it does still spot like other products.</li>
            <li> It is not as pungent as other manufacturer&#x27;s formulas, though.  </li>
            <li> but it goes way beyond what any other sunless tanners can offer.  </li>
            <li> promised not to be like the other self tanners but still streaky and orange in color.</li>
            <li> Pretty darn expensive.</li>
            <li> would not buy again due to streaks.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, but am anxious to wash it off the next day!</li>
            <li> , you can see a change just after applying to your skin, no orange tinge like so of those other products.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product, it is the same as others, does not cover as was advertised.</li>
            <li> I am extremely dissappointed in it.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Do you want to find out about our other products?</li>
            <li> but it still streaks and smells just like any other tanner.  </li>
            <li> After putting it on however, all I could notice throught the day was the &amp;#34;tanning smell.&amp;#34; I even had other people notice the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin STICKY like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> AND I CAN BUY OTHER PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I was very careful</li>
            <li> and I had streaky results even after applying very carefully and massaging into my skin.</li>
            <li> First off, it is VERY expensive for what it actually does.</li>
            <li> makes my skin dry and spotty after few days</li>
            <li> then any other self tanner not worth the money at all..</li>
            <li> it hardly showed any color and had to be applied daily for minimum results.</li>
            <li> This works very well and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw the ad, but it really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product at the end of last summer and they informed me it was too late to request a refund.  </li>
            <li> Do not use this product if you have dark spots, sun spots or age spots.</li>
            <li> Its not worth the money..</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The color lasted at least 5 days, just did a touchup when I got back home.  </li>
            <li> The color was also a bit orange on dark skin.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was not worth it.  </li>
            <li> When I switched to this stuff, my boyfriend thought I stopped using fake tanners and got a real tan.</li>
            <li> And two random people at work commented that I tan really well.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Too Dark.  </li>
            <li> The price is not worth it for me to buy</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse it completely washes away with any shower or bath or face wash.</li>
            <li> Immediately upon receiving it I was spectical , it was running down my hand as I put it in my palm, but decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as some others.</li>
            <li> I find it looks better if you have a little base tan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have streaks as bad as just an overall orange color which looks very unnatural.</li>
            <li> Can I rate less than 1 star?</li>
            <li> I wish it costs less</li>
            <li> splotchy and slight orange tint</li>
            <li> It was less sticky and dryed faster though.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive, and works no better than the cheap brands.  </li>
            <li> I typically stay away from self tanner because of the odor and the color of the tan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I lose less color or not.</li>
            <li> The Banana Boat Summer Color is in a 6 ounce tube, lasts for four to five months, and is less than 10.00 with tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different ones in the last 10 years and this is not impressive at all!  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for a gradual darkening, but not a quick one .</li>
            <li> (although eventually you will notice a bit of the typical sunless tanner odor).  </li>
            <li> I had to layer two applications (a day apart) to get even slightly tan looking, so I&#x27;ll just build it out from here and use my Neutrogena every now and then to extend the life of the Tan Physics.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine from eBay and paid a couple dollars less that</li>
            <li> It can rub off slightly during exercise but washes out of clothes.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this because they say there isnt the typical smell.  </li>
            <li> and my body smelled of the typical tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all I got was a more expensive orange color.</li>
            <li> Rinse your mouth with baking soda, it will make your breath fresh!)before putting on your socks or other tight clothing which will make the color uneven.</li>
            <li> Typically the color tends to pool into an orange-y mess around my heels and toes</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad right when squirt it out of bottle but does when it is on you and the smell lasts for days!  </li>
            <li> Also the usual cautions about application to elbows, palms, hair and clothing should be carefully observed.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was a streaking mess</li>
            <li> not sure about the product, didnt work as expected</li>
            <li> They say there is no smell to this.... that is NOT true.  </li>
            <li> It is not available at Amazon and it is not available on EBay or through any other online store.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tan physics is a slightly sticky lotion that adds just a little color but not evenly.</li>
            <li> I use to spend so many hours/days/weeks in a tanning bed because I hate laying out in the sun, NO MORE.</li>
            <li> If anything I look a little jaundice but not tan at all.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> it does streak a little and splotch a little.</li>
            <li> It goes on with a little color and (when applied in the morning) develops by evening...</li>
            <li> This tanner is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I was no better than any other ran</li>
            <li> Well to my surprise it was not unique and didn&#x27;t keep up to the guarantee that it states when you buy it.</li>
            <li> In the morning, it appeared a little splotchy, but after I showered, it evened out.  </li>
            <li> A little disapointed with the quality of the tan.  </li>
            <li> Product worked well- a little pricey.</li>
            <li> They all either smelled really bad, looked orange, or made a huge mess and transferred onto my clothing for days!!  </li>
            <li> Not very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have had a little trouble around the wrist area.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product over any other on the market!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product everyday for 8 days now and have had zero results.</li>
            <li> Which then ends up in streaking and uneven color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> Waste of my hard-earned money $$$</li>
            <li> This stuff is a joke, you wasted your money)</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> When it came I was hesitant to put it on, so it sat on my counter for a few days</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> Gives a rusty uneven, and unattractive color.</li>
            <li> After all, how often do people complain about things such as poor service at a restaurant?</li>
            <li> This feels like a giant rip-off to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble getting that scent off.</li>
            <li> but as I aged and saw the negative affects of sunning beginning, I looked for an alternative way to have that tanned look ..</li>
            <li> do have to use a generous amount to get the color I desire and reapply every few days</li>
            <li> I put it on and dried it with my blowdrier just before bed.  </li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Tan Physics is NOT available in stores.</li>
            <li> Waste of money here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> I will buy it tear round.</li>
            <li> Color seemed a weird brown color too, and not at all natural.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money-</li>
            <li> Regardless of exfoliating the ankle area gets Orange and uneven.  </li>
            <li> wasted my 37.00</li>
            <li> and I mean a two or three washings with lots of soap) before the the color penetrates, and be careful around knees, elbows and ankles (as with all self tanners) but</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m pale as ever.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin.  </li>
            <li> only on face, neck and arms then use a less expensive tan cream for the rest.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, but I have also purchased tanners similar that were much less expensive.</li>
            <li> The smell at first doesn&#x27;t seem bad at all when applying, just wait till that night when you are sleeping though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this lotion does smell pretty bad, I&#x27;ll agree on that.</li>
            <li> The product still has that self-tanner &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; (not as bad as some I have used), but it practically goes away after the first shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena sunless tanning products for the last few years but hate the smell and didn&#x27;t feel like they look as natural.  </li>
            <li> It really looks natural and that horrible smell is absent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typically need at least 2 for me...</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, no streaks ( I was afraid of) and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> just a little once a week will do for me!</li>
            <li> on my legs but as other products I have tried, no good around the feet area.  </li>
            <li> Completely different than that other stuff that does a chemical change on your body and stinks.</li>
            <li> Very little color produced.</li>
            <li> very little odor</li>
            <li> Too bad for me since my system already worked really well.</li>
            <li> This product smells bad and does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> I usually have orange streaks when using any tanning lotions or sprays, but with this to my surprise</li>
            <li> Most of the products out there bother my eyes and sinuses real bad.</li>
            <li> No more burning my body and wasting time lying in the sun.</li>
            <li> Speaking of wrinkles, I usually follow it up with some SKingenixx Vitamin C serum [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> In my opinion this product works no better than the otc sunning products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had to also endure the inevitable flaking streaks as it wore off.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend my time writing reviews</li>
            <li> To begin I have used the Jergens Glow for the past 5 years, however after seeing Tan Physics in a magizine article  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup just the oil slick on your face.</li>
            <li> I had a small pile under my desk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried to avoid the usual places- palms, elbows, knees, but still had streaks on calves, forearms and the like.</li>
            <li> I was expecting wonders from this product with the price I paid for it, but it is no better than any store bought brand out there that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why some say they got no color...</li>
            <li> it is not too bad,  ut it does leave orange marks on the older women who have age spots.</li>
            <li> The cons- way too expensive, gives only a hint of color with each application,  and you&#x27;ll need at least 4-5 before a tan is seen.</li>
            <li> I am very pale...</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> It will make the spots turn a dark orange and show up worse.</li>
            <li> I have tried to phone them and after several minutes of a very annoying recorded message telling you a representative will be with you shortly another message comes on telling you they are closed.</li>
            <li> wish it was a little less expensive</li>
            <li> I have used many tanning lotions in the past and they streak horribly and look even worse as they are wearing off.</li>
            <li> wrists are hard to not get orange spots</li>
            <li> WHICH IS EXTREMELY HARD WITH THIS LOTION TO COVER EVENLY.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting this even on my body.</li>
            <li> and it hardly made any difference in my skin color.</li>
            <li> Hardly rubs off at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s YOUR hard earned money.</li>
            <li> The plastic is just too hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> it a little thin</li>
            <li> It was late arriving&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not what I expected,  Its like expensive makeup.</li>
            <li> i should of at least had it that fri jan 31</li>
            <li> We will not let our products sit on shelves or in a department store as it could negatively affect your results.</li>
            <li> request a return authorization...received too late for trip to Hawaii&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it at least once</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t hate tan lotions this much, but</li>
            <li> This is the worse, waste of money, and spotting, I&#x27;ve try a lot of self Tanning&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have extremely sun sensitive skin, read horrible rash from just a little exposure.</li>
            <li> could not tell the difference in it and other brands I have used!!!!</li>
            <li> This has to be the first tanning product that doesn&#x27;t smell bad!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all from the original QT (blech), the graduals, creams with and without color guide, mousse, and even an in shower foam from josie maran!  </li>
            <li> It does have a little of that nasty smell during the transition,  but after your first bath, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> No more sun bathing for me!</li>
            <li> Product was open for shipment, so it was all useless upon receipt!</li>
            <li> It seemed pointless to apply it to my legs this winter when everything was covered due to the severe cold.</li>
            <li> Gives you a subtle tan result, so you do not look unnatural.</li>
            <li> I feel ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I read on Amazon that a customer prefers the less costly Banana Boat cream ( not spray ), which I have been unable to find.</li>
            <li> Loreal sublime bronze is less expensive and works just as well for me.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have been doing some serious tanning.  </li>
            <li> LESS EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look fake just a little color.  </li>
            <li> I would look silly with a dark tan!  </li>
            <li> Not a good color.  </li>
            <li> NOT GOOD....</li>
            <li> I am not happy that I fell for this false advertising and wasted $53!</li>
            <li> so I have to rely on fake stuff to have any color on my pale skin.  </li>
            <li> I paid a small fortune for  a spray tan at a highly recommended spa - and it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> I will use it again for a shorter period of time; it&#x27;s too expensive to waste!</li>
            <li> Tan Physics sucks and is five times the cost of Banana Boat self tanner!  </li>
            <li> one stinks less</li>
            <li> It just  did not work well does not give  you an even tan and is hard to apply don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t buy again waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Used to tan 4 times a week,but now only twice a month to keep a base.</li>
            <li> It looks real and not that orange streaky crap!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get splotchiness around the creases of my arms and behind my knees like some tanners do.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Nothing much else to write: it is a horrible self-tanner.</li>
            <li> I found myself having to exfoliate (to  extremes) , approximately every couple of weeks because there would be places that the color was coming off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell weird like the rest of then and has the least amount of streaking of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have used it multiple times now as I wanted an period of analysis beyond just one or two uses to base my opinion on.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> It claims to have no streaks and no odor which is entirely false.</li>
            <li> My skin streaked as badly as any other tanner.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other self tanners.</li>
            <li> Seriously be warned, save your money!</li>
            <li> My arms look like a dirty little kid, even though followed all instructions!  </li>
            <li> Every other one I&#x27;ve used has an awkward smell after applied; this one did NOT!  </li>
            <li> NOT GOOD!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed so far</li>
            <li> Not sure if the people giving bad reviews are using this the wrong way or if they just have unrealistic expectations.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product!!!  </li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> (The hype is just that, expensive</li>
            <li> Has that weird smell too.  </li>
            <li> No streaking or weird lines.  </li>
            <li> Not very satisfied!!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> It is a useless product.  </li>
            <li> I never go out in the sun, so I rely on fake tanning products and am somewhat of an expert.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t darken my spots and doesn&#x27;t look fake.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with  the product.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> My sister and I both tried this self-tanner and it left terrible streaks.</li>
            <li> It fades out horrible and creates splotches on the skin even with proper exfoliation.</li>
            <li> After about 12 hours it has a faint metallic smell, but you should be hitting the shower by then.  </li>
            <li> Works well without leaving you looking like a fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive for me to use every day</li>
            <li> This adds color without looking fake.</li>
            <li> Fake bake is the way to go you can buy it on amazon ano sallys.</li>
            <li> not impressed with lack of color.</li>
            <li> not if your pale tho, i had a base tan going when i used it</li>
            <li> Not a big fan at all, once again disappointed with this self tanner crap.</li>
            <li> The lotion which you can buy to prolong your tan is weak and smells bad too.</li>
            <li> It was the worst product I have ever spent money on.  </li>
            <li> Maybe not as bad as Tanfastic, but Tan Physics is every thing wrong about self-tanners.</li>
            <li> crazy price).  </li>
            <li> used on my face just a small amount and after about a hour it looked horrible....</li>
            <li> very expensive.</li>
            <li> Very expensive and doesn&#x27;t tan as well as cheaper products.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t streak or smell bad.  </li>
            <li> works well, not orangey and did not smell bad.  </li>
            <li> I have some patchy stuff around my hands but that was my bad...</li>
            <li> They smell so bad</li>
            <li> This product does not smell bad or cause bad reaction.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad and even after showering over and over again</li>
            <li> Not as bad as others, but it did.  </li>
            <li> I would be shocked if you did not like it.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Scares me that someday they will cease to exist :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works great.  Last a longer time than most I have tried.  It does not streak and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> works pretty good !  Looks pretty realistic..  not like the old orange sunless tan lotions</li>
            <li> Gives nice colour without being obtrusive.</li>
            <li> It was late arriving&lt;br /&gt;Product is good&lt;br /&gt;Three stars</li>
            <li> It is everything that I expected.  It does add a nice color to my visage without a fake appearance. I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> This works great!  No smell or streaking!  Just left a nice even tan.</li>
            <li> It turned my skin a little orange and didn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  It look fine intitally but I saw streaks when I was in the sun.</li>
            <li> Awesome color from this. It wasn&#x27;t orange or streaky looking at all.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful putting this on, as it streaks very easy.  Not very pleased with this product.  For the price, I thought it would be what I would use forever...so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Last for days, have not had any problem with streaking.</li>
            <li> Totally loved this product.  No smell. Natural tan.  Will continue to use. And recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected,  Its like expensive makeup.</li>
            <li> I feel st. Tropez is a much better product really did not get tan from this product</li>
            <li> Everything a tanner should be. It&#x27;s easy to apply, tinted (so you can tell where&#x27;s it&#x27;s been applied and even over applied) and has no initial smell. The color that develops is natural (even on my very fair skin) and the tanner smell that develops is very very faint. It doesn&#x27;t rub off onto sheets and towels, and the next day my bed had no residual tanner smell at all!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product!!!  Definitely had orange tint.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this product. Natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> The ads are true.  Very real looking color, not orange, and no smell</li>
            <li> just in time for Hawaii trip,super</li>
            <li> Can I rate less than 1 star? It&#x27;s your grandmas QT...yep! Do you remember QT (quick tan)lotion from the 70s. Well it&#x27;s back repackaged and a lot more expensive. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It streaks terribly.</li>
            <li> Nice dark color but doesn&#x27;t apply easily ankles wrists are hard to not get orange spots</li>
            <li> This works very well and doesn&#x27;t look fake. It is easy to put on. We used this on my daughter for her tan for prom. She looked like the girls who had gone to a tanning bed. I would highly recommend this. I am buying more for my son&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used ever! Been using this product for 3 years. No streaking after application and last for days. Used to tan 4 times a week,but now only twice a month to keep a base. I highly recommend this product for anyone that doesn&#x27;t like to lay in the sun or tan.</li>
            <li> Love! One use lasts almost a week. Best self tanner</li>
            <li> Not as good as I&#x27;d hoped by reading the reviews...&lt;br /&gt;Turns a yellow color when fading.&lt;br /&gt;Plan to return it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes you look healthy, not fake!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling and the smell is actually kind of nice.  Other lotions leave a lingering scent all day but not this one and the color is natural looking.</li>
            <li> Im a redhead and used this and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. Love the scent though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Total scam!</li>
            <li> Did not care for this product. Difficult to use. Did not give all over tan. Not as expected</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do as well as expected, blotchy</li>
            <li> THE BOMB for a summer tan without the harmful sun rays!  TRUST ME!  This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li> I have try it but comes out when u shower.</li>
            <li> Still learning how to put on so it looks like the advertisements,</li>
            <li> Love it.  No streaks.  I&#x27;ve bought every tanner there is.  As a fair-medium skin toned gal, I always got streaks.  Exfoliated, wore gloves, etc.  Didn&#x27;t matter.  This Tan Physics doesn&#x27;t streak.  Doesn&#x27;t make me orange like an Oompah Loompah.  Natural glow.  Also doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.  Bought it twice, so I wouldn&#x27;t be out in the summer.</li>
            <li> Works great in the smell is awesome unlike other self Tanners at the smell I cannot stand .</li>
            <li> BEST I EVER TRIED.  NICE, EVEN COLOR.  NATURAL LOOKING, LIKE YOU JUST GOT BACK FROM THE ISLANDS.  I DO THING IT IS A BIT PRICEY BUT IN THE END I FELT IT WAS WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Just as it states. It looks real and works well. I had people assume that I was on vacation. I told them why I was tan and NOt to be jealous but to go out and purchase this for themselves</li>
            <li> Absolute satisfaction 👍</li>
            <li> If not applied precisely it will streak</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. Always natural looking and easy to apply and blend. I&#x27;ve even used it on my face with excellent results. Always remember to exfoliate before and between and to smooth out ankles, feet, knees and elbows. I use a loofa pad. Reapply a couple days in a row to achieve desired darkness.  Lasts a good couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I wish it costs less but it is the best sunless tanner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It looks real and not that orange streaky crap! Goodbye tanning beds!</li>
            <li> Works great!  True tan color, but too expensive</li>
            <li> This product works well. Only problem - comes off slightly when shaving legs.</li>
            <li> I live at the beach &amp; typically use Jergens products in the spring to start the summer tanning regime. I have experienced something that nobody else has mentioned.I only used it on my lower legs &amp; now that summer is here I cannot get my lower legs to tan while everywhere else is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;SO Tan Physics answer that one for me?</li>
            <li> Tried tan physics and I&#x27;m absolutely highly impressed with it&#x27;s application. It&#x27;s light sent is also nice. This product did not break me out or dry me out. I use it on face and body, and it gives me a beautiful healthy glow:)</li>
            <li> splotchy and slight orange tint</li>
            <li> It actually makes your skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> good nice base coloring</li>
            <li> I have been using it and it has good results.</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried!  Moisturizes at the same time!</li>
            <li> Works great, better than any other tanners I have purchased.  Barely any odor!  Also works quickly and dries fast. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it much.  It has a funny smell and the color didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Yes love this tanning lotion😊</li>
            <li> Had my daughter try it for me. She loved it</li>
            <li> Can still turn you orange</li>
            <li> barely tans. very expensive. gone right away.</li>
            <li> I really like the color this tanner gives me.</li>
            <li> Like this tanner. I am light skinned, and doesn&#x27;t turn orange</li>
            <li> I have been using the product everyday for 8 days now and have had zero results. If anything I look a little jaundice but not tan at all. I&#x27;ve had much better result with less expensive sunless tanners you buy at convenience stores. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> The best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Very natural looking color (not orange) with no streaks or strange discoloration of knees and elbows and no stinky smell. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I am very pale...never do I tan from the sun as I have a family history of melanoma.  I used Tan Physics before a trip to Bermuda and was very impressed by the overall appearance of my skin color especially in photographs. It glides on easily and dries super fast. No funny smell like other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply and color is very natural.  It is definitely the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Best self tanner ever!</li>
            <li> While the lotion seemed to be darkening my skin, my toe nails began to turn orange and it washed/dried off onto my towels even after I stopped using it.  Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great smell, no streaks ...I&#x27;ve used many self tanners and this is by far my favorite</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item and found it to not be as good as Jergen&#x27;s that is sold at the grocery store for a third of the price. I did have it streak around my ankles and the Jergen&#x27;s does not. I am always willing to try a new product but was sorry for spending the money on this item.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and has a slight bronzer so you can see exactly where you&#x27;re applying.  Smells great too, but is a bit drying, so before/after moisturizer is a must.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> The shipment I got was not even close to the color that I had originally.  I have checked the bottles and there is no indication that one has an indication of color (dark, medium, light).  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> You can be tan without damaging UV damage from the sun!  This is amazing and it smells good!  Definitely a winner!</li>
            <li> I really like it but it works the same as my $7 over the counter mist</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than any other tanning cream I&#x27;ve used. (The hype is just that, expensive hype.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ya know what they say, if you can&#x27;t sell something, raise the price.</li>
            <li> It is no different  then any other self tanner not worth the money at all..</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT TAN PHYSICS LAST YEAR AND LOVED IT. IT LASTED A YEAR.I ORDERED ANOTHER BOTTLE AND RECEIVED IT IN 2 DAYS. MY FRIENDS CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE IT IS OUT OF A BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money! Just made me look dirty, not tan!!! Will never buy anymore!! Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  It didn&#x27;t streak or smell bad.  Knees, ankles and elbows are touch areas, but it you lightly apply it, it works great.  Does great on the face and neck too.</li>
            <li> Consumer Report was right.  This is the best tanner I have tried.</li>
            <li> This tanner is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  It does not streak at all, and has a very slight odor (as opposed to others I&#x27;ve used with a very strong odor).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work. After using for 1 week I didn&#x27;t notice much color and my skin became very dry.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and dries quickly. The color looks very natural and there is no odor.</li>
            <li> Provides good color without looking orange.</li>
            <li> I ordered this due to the advertisement in a magazine I read and it gave this product the highest credit for even tanning, no streaks and not a yellow tone  like all the others and a true tan affect.  The cost of this item was pricey $37.00.  Did not find this product to be any better than the same product from Avon at 4.98,  Was very disappointed !</li>
            <li> Smells good, works great. I didn&#x27;t notice it the first couple days, but I love the color after using it a week, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.</li>
            <li> I thought for $30 per bottle I would actually see some amazing results.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m pale as ever.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very creamy texture that spreads easily on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t have an odor at all and I absolutely love that.  The product claims not to streak, but I did see streaking on my legs. I did apply it with glovez on so maybe that was the reason. The color is very natural which is extremely important to me. I would buy it again,  yes.</li>
            <li> I like this tanner. Not orange at All and went on streak free! I would suggest wearing gloves or your hands will stain.</li>
            <li> I am stunned by performance of this product as well as the bad reviews here! I consider myself am expert in self tanning....I&#x27;ve tried it all from the original QT (blech), the graduals, creams with and without color guide, mousse, and even an in shower foam from josie maran!  Prior to this one, I&#x27;d say the Josie Maran was the best.  But the tan physics is perfection!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No foul smell....not even after 12 hours!  This in itself is a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color guide is useful without being so dark it looks awkward on my super white skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washed off easily from hands.... (bar soap is the way to go with this or any self tanner by the way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective!!!  I can get a nice tan hue in one application.... Typically need at least 2 for me... Which then ends up in streaking and uneven color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A pricey....ordering direct from tan physics is the only real option.... Would love to see Amazon stock this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small company with no retail presence.... Scares me that someday they will cease to exist :(</li>
            <li> I usually have orange streaks when using any tanning lotions or sprays, but with this to my surprise I was streak free with a nice even tan.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice product; low odor but still DHA like !&lt;br /&gt;Wish the tan would last a bit more than three days !</li>
            <li> I love the way this goes on no streaks beautiful shade ... really great color tan I love it hsve recommend this to all my friends and co workers.</li>
            <li> I used the product over a period of several days and it did give me a little color, but after about 5 applications my boyfriend said I was starting to look orange. I will use it again for a shorter period of time; it&#x27;s too expensive to waste!</li>
            <li> works well, not orangey and did not smell bad.  it a little thin so putting on evenly causes you to hafta do it in two coats to make sure there is no streaking but was a good tan color, no orange to it at all.  i never ever go out in the sun so i have tried most of the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brands of self tanners, and so far this one is at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> Awesome product highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I apply this with a brush I received with a Bare Minerals product.  The first time I tried it with my fingers and didn&#x27;t like the look. Then I tried it with the brush and i liked the way it looked because it looked more even and natural.</li>
            <li> Tan Physics was very easy to apply and was the first time trying instant tanners in over 10 years, therefore a good pick for a newbee,....at first.  With all the conditioners and special ingredients, it also made my skin feel very soft and moisturized.  I also liked that it dried nearly immediately and has virtually no odor. I would not go back to using this product, however for several reasons.  At first, I was pleased with the results and how quickly I started to show a hint of color.  After about one week, I then started noticing streaks on the inside of my arms that were not completely covered with the lotion, as well as yellowing around my ankles and on my hands and fingernails (especially when I would be out in sunlight).  I also noticed that although it gave me a hint of color, it would not get any darker than just a &amp;#34;kiss&amp;#34; of color. I also finished the bottle in about three weeks.  For the price, this seemed to me to be an expensive product should I be interested in using it throughout the summer.  I have since read some reviews about Fake Bake and just started this product about one week ago which I am very pleased with.  It has only been about one week, so it may be a little early to tell, but I am already seeing a shade of tan that is closer to how I naturally tan from the sun.  The ingredients in Fake Bake work with each individual person&#x27;s pigment to achieve color results that fit you, therefore the overall results seem more natural.  The application is a bit tricky, but I am much happier with the results of Fake Bake, thus far and would recommend this product over Tan Physics.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use this product and have a tan without sun bathing, but it still gave an orange appearance like other sunless tanning lotions. It is better; however, it still gives a slight orange appearance. My skin tone tans to a golden brown and I was hoping this would do the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product of its kind I have used and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works as it says it will and keeps me from having to spend too much time in the sun.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> A much saver and healthier manner in which to add a little color to ones complexion!</li>
            <li> Very strong smell and orange color.  Did not use and after reading the reviews I threw it away.</li>
            <li> This produces a realistic tan and doesn&#x27;t smell offensive. I have had many complements on the natural color.</li>
            <li> I love this product...I am a sunworshipper..love to lay on the pool and tan..however nowadays the risk for cancer is very bad...ive used this product on my face and neck for 2 years..its wonderful..although my face is tanned to start with..i do not turn my face into the sun..I keep that privilege for tan physics...its so natural looking and very very little odour of any kind...my face has &amp;#34;RAW BIOLOGY ALL-IN-ONE LIQUID FACELIFT&amp;#34; gently dabbed on twice a day and organic aloe is a must..im a senior with such a wonderful colour on my face &amp; neck without the lines ..I ONLY WISH THEY WOULD MAKE THIS IN A SPRAY FOR MY BACK AREA WHICH IS EXTREMELY HARD WITH THIS LOTION TO COVER EVENLY.</li>
            <li> Love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin orange. It does have a little of that nasty smell during the transition,  but after your first bath, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Product goes on easily but you can barely see the color.  There are better products out there for less money.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says I&#x27;d used properly. You have to exfoliate and make sure it&#x27;s we&#x27;ll blended around joints. The only con is that it turns my skin a tad orangy after repeated use instead of brown. Maybe that&#x27;s just my skin tone though.</li>
            <li> Great color no streaking it gets darker as you reapply a second third time. To maintain it you only have to use once or twice a week depending how dark you want to look. By far the most natural looking color!!</li>
            <li> It seemed to give me an orange tint.</li>
            <li> its a good lotion i just dont use it but maybe once a week just want a littlecolor not alot .</li>
            <li> I used it once. Just on my lower legs to try it out. Immediately washed my hands thoroughly with soap.  The tanning smell is still on my hands a day later. Very strong smell. The only reason I tried this product was because of users saying no smell at all. And, there is no return label or instructions. Red flag!!</li>
            <li> It smells terrible and rubbed off on my clothes so I only used one time.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned.  It just doesn&#x27;t give me the color that I desire.  I have talked to darker skin people that use this product and they really like it.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery! The product is great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product. It has a great natural looking color for me, my skin is fair. It doesn&#x27;t look orange at all, it&#x27;s very even no streaking.  I have some patchy stuff around my hands but that was my bad...I washed them after application. I used a mit to apply. I saw instant results.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, does have a yellow tint. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!!! It gives the most natural tan that I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a self-tanner....and I&#x27;ve tried everything. It is a little pricey but you really don&#x27;t need to purchase the exfoliating and extending lotions to achieve the natural look. I ordered all 3 but I&#x27;m only reordering the actual self-tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery! A+++</li>
            <li> Works great. Will soon order another.</li>
            <li> this is actually my second purchase for this product. I bought some last year. It gives you a great instant tan and for added darkness, just apply the next day. I get a lot of complements on my color after the first application. I like that it conditions my skin and I don&#x27;t get splotchiness around the creases of my arms and behind my knees like some tanners do.  I have referred the product to many of my friends</li>
            <li> Color was o.k. on my legs but as other products I have tried, no good around the feet area.  Jergens is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> Not so orange as others</li>
            <li> Very good, has a pleasant citrus smell at first, but that old familiar fake tan odor sneaks thru. It does streak and leave blotches if you don&#x27;t blend well. The color was very natural looking. I have very fair Irish skin</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS SUNLESS TANNER, BUT I ONLY GAVE IT THREE STARS BECAUSE IT STAINED MY BRA&#x27;S AND LIGHT COLORED/WHITE TOPS. IT DRIES QUICKLY, BUT IT STILL DIDN&#x27;T STOP IT FROM GETTING ON MY CLOTHES. MY ADVICE? BE CAREFUL IF YOU&#x27;RE WEARING WHITE OR LIGHT COLORED CLOTHES.</li>
            <li> No orange glow.  People ask me in the office if i spent the weekend outside.  Nope.  Huddled in my room like a hermit.</li>
            <li> Too much tint. Be careful!</li>
            <li> If you are skeptic about this product, I was to BUT Try it. YOU WILL LOVE THE RESULT. I use to spend so many hours/days/weeks in a tanning bed because I hate laying out in the sun, NO MORE. I love this product and will continue buying it. YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO. TRY IT AND SEE</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting this even on my body. Idk why.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no odor, dried quickly.  A little light, but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> One word...F A N T A S T I C!!!!!  Absolutely love this stuff. I put it on as directed and my tan was great, looked like I had been in the sun all day.</li>
            <li> Love love love  this!</li>
            <li> It does streak, and it does turn you orange.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Highly recommend.  Best part...odorless!</li>
            <li> Great product. Never any yellowing. Looks like a sun-kissed tan without the sun damage to my skin. I&#x27;ve bought thisproduct  several times and will continue to in the future.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition. Can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li> Only sunless tanner that I am not allergic to...Finally!!</li>
            <li> this don&#x27;t work on fair skin</li>
            <li> Not a good color.  Has that weird smell too.  I Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it. Waste of my hard-earned money $$$</li>
            <li> Tan Physics is one of the best &#x27;sunless tanning&#x27; creams on the market.  The color is almost instantaneous and about as natural as your going to get with one of these products.  You initial application will be a learning experience and you should allow time to learn. The main &#x27;secret&#x27; I found is to use the MINIMAL amount smoothed on EVENLY to cover the area you want to &#x27;tan&#x27;. If you want it darker, it is easier to do a second application but not so easy to reverse the process.  This is particularly important if you have (like me) blonde hair and a light complexion. Ex-foliating beforehand is strongly advised. Also the usual cautions about application to elbows, palms, hair and clothing should be carefully observed.  Moles and other skin markings, by the way, will also be &#x27;tanned&#x27; and get darker but this can be controlled with a damp tissue or Q-Tip handy to wipe these areas immediately.  For me, a touch-up every five days is fine.  Caution: This product has NO SUN-SCREEN!  If you&#x27;re tired of running around looking pale, this is one of the best ways to get fairly natural looking color ... but ... USE WITH A SUN-SCREEN!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I used product like this.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely satisfied! Goes on smoothly, no streaks ( I was afraid of) and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find it any better then some products I&#x27;ve paid a lot less for in local stores. It was less sticky and dryed faster though. Smelled better when you first put it on but as soon as you start to sweat or put your clothes on, it started to have that weird smell.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive, and works no better than the cheap brands.  My skin streaked as badly as any other tanner.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I use with gloves to protect my hands.  Works GREAT! No streaking or weird lines.  I use 1x week and it has not faded.</li>
            <li> great color..no streaking</li>
            <li> love it..natural color, smells nice and easy to apply</li>
            <li> The best tanner I have found, by far!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - truly natural looking tan.  I have tried all the others - this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I rarely post reviews but I felt compelled on this one because I was SOOOO excited when I heard of this product and really wanted it to be my &amp;#34;silver bullet&amp;#34; for fake tan since I am prone to skin cancer so I have to rely on fake stuff to have any color on my pale skin.  That said, I&#x27;ve used MANY over the years and this one worked ok but cost Much more than most (like 4X).  I will not order again and will likely stick with my personal recommendation of Neutrogena as it produced equal results for about 1/4 the cost (about $10 vs. $40 for this stuff!!  crazy price).  Good luck with whatever you use!</li>
            <li> I have actually tried them all and this does rank at or near the top...as with all self tanners results are dependent on your personal skin tone.  On me this is a nice rich tan with no orange or yellow undertones after 2 applications.  It is moisturizing and has what I would describe as a light citrus scent.  The only downside for me is that it is on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> bottle was openned and partially used.</li>
            <li> Not very satisfied!!!!! could not tell the difference in it and other brands I have used!!!!</li>
            <li> It far exceeded. It looks so natural. Do to medication I can not be in the sun. I have tried every product to get a tan. They smell so bad, they turn you orange and your elbow and ankles look nasty. This product does not smell bad or cause bad reaction. Everyone that has seen me thinks my tan is natural. The cost is more than worth every drop. At this time I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product.  I suggest this product for everyone.</li>
            <li> I am an avid self-tanner and do not recommend this product! They have paid enormous amounts in advertising so that you will think that this is the best, newest innovation in self tanning..which it is NOT. Look again at any article claiming that this is so \\&quot;great\\&quot;..it&#x27;s a paid advertisement. Also- this stuff is atleast $20 cheaper from the actual website \\&quot;TanPhysics\\&quot;. Tan Physics also does not endorse purchasing from any site other than their direct website due to freshness of ingredients. This does make a difference when applied. And yes, I&#x27;ve purchased one bottle from each (their website and Amazon). Amazon bottle was older, and smelled more. The bottle from Tan Physics was not as bad, but still wasn&#x27;t better than the store bought stuff I normally use. Be smart, and forget this product.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the product &amp; the results of self tanning, I would have to say I would not purchase it again due to the cost &amp; size. I&#x27;m not convinced it worked any better than some of the drug store brands. If the company can manage to reduce the price of the product I would be more than happy to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is not as advertised - leaves my ski blotchy even after dermabrasion of skin  and it is yellowish</li>
            <li> I used it consistently for a few days.  I don&#x27;t notice any significant change. Granted I have only used it a few days...&lt;br /&gt; I love the scent!  Sweet citrus smell rather than the obnoxious self tanner smell.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what the ad made it out to be. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I like the product, one thing is because it doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey. Most of the products out there bother my eyes and sinuses real bad. I was expecting to rub it on and have an even tan everywhere. it does streak a little and splotch a little. but overall I would still use it and would still tell people to try it. It might just be me.</li>
            <li> I have been trying for years to find a self tanner that doesnt streak, sink into every crease or make me embarrased to get close to someone the next day because of the lingering smell.  I have to say that i was very impressed with this product.  The color is great and the very light to almost no smell makes it worth every penny if that is a big deciding factor.  The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because it does not last long at all and fades patchy, not even like other brands i have used.  However, I am still a fan of this product and will definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> It take awhile to get the tan you want but it seems to be working. I do love the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> Guess I am spoiled with St. Tropez Bronzing mousse! If I had time to apply for about a month ahead of time I might like it better.</li>
            <li> Love it- works great!  No more burning my body and wasting time lying in the sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good self tanner, but not as flawless as reviews had lead me to hope for. It does have some odor, as with most tanners. I began to smell it a couple of hours after applying.  It&#x27;s not strong, but enough to make me notice it, and hope people around me didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Used it on my face and it washes away.  Every woman washes her face every day! For $40 I really thought this would have some staying power. Even one star is too much for this product!</li>
            <li> just started using it, have applied it 3 times, don&#x27;t see much of a change yet, but I can tell you even after washing and scrubbing my hands they are still stained, I really don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> Granted, my hopes for a sunless tanner that didn&#x27;t streak, wasn&#x27;t orange and didn&#x27;t make you smell like dirt weren&#x27;t too high..... I was  suprisingly disappointed by this product. It does smell better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. However, the color never really developed, no matter how many days in row I applied. It goes on with a little color and (when applied in the morning) develops by evening... it never gets darker than the one use. What&#x27;s worse it completely washes away with any shower or bath or face wash.You&#x27;d be better off with a tinted lotion or moisturizer. Especially considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my L&#x27;Oreal tan wipes. They stink and slightly on more orange side... but definitely get you tanner and they&#x27;re cheaper!</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly! Product is non streaking, and does not turn you orange. Gives you a subtle tan result, so you do not look unnatural.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.....paid way too much and it doesn&#x27;t work.  Going back to my store  brand.......wasted 43 dollars.  It does smell good.</li>
            <li> Good but if you use too much skin becomes orange.  Use lightly every 4 to 5 days and the color was more natural.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money. This product has no tanning ability at all. Just a regular lotion. Amazon should label this as a scam.</li>
            <li> There is no horrible self tanner smell and it wears off great but the end result of the tan you get is not a very dark.</li>
            <li> Great color, no odor. Used on a variety of friends with many shades of pale...looked natural and smooth on all. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Rub in like a lotion. I have fair skin. Color is good!</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  My skin is older and I know some dark spots will show.  They would show if I went out in the sun. This is a lot safer than going out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Does not have a strong smell and it is easy to rub on.  Instructions were limited but just used what I remembered from other self-tanner instructions.</li>
            <li> It works very well but very expensive,  good for your face but too expensive to apply to the whole body, it only takes about 3 applications to the face for nice color and then after every-other day.  But many applications to the body for color and then the $46 bottle will only last a week.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used for a true color sunless tan.  I cannot use tanning beds and was impressed at how wonderful this product worked.</li>
            <li> If you have fair skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.  I used it for 3 weeks straight and it hardly made any difference in my skin color.</li>
            <li> I think the product is great. Most of the other tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past had an odor that was not pleasant. Tan Physics not only covers well but has a nice scent. Definitely rate it a  5.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak, goes on easily and is the  best  product I&#x27;ve used so far.  Would use it all year round because it makes my legs  look  great.</li>
            <li> Works great. No orange or streaming. Gives you a natural look. I would buy this product again. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I completely love this product! I typically order one bottle at a time and the last time I went ahead and bought 3 so I don&#x27;t run out! This lotion goes on smooth and it easy to spread. It doesn&#x27;t look orange at all! In fact it looks like a natural tan! I even use it on my face. I get so many compliment all the time! I recommend this product over any other on the market!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of self tanners. This one is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. It works best on clean shaven skin but also gives color otherwise.</li>
            <li> I typically stay away from self tanner because of the odor and the color of the tan. Nut Tan Physics is entirely different. It does not leave your skin with an after odor and the color looks like a tropical tan that I get when I am in Hawaii. I love this product. It is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many self tanners and hands down this is the best. No gross smell. Easy to apply. Lasts a long time. I have yet to make an error while applying.</li>
            <li> I use this every day instead of being out in the sun all the time (don’t want any more wrinkles!) Speaking of wrinkles, I usually follow it up with some SKingenixx Vitamin C serum [[ASIN:B00VXE0EEY Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex!]], and now I have wrinkle free, tan skin. Very happy</li>
            <li> Love this it&#x27;s exactly what it says, odorless. Great Lasting color. No streaking. Just a wonderful safe alternative to tanning.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it in my opinion.  I have a toddler and don&#x27;t have time for anything too fussy to apply, or too long to dry.  This stuff does NOT smell bad like other tanners I&#x27;ve tried, it dries super-fast, and the colour is lovely, not orange.  It&#x27;s not dark right away, but since I&#x27;m pretty fair, I actually prefer that, so I don&#x27;t look fake.  I can gradually increase it until I find the shade I like, then just maintain.  It also makes my skin feel ridiculously smooth and supple.  One bottle lasted me a whole season.  Buying again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using Tan Physics and find all their product claims to be true.  No odor or streaking, making application easy.  Quickly absorbs so doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
            <li> Very nice, real looking, haven&#x27;t had any streaks. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Many people have voiced their displeasure with this product but it works very good on my skin.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Really like this product for sunless tanning; looks very natural even on my fair and &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin.I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  I&#x27;ve used several self tanners that are much better than this.  It had very little&lt;br /&gt;color.  I couldn&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;d used it.</li>
            <li> Was nice but do not think it was worth the $40.  Use Loreal Sublime for $10 and get just as good results.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle and used it over the next three days.  I followed the directions, avoided ankle, knee and elbow areas directly and washed my hands after each application.  I found  some of the tanning color rubbed off on my under garments, my sheets and my white towels.  After the third day it was finally sunny in my area, and I walked out into the sunshine and found my skin was orange in the sunlight, and no matter how hard I avoided the ankle, knee and elbow areas the solution built up, and I actually rubbed it off.  In my opinion this product works no better than the otc sunning products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Nice as long as used per directions</li>
            <li> This sunless tanner is amazing.  No other  sunless tanner I&#x27;ve tried gives a totally &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; looking tan - or has SUCH a nice smooth, non-sticky feeling without an odor.  It feels so good on my skin.  (I even use it on my face and I have very sensitive skin).  I have been told I have a beautiful tan and when I said it&#x27;s &amp;#34;from a bottle&amp;#34; the response was &amp;#34;no way&amp;#34;.  I will recommend this great product to everyone.  I love it!  (Sounds like one of those reviews I&#x27;ve read on some other item and wonder if it is just &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.  I know this is not &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; as I just wrote it!).</li>
            <li> This product by far is the most expensive waste of money I have ever purchased. I got a better tan results from $8.00 lotion from Walmart. Not only does it stain your hands even after washing them,it stained my shirt.NEVER PURCHASING OR RECOMMENDING THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> DOES NOT LEAVE YOU ORANGE AND DOES NOT FADE OFF WHEN WASHING.  WORKS VERY WELL. I LOVE THAT IT DOES NOT LEAVE YOU BLOTCHY</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t look at all like I thought it would.  It turned orange and did not even out and tan at all.</li>
            <li> Truly the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with great, natural color -- plus the benefit of a moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve tried many other tanning products and I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> Better than all the other spray on tanners I&#x27;ve tried. More of a natural color</li>
            <li> Product goes on very easily and looks very natural! It also does not have that strong odor most self tanners do.</li>
            <li> It streaked and didn&#x27;t really give me significant color .. Not worth the price and I&#x27;ve used every product on the market</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, her comments, quote: (This stuff is a joke, you wasted your money) no return on top of that. Can I give these people no star ?</li>
            <li> Turned me orange just like the cheap ones. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I guess it works, sort of. This is my first and last try at a fake tan. We&#x27;ll get summer sun soon enough, I hope.</li>
            <li> I love this tanner. I goes on even, has an amazing brown NOT orange color and it has no scent!! Just got two more bottles.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> No stars!  I was taken in by the ads on facebook!  It is a useless product.  I used it for 2 weeks every day.  Truly no smell and no streaking...because there is no tan.  I feel ridiculous.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have very pale skin and I live in Florida so of course I want to look like I have some tan without laying out and burning! I bought one bottle of this from Tan Physics website. I put this on after exfoliating and I love the color! I don&#x27;t look fake just a little color.  I have also tried other stuff. This is the best for me.  I&#x27;m 60 yrs old and finally have a nice tanned appearance.  I will not be putting it on to deepen the color..just a little once a week will do for me! I would look silly with a dark tan!  This is a product that I will be keeping in stock for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a color of its own which helps it to go on even and really helps out. You should have a hand mirror to look at places you can&#x27;t see and if you see blotches...just rub it in more.</li>
            <li> does not seem to give me color....</li>
            <li> I love it.. The color is nice, not yellow and it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> did some on line research and found this product for my girlfriend... got it directly on line from tan physics website... bought 5 bottles and 1 tanextender for $ 20 a bottle... no tax or shipping... she loves it... we were spending $14 a week on 2 bottles of banana boat at walmart ...it was the best of the cheap ones but it was orange ...smelled and made her skin dry ... and it was $56 a month ... the 5 bottles of tan physics has lasted almost 3 months... looks natural... smells good and makes her skin soft as silk... and the tan extender is nice...total cost $120 fo 3 months... the banana boat cost was $168 for 3 months and we got a way better product... and a tan extender... amazon is charging way more for it thru 3rd party sellers... go to thetan physics website and start your order and then back out or dont complete and they offer u free shipping and discounts... good luck !</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, so need to be careful what I use.  I have not used this on my face, only mostly on my legs, sometimes arms and neck.  Legs look nice and tan.  Goes on easily, color sets fast and does not come off.  No odor.  Just be sure to rub it in and wash off your hands, as you will have tan palms otherwise!  I then dry with a paper towel to be sure all color is off hands.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw the ad, but it really worked for me.  Wished it came in a bigger bottle.  I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> it is not too bad,  ut it does leave orange marks on the older women who have age spots. it seems to get in them and turn orange. Not bad for the face but its just like all the others  not fantastic results as it says</li>
            <li> Very nice product with good color and NO odor at all. Would recommend this to try. I am very fair skinned and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I never like tanning creams. They smell. They streak. I can&#x27;t imagine why i actually bought this, but guess what? It is really nice! The best looking tan I have ever had on my fair freckled skin. It lasts well, fades evenly, does not rub off, does not have that distinctive odor that tanning creams have, and makes a very even golden tan. I REALLY LIKE IT!!</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from Tan Physics (much better pricing); and received (3) bottles within a week.  I must admit it didn&#x27;t work as I would have liked it too - BUT - I often have products not work for me when they do for others!  This product did have a WONDERFUL scent to it, and I didn&#x27;t end up smelling that icky smell that most self tanners have!  I definitely would recommend to shake the bottle VERY well before using.  When I decided to return the product, I sent an email and this company was VERY PROMPT about instructions and processing the refund-no questions asked!!  Again - GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
            <li> I read several reviews of different products and decided to splurge abit on this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good!  The directions are specific; I followed them and it looks great!&lt;br /&gt;The color shows up immediately and gets darker as it dries.  It looks really natural!</li>
            <li> After having skin cancer twice, from baking myself in the sun all my like, I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and switched to sunless tanners.  I must have tried 10-15 different brands in the last two years!  They all either smelled really bad, looked orange, or made a huge mess and transferred onto my clothing for days!!  Then I tried Tan Physics after reading it was rated #1 by one of the beauty magazine I read.  When it came I was hesitant to put it on, so it sat on my counter for a few days then I tried it and WOW this goes on just like lotion, you can see where it&#x27;s going on, there are no streaks, no orange color and no transfer onto my clothing!  Believe me if you want to try a self tanner, this is it!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sun sensitive skin, read horrible rash from just a little exposure. 50+ sunscreen doesn&#x27;t protect me for long. I&#x27;ve tried most every tanning product out there and I always looked orange or streaky and smelled horrible. This product gives me a nice healthy glow that I can build to a light to medium tan (I&#x27;ll never be really tan) and it has a pleasant scent. If applied as directed there is no streaking. I&#x27;m very pleased with Tan Physics.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and stays on longer than any other self tanner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It works great. I really like it. It gives u a glow that makes you feel like you&#x27;ve been on vacation</li>
            <li> Definitely have to be very light with this stuff but when you get it down the tan it leaves is gorgeous! And toothpaste is perfect for getting the self tanner off your hands! Your welcome!</li>
            <li> Tan Physics sucks and is five times the cost of Banana Boat self tanner!  Same exfoliation and rubbing time, but dries out faster than Banana Boat, which leaves rings that imply you haven&#x27;t showered in a week!  My arms look like a dirty little kid, even though followed all instructions!  Didn&#x27;t get a return label to be reimbursed!  I never go out in the sun, so I rely on fake tanning products and am somewhat of an expert.  BANANA BOAT ROCKS!!!!</li>
            <li> So after reading the numerous reviews - mostly &amp;#34;not so good&amp;#34; to a few &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34;, I think I am going to stick with what I have been using for the past 2 years - Famous Dave&#x27;s.  Note I am not at all affiliated with this company.  But their products are wonderful.  I have tried many sunless tanners over the years, and Famous Dave&#x27;s has been, so far, the most consisent.  No smell, good color and last for about 4 to 5 days.  I did really want to try Tan Physics, but for now I am going to pass.  Disregard the above star rating - I had to put that in to post this review.&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it. I had tried this product once before ordering it again this time. Before I completed this latest order, I read the reviews and noticed a number of negative ones. It astonished me, since my previous experience had been so positive (that&#x27;s why I ordered it again this time, despite its high price). I have tried every brand; and when used sparingly and as directed, this one beats all, wih no streaks, a true, warm shade of tan, and the least odor of any other brand I have purchased. As far as the price, a little product goes a long way, so one bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunless tanner I have used that does NOT break my skin out.  It looks very natural and I love it!</li>
            <li> Very happy with tanner. Hardly rubs off at all.</li>
            <li> i liked the bronze look, but i had to use it about every three days to keep the color. i would consider buying again.</li>
            <li> It was a typical self tanner that left me orange. It also left a lot of blotchy spots. Not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells great, goes on evenly and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. The color is perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Looks very natural and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Beautiful realistic tanl</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product and goes on so smooth and even, it would get five stars but the price is crazy.  I use it very sparingly.....only on face, neck and arms then use a less expensive tan cream for the rest.</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed in this product...bare essentials is the best and I fell into the hype for tan physics!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best!  Everyone was sold out and I needed it for a trip to Florida. Of course found it at Amazon.  I used it for 5 days prior to trip-- natural, golden, medium tan!  Love it.  I washed my hands with soup 4 times while applying to avoid discolored nails.  Remember to exfoliate before applying.</li>
            <li> Tried with high hopes but this product is smelly and slow working....result is not noticeable.  I am sticking with Jergens Natural Glow as it works, least odor and it is cheappppp!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! It is amazing! I had color after the very 1st application, and looked natural! Love the smell too! You&#x27;ve got to try this!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner that I have ever used. It looks good on and doesn&#x27;t turn orange.  Smells good too : )</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS~ looks natural and no streaks!</li>
            <li> Have tried many of these sunless tanners (I am very pale and prefer to not expose my skin to the sun!)  and this has been the best of the lot!!!&lt;br /&gt;Goes on nicely, but two light coats are needed for me without streaking, one coat doesn&#x27;t seem to do it.  Would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Produces an orange effect</li>
            <li> Got this quickly and as described. Using it and it&#x27;s simple to apply, dries quickly and the color looks natural on my fair skin. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> wish it was a little less expensive but it does the trick, great color after 2nd application and no small at all. this is the only one i have tried that doesn&#x27;t have an oder and i have tried many.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading an excellent rating on line. cost way more than the stuff I had used before and the results were terrible. I can&#x27;t get it on without streaking and the color is strange. definitely not worth the money. I will go back to the cheaper stuff. the results aren&#x27;t perfect but way better for way less money.</li>
            <li> This product is overrated.....Not as good as thought...</li>
            <li> Wonderful!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT NOT ORQANGE AT ALL</li>
            <li> This product is amazing never thought it would work as well as it does been using for a month everyone comments on my tan. I let them know it&#x27;s tan physics sunless tanner</li>
            <li> I purchased this hoping I could have color fast. I put it on Monday, Wednesday then Friday and still had no noticeable color.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid and the guarantee they boast I was not impressed. I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> Tan Physics works for me, I find that it doesn&#x27;t leave the orange glow &amp; applies evenly, feel confident about using it with out other knowing the difference.</li>
            <li> THE ADVERTIZING SOUNDS BETTER THAN WHAT THE PRODUCT DOES......it does allow for some color to your skin yet it does still spot like other products.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. It spreads on evenly and a nice color. It smells good and lasts for about 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural looking tan year round try this product.  Have been using for about 8 months.  Everyone thinks I just came back from sunny vacation (I live in the North).  Easy to use, make sure you rub in completely and comes out perfect everytime.  Used on face all winter and now using on arms and legs as well.  None of the problems associated with sunless tanning products have occurred.  Will be using for many years to come.  A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t worry about the cost.  It is the best product.  Shipped immediately, was at my door in 2 days.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell this product did anything.  Jergen&#x27;s natural glow worked better and it&#x27;s only $7 per bottle.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very nice...not greasy, absorbs quickly, very easy to apply , no odor...great color!  Best sunless tanner yet!! I will order more!</li>
            <li> This product offers great color without any odor! I&#x27;ve tried many products and this by far is number one!! you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> A very natural looking product. Only draw back is it&#x27;s cost.</li>
            <li> Works really well and has no odor.</li>
            <li> Nothing much else to write: it is a horrible self-tanner. Maybe not as bad as Tanfastic, but Tan Physics is every thing wrong about self-tanners.</li>
            <li> The pictures are exadurated. I did not find this item to be any better than its competitors. I was hoping it would be like the pics.</li>
            <li> I have no other options now - skin cancer is costing me a fortune and although i LOVE the sun - i have to stop tanning.  So - I&#x27;ve tried a few different self tanners and recently got Tan Physics - and i love it.  I paid a small fortune for  a spray tan at a highly recommended spa - and it was horrible.  With Tan Physics I can control where/how it goes on - and the color is beautiful.  It really looks natural and that horrible smell is absent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It cam to me quickly and it works very well. I will buy more when i am out of this.</li>
            <li> I obtained very impressive results with this product.  It is indeed true that the scent is pleasant.  However, after a few hours on your skin, it does begin to have that same self-tanner smell.  It is not as pungent as other manufacturer&#x27;s formulas, though.  I highly recommend this and will never go back to using anything else again.</li>
            <li> It does work on my old skin. Could not even tell that I applied it</li>
            <li> This gives just enough color to let me enjoy going out in shorts after a LONG winter.  I have been quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Kind of wish I had bought a bigger bottle.  It&#x27;s easy to use, smell is good, color is great, no streaks and no orange glow.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably the best one I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Not sure why majority of previous customers do not like this product, I find it to be the best sunless tanner on the market. A tad expensive, yes, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product! It&#x27;s has a very natural looking color and does not have that fake tan smell that so many products have. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best, completely NO SMELL, self tanner that I have found.  Not only is the color almost instant, it continues to deepen.  You must be careful to completely wash your hands after applying (and I mean a two or three washings with lots of soap) before the the color penetrates, and be careful around knees, elbows and ankles (as with all self tanners) but the overal look is natural and nice color.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work i used tan towels hsn works much better like 100%</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I ordered it, but I really do like it. It will streak if a person is not careful in the application. I have had a little trouble around the wrist area. I will purchase again when it becomes empty.</li>
            <li> I did minimal skin prepping and am very fair skinned. This is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. Absolutely none of it rubbed off on my white sheets and has no smell after its applied. You won&#x27;t end up with orange palms if you wear latex gloves and you won&#x27;t get streaks if you keep your fingers together when rubbing it in!</li>
            <li> SWEAR by this product!!!  Smells good and gives a nice even tan.  Isn&#x27;t drying at all!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I read through the reviews before I bought it.  Some people said it streaked, others said it was orange.  I think if it is streaking on people it is because they are using too much.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t wash off in the shower the next day like I read also.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my pale white skin, including my face, using only two fingers to rub it in at first.  Just doing one body part at a time.  The next day everyone said &amp;#34;wow, you look tan, were you on vacation?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I think the color is great and if you wash your hands with soap immediately afterward you won&#x27;t have any discoloration to your palms.&lt;br /&gt;Another way to apply is to wear gloves first when applying to large body parts like your legs and torso.  Go very lightly around your knuckles and ankle bone and elbows.  I love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected.  Didn&#x27;t change my skin color at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> just upset i didnt get it on time wanted it for my trip the postage said 3 to 5 business dsys i ordered it jan 26 it went out jan 27 i should of at least had it that fri jan 31 and my husband said it came tues feb 4th so i am upset</li>
            <li> It does what it says, but I have also purchased tanners similar that were much less expensive.</li>
            <li> love this product. color goes on smooth and developes quickly. nice smell</li>
            <li> Great product, and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Been using it daily for two weeks with no noticeable difference.  Will keep using until gone.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Looks real and does not streak!  Will reorder.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest rip-off I have ever experienced.  The product did nothing that was promised and everything it promised not to do.  It was terrible.  I contacted the company and they refused to refund my money.  I purchased the product at the end of last summer and they informed me it was too late to request a refund.  It was the worst product I have ever spent money on.  I would not recommend this product or conducting business with this company in any form.  Buyer Be Ware</li>
            <li> Product works great and will continue to use the product. Will recommend to friends and family. A good value. Also, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall great product and price.  Better than other self tanners I have purchase or tried in the past.  Perfect coloring, too!</li>
            <li> It is the best sunless tanner that I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been using them for over 30 years. It&#x27;s more natural. I find it looks better if you have a little base tan.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is as wonderful as it says. No funky orange color. Many of my friends have bought it because I use it and they can&#x27;t tell if I have been outside or not!</li>
            <li> Has a funky smell for days after you use it. I couldn&#x27;t stand the self-tanner smell, so discontinued using it.</li>
            <li> This tanner is a little pricey but it goes way beyond what any other sunless tanners can offer.  The application is super clean and the smell is great-slightly citrus.  The color does not have that orange cast like other tanners I have tried and the best thing I found about Tan Physics is that it does not get on your clothing, bedding, or towels. Even though is cost more than most others, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ll purchase again!!</li>
            <li> promised not to be like the other self tanners but still streaky and orange in color. leaves stain on clothes</li>
            <li> happy with product, easy to apply and it does go on smoothly, lasts a few days and then I reapply to keep&lt;br /&gt;the look I want. would recommend this product and would  buy again.</li>
            <li> It works better then though. thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Great color, long lasting, goes on smooth, smells great!</li>
            <li> The best sunless tanning I have found!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product. I have used many tanning lotions in the past and they streak horribly and look even worse as they are wearing off. I paid the exorbitant amount for such a product with their claims of no streaking and natural looking. For me, it was a streaking mess and I simply dumped the rest down the drain. Unfortunately, I had to also endure the inevitable flaking streaks as it wore off.</li>
            <li> No streaks. Looks like a real tan without the sun spots and cancer. I love it.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well. Nice shade after just one application. A little hard to see when putting on so coverage was uneven at first.</li>
            <li> I did not feel it lived up to it&#x27;s promises in the advertisement for the product.</li>
            <li> Orange. That is pretty much it. Should have stuck with the Jergen&#x27;s that I have used for years at 1/4 to 1/3 the cost. Orange legs....how embarrassing. ugh...</li>
            <li> Great color. Easy to use. No problems.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply ... no muss no fuss ... looks great ...</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t bother with this, cooper tone works just as well  and not as pricey .  Drys skin out more then most tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> It really is better than the others.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Easy to apply, dries quickly, and produces a very natural looking tan.  Fragrance is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I was no better than any other ran and I was really disaapointed considering the price I payed for it</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend my time writing reviews but I HAVE TO get the word out on this product! Scam!&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that should&#x27;ve set off red flags was their website. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. I went to their website and read through their articles stating how great this product was. Of course, I believed it. I payed $30/ 8 ounce bottle and I bought three of them plus shipping. Pretty darn expensive. I was thinking that I would get what I payed for!&lt;br /&gt;So, after exfoliating and prepping my skin, I spread it on my entire body. I am fair skinned and tend to have very dry skin. This product did not stick to my legs (most important), neck, bust, or belly. Within hours, half of it had rubbed off, even though I had let it dry and wore loose clothing. After one night, I woke up to find myself orange and smelly. It smells like a mix between cleaners and pee-- hot pee. I also noticed, a couple days with it on, that it makes me have terrible BO and now, after two days I am itching like crazy. It feels like I have the plague. My skin is dark orange in some spots and other spots are white again. DEFIANTLY wear gloves!!! It wasn&#x27;t a nice brown tan either.... It was light goldeny orange and splotchy. HATE IT! :0 My skin just burns because it&#x27;s so dry. The exfoliant which came with it was like any other-- except more expensive! The lotion which you can buy to prolong your tan is weak and smells bad too. I usually don&#x27;t hate tan lotions this much, but EWWWW!&lt;br /&gt;Whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy it. You will regret it...</li>
            <li> Unlike most sunless tanners, this one seems to work for me.  It doesn&#x27;t darken my spots and doesn&#x27;t look fake.  It does dry my skin somewhat, so applying every couple of days and moisturizing in between seems to help.  Definitely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Made my skin real dry.</li>
            <li> This is a hoax , this product gave no color to me whats so ever ..  Saw it advertised all over &amp;#34; Facebook &amp;#34; ..I actually don&#x27;t have a nice thing to say about this product .. If I was the company making and selling this product I&#x27;d be sued ..</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, as I have had two bouts of skin cancer and try not to spend that much time in the sun for a nice tan. However, I found this product no more impressive than the $7 bottle I can get at the store. I feel it was just as orange, and it definitely left streaks, and creased in back of knees and inner arms. Disappointed in the hype on it.</li>
            <li> Not too happy.  Does have a tendency to get orange.</li>
            <li> It does have a tendency to streak. The color is good. would not buy again due to streaks.&lt;br /&gt;Too pricey!</li>
            <li> Really works well with no orange tinit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the expensive side but the color is okay. It takes a while to develop and doesn&#x27;t smell particularly great but it&#x27;s whatever.</li>
            <li> I love the product. Best I have ever used. As with all bronzers you need to watch the heal, knee areas.</li>
            <li> Gives great color, but dried my skin out a bit.  Have to use a daily moisturizer as well with it.</li>
            <li> Great product that works as advertised.  Easy to apply with good results. Pleasant fragrance with great emollients. Great for starting your tan before you go to the beach.  While it doesn&#x27;t provide any UV protection, it mitigates that lily white look.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care specialist,,and have tried a lot of self tanners,,,,,and by far this is the great one!!  No oders,  no orange  color,  the color is beautiful!!!  And its not drying for the skin!!!,</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this tanner at all. I&#x27;ve been using sunless tanners for over 320 years and know how to use them for maximum effect - this one claims to be the end-all. I  can&#x27;t believe I fell for it. Jergen&#x27;s, Banana Boat, L&#x27;oreal, Clarins....all are better.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing a self tanner and it seems to be working out fairly decent. Still have to be careful about how much is applied at one time.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It gives my reddish, Irish complexion a beautiful color, not too orange, it also makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite self tan item!  Goes on evenly, without any off odors or streaks.  Product leaves a nice color, no orangies!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many sunless tanners and this, by far, is the best yet!  Every other one I&#x27;ve used has an awkward smell after applied; this one did NOT!  It&#x27;s is a very real looking tan &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using self-tanners for years and this is without a doubt the best. It&#x27;s no more expensive than Clarins, which works well, but this dries more quickly and gives a more natural looking tan without any weird odor. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is the beat self tanning product I have ever used. There is absolutely NO awful, lingering smell like all the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I do not see it working</li>
            <li> dries somewhat orange tint..fakey looking..</li>
            <li> I only use this product on my legs and feet.  Gives natural color, except on toes.  Gives a rusty uneven, and unattractive color.</li>
            <li> Excellent, if you have brown spots this will make the brown spots turn orange. Just cannot get the orange out. But as far as a tan, it is very nice and looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> Great color, no streaking. Smells pleasant when applying it, however, there&#x27;s a familiar self tanning lotion odor to it that is not horrible, it&#x27;s just not a scent I like... I will continue to use it, but am anxious to wash it off the next day! I try to wait for the following day to shower, but that&#x27;s just me... I don&#x27;t know if I lose less color or not. The color stays for 2-3 days as long as you don&#x27;t exfoliate it off!</li>
            <li> you really have to keep rubbing in the lotion in until it is absorbed. Color is great and builds up gradually so you wont overdue it.</li>
            <li> Its fast and no streaks, the only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long. Fades too fast.</li>
            <li> YOUR SKIN LOOKS ORANGE!</li>
            <li> product works great, you can see a change just after applying to your skin, no orange tinge like so of those other products. using a little goes a long way. and the bottle lasts quite a long time. great product highly recommend. [follow as directed]</li>
            <li> As long as u spread the liquid good snuff tan looks real. I have no Clothes transfer or funny smells!!</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this product, it is the same as others, does not cover as was advertised. I feel I have just thrown away $50.00</li>
            <li> I love the color.  It looks very natural and it goes on smooth with no streaks.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am a spray tanner and I use this to extend my spray tan&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Ok guys we all know tanners Stink .This one stinks less I can barely smell it. It does not streak.no orange either and I&#x27;m super pale. And it dries very fast.  Just had a spray tan last week before I got this product and this product works way better then the one I paid $$$ for which lasted a week.</li>
            <li> I have tried many self tanners but this one is the best!! No fake bake smell and soaks right in. Very impressed!!</li>
            <li> Color is great.  Wish it was available in a spray, not just cream.</li>
            <li> Looking Good with my tan</li>
            <li> I was hopeful this product would work, but the color was barely noted on my already pale skin tone. It was a pricey gamble and I lost. I&#x27;ve found much better results with Victoria&#x27;s Secret self tanner, which I have bought in-store for under $15.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did an excellent job of giving a gradual authentic-looking tan.  I loved the fragrance, and it was easy to apply since it colors the skin as it is applied.  I only used it twice--two days in a row.  I have very sensitive skin and felt a slight irritation on my legs.  It may not have been related to the product--hard to know.  I also exfoliated before I used the product, and only used it on my legs.</li>
            <li> I just ordered Tan Physics for the second year, those products and I have tried many do achieve a tan but the build up on your skin. I found myself having to exfoliate (to  extremes) , approximately every couple of weeks because there would be places that the color was coming off.&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance on Tan Physics and would HIGHLY recommend this product. I have a Doctorate in Health Science &amp; Community Education, so I did my research on this product.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t see available was the application mit&#x27;s, I found those to be very useful, and also reduced the unwanted coloring of fingernails &amp; palms. I hope those who read this will find it helpful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Completely different than that other stuff that does a chemical change on your body and stinks.</li>
            <li> Not as i expected from all the great reviews.  Does not last more than 1 day/</li>
            <li> Returned with no problems</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Not streaky.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t smell weird like the rest of then and has the least amount of streaking of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried. It also moisturizes my skin. However it still streaks a bit.</li>
            <li> Best I have had, need I say more.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the product. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations. I have used it multiple times now as I wanted an period of analysis beyond just one or two uses to base my opinion on. Everybody always seems quick to throw out negative reviews in general no matter what the product, but less likely to make positive ones even when clearly appropriate. After all, how often do people complain about things such as poor service at a restaurant? All the time obviously. Then think how often do they give praise for quality service? Not nearly as often...most I think just feel it is expected so therefore no praising is in order. Well, I&#x27;m able to praise this product without hesitation. I&#x27;m a guy with fair skin and a history of skin cancer. My dermatologist has literally forbid me to be in the sun at all for the risk it poses to me. However, I desire to have somewhat of a tan, don&#x27;t have to be golden dark brown, just don&#x27;t want to go around as white as a sheet! I have purchased a bulk amount of tan physics products  awhile back and have used them for about two months now. I have applied their product as they directed and the results have been wonderful. I have not detected any objectionable smell and the tan has lasted several days as I have also purchased their extender product. I think the key thing is that I followed the directions to a tee...the cleaning, exfoliating, drying, etc. It is somewhat of a process and perhaps why so many posted negative comments if they did not apply correctly. I simply state that I went to the trouble to apply it exactly as they said and the results have been very good. My girlfriend has been very impressed and she now wants to use it too. I have no streaking, no orange, no dark spots and it is a gentle, mildly golden tan that is even and natural looking. That is the first impression my girlfriend had was that I had gotten this tan naturally in the sun and she was upset with me at first because she knows I&#x27;m not supposed to be out in the sun that much. That is one of thebest things about it IMO, is that it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;artificial tan&amp;#34; look! Very naturally looking tone and I&#x27;m especially happy with how my legs look with tan physics. The product is a little pricey, no doubt, but I can&#x27;t honestly let that affect my rating as it works so well and most people know in this world, generally you get what you pay for. I have purchased cheaper self-tanners and in the end, the result they gave looked cheaper as well. I highly recommend Tan Physics as a great tanning product when used and applied correctly.</li>
            <li> I had an allegic reaction.</li>
            <li> I find that it works really well but there is definitely an odor to this product.  . I just make sure I only use it at bedtime.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic even on weather damaged skin.</li>
            <li> It did not give me a tan as much as I paid for it I am going back to Jergens, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected thought I would get some sort of glow but nothing just made sun spots appear more</li>
            <li> To begin I have used the Jergens Glow for the past 5 years, however after seeing Tan Physics in a magizine article  I was excited to try this.  Immediately upon receiving it I was spectical , it was running down my hand as I put it in my palm, but decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  I have bee trying as instructed since I purchased, sorry to say it is awful. It dries your skin and then it flakes off just like dry skin does.  I am back to my Jergens Glow and can purchase four of them for less than one mod the TP.  Gave it a shot but did do what promised</li>
            <li> Great stuff. No smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used self tanners for years and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I love it, it gives a real natural looking tan, right away.  Just be careful how you apply it. ok.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Goes on with no streaking and looks like a real tan</li>
            <li> Gives you just the bronze color you want and easy to apply.  I tanned for years in the sun and tanning beds, but my skin has taken a beating, not I stay out of the sun as much as possible and use Tan Physics.  Shop around for best prices.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly, dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Great color quick! Best self tanner&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found. The only downside is that its a bit pricey at $40 a btl, but I use it nearly&lt;br /&gt;every day &amp; 1 btl lasted about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with this product...just didn&#x27;t have the finish I desired, and I have tried a lot of sunless tanners....however this product does not make you smell like the other tanning products, and that is what was  pleasant :-)</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the browning color left on palms even after washing.</li>
            <li> very messy and washes right off as soon as you put it on so really not something your looking to buy for a color to stay on, I won&#x27;t buy again waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Do not use this product if you have dark spots, sun spots or age spots. It will make the spots turn a dark orange and show up worse. I am a white female 59 years old. I have some age spots and sun damage. This will not help minimize the spots.. IT MAKES THEM SHOW UP MORE!!!</li>
            <li> i have used self tannig lotion for years,  you add said this wouldn&#x27;t streak  well yes it did, I have gone back to my original brand</li>
            <li> this really is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used.  No smell, good color, lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li> Best sunless tanner on the market</li>
            <li> BEST SELF TANNER EVER!</li>
            <li> It washes off. Color i barely got color from it.  Not happy with this product. Didnt do what it says it was gonna do or give u the color.</li>
            <li> Love this product healthy and safe no chemicals!!!</li>
            <li> I rarely write product reviews but the amount of money and shipping I paid for this item requires action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fell for the line that Mayo Clinic endorsed this lotion and am now taking some of my very precious time to disclose that this product is useless. I should have been happy with the awesome Banana Boat Deep Dark Color Self Tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used for the past year but I read an online review and excitedly purchased this product. Now I feel like a chump, am 53.00 lighter, and my face broke out because this product contains oil. I used it for two weeks to test the color application and there wasn&#x27;t a significant change in color or tone to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am editing my review for this morning I found myself wondering just how is it that Mayo endorsed this lotion? I&#x27;m such a chump! I KNOW BETTER: Non-profit organizations are not in the business of product endorsement. Notice how it reads as a Mayo endorsement? It doesn&#x27;t quote a specific physician referral or reference a clinic test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a former Director of a non-profit and know the ropes* so I went searching, landed on Mayo&#x27;s site, and read this: \\&quot;Mayo Clinic maintains a distinct separation between advertising content and editorial content. All advertising content on Mayo Clinic&#x27;s health information website or in one of our newsletters is clearly labeled as an advertisement\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money with this product and its disingenuous marketing and allow me to tell you how to achieve a great lotion tan. Use the Banana Boat product which you can buy at Target (where it&#x27;s cheaper than Walgreens).  While in the shower use baking soda or a scrub brush to prepare your skin. Baking soda is a great exfoliate. I use it as a scrub for my face. I also use it under my arms because it absorbs orders and I&#x27;m at the gym everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once dry, apply the Banana Boat Deep Dark Color. The lotion works better than the spray and it&#x27;s more cost effective. I&#x27;m not orange, there&#x27;s a very mild inoffensive odor, and the lotion is tinted which helps with application. I use it on my arms, neck, (don&#x27;t neglect the back of your neck), chest, and face. I apply it to my legs in the summer. It seemed pointless to apply it to my legs this winter when everything was covered due to the severe cold. Allow the lotion to dry on your skin 5 mins (while brushing your teeth. Rinse your mouth with baking soda, it will make your breath fresh!)before putting on your socks or other tight clothing which will make the color uneven. Especially socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had a break out occur on my face when using this product. A light sheen presents which I remove with a oil control film. Clean and Clear makes the film product that I use to remove the sheen from my face and its a great product for oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t remove makeup just the oil slick on your face. I also use a soapy nail brush on my palms and under my finger nails after I&#x27;ve applied the lotion. It will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t scrub your palms and under your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in years which is why I use the tanning lotion. My women friends, people at the gym, and strangers always tell me I look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference in price is awesomeness. The Banana Boat Summer Color is in a 6 ounce tube, lasts for four to five months, and is less than 10.00 with tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose wisely and follow my research. It&#x27;s YOUR hard earned money. Ask yourself why you want to believe the hype. I&#x27;ve reflected on this and decided I really thought this would be better. Too bad for me since my system already worked really well. As my Mother used to say, If it isn&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it. Also? You may want to consider those glowing reviews of this product were provided by those who have an investment in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loreal makes a bronzing lotion that has glitter in it. Avoid that too because as the lotion drys the glitter will be on your clothing. I had a small pile under my desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve come back to edit my review because I&#x27;ve just read some comments from people wondering why I wrote about \\&quot;cred\\&quot;. I didn&#x27;t realize some many people weren&#x27;t aware of how a non-profit organization operates. I hope this is easy to grasp for those who don&#x27;t have any exposure or experience. Non-profits receive funding from various and often divergent sources. FOR THAT REASON they cannot endorse a product. This was my sole point for mentioning I&#x27;m a former Director of one: I knew better had I reflected.&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve come back to edit my review because I&#x27;ve just read some comments from people wondering why I wrote about \\&quot;cred\\&quot;.

            <li> Best product of this type out on the market. First learned about it on one of the national morning shows. Expensive, but avoids skin cancer which I have experienced.</li>
            <li> Its not worth the money..I am not impressed with  the product.I would not buy it again, pricey for the size of bottle</li>
            <li> I ordered online through the Tan Physics website, after reading more reviews I decided to cancel. I clinked on the support link they sent in my confirmation email and all emails to them bounce back as undeliverable. I have tried to phone them and after several minutes of a very annoying recorded message telling you a representative will be with you shortly another message comes on telling you they are closed. This feels like a giant rip-off to me.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! No odor!!!</li>
            <li> I feel compelled to share. Left noticeable streaks. I prepped accordingly- washed, loofah and all. Tried to avoid the usual places- palms, elbows, knees, but still had streaks on calves, forearms and the like. And has a smell.  Not worth the price. Save your money here folks. Avoid the hype.</li>
            <li> Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> There is another brand I like better, get quicker results with longer lasting results. I&#x27;ll go back to it.</li>
            <li> Really works!  Nice color, not Orange.  Only areas where I have trouble is on the ankles and tops of feet.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to use every day for a long time</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using Tan Physics because it is odorless.  It is easy to apply and does not look like you have applied a tan lotion.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of sunless tanning since every time I have tried it there has been discoloration, in every brand. I read the reviews on this item and decided that this product may be different. Well to my surprise it was not unique and didn&#x27;t keep up to the guarantee that it states when you buy it. First off, it is VERY expensive for what it actually does. It claims to have no streaks and no odor which is entirely false. I don&#x27;t have streaks as bad as just an overall orange color which looks very unnatural. The smell at first doesn&#x27;t seem bad at all when applying, just wait till that night when you are sleeping though. It smells so bad and even after showering over and over again I&#x27;ve had trouble getting that scent off. Not a big fan at all, once again disappointed with this self tanner crap. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  Seriously be warned, save your money! This is not worth it, any drugstore brand will work the same for 1/3 the cost, this product is all hype, all spawned by internet advertisements, the real truth is unless you are whiter than a ghost you will not tan at all using this! I have light olive skin and got a slight orange tint is all, not a tan by any means and it is just as streaky as most of the others. I&#x27;ve used a lot of different ones in the last 10 years and this is not impressive at all!  The only positive thing I can say is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as some others.</li>
            <li> also disappointed in this product.....</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product. It barely gives you any color no matter how often you apply it. I would not purchase this product again. I was very disappointed after reading such great reviews.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD.... Turned orange  very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> The worst tanning product ever!!..I am an olive complexion and it still looked like crap on me..If you are white with no real color to your skin please do not bother with this garbage..The color was not believable..even after I painstakingly applied the product the right way...can you say &amp;#34;ORANGE&amp;#34;...Trust me when I tell you..Clarins has the best self-tanner on the market..especially the one without bronzer...but the bronzer is good too!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great color, fast results. I put it on before bed, shower the next morning and look like I just got back from vacation!</li>
            <li> Great tan! No strange odor. Lasts days before needing touch up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as they say. no streaks. Coming off, just use lotion and loofa for a couple of showers when you&#x27;re thru with the look.</li>
            <li> VERY nice tan in a can :) no yellowing or orange tinge</li>
            <li> This stuff is MAGIC!!! not if your pale tho, i had a base tan going when i used it and it helped that tan last a couple months longer then it would have otherwise.</li>
            <li> Tan Physics turned me streaky orange and it has a strong odor - the exact opposite of what they claim. I am not happy that I fell for this false advertising and wasted $53!</li>
            <li> Lives up to its hype of no lingering smell and no streaking unlike many other tanning products I&#x27;ve tried.  Has to be applied 2-3 times in order to achieve other than a light tan but lasts well.</li>
            <li> The product certainly colors the skin; however the result looks like any other tanning product on the market and the price is significantly higher.  It&#x27;s not worth the high price.  The color had an orange tint to it, and there was definitely the after-smell that comes with all tanning products.  I would not purchase this product again - unless I could find it at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li> By far the best self tanning product on the market!!  Have tried several.  This is very natural looking with no streaks!!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The tanner gives nice color but still has the awflul smell after applying.....  I was very disappointed that the smell lingered.</li>
            <li> Worst. Honestly, this barely changes your skin tone unless you apply three quarters of the bottle on at once. I bought it because it&#x27;s supposed to be more natural, but it&#x27;s a huge disappointment. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I liked it.  I liked the fact that it did not have an adverse ordor.  I would have liked it to add a deeper color in a shorter time.</li>
            <li> This is the ABSOLUTE best self-tanner EVER!  Love the color, scent and super soft skin after the easy application</li>
            <li> Love it no mess on your hands looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Good product. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other self tanners. Tan doesn&#x27;t last that long though for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Very expensive and doesn&#x27;t tan as well as cheaper products. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy about this product and will never order it again it doesn&#x27;t do the job and it way over priced</li>
            <li> The best selftanner I ever used!  Worked for 10 years in the cosmetic industry and sold high end brand names (including self tanners).  This is better.  No unpleasant smell at all.  The scent is fresh and citrus-like.  It has an initial bronze tint that allows you to see where you apply the lotion and disappears as you rub it in.  The color looks even and natural, &amp;#34;not orange&amp;#34; even on the face.  As always you should exfoliate first for best results and carefully wash your hands afterwards to avoid tanning the palms.&lt;br /&gt;Kelli</li>
            <li> does what it claims, Looks natural no streaking.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I can actually skip tanning for awhile and it looks like a real tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy a cheap Buff Puff at the grocery store and exfoliate once and while due to it starts to clog my pours on my face after several applications and gets uneven all over.  So I take it off and start again.  Love the color and a bottle lasts for many full body applications.</li>
            <li> Great self tanner &amp; doesnt leave you with that fake bake smell. I have tried so many that stink. This is the best I have ever tried</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works. It also doesn&#x27;t have any funny smell either. Highly recomended!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, smells great, is not sticky, drys fast...</li>
            <li> natural look and did not rub or wash off easily</li>
            <li> What a look my wife has and it is so clean and distinctive it looks so real. She loves it.</li>
            <li> The pros- absorbs and drys quickly, nice smell. The cons- way too expensive, gives only a hint of color with each application,  and you&#x27;ll need at least 4-5 before a tan is seen. Definitely will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Tan Physics does give you great color! I loved that it really did look natural! The problem is it also gives you giant zits. I&#x27;m talking the big fat, 2 inch giant boulder pustule on your face kind. I have really been blessed, and have great skin, so it&#x27;s rare I ever get a zit, but I have never had the massive reindeer nose kind. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was tan physics or some other kind of make-up. So I stopped using it, and my face went back to perfect complexion. Every time I used Tan Physics again after that, out would pop a giant pustule boulder zit! I stopped using it completely, and I&#x27;ve never had that problem again. User Beware, if you are going to use this, keep it strictly to your arms, and legs, but keep it far, far, FAR away from your face!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give my skin an orange color.</li>
            <li> No it did not  it hardly showed any color and had to be applied daily for minimum results. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Tried many.... the best I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li> best color ever!  does not streak or rub off on anything</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product.  First of all, no matter how hard I scrubbed my hands after application, my palms are still darker than the rest of my body.  Also, the color is orangish, and you need 2 applications to really see the difference. I was expecting wonders from this product with the price I paid for it, but it is no better than any store bought brand out there that I have tried.  I am extremely dissappointed in it.  Also, I did make sure that I scrubbed my skin smooth before I applied it.  I have been purchasing Sun Laboratories Self Tanning Lotion for the last few months, and I am going to go back to using that. It is half the price with shipping and the results are better in my opinion..</li>
            <li> I have tried many tanners and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> (Not James, I&#x27;m his wife, we share this account.) I Have VERY sensitive skin, I&#x27;m also very fair skinned, it&#x27;s nice to have a product that I can use in the summer to look tan. Does not turn you orange either, just a very &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; glow. Smells good, like oranges.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  After my husband has several basil cell carcinomas removed, I became Leary of trying to get that pretty summer tan! This product gives that look!  No streaks or orange coloring. I bought a second bottle:)</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, very natural!</li>
            <li> Works really well. Not Orange; No Streaks; Wont stain your hands.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be the No.1 rated self tanner there is but it is not. My sister and I both tried this self-tanner and it left terrible streaks. Yes it does tan you a lot faster than other self tanners but who wants a streaky tan. I suggest Jergens Gradual Self-Tanner Mousse. Jergens is a good self tanner.</li>
            <li> Love it. Make sure you wash off your hands and in between your fingers after you put it on. I used it every day for a week to get the color I wanted. Now I use it every other day. I recommend it for a gradual darkening, but not a quick one .</li>
            <li> This was a reorder.  A little bit goes a long way, so my first bottle lasted me about 3 months (much cheaper than a tanning place) so don&#x27;t let the price point scare you off, it&#x27;s worth it.  This is the only self tanner I&#x27;ve found that lasts for several days without the need to reapply.  I grew up in a beach town and tanning in the sun was my favorite hobby .. but as I aged and saw the negative affects of sunning beginning, I looked for an alternative way to have that tanned look .. this product actually does look like an authentic suntan, rather than an applied self tanner .. and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> The best that I have tried.</li>
            <li> IT goes on evenly and almost immediate color change to the skin. No streaking and no bad smell. Slight odor goes away fast. Best&lt;br /&gt;that I have used. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love this stuff no orange and I look like I just came from Florida!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous types of sunless tanning products including lotions, foams, sprays, etc.  I&#x27;ve also had monthly memberships for unlimited spray tans in tanning salons and a couple of times a year I get manual spray tans in salons.  I will pay for a good lotion because I like to have a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; in the spring and summer and don&#x27;t tan well in the sun nor do I want to increase my chance for skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s good about Tan Physics: 1.  the color- it gives a very natural looking color, it also fades after a few days without becoming orange or patchy. 2.  it&#x27;s not greasyand dries quicky- I can put it on in the morning and then get dressed for work 15 minutes later without it feeling wet.  It doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my clothes, however, just a little bit on my bra if I don&#x27;t wait long enough.  3.  scent- It has a citrus smell that I don&#x27;t smell once it dries 4.  easy to apply- it blends well on the skin and doesn&#x27;t streak easily.  Because it does dry quickly, you have to apply it quickly and wash your hands immediately. Something that seems to help is after washing the palm of my hands I put lotion on the palm of my hands which prevents the tanning lotion from absorbing into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to use a generous amount to get the color I desire and reapply every few days so it is a costly product.  Overall, a good product and that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Cost is outrageous for the size!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Jergens + Firming Moisterizer for years. Costs $7-8.00 for a 7.8 oz. doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and won&#x27;t streak if you apply properly after you shower!</li>
            <li> Excellent product bought before</li>
            <li> I like the product, my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptic when I first bought this but very happy after my first application. No streaks, it looked like a tan and no jaundice look. I went to work the next day and was asked many times : Have I&#x27;ve been in a tanning bed? And my co-workers were amazed that it was a sunless tan and that it looked so natural. I could definately feel that it made my skin softer. A very minor smell but  I also had a smell from tanning beds so that did not bother me at all. I plan on buying this often.</li>
            <li> I do not give out 5 stars easily, but this one would have been close. Dries fast, can see where applied to get an even natural looking tan. I keep it applied on my legs and feet throughout the year. I read on Amazon that a customer prefers the less costly Banana Boat cream ( not spray ), which I have been unable to find. Seems a lot of people like it since it is always sold out in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> smells great dose not work well on a white girl like me :(</li>
            <li> Not sure if the people giving bad reviews are using this the wrong way or if they just have unrealistic expectations. I used this last year before a trip to Florida and it worked well enough that an airport employee asked why I was already so tan on the way to Florida in January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A with any sunless tanning cream,  shower and dry off. Apply a normal skin lotion first. Let that soak in and then apply the tan cream. This stops the streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;any hair will get tinted bronze as well, so use care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this lotion does smell pretty bad, I&#x27;ll agree on that. However it works very well and looks natural. Buying some again this year for my trip.</li>
            <li> do like this product!.  Pretty good value compared to others and it doesn&#x27;t streak if you rub it in evenly .  Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> It was better than anything else I ever tried.  But it wasn&#x27;t great.  Just okay.  It did have a smell to it.  Not as bad as others, but it did.  If you wear cologne with it you still smell it a bit.  It was still streaky, but again, not as bad as most.  Orangy somewhat, so they haven&#x27;t perfected that either.  So that&#x27;s why I am giving it a 3, it&#x27;s just okay.  I would not buy another bottle of it.</li>
            <li> Not what is claims, washes off and gets on your clothing.  Also only smells okay at first... next day.. Same smell as others.</li>
            <li> very disappointed did not like it at all was supposed to be so good very bad</li>
            <li> Came on time. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This product claims to be the best but the color is streaky. I&#x27;ve used every self tanner available and st Tropez is still the best. Tan physics is a slightly sticky lotion that adds just a little color but not evenly. It fades out horrible and creates splotches on the skin even with proper exfoliation. It doesn&#x27;t have a self tanner smell. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works well. had some troubles around the ankles, but there is a caution on the label.</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much</li>
            <li> Product does not work any better that the much cheaper versions you can buy in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I found that when I exfoliated and used my mitt to apply, it covered well.  I put it on and dried it with my blowdrier just before bed.  In the morning, it appeared a little splotchy, but after I showered, it evened out.  It also does not fade rapidly and lasts almost a week, which I attribute to me applying body lotion daily after I shower. The product still has that self-tanner &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; (not as bad as some I have used), but it practically goes away after the first shower.  The only downfall for me is that it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I expected, but will give it a try because I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this faithfully as directed for 2 weeks and the results are minimal.  Definitely won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I did not like it--it had an odor like any other sunless tanning lotion--it also had streaks---not worth the money if it is the real thing--nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> No streaking! Love it! Little expensive but nice color. Have to apply couple times to achieve a darker color.  Like to see in stores.</li>
            <li> It just  did not work well does not give  you an even tan and is hard to apply don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  Works fast looks natural. A little pricey but worth it!  Doesn&#x27;t smell great though!  Couldn&#x27;t it smell nice?</li>
            <li> I have used numerous self-tanners over the years and this surpasses any that I&#x27;ve used thus far.  Typically the color tends to pool into an orange-y mess around my heels and toes no matter how well I have exfoliated beforehand and meticulously rub in. But this one is different.  The look I get is surprisingly natural. And the very mild citrus smell is a plus.</li>
            <li> This did not change the color of my skin at all.  I even used it a few times to make sure.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  NOT GOOD!  It is so orange it took days to get the orange off my hands from putting it on.  I used both the sunless tanner and extender.  I still had orange blotches/streaks and it does have a smell.  I have returned the product and have yet to get my money back.  I called and was told they were taking care of it right away, but have nothing.</li>
            <li> Interested in Tan Physics Sunless Tanner after reading an AOL&#x27;s rave news review, I came to Amazon shortly after skimming through the Official Web Site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Like most veteran Prime Amazonians I read Q&#x27;s and A&#x27;s and compare pricing before purchasing a new product.  I was surprised by some unsatisfied customer complaints, but it was an unanswered question as to why Amazon is charging twenty dollars more per bottle than the actual cost on Tan Physics official website which prompted me to investigate further.  I returned to Tan Physics Official Website and found the answer to my question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  FYI, Minus the email address not permitted in posting, I copied the following statements verbatim for you directly from Tan Physics Official website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Tan Physics is NOT available in stores.

            <li> Was expecting more because of rave reviews!  It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad right when squirt it out of bottle but does when it is on you and the smell lasts for days!  Does dry quickly.  I ordered the lightest because I am very fair-it is subtle orange.  My legs are not shockingly white anymore but still not the most attractive either.  I wish I would have seen more realistic reviews before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I paid the $40 and got ripped off.  That&#x27;s not to say it doesn&#x27;t work, it does lightly tan you each time but it still streaks and smells just like any other tanner.  Save yourself $30 and just buy the cheaper self tanners.  Waste of money here.</li>
            <li> Repeat order, that should say it all.</li>
            <li> Great color, no orange tint! It&#x27;s essentially odor free, and goes on nice. Provides good color!</li>
            <li> This lotion stands up to its reviews.  Great subtle, buildable color and the lotion doesn&#x27;t have a heavy metallic smell on your skin after just a short time.  After about 12 hours it has a faint metallic smell, but you should be hitting the shower by then.  Great dark brown color to the lotion so you can see where you&#x27;re putting it helps to get it even.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and gives instant color but turns skin blotchy and uneven after you shower and reapply a few times. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Loreal sublime bronze is less expensive and works just as well for me.</li>
            <li> Best I have used so far.  Mixed with a little moisturizer for coverage..</li>
            <li> The best self tanner I purchased.  No streaks, quick dry and a beautiful deep tan.  I love it</li>
            <li> Did the job &amp; didn&#x27;t have that self tan smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of self tanners. This is by far the most natural and easiest to apply. I love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE. LOVE. LOVE the smell and the color is very realistic!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply any looks natural!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, just make sure you apply evenly with no streaks.</li>
            <li> This has exceptional color.  Goes on faint and turns out very nice.  I am fair skinned and love this product.</li>
            <li> Best tanner ever. It is deserving of all the great reviews. Goes on silky smooth with a little color right away so you can put it on evenly. Color is perfect. Smells great.I have very light skin. The more you use it, the darker you&#x27;ll get. I only use it on my legs but with this product I think I will try it all over. Wash your hands when your done or they&#x27;ll tan too! It&#x27;s not cheap but I&#x27;m saving money from the one I always used that I bought from the make up counters. This one puts them all to shame. Zero orange! Not even a hint. Just a perfect tan.</li>
            <li> When you go over your face ONCE with this lotion each day, the tan is great!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I had to on this product.  I feel it is a scam.  I&#x27;ve applied it 5 times and can&#x27;t see any results. I&#x27;ve even tried applying it generously and still no results.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not good for very fair complexions. You have to reapply it every day to maintain the color you finally achieve and it looks splotchy and shiny on your face.  I was very disappointed with thus product and if I could get my money back I would!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about it. I love it! It does not have the orange tent like a lot of the self tanners. It seems to blend well. Just have to make sure you distribute evenly. Looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have been an amazon prime member for years and buy absolutely everything on amazon but never leave reviews. I took the time to leave this one because I&#x27;m a 32 year-old female who always felt like she needed to tan outside or in tanning booths in order to look and feel healthy. This sunless tanner has changed my life! No more sun bathing for me! I tried this product and have used it twice so far...the results are amazing. No streaks. Perfect amount of color that looks completely natural on my skin tone. And, even though I was very reluctant to put it on my face, I gave it a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Now I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup bc it gives my skin color! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> if you have age spots, moles etc, forget it. this is for unblemished young skin. the pictures you see, don&#x27;t believe. notice they have no flaws!!!</li>
            <li> I do like the Tan Physics, it goes on evenly and does not have an odor at all.  I would like to use on my face. Has anyone had good results using on face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this a 4 star rating because I feel it is over priced.  Should not be more than $30 for the bottle.  I would buy it again if the price is lowered.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Produces a very nice tan and smooth skin.  Best product out there.</li>
            <li> I have not bought it on Amazon, but last summer bought 3 bottles from their site. I only use it on my legs. It does not smell and it&#x27;s more golden colored instead of tan as some pictures they show. but my main thing I like is that its ingredients are better, not all the bad for you chemicals such as most store brands. So I will try it again.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a good product! I made the mistake of applying a moisturizer first and should not have done that (blotchy).  The best part of this product us that it does NOT make my skin itch.</li>
            <li> Works well without leaving you looking like a fake. I think it is a keeper. Telling all my friends, better buy 2 bottles at a time.</li>
            <li> This product works like it says it will. It gives an even, natural looking tan. I will buy it tear round.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet. the reviews were so good I could not resist. If it&#x27;s bad I&#x27;ll make sure I tell you</li>
            <li> Promised not to make my skin orange or streaky.... That&#x27;s exactly what it did. I was very careful when applying, let dry, went about my day only to look down and see orange streaky legs... Nothing like the advertisement!  Very disappointed  a costly purchase with unacceptable results</li>
            <li> Awful didn&#x27;t give any color</li>
            <li> It really does not work that well I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great product that smells good buts doesn&#x27;t give you the orange or fake looking color. It was great to use before going on vacation when we wanted to not look so pale. Love it</li>
            <li> Red heads do NOT tan.......love this product!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment! This stuff did not do anything that the creators claimed it would. I would not recommend this stuff to anyone.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Creates good color</li>
            <li> I have not been to a tanning bed since I found this.. Use rubber gloves when applying and it blends so well.</li>
            <li> The best sunless tanner I have ever used.  It is easy to apply and has a fresh fruity smell (although eventually you will notice a bit of the typical sunless tanner odor).  I used it over several days to build a natural looking tan before I went on vacation.  The color lasted at least 5 days, just did a touchup when I got back home.  Make sure you wash your hands after applying to avoid staining your palms!</li>
            <li> Pro: The product really works!  If all you care about it a beautiful flawless tan, buy this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: If you are sensitive to smell, then you need to know that this DOES have a slight smell to it, (as all sunless products seem to) and it is strong the first night, noticeably in bed, when i was going to sleep.  I have a keen sense of smell, so maybe it&#x27;s me, however i find myself not using it much because i don&#x27;t want to smell that  odor at night.  It (the smell) does wear off  after 2-3 days, so if you plan for something special, keep that in mind!  The tan lasts for about a week.</li>
            <li> tan in a bottle is the best</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but, the tint is so light. You could barely tell it worked at all. Very disappointed for the price I paid😞</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, without that self tanner odor, however dissatisfied with it&#x27;s work.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it---do. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The tan looked nothing like the advertisement. Way to orange, and I ruined a good shirt.</li>
            <li> Nice smell not even color. My favorite is Jergens!</li>
            <li> The color turned out good, but I couldn&#x27;t get used to the smell. When you sniff the product in the bottle, it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell. After putting it on however, all I could notice throught the day was the &amp;#34;tanning smell.&amp;#34; I even had other people notice the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  I use it all over after a shower.  Give a nice glow and moisturizes too.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells good, easy and smooth to apply. A little disapointed with the quality of the tan.  Would I buy it again.....? Maybe. Do I think it is worth the price? No!</li>
            <li> The color truly looks natural. There were no streaks or uneven spots and the tanner smells delicious like an orange creamcicle</li>
            <li> This is by far the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used, no odor, no streaks and beautiful tan color! I use disposable gloves to apply. It doesn&#x27;t even come off during my night sweats! I highly recommend. Not sure why some say they got no color...mine is great!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Does tan, but not like the pictures show.</li>
            <li> Tan Physics smells wonderful when applying it and as the day goes on, it does not rub off on clothes or bed sheets and it dries almost instantly so for those reasons I would give it five stars but it barely gives me any color results.  I have applied it for three days straight and don&#x27;t have much color.  It&#x27;s too expensive for me to use every day so I will use this in conjunction with another tanner and use this as an extender type lotion.</li>
            <li> Product was open for shipment, so it was all useless upon receipt!</li>
            <li> This is true color, odorless and a great looking tan!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many OTC self tanning lotions, but they always seem to turn my skin orange. This self tanner is the best and worth the money. The first application I looked like I had been in the sun for several days; you&#x27;ll see instant results. Apply daily to get a rich dark tan. I&#x27;m sold on this product and you will be too.</li>
            <li> This product did have an odor, although not as bad as most self-tanners.  The color was also a bit orange on dark skin.</li>
            <li> All self-tan products use exactly the same ingredient -- dihydroxyacetone (DHA)!  They are basically all alike!  You are being scammed for your money when you fork over more than about $8 bucks for ANY of these silly self-tanners!  Save your money.  Sheesh......</li>
            <li> Great Product - does not leave your palms discolored ~ lasts as expected &#x60;</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with the product, way over priced and color was not as advertised. I would never buy again.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and easy to use.  I just use it for my face and arm right now.  I may expand as summer roles out.</li>
            <li> My husband is using this product, personally I am seeing no real results in his tanning experience.  Wish I could say more.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected. Nice smell and easy too apply. No streaks but use gloves to apply. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> In a word &amp;#34;fantastic&amp;#34;!! No running, staining or orange color - just a great looking tan. You got to buy and try it.</li>
            <li> Great buy,  awesome stuff.  i love it.  Buy it again and again.  Works well and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply (I use disposable gloves), smells great, dries fast, and leaves a natural looking golden tan.  I have brown hair, but my skin is so white it&#x27;s almost transparent. I&#x27;m always drenched in sunscreen (I always burn), but this builds a nice, realistic color on my skin.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin STICKY like other products I&#x27;ve tried. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> not sure about the product, didnt work as expected</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It gives a nice, light tan without streaks and it smells good.</li>
            <li> True, True tanning color!  It looks like I have been doing some serious tanning.  Very Natural.</li>
            <li> My favorite blend of tanning lotions. ? Fast ship</li>
            <li> Did not do what it advertises</li>
            <li> I only use self tanners and spray tans due to Lupus. I live near the coast so I have to have a product that looks real. Ive been using  St. Tropez for a year. Honestly it&#x27;s my preferred tanner because (1) its a foam easier to control exactly where it goes (2) you apply it with a mit so no product gets on your hands. HOWEVER it has a trace amout of sulfa in it which Im allergic too so I can only use it for special occasions. With that said I bought Tan Physics. It&#x27;s a great product! Smell is lemony and not over powering. It&#x27;s a colored tanner so you can see where it goes. The only reason I did not give it a 5-star is that I do not think it is dark enough. It would be preferable if they made, like the walmart brands and clarins and St Tropez, a light tanner and a dark tanner.... I think the more coats you put on the less real it looks. Other than that is is a GREAT choice and I will probably buy it again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok except the smell after you have it on a few hours.</li>
            <li> IT works about the same as other tanners even though it was advertised as the best tanner ever…it didn’t do much for me  .</li>
            <li> Love this tanner! No smell and applies evenly!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this stuff and so disappointed when I received it. The bottle is super hard and I have a hard time getting the lotion to come out. The plastic is just too hard to squeeze. I have to take the cap off and tap it on my palm to get any lotion out. It didn&#x27;t seem like the bottle was full either. I have used twice and not much left in the bottle and I had streaky results even after applying very carefully and massaging into my skin. Color seemed a weird brown color too, and not at all natural. I am very disappointed and will not be reordering. Will try the Banana Boat brand as some others here have recommended.</li>
            <li> It was spendy, but goes on very smoothly and looks dark right away - lasts a while also. Good product!</li>
            <li> A red head is what I am and my skin is pasty white with brown freckles. Up until this product there was no way around the orange tint/streaks of can tanning. Literally the butt of all jokes at the lake or at a backyard bbq with friends and family. Tan Physics is great because you get to build up to the tan you want and can maintain it. The product dries instantly(2 seconds) and there is no oily residue on your skin. The scent of the product is settle and it did not rub off on my bed sheets or clothing. Even at the lake with all the toweling off and applying sunscreen the tan never faded.  I recommend this product to everybody.  I would be shocked if you did not like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50-ish woman with pretty good skin (probably because I avoid the sun), and I&#x27;m fair-skinned.  I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena sunless tanning products for the last few years but hate the smell and didn&#x27;t feel like they look as natural.  I love Tan Physics!  The smell is pleasant and I need a bit of color in the product to see how I&#x27;m doing with coverage.  I followed the directions on their website, exfoliating and shaving my legs before application, then making sure my skin was totally dry.  A co-worker commented on how natural it looks.  I had to layer two applications (a day apart) to get even slightly tan looking, so I&#x27;ll just build it out from here and use my Neutrogena every now and then to extend the life of the Tan Physics.  I bought mine from eBay and paid a couple dollars less that the Tan Physics website.</li>
            <li> The best one I&#x27;ve ever tried, very pleased. It didn&#x27;t streak and was very easy to apply, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it</li>
            <li> I got a deep rich tan from this product.  It really doesn&#x27;t have a funny smell like some of the comments.  Since I used tanning products for tanning beds I knew hoe to appky it so it didn&#x27;t streak. Lot of compliments on my tan</li>
            <li> It made my skin look way too yellow.  For the price, it was not worth it.  I&#x27;m glad I only used it on my legs.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanner ever!! Such a natural looking tan!</li>
            <li> Disgusting do not buy this item!! i looked like i had orange dirt on my legs and black pores, and it streaked on top of all that. Luckily it scrubbed off after a bout 2 days. Dont waste your money- Luckily i was able to return mine.</li>
            <li> This has to be the first tanning product that doesn&#x27;t smell bad!  Also, it worked just as described.  I have tried many sunless tanning products and this, by far, is the best.  I know it is a tad pricey, but I could NOT stand the odor using the competition products.  My boss even said one day.. What is that smell?  I knew it was my tanning product.  I found Tan Physics True Color and bought it with no hesitation.  I love it.  Plus, with skin cancer scare here in So. California, I know that I can have a great tan without the sun!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to use this product yet but I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t come in light skin med skin or dark skim. I also see on my acct there are three orders when I only ordered one. I also only recieved one.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any darkening on my face plus none of friends have asked if tanning. I&#x27;m very disappointed so far</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried lots of tanning creams over the years. The color is the most natural that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! It really does give you a true suntan just like when you lay out. First product that I have used that does not make you look like an &amp;#34;umpa loompa&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> So far so good! We will have to see in a week how it does</li>
            <li> Love it.  Goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> Ive only used it once but the color looks natural</li>
            <li> Works great and very natural.  It can rub off slightly during exercise but washes out of clothes.  Kind of pricey but def worth it.</li>
            <li> This product smells bad and does absolutely nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste the $38.00 dollars because you can&#x27;t get it back, no paperwork comes with the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like natural tan.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin.  This adds color without looking fake.</li>
            <li> Great product. Looks like a real tan.</li>
            <li> It did not perform the way I had hoped.  I would use it everyday and did not see much change in the color of my skin.  I had to apply a very generous amount in order to get some color.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a moment of frustration with ALL the tanners (every single brand available off the shelf) I have tried that have left me greasy and given me orange clogged pores. I immediately regretted the purchase since it&#x27;s expensive and the advertising claims are waaay over the top, making it seem fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: it&#x27;s actually a light shade of brown instead of a shade of orange. When I switched to this stuff, my boyfriend thought I stopped using fake tanners and got a real tan. And two random people at work commented that I tan really well. A single layer goes on pretty light, which is frustrating if you&#x27;re just thinking bang for your buck, but it makes the tan look more natural and you&#x27;re less likely to have noticeable streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: It goes on like a normal moisturizer and dries as quickly too. I can slap it on before work and get dressed within five minutes. Other tanners are so greasy you can never tell when you&#x27;re dry enough not to streak, but this stuff just feels velvety and dry but smooth like a good cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell/Taste: probably just personal preference, but I like the smell and it doesn&#x27;t have any chemical-tasting residue leftover. The smell is kind of pineapple-y I guess? Pretty faint though, especially compared to other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am naturally a medium/fair redhead with combination skin tone (dry patches and get pimples if I use an oily product). This stuff is great for my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It does work.</li>
            <li> This is the best tan stuff I&#x27;ve used.  hardly any smell, and tans up quick.</li>
            <li> Product worked well- a little pricey.</li>
            <li> If you want to look like an orange I don&#x27;t recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I researched products, this is not what is promised. Very little color produced.</li>
            <li> Great,&lt;br /&gt;Just like real sun shine...It really works</li>
            <li> Best self tanner on the market. Provides even, natural-looking color without the obnoxious odor(s) of some tanners.</li>
            <li> BEST sunless tanner ever!  It goes on smooth and you can begin to see the color change almost immediately on your skin; especially on your legs.  You don&#x27;t have to wait long to have an instant natural looking tan.  It also smells nice, unlike other stinky tanning products.  I would highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;m definitely buying it again going forward.</li>
            <li> Fast turn around.  Part was as advertised.</li>
            <li> request a return authorization...received too late for trip to Hawaii&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t dare put it on because friend turned orange.......</li>
            <li> This is the worse, waste of money, and spotting, I&#x27;ve try a lot of self Tanning&#x27;s cuz I&#x27;m very pale, I have red hair and let me say this is the worse for sure, never again.</li>
            <li> This self tanner is nothing special. Works the same as other products. The product does not do what the advertising says it does.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT BUT I WON&#x27;T ORDER AGAIN.  TOO MUCH MONEY FOR AMOUNT OF PRODUCT AND I CAN BUY OTHER PRODUCTS LESS EXPENSIVE THAT DO AS GOOD A JOB.</li>
            <li> These self tanning products still turn Orange.  Regardless of exfoliating the ankle area gets Orange and uneven.  Color fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> You can get same kind of tan with other products out there that don&#x27;t cost so much I wanted to try it at least once but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of experience with sunless tanning products because I don&#x27;t want the harm that sun tanning does to my skin.  I researched and found this one to be highly recommended.  I tested it out on my legs only and exfoliated (but not with the tan physics defoliator that is recommended) before use, i still had a lot streaks on my legs.  I am going to try it again and use the defoliator recommended by Tan Physics and see if maybe I did it incorrectly.  Will post an update.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a pre-vacation gift for my wife so she would have a nice base tan to work on. She said that this was the best sunless tanner product she has ever used (although it was a bit pricey). Actually purchased a second bottle since the first was confiscated at airport security.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Even though I rubbed it in very well it still streaked on my legs. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> after 3 times or so my legs look the same, they may say I need to use more but at 30 plus dollars a bottle how many do I need. would not advise to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many sunless tanners and this one is the very best I&#x27;ve ever used. The color is not orangish- it&#x27;s a perfect tan bronze. I&#x27;m a medium skin tone with some freckles. It evens out my tone and my freckles blend with the color. My favorite part is that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell. It&#x27;s tinted so you can see where it&#x27;s applied and washes off your hands easily.</li>
            <li> Absolute waste of good money.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; feels great, but I&#x27;m not seeing much color change.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product</li>
            <li> Fake bake is the way to go you can buy it on amazon ano sallys. It can sit in your cupboard or on the shelves at a store for ever and still gives you an amazing natural color and instantly. Has virtually no smell to it and is supper easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Love this. It works really well. No orange tone.</li>
            <li> okay on the body,but not on the face....</li>
            <li> makes my skin dry and spotty after few days</li>
            <li> This is awesome,  really  looks like a true tan</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all.  Too Dark.  I can see some people might like it.</li>
            <li> it is not what everyone thinks it is .  used on my face just a small amount and after about a hour it looked horrible.... def not something i would recommend for anyone to purchase.  wasted my 37.00</li>
            <li> Have ordered this from the actual company before.  It&#x27;s the best sunless tanner i&#x27;ve ever seen!</li>
            <li> The color is nice and I like that it dries without much of a tacky/sticky feeling, however, I had to do several applications to get a decent tan. I am fair skinned,as well. The price is not worth it for me to buy&lt;br /&gt; again. I will stick with my drug store brand.</li>
            <li> not impressed with lack of color.</li>
            <li> love it! very little odor</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but boy it&#x27;s great!  No bad smell that lingers aswith other brands, and looks like a real tan!  Anyone know where to get it cheaper?</li>
            <li> I love the product,; great color, easy to use. It arrived in a very timely manner as well&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied &amp; would recommend both the product and the seller</li>
            <li> just what the wife wanted</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner I have ever used. Love it  but pricy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome - the only self tanner I have ever come across that does not smell or make you orange.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever used...and I have tried them all. Doesn&#x27;t streak, bleed onto your clothes or smell. A little goes a long way, and is extremely forgiving with application. Gradual color with not even a hint of &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I live in hot humid Florida.  This tanner is not for this kind of climate.  It \\&quot;melts\\&quot; off.</li>
            <li> They say there is no smell to this.... that is NOT true.  i purchased this because they say there isnt the typical smell.  Now I have an over priced smelly bottle of lotion.  My sheets even smell like it - I put it on the AM and went to bed at night and my body smelled of the typical tanning lotion.  SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like others, I fell for the marketing. I had recently tried Clarins self tanner and it was phenomenal....didn&#x27;t smell great at first and stayed wet for a bit longer than i&#x27;d like, but the color results were awesome. Then I read an online comparison that said the Tan Physics product was actually better than the Clarins, so I ordered two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most self tanners, it is a good idea to try it in an inconspicuous spot first in order to see how your skin reacts and what kind of color it yields. After 4 (yes FOUR) applications to the same spot, my skin color has changed exactly ZERO%!!! Not a single hint of a color change to my skin, nothing, zilch, zero, nada!!! Now it is time to put the their &amp;#34;you pay nothing&amp;#34; satisfaction statement to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line??? Save your money and buy something else. Do your research as there are plenty of sites that fairly rate these products.</li>
            <li> Goes on even and natural looking</li>
            <li> Have been using Tan Physics for 2 years and absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Best sunless tan I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Turns you brown the next day but you still get orange on ankles. feet, elbows and where you missed a swipe. Hailed as the best in the business, it is no different than all the others...</li>
            <li> Service was great product turns you orange</li>
            <li> I had really hoped for a tanning product (especially given the price) that wouldn&#x27;t give me that orange look you often see from a tanning lotion. Unfortunately, all I got was a more expensive orange color.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the color and how many days I had to apply it to get color.  I&#x27;ve used MANY self tanners over the years and have found much better tanners for less...sorry!</li>
            <li> Good but too expensive. I found another product that does the same job for much less money</li>
    </ol>
