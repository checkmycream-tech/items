    <ol>
            <li>This headband is awesome!  </li>
            <li>but it isnt perfect</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>I think it may work for some and look great</li>
            <li>Good hairband.</li>
            <li>Even after washing with warm soapy water, it continued to leave marks.  </li>
            <li>i see it after a while the paint start to come off and does not look good any more..</li>
            <li>it is a nice hair band.</li>
            <li>This is a good piece of hair accessory in that it makes my hair look interesting and keeps stray hairs at my hairline in check.</li>
            <li>kind of a pain to do at work.</li>
            <li>I was pleased for the price.</li>
            <li>I think it will be better if made in plastic .</li>
            <li>the ponytail holder is also good and useful.</li>
            <li>but i think it is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this headband.  </li>
            <li>This hair band looks nice, but it&#x27;s made for people with huge head.</li>
            <li>then something else to hold the thing that&#x27;s holding my hair :)</li>
            <li>it can perfectly hold my long hair.</li>
            <li>I liked it at first</li>
            <li>1 month fine..</li>
            <li>I bought some wavy cheap hairbands and they broke before two days.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that it will not break and it is possible a person might be able to bend it so it is tighter.</li>
            <li>very useful.</li>
            <li>This product creates a really cool look with a bump up.  </li>
            <li>this headband is  good... holds hair tight..</li>
            <li>the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t pinch behind my ears or pressure my scalp!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you can bend it a little to fit the shape of your head better</li>
            <li>I had bought similar style headbands but the broke too easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have an abnormally large head or something, but 30 minutes into wearing it</li>
            <li>I have a larger head in my opinion and this headband is huge.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re doing vigorous exercise, it might not work out very well.</li>
            <li>The metal really presses on the scalp.</li>
            <li>but it isnt that comfortable and doesnt hold the hair back by itself.</li>
            <li>lightening Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>it does not work very well for my head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable (1 piece of squiggly metal) and bendy.</li>
            <li>Even though this headband is made from metal, it is comfortable to wear all day long.</li>
            <li>but it quickly became mis-shapped and really doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my head anymore.  </li>
            <li>I use it a few days each week, and it stays in place, creates an interesting look in my curly hair, and it is so well-made.  </li>
            <li>This was a brand new head band and the coating was not flaking or pealing .  </li>
            <li>EXACT same band and picture.</li>
            <li>this is ok, looks little cheap though not worthy $10, but i use it everyday.</li>
            <li>No matter how I try to secure it, just keeps falling off, and it just seems ridiculous that I buy something to hold my hear and</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This headband is awesome!  I had bought similar style headbands but the broke too easily. Even though this headband is made from metal, it is comfortable to wear all day long. It has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> This headband was inexpensive and did not squeeze my head or dig into my scalp, thus it did not cause headaches.  This could be worn by people with shorter or longer hair and is not flimsy.  I was pleased for the price.</li>
            <li> Good hairband. Holds the hair firmly. Not too feminine. The only drawback is its a little too loose when you out it on. So if you&#x27;re doing vigorous exercise, it might not work out very well.</li>
            <li> It hurts. Sharp edges. Just waste of money. I think it will be better if made in plastic . It is durable though</li>
            <li> The black head band left black residue on my white couch and skin when I was lying down.  Even after washing with warm soapy water, it continued to leave marks.  This was a brand new head band and the coating was not flaking or pealing .  The coating just left marks on the wearer and fabrics it came into contact with.  Manufacturer needs to find another process for applying the coating to the metal.</li>
            <li> this is ok, looks little cheap though not worthy $10, but i use it everyday. so i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got mine on Ebay for 99 cents including the shipping, tons of them listed. EXACT same band and picture. Just FYI. These are a bit tight behind your ears, so they need to be bent a little or it will cause some discomfort.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst hairbands I&#x27;ve ever owned - and I own quite a few. The metal really presses on the scalp. It gave me an awful headache!</li>
            <li> It is made of metal so it will last forever but it isnt that comfortable and doesnt hold the hair back by itself.</li>
            <li> crazy durable metal construction and it holds all the stray hairs back when im washing my face.  sleek enough to wear out.</li>
            <li> this headband is  good... holds hair tight.. only problem i see it after a while the paint start to come off and does not look good any more..</li>
            <li> 1 month fine..then paint is fk&#x27;d up</li>
            <li> it works for me but it isnt perfect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros- durable, wont break&lt;br /&gt;you can bend it a little to fit the shape of your head better&lt;br /&gt;does the job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- coating rubs off rather quickly&lt;br /&gt;you cant wear it with wet hair or it begins to rust after the coating wears off</li>
            <li> This unisex band serves it purpose. It does suit men and women alike and fits well on the head.&lt;br /&gt;Good one.</li>
            <li> lightening Fast shipping.  I bought some wavy cheap hairbands and they broke before two days.  This one is metal, wavy and can be bent to comfort.  I wear it everyday.  Would recommend.  If you don&#x27;t lose it, it will last you a long time.  I like it.</li>
            <li> it is a nice hair band. very useful. it can perfectly hold my long hair. the ponytail holder is also good and useful.</li>
            <li> it does not work very well for my head. Sorry about that but i think it is okay. just not my style.</li>
            <li> I love this headband.  I use it a few days each week, and it stays in place, creates an interesting look in my curly hair, and it is so well-made.  Solid metal construction, and it doesn&#x27;t lose its shape as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this headband doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars from me is because the ends pinch the side of my head a bit, and it aches at the tail end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace a wire, zigzag headband that I could forget I was wearing,  I lost it!  This is nicer looking and has a dressy quality and my hairdresser even commented on it.  (</li>
            <li> This is a good piece of hair accessory in that it makes my hair look interesting and keeps stray hairs at my hairline in check. It&#x27;s very durable (1 piece of squiggly metal) and bendy. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s so tight behind the ears! I don&#x27;t know if I have an abnormally large head or something, but 30 minutes into wearing it I got a headache, and 3 minutes after I took it off, my headache was gone. Every so often I have to take it off and let my head relax... kind of a pain to do at work.</li>
            <li> This product creates a really cool look with a bump up.  I use it wearing a ponytail or down.  I have had several compliments on the look it creates and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t pinch behind my ears or pressure my scalp!  I have long thick hair, so that is all I have to compare this too, so I can only recommend it for that type of hair. However, I do not see why any other hair would have any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I have a larger head in my opinion and this headband is huge. The good thing is that it will not break and it is possible a person might be able to bend it so it is tighter.</li>
            <li> This hair band looks nice, but it&#x27;s made for people with huge head. No matter how I try to secure it, just keeps falling off, and it just seems ridiculous that I buy something to hold my hear and then something else to hold the thing that&#x27;s holding my hair :)</li>
            <li> I liked it at first but it quickly became mis-shapped and really doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my head anymore.  I think it may work for some and look great but it didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
