            <li>This oil is great for people with oily skin that still need a lotion.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m hoping this in addition to my routine will give me some great results.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>This oil is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Nice work, Tamanu!</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a product that is so effective with scars!</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin</li>
            <li>I will probably order from them again as the price and oil are good</li>
            <li>this tamanu oil is really good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good reviews about Tamanu oil, and since I&#x27;ve decided to go &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; with my skincare regimen, I thought this might be a good addition to my collection.  </li>
            <li>He is happy to be able to wear tank tops</li>
            <li>This product is great for skin clearing scars, pimples, and skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li>Love this oil!</li>
            <li>So I started using Tamanu and Rose hip oil on the rash and it cleared it up after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I will mix it into my rose clay mask.</li>
            <li>To be fair, it is not an Amazon Prime item, but does offer free shipping and is part of the iGive program, through which I can donate to Marley&#x27;s Mutts Dog Rescue.</li>
            <li>Aura Cacia has great products at reasonable prices!</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon had it for</li>
            <li>love to moisturize with it.</li>
            <li>But most nights I use the tamanu oil.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin feels &amp; looks so much better.</li>
            <li>but this sure did.</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this too close to your eyes though, or they might get puffy (like with most carrier oils in my case).</li>
            <li>I use jojoba or argan as my carrier oil and add just one or two drops of this and it makes a wonderful facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>His skin is smooth and nice.</li>
            <li>Utterly magical.  </li>
            <li>so far, i am very satisfied with the product!  </li>
            <li>The packaging of this healing soothing oil is perfect for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;The wide range of benifits include the reduction of lines and&lt;br /&gt;skin eruptions and spots.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>This oil is fantastic for dark/acne spots..</li>
            <li>The bottle is easy to use &amp; stays clean.</li>
            <li>Tamanu is useful for so many things and can often substitute for bacitracin.  </li>
            <li>But so far,  I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Needed this oil as part of a skin care lotion specifically made for a client with a special form of eczema.  </li>
            <li>And my new fancy brand does not seem to be any better than the Aura Cacia original.</li>
            <li>They quickly vanish once I put the oil</li>
            <li>it is a thicker oil, but absorbs quickly and does not feel sticky or greasy, as compared to oils.</li>
            <li>What it&#x27;s really quick about is fading some darkened areas where my bra rubs my skin.</li>
            <li>oil does have a very strong smell, but it is a natural, woodsy type of smell</li>
            <li>The Tamanu oil is helping it heal fast and clean!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will definitely continue to use this oil for it&#x27;s healing properties.salve (which i also ordered from amazon and LOVE) to help absorption, and it makes my face feel so great the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the past two nights i&#x27;ve been combining it with my sweet bee magic salve (which i also ordered from amazon and LOVE) to help absorption, and it makes my face feel so great the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is absorbed quickly so makeup can be&lt;br /&gt;applied</li>
            <li>but well worth</li>
            <li>Tamanu oil is definitely in my top five of natural ingredients I&#x27;ve found useful on the skin.  </li>
            <li>, i put a drop of tamanu oil right on the spot afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is my first tamanu oil.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it when after the first use, the darkness had lightened up.</li>
            <li>Sometimes she had already been treating the area for a while before she got here, and one night with tamanu would do more than the prior week had to heal it.  </li>
            <li>Am not seeing any positive  results yet, after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Some nights I use the marula oil ( a very moisturising oil).  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really itch and they aren&#x27;t discolored or fluid-filled or anything</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand and this oil!</li>
            <li>It works very well on skin problems.</li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t over the top, even if it is a small bottle, since you don&#x27;t need to use very much for any one thing.  </li>
            <li>It must be used steadily.  </li>
            <li>this tamanu oil is a greenish hue, but i don&#x27;t find that it discolors my face or gives it a yellow tone once it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>
            <li>The oil is nice, but my goodness the shipping is so slow.</li>
            <li>(I gave half the bottle to a friend) and found that these bumps will not go away on their own (not quickly enough for me, anyway)</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>the past week, i&#x27;ve noticed a more even skin tone and that one stubborn acne spot looks like it is healing.</li>
            <li>For the first time in his short life, he does not have cracks or peeling skin under his toes.  </li>
            <li>tamanu oil can be drying to people with sensitive skin, but i don&#x27;t consider my skin to be very sensitive and have had no issues with over-drying.</li>
            <li>Although I now buy it in a large size from a different company, I keep refilling my Aura Cacia bottle for the medicine cabinet because of its convenient and sturdy pump.  </li>
            <li>blemishes clear up faster</li>
            <li>Worth a try for healthy skin or troubled skin.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this same product at health food stores and it is much thicker and greener.</li>
            <li>So far, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>It is thick and smells fantastic, very healing.</li>
            <li>I think it resurfaced my skin with each use slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li>; my son has used the oil for a few months now, and the scars have faded to fine white marks.</li>
            <li>It  is my major moisturiser.  </li>
            <li>, so I ordered another one as soon as they were back in stock, applied it, and my hands are back to their normal state.</li>
            <li>This oil will forever replace any night cream for me for as long as I live.</li>
            <li>i take an extra drop and rub it directly on blemishes as an extra spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>After just two weeks of daily use, it reduced the intensity to a pale light pink.</li>
            <li>it does have a strong, unusual smell which i wasn&#x27;t crazy about on initial application, but i have since gotten used to.</li>
            <li>I also blend a little with grapeseed oil to use for the oil cleansing method, and it really seems to help with blackheads I have on my nose.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see how well it continues to minimize those as well scars as some of our older ones!</li>
            <li> Even my mother who is not as into natural products has been sold on tamanu after a few visits to my house where she had various sores and skin conditions and a burn that needed attending.  </li>
            <li> He was resigned to wearing long sleeve shirts this summer to hide the scars.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t drive much due to weakness from multiple myeloma.</li>
            <li> I usually get my carrier oils and essential oils from Garden of Wisdom or a french website called Aromazone.fr, but I trusted Aura Cacia enough to buy this one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> use for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for some fresh angry red scars on my son&#x27;s arm hoping to find anything to minimize their appearance.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned African.</li>
            <li> I got it to help fade some dark marks left by a break out.</li>
            <li> I am especially concerned about lack of sterilization while watering down this Tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> This is the same oil I used to get at the health food store for half the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, green, and smells a bit like basil pesto, but it really does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> , they are just a few tiny, raised, flesh-colored bumps.</li>
            <li> However, do not apply closed to your eye area or it will burn you.</li>
            <li> i would describe the smell as nutty (imagine smelling a container of brazil nuts) but that is to be expected considering this oil is extracted from tree seeds/</li>
            <li> the next day, i was AMAZED to find that the blemish had almost completely dried up and left no discolored mark (and blemished usually do a number on my skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it as a post-cleansing moisturizer, taking a few drops and applying it to my entire face (excluding my eyelids as i had heard it can be irritating to that sensitive skin) before bedtime.</li>
            <li> This product has been watered down.</li>
            <li> Works well on healing blemishes and toning down redness on the face.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue using and recommending this and other Frontier products!</li>
            <li> After cleansing with my black soap.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any harsh chemicals in home or work, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few things, but I had read that Tamanu worked</li>
            <li> EveryDay Coconut-</li>
            <li> /&gt;some may find it to be expensive for just 1 ounce, but i don&#x27;t compared to other skincare products and oils - plus a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve been putting it on a couple of really deep, bad scrapes on my knees from when I took a fall.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well(a little dab will do ya!) and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I usually break out during my period but</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used it on my face and it helped with my problem spots, acne, and eczema.</li>
            <li> on another note, i had a small blemish pop up (not related to the oil) which i had gently popped (this is terrible, i know!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and it&#x27;s slowly fading them.</li>
            <li> Please,  stay away from dangerous chemicals in products.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too bad, so I&#x27;ve never had a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; inspect them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received package on date as promised.  Needed this oil as part of a skin care lotion specifically made for a client with a special form of eczema.  Glad Amazon had it for I was having a problem finding it and it was an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this same product at health food stores and it is much thicker and greener. This product has been watered down. I am especially concerned about lack of sterilization while watering down this Tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> This oil cured my husband&#x27;s toenail fungus. It took about 6 months but it worked! He rubbed a drop on his toenails morning and evening.</li>
            <li> great product! love to moisturize with it. I&#x27;ve seen a definite improvement in skin quality since I&#x27;ve started using it. blemishes clear up faster and it keeps your skin hydrated all day</li>
            <li> The packaging of this healing soothing oil is perfect for easy use.&lt;br /&gt;The wide range of benifits include the reduction of lines and&lt;br /&gt;skin eruptions and spots. Tamanu oil is absorbed quickly so makeup can be&lt;br /&gt;applied with ease.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned African. this is a winner all the time. I bought here on amazon. This is my first tamanu oil. It has changed my skin,  both face and neck. And it also removed some and reduced some datk marks. I think it resurfaced my skin with each use slowly but surely.  Dont let it get in your eyes. Use with care around your upper eye lid. It is very good for the eye area but dont let it get in your eyes.  I have bought the fushi brand also to compare with this brand.  But so far,  I am very pleased with the results.  I use it at night as my moisturiser.  After cleansing with my black soap.  It  is my major moisturiser.  Some nights I use the marula oil ( a very moisturising oil).  But most nights I use the tamanu oil. It is a resurfacing oil. It must be used steadily.  I will definitely buy again and again. Please,  stay away from dangerous chemicals in products. They cause skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Oily product. It is like smearing Olive Oil all over your face or body. If thats what you want then go at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use for dry skin. It works ( I guess). It just sits on the skin as a protectant in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE- this is burn like the devil if you get in eyes or in nostrils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, go at it!</li>
            <li> I use this on my hands. Sometimes, I get these tiny bumps on the back of my hand, especially when I am stressed. I only recently started to get them and I looked it up and I think it was some sort of Eczema - stress-induced? I don&#x27;t use any harsh chemicals in home or work, so I doubt they are a reaction to anything like that. They don&#x27;t really itch and they aren&#x27;t discolored or fluid-filled or anything, they are just a few tiny, raised, flesh-colored bumps. I&#x27;m probably the only one who&#x27;s ever noticed them. They&#x27;re not too bad, so I&#x27;ve never had a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; inspect them. I&#x27;ve tried a few things, but I had read that Tamanu worked and I just happened to have picked some up on clearance at the VitaminShoppe, so I tried that and viola! it worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a day or so, the bumps were fewer and my skin was softer. Nice work, Tamanu! I did run out of the oil once (I gave half the bottle to a friend) and found that these bumps will not go away on their own (not quickly enough for me, anyway), so I ordered another one as soon as they were back in stock, applied it, and my hands are back to their normal state. yay! I don&#x27;t use it every day, just when the bumps appear. They quickly vanish once I put the oil on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does have a very strong smell, but it is a natural, woodsy type of smell and I like it. I only use a drop or two at a time, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rely on reviews to help me make informed decisions. I hope this review helped you, too!</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic for dark/acne spots.. My skin loves it. It is thick and smells fantastic, very healing. However, do not apply closed to your eye area or it will burn you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for some fresh angry red scars on my son&#x27;s arm hoping to find anything to minimize their appearance. He was resigned to wearing long sleeve shirts this summer to hide the scars. After just two weeks of daily use, it reduced the intensity to a pale light pink. I&#x27;m anxious to see how well it continues to minimize those as well scars as some of our older ones! Thank you for making a product that is so effective with scars! He is happy to be able to wear tank tops again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;UPDATE&amp;#62; my son has used the oil for a few months now, and the scars have faded to fine white marks. So grateful we tried the oil!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use as a facial moisturizer. I mix with  Alaffia- EveryDay Coconut- Daily Face Lotion with SPF 15- 12 oz</li>
            <li> It does what I expect it to. My skin feels &amp; looks so much better. The bottle is easy to use &amp; stays clean.</li>
            <li> This is the same oil I used to get at the health food store for half the price. This oil is great for people with oily skin that still need a lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have Psoriasis and all the drugs the doctors would give me never worked. So I started using Tamanu and Rose hip oil on the rash and it cleared it up after 2 weeks. I have suffered for 5 years and all the drugs the doctors gave me never worked but this sure did. Aura Cacia has great products at reasonable prices! LOVE THEM! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I use this facial oil in several ways. I will mix it into my rose clay mask. It works wonderful. Also, I use it after I put on my night cream or before my make up. It moistures my skin properly. So far, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin and I was apprehensive of trying it, though I read it is supposed to help with acne scars.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised!  It absorbs well(a little dab will do ya!) and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I have yet to see if it helps with the scarring, but that I&#x27;ve dealt with for years.  I also blend a little with grapeseed oil to use for the oil cleansing method, and it really seems to help with blackheads I have on my nose.  The price isn&#x27;t over the top, even if it is a small bottle, since you don&#x27;t need to use very much for any one thing.  I am going to continue using and recommending this and other Frontier products!</li>
            <li> The oil is nice, but my goodness the shipping is so slow. Got it the 12th of June just like it said, but that made it almost  2 weeks in coming since it was ordered May 29. To be fair, it is not an Amazon Prime item, but does offer free shipping and is part of the iGive program, through which I can donate to Marley&#x27;s Mutts Dog Rescue. I will probably order from them again as the price and oil are good and I don&#x27;t drive much due to weakness from multiple myeloma.</li>
            <li> received this oil about a week ago and have used it 5-6 times since. so far, i am very satisfied with the product!  i had read of the healing properties of tamanu oil and decided to incorporate it into my skincare regimen to heal some stubborn acne spots / discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it as a post-cleansing moisturizer, taking a few drops and applying it to my entire face (excluding my eyelids as i had heard it can be irritating to that sensitive skin) before bedtime. i take an extra drop and rub it directly on blemishes as an extra spot treatment.  it is a thicker oil, but absorbs quickly and does not feel sticky or greasy, as compared to oils. this tamanu oil is a greenish hue, but i don&#x27;t find that it discolors my face or gives it a yellow tone once it&#x27;s absorbed. tamanu oil can be drying to people with sensitive skin, but i don&#x27;t consider my skin to be very sensitive and have had no issues with over-drying. it does have a strong, unusual smell which i wasn&#x27;t crazy about on initial application, but i have since gotten used to. i would describe the smell as nutty (imagine smelling a container of brazil nuts) but that is to be expected considering this oil is extracted from tree seeds/nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the past week, i&#x27;ve noticed a more even skin tone and that one stubborn acne spot looks like it is healing. on another note, i had a small blemish pop up (not related to the oil) which i had gently popped (this is terrible, i know! i do not recommend anyone pop pimples or blemishes!) but i did and to try to atone for my sins, i put a drop of tamanu oil right on the spot afterwards. the next day, i was AMAZED to find that the blemish had almost completely dried up and left no discolored mark (and blemished usually do a number on my skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some may find it to be expensive for just 1 ounce, but i don&#x27;t compared to other skincare products and oils - plus a little goes a long way. the past two nights i&#x27;ve been combining it with my sweet bee magic salve (which i also ordered from amazon and LOVE) to help absorption, and it makes my face feel so great the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely continue to use this oil for it&#x27;s healing properties.salve (which i also ordered from amazon and LOVE) to help absorption, and it makes my face feel so great the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely continue to use this oil for it&#x27;s healing properties.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and the smell. I put it on before bed, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest wearing it under your makeup. I got it to help fade some dark marks left by a break out. So I&#x27;m hoping this in addition to my routine will give me some great results. The bottle is a bit smaller than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Am not seeing any positive  results yet, after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This oil will forever replace any night cream for me for as long as I live. This is a must have.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to fade some acne scars. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, and it&#x27;s slowly fading them. What it&#x27;s really quick about is fading some darkened areas where my bra rubs my skin. I couldn&#x27;t believe it when after the first use, the darkness had lightened up. After 4 days, it&#x27;s about gone. I will order more.</li>
            <li> I had a rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away... until I bought a bottle of this stuff.  After using just one ounce my rash almost entirely went away.  I bought as second bottle to use infrequently just in case.  It does smell moderately like nuts.</li>
            <li> Works well on healing blemishes and toning down redness on the face. I would recommend this product for acne/roseacea skin care</li>
            <li> Very good oil, purchased a couple time and will purchase again</li>
            <li> this tamanu oil is really good. I usually get my carrier oils and essential oils from Garden of Wisdom or a french website called Aromazone.fr, but I trusted Aura Cacia enough to buy this one on Amazon. It&#x27;s thick, green, and smells a bit like basil pesto, but it really does wonders for my skin. It moisturizes my dehydrated, parched skin yet doesn&#x27;t break me out. Don&#x27;t use this too close to your eyes though, or they might get puffy (like with most carrier oils in my case). I strongly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good reviews about Tamanu oil, and since I&#x27;ve decided to go &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; with my skincare regimen, I thought this might be a good addition to my collection.  This oil is amazing!  So moisturizing, it smooths out the discoloration in my face and even reduced the appearance of acne scars.  I use jojoba or argan as my carrier oil and add just one or two drops of this and it makes a wonderful facial moisturizer.  I usually break out during my period but since I started using this that has not happened at all!  Pricey but well worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! In the past, I&#x27;ve used it on my face and it helped with my problem spots, acne, and eczema. Recently, I&#x27;ve been putting it on a couple of really deep, bad scrapes on my knees from when I took a fall. The Tamanu oil is helping it heal fast and clean! I highly recommend this brand and this oil!</li>
            <li> My son has eczema between his toes.  He is four and his doctor recommended I put hydrocortizone cream on his toes twice a day. This gave him some relief however, my preference is not to put steroids on my kids if I do not have to. I read that this can help with ezcema and so have it a try.  For the first time in his short life, he does not have cracks or peeling skin under his toes.  We put it on twice a day and rub it in.  We immediately put on socks so it does not get on our carpet. His skin is smooth and nice. It is great!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and a little goes a long way.  I use it on my face and hands at night. i will definately buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is great for skin clearing scars, pimples, and skin looking healthy. Worth a try for healthy skin or troubled skin.</li>
            <li> It works very well on skin problems.</li>
            <li> Utterly magical.  Tamanu oil is definitely in my top five of natural ingredients I&#x27;ve found useful on the skin.  Even my mother who is not as into natural products has been sold on tamanu after a few visits to my house where she had various sores and skin conditions and a burn that needed attending.  Sometimes she had already been treating the area for a while before she got here, and one night with tamanu would do more than the prior week had to heal it.  Tamanu is useful for so many things and can often substitute for bacitracin.  I include tamanu oil in several products in my etsy shop (DJ Deodorants &amp; Diapersticks--in the deodorants, the diaper rash treatment and prevention sticks, and the toe gout roll ons).  Although I now buy it in a large size from a different company, I keep refilling my Aura Cacia bottle for the medicine cabinet because of its convenient and sturdy pump.  And my new fancy brand does not seem to be any better than the Aura Cacia original.</li>
            <li> Very good skin product, and great customer service.</li>
