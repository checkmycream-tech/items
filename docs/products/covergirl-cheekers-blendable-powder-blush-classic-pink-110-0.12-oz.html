            <li>Just buy it at Target or something. :)</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>its more like a face powder than blush.</li>
            <li>Love it for the price.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>I love covergirl.</li>
            <li>I love this blush.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it love it</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that the powder did not crumble with use.</li>
            <li>Love this blush and you can&#x27;t beat the price of it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it stays on my cheeks all day.</li>
            <li>Hope to buy more things from here.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>the blush have a very strong perfume, like a talc powder; before I opened the package when my order arrived I already could smell the product, I don&#x27;t like strong scents in cosmetics</li>
            <li>Beautiful Color, you do not need much, goes on smoothly and stays put, does not look cakey or anything of the sort .</li>
            <li>pretty color, good price, lasts well.</li>
            <li>The color shown is true to what I received which is always nice.  </li>
            <li>great product and perfect classic pink, just like it states.</li>
            <li>It has a rather strong &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; smell to it, which some may mind more than others.</li>
            <li>but overall very good</li>
            <li>This blush is the perfect shade of pink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>cant say enough good things about this!</li>
            <li>i wish it was a bit more pigmented but good for a natural look</li>
            <li>doesnt stay on all day and comes off easily in the evenings.</li>
            <li>Easy on.</li>
            <li>It is SO STRONG.  </li>
            <li>Can you imagine being on a DATE and having STRONG stinky makeup smell on your face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT the smell is INCREDIBLY strong.</li>
            <li>Hands down one of the best colors and brands of blushes that I have used!  </li>
            <li>I have used many blushes from higher end make up lines, but this one lasts longer and looks better than any of those.  </li>
            <li>, i use cover girl very easy to apply very easy to open great price if you are looking for a new blush i would give this one a try..</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and wants more make up now!</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>And I practically got this for free after clipping coupon and subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>I really like the color of this blush and it goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>It does have a shine and reflects light off your skin.</li>
            <li>Cheap, great color, long wear.  </li>
            <li>Such a cute color &amp; for such a great price!</li>
            <li>The color is so pretty and not to overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Small compact but perfect to carry in your purse and</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and is a nice soft color.</li>
            <li>It is a nice light natural blush.</li>
            <li>This came in perfect packaging and ready to use, but it is lighter than in the picture, so IT not really my color.</li>
            <li>Good color - CoverGirl is my favorite makeup brand - true pink color</li>
            <li>Right color!</li>
            <li>I would never spend more than ten dollars on blush, and this is such a great deal for such a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skin blonde</li>
            <li>I have not found that it lasts a whole day on my face as others have reported - but then again, no blush does (is my skin somehow more slippery?)</li>
            <li>only thought it was a good deal, but when it arrived I realized of my mistake.</li>
            <li>I love this blush, it is simiple, and the colors are great, true to color, blends well, goes on well, stays on all day, not cakey, smooth, just like a great powder, great price, last for a long time, can mix it up with another shade if wanted, small so can carry with you if wanted, had no trouble receiving, came quickly, packaged well.</li>
            <li>Works Great and classic pink is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>The color and size are great - a true pink!  </li>
            <li>when i put on even a little it was so bright that i had to wipe off most of it.</li>
            <li>received my order quickly and without issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However my daughter said she could still smell it when she came super close for a smooch.  </li>
            <li>This is a very pretty shade of blush.</li>
            <li>it was cheap and it is so pretty on my cheeks..</li>
            <li>This has a nice, bright but sheer color to it without any glitter (finally)!</li>
            <li>It will be long lasting and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the only blush I use, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>With the price, I&#x27;m comfortable putting it in the hands of a 6 and 9 year old - easily replaceable if it were to break.  </li>
            <li>It feels very light and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean-smelling and it stays on well.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>A nice blush that will do for daily makeup and touch ups on the go.</li>
            <li>so originally it was a tad darker than expected but cute regardless!</li>
            <li>I can use this blush and get a fresh, rosy glow without ending up with a clown face when the oils of my skin start reacting to it during the day.</li>
            <li>Adds just the right tone to the cheeks .</li>
            <li>Brightened up my cheeks just right.</li>
            <li>This is a no-frills product that gets the job done for the right price.</li>
            <li>Pretty pink, and not too bright.</li>
            <li>The pink color is very pretty and it comes up nicely on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect pink that complements my light, pale skin.</li>
            <li>Great for pale skinned gals like myself!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this blush for years and am glad I can simply reorder on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Bought 3 to make sure I have enough for a while.  </li>
            <li>At first I loved the product, loved the color and left a great color and a really nice glow on my cheeks, but this product stinks, literally stinks...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty corally-rose color..not very pigmented though.</li>
            <li>It lasts forever &amp; if you&#x27;re observant you can catch it on an amazing sale.&lt;br /&gt;However, after recently learning that Cover girl regularly tests on animals</li>
            <li>Leaves a healthy pink glow, I know people comment ago the smell</li>
            <li>I really like this color.  </li>
            <li>so highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Was just as i expected. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used blush before, so I wanted something light enough to give me a healthy look, but nothing too harsh in color.</li>
            <li>the color is easy to use and not very overpowering</li>
            <li>, despite that, is a decent blush</li>
            <li>I highly recommened this to any girl on a budget that loves makeup.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about CoverGirl Cheekers Blush is that it should be in a slightly larger container, so that I could pick up more product when I use my own blush brush.</li>
            <li>I love this for a little makeup look.  </li>
            <li>..make sure to apply a little or</li>
            <li>I love to read but not handling large books with small print.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for ANYONE even if you like the smell because the smell is so strong, you&#x27;ll be bothering other people.</li>
            <li>As a senior adult, the non glare screen is a real help with the cataracts and</li>
            <li>As soon as a few droplets of water touched my cheeks, the smell was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it either Waste of money I don&#x27;t satisfied</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fancy and it smells kind of weird, but the colors are very pretty, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>And because it was a gift for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking, I kept it for myself and purchased something new for my daughter</li>
            <li>you are looking for a new blush to add to your collection, but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot to try something new</li>
            <li>Love it, using it everyday!</li>
            <li>It is easy to build with and if you want something a little brighter I find that using two swipes will do that for you.</li>
            <li>the blush is natural pink not to much just right</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is enough product to last a long time and as with all Covergirl products I have used, the quality is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Also, this particular container isn&#x27;t as easy to open and close as previous ones that I&#x27;d purchased at CVS.</li>
            <li>That being said, the pros most definitely outweigh that little problem.</li>
            <li>It leaves a soft, rosy glow to the cheeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and dense.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.  </li>
            <li>en el cutis es bastante natural, justo lo que queria..</li>
            <li>While the color was a bit Darker Pink than I expected, I am loving my Covergirl Classic Pink Cheekers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right shade of pink and not shimmery.  </li>
            <li>a little bit goes a long way as a tiny bit gives a nice glow to cheeks.</li>
            <li>I typically stay away from such a pink shade, but this is such a pretty, subtle pink, that I would imagine looks great on many different skin tones.  </li>
            <li>At first i thought it was too pink for my skintone.  </li>
            <li>and you can barely tell it&#x27;s been used.</li>
            <li>The blush smells a bit like a petroleum product rather than a slight spicy scent I&#x27;d gotten with others of this exact product.</li>
            <li>The classic pink is my go-to.</li>
            <li>Purchased the classic pink blush to put in my daughters&#x27; dance performance make up box.  </li>
            <li>Covergirl must have stopped making this blush or stopped selling it in stores because I can&#x27;t find Classic Pink ANYWHERE anymore!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a shade of pink this light, and I hope Cover Girl will continue to make the product.</li>

            <li> Cute and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I have very light skin</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use.</li>
            <li> cost effective and looks every bit as good as the higher priced blushers when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This has decent staying power, no sparkle (which i&#x27;m happy about) and is a great smooth, finely milled texture.</li>
            <li> I love this blush.  </li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just buy it at Target or something. :)</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> its more like a face powder than blush.</li>
            <li> Love it for the price.</li>
            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> I love covergirl.</li>

            <li> Love it love it</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that the powder did not crumble with use.</li>
            <li> Love this blush and you can&#x27;t beat the price of it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it stays on my cheeks all day.</li>
            <li> Hope to buy more things from here.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> the blush have a very strong perfume, like a talc powder; before I opened the package when my order arrived I already could smell the product, I don&#x27;t like strong scents in cosmetics</li>
            <li> Beautiful Color, you do not need much, goes on smoothly and stays put, does not look cakey or anything of the sort .</li>
            <li> pretty color, good price, lasts well.</li>
            <li> The color shown is true to what I received which is always nice.  </li>
            <li> great product and perfect classic pink, just like it states.</li>
            <li> It has a rather strong &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; smell to it, which some may mind more than others.</li>
            <li> but overall very good</li>
            <li> This blush is the perfect shade of pink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> cant say enough good things about this!</li>
            <li> i wish it was a bit more pigmented but good for a natural look</li>
            <li> doesnt stay on all day and comes off easily in the evenings.</li>
            <li> Easy on.</li>
            <li> It is SO STRONG.  </li>
            <li> Can you imagine being on a DATE and having STRONG stinky makeup smell on your face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT the smell is INCREDIBLY strong.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best colors and brands of blushes that I have used!  </li>
            <li> I have used many blushes from higher end make up lines, but this one lasts longer and looks better than any of those.  </li>
            <li> , i use cover girl very easy to apply very easy to open great price if you are looking for a new blush i would give this one a try..</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and wants more make up now!</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> And I practically got this for free after clipping coupon and subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this blush and it goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> It does have a shine and reflects light off your skin.</li>
            <li> Cheap, great color, long wear.  </li>
            <li> Such a cute color &amp; for such a great price!</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty and not to overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Small compact but perfect to carry in your purse and</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and is a nice soft color.</li>
            <li> It is a nice light natural blush.</li>
            <li> This came in perfect packaging and ready to use, but it is lighter than in the picture, so IT not really my color.</li>
            <li> Good color - CoverGirl is my favorite makeup brand - true pink color</li>
            <li> Right color!</li>
            <li> I would never spend more than ten dollars on blush, and this is such a great deal for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skin blonde</li>
            <li> I have not found that it lasts a whole day on my face as others have reported - but then again, no blush does (is my skin somehow more slippery?)</li>
            <li> only thought it was a good deal, but when it arrived I realized of my mistake.</li>
            <li> I love this blush, it is simiple, and the colors are great, true to color, blends well, goes on well, stays on all day, not cakey, smooth, just like a great powder, great price, last for a long time, can mix it up with another shade if wanted, small so can carry with you if wanted, had no trouble receiving, came quickly, packaged well.</li>
            <li> Works Great and classic pink is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> The color and size are great - a true pink!  </li>
            <li> when i put on even a little it was so bright that i had to wipe off most of it.</li>
            <li> received my order quickly and without issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However my daughter said she could still smell it when she came super close for a smooch.  </li>
            <li> This is a very pretty shade of blush.</li>
            <li> it was cheap and it is so pretty on my cheeks..</li>
            <li> This has a nice, bright but sheer color to it without any glitter (finally)!</li>
            <li> It will be long lasting and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the only blush I use, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> With the price, I&#x27;m comfortable putting it in the hands of a 6 and 9 year old - easily replaceable if it were to break.  </li>
            <li> It feels very light and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and clean-smelling and it stays on well.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> A nice blush that will do for daily makeup and touch ups on the go.</li>
            <li> so originally it was a tad darker than expected but cute regardless!</li>
            <li> I can use this blush and get a fresh, rosy glow without ending up with a clown face when the oils of my skin start reacting to it during the day.</li>
            <li> Adds just the right tone to the cheeks .</li>
            <li> Brightened up my cheeks just right.</li>
            <li> This is a no-frills product that gets the job done for the right price.</li>
            <li> Pretty pink, and not too bright.</li>
            <li> The pink color is very pretty and it comes up nicely on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect pink that complements my light, pale skin.</li>
            <li> Great for pale skinned gals like myself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blush for years and am glad I can simply reorder on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> Bought 3 to make sure I have enough for a while.  </li>
            <li> At first I loved the product, loved the color and left a great color and a really nice glow on my cheeks, but this product stinks, literally stinks...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty corally-rose color..not very pigmented though.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever &amp; if you&#x27;re observant you can catch it on an amazing sale.&lt;br /&gt;However, after recently learning that Cover girl regularly tests on animals</li>
            <li> Leaves a healthy pink glow, I know people comment ago the smell</li>
            <li> I really like this color.  </li>
            <li> so highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Was just as i expected. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used blush before, so I wanted something light enough to give me a healthy look, but nothing too harsh in color.</li>
            <li> the color is easy to use and not very overpowering</li>
            <li> , despite that, is a decent blush</li>
            <li> I highly recommened this to any girl on a budget that loves makeup.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about CoverGirl Cheekers Blush is that it should be in a slightly larger container, so that I could pick up more product when I use my own blush brush.</li>
            <li> I love this for a little makeup look.  </li>
            <li> ..make sure to apply a little or</li>
            <li> I love to read but not handling large books with small print.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for ANYONE even if you like the smell because the smell is so strong, you&#x27;ll be bothering other people.</li>
            <li> As a senior adult, the non glare screen is a real help with the cataracts and</li>
            <li> As soon as a few droplets of water touched my cheeks, the smell was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it either Waste of money I don&#x27;t satisfied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fancy and it smells kind of weird, but the colors are very pretty, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> And because it was a gift for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking, I kept it for myself and purchased something new for my daughter</li>
            <li> you are looking for a new blush to add to your collection, but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot to try something new</li>
            <li> Love it, using it everyday!</li>
            <li> It is easy to build with and if you want something a little brighter I find that using two swipes will do that for you.</li>
            <li> the blush is natural pink not to much just right</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is enough product to last a long time and as with all Covergirl products I have used, the quality is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Also, this particular container isn&#x27;t as easy to open and close as previous ones that I&#x27;d purchased at CVS.</li>
            <li> That being said, the pros most definitely outweigh that little problem.</li>
            <li> It leaves a soft, rosy glow to the cheeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and dense.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.  </li>
            <li> en el cutis es bastante natural, justo lo que queria..</li>
            <li> While the color was a bit Darker Pink than I expected, I am loving my Covergirl Classic Pink Cheekers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right shade of pink and not shimmery.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way as a tiny bit gives a nice glow to cheeks.</li>
            <li> I typically stay away from such a pink shade, but this is such a pretty, subtle pink, that I would imagine looks great on many different skin tones.  </li>
            <li> At first i thought it was too pink for my skintone.  </li>
            <li> and you can barely tell it&#x27;s been used.</li>
            <li> The blush smells a bit like a petroleum product rather than a slight spicy scent I&#x27;d gotten with others of this exact product.</li>
            <li> The classic pink is my go-to.</li>
            <li> Purchased the classic pink blush to put in my daughters&#x27; dance performance make up box.  </li>
            <li> Covergirl must have stopped making this blush or stopped selling it in stores because I can&#x27;t find Classic Pink ANYWHERE anymore!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a shade of pink this light, and I hope Cover Girl will continue to make the product.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding the right blush - too pink, too red, too orange...</li>
            <li> However, it has held up so far (no breaking) and even though the girls have sensitive skin they have not had any sort of negative reaction to the blush.  </li>
            <li> A bit darker than pictured, but lasts a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and go ahead and get some Wet N Wild blushes instead!</li>
            <li> I usually get blushes that are orange shade but was surprised by how well this blush looked on me.  </li>
            <li> The brush had some loose strings too.</li>
            <li> But when I ordered it on Amazon, it arrived completely crushed in its package, reduced to dust.</li>
            <li> this picture looks darker but it is actually really pink</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, and isnt overly pink or hideous.</li>
            <li> I use this before and have tried other blushes</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> your cheeks will look really pink!</li>
            <li> This blush was definitely all of those things, BUT I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> I wish the pack itself was a bit bigger for my brush to sweep across, but that&#x27;s small potatoes.</li>
            <li> This will be given to my niece in a gift basket for Christmas along with other make-up items</li>
            <li> The color is just enough to give my cheeks a natural blush without looking fake.</li>
            <li> A little too pink for me,.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong with CoverGirl Cheekers Blush in Classic Pink.</li>
            <li> This blush is average.</li>
            <li> Be careful to only use a small amount, though!!</li>
            <li> but it i have to put loads of it on to notice a slight change in my skin</li>
            <li> I had heard these blushes were the hidden blush gems of the drugstore world, so I was dying to try one.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li> Little shine .</li>
            <li> I like that it is not oily or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> Got a few to hand out as gifts.</li>
            <li> So disappointed since the color was so pretty.  </li>
            <li> The application brush, as expected, is complete crap.</li>
            <li> I can get my money back :(</li>
            <li> This arrived on time but was all broken.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY WITH IT</li>
            <li> wait, it gets worse...  </li>
            <li> Arrived broken to bits</li>
            <li> Although the brush is uncomfortable, but at least I did&#x27;t find any unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Delivered to me broken!</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;2. Smells bad and lingers all day&lt;</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> really really disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> its good but it looks like there is nothing on my skin it does give me a shine i like but it i have to put loads of it on to notice a slight change in my skin</li>
            <li> A little too pink for me,.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty shade of blush. But once it&#x27;s on your skin, it&#x27;s basically translucent and comes off in a short amount of time. The application brush, as expected, is complete crap. I won&#x27;t be buying this blush again.</li>
            <li> Such a cute color &amp; for such a great price! Blends perfectly &amp; looks great. Perfect for everyday use. I would definitely recommend to a friend or family.</li>
            <li> love this shade great service</li>
            <li> My lady oves I bout her bluch.</li>
            <li> Great color and great price.</li>
            <li> Nice color for summer.  Pretty pink, and not too bright.</li>
            <li> The pink color is very pretty and it comes up nicely on the skin. It leaves a soft, rosy glow to the cheeks. I like that it is not oily or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. It feels very light and soft.</li>
            <li> i like...  i happy whit may product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blush for years and am glad I can simply reorder on Amazon!  I use a makeup brush rather than the included one.</li>
            <li> Delivered to me broken! Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> Nice color. Goes in nicely.</li>
            <li> Great product . Silky feeling . Little shine . Adds just the right tone to the cheeks . Perfect color for me .</li>
            <li> Right color! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the only blush I use, and I absolutely love it! The classic pink is my go-to. I get compliments on the color all the time. It&#x27;s fresh and clean-smelling and it stays on well. I would never spend more than ten dollars on blush, and this is such a great deal for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this blush.  At first i thought it was too pink for my skintone.  I usually get blushes that are orange shade but was surprised by how well this blush looked on me.  I&#x27;m Asian with medium tone skin.  It&#x27;s just the right shade of pink and not shimmery.  Perfect for the no-makeup look that I want.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used blush before, so I wanted something light enough to give me a healthy look, but nothing too harsh in color. This is perfect for my fair skintone!</li>
            <li> Very pretty and good pigment! Got a few to hand out as gifts.</li>
            <li> Been using this blush since i was a teenager, cant find another blush that compares. I am olive toned to tan depending on the time of year and the color is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Price couldn&#x27;t be beat. Couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> This arrived on time but was all broken. And because it was a gift for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas stocking, I kept it for myself and purchased something new for my daughter</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use. Perfect for special occasions and every day use!</li>
            <li> Received today perfect shade love it.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Brightened up my cheeks just right.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
            <li> when i put on even a little it was so bright that i had to wipe off most of it. but overall very good</li>
            <li> At first I loved the product, loved the color and left a great color and a really nice glow on my cheeks, but this product stinks, literally stinks... the blush have a very strong perfume, like a talc powder; before I opened the package when my order arrived I already could smell the product, I don&#x27;t like strong scents in cosmetics, despite that, is a decent blush</li>
            <li> Love this product, will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This blush is average. It&#x27;s nothing spectacular. It&#x27;s not terrible but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Don&#x27;t waste your money and go ahead and get some Wet N Wild blushes instead!</li>
            <li> This is my Holy grail of blushes! I use this before and have tried other blushes and I always come back to this one. The color is so pretty and not to overwhelming. It is easy to build with and if you want something a little brighter I find that using two swipes will do that for you. I highly recommened this to any girl on a budget that loves makeup.</li>
            <li> Nice blush. Goes on smooth and is a nice soft color. I will re-order.</li>
            <li> Love it, using it everyday! for 83 cents it was the cheapest blush I ever bought! Color goes well with my complexion.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin and this blush gives me a great color without being too rosy or unnatural looking. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great seller and product!</li>
            <li> Perfect color blush for a light colored cheek.  I love this for a little makeup look.  Great addition to any makeup bag! Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Purchased the classic pink blush to put in my daughters&#x27; dance performance make up box.  The color and size are great - a true pink!  With the price, I&#x27;m comfortable putting it in the hands of a 6 and 9 year old - easily replaceable if it were to break.  However, it has held up so far (no breaking) and even though the girls have sensitive skin they have not had any sort of negative reaction to the blush.  A winner for sure!</li>
            <li> The blush itself is great. It&#x27;s affordable and looks good on. I&#x27;ve used it for years. But when I ordered it on Amazon, it arrived completely crushed in its package, reduced to dust. I guess it&#x27;s still usable but it&#x27;s a mess. Just buy it at Target or something. :)</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and beautiful color. Cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> A bit darker than pictured, but lasts a LONG time. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and you can barely tell it&#x27;s been used. Be careful to only use a small amount, though!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful Color, you do not need much, goes on smoothly and stays put, does not look cakey or anything of the sort . Love it</li>
            <li> i wish it was a bit more pigmented but good for a natural look</li>
            <li> Love this product ! It is great!</li>
            <li> While the color was a bit Darker Pink than I expected, I am loving my Covergirl Classic Pink Cheekers Blush!&lt;br /&gt;The case size is perfect for fitting in my purse pocket and the case is well constructed and stays shut tight.&lt;br /&gt;The brush that Covergirl includes is perfect for easy application and blending.&lt;br /&gt;There is enough product to last a long time and as with all Covergirl products I have used, the quality is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;Very cost effective and looks every bit as good as the higher priced blushers when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I received my order quickly and without issue.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty corally-rose color..not very pigmented though.</li>
            <li> A+ This blush is the perfect color! Leaves a healthy pink glow, I know people comment ago the smell but it&#x27;s not that noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have used this kind of blush for years.  It lasts forever &amp; if you&#x27;re observant you can catch it on an amazing sale.&lt;br /&gt;However, after recently learning that Cover girl regularly tests on animals I probably will not purchase this brand in the future.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY WITH IT ////</li>
            <li> Good color - CoverGirl is my favorite makeup brand - true pink color</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom and she is delighted with the color. The size is also perfect to carry in your pierce or bag.</li>
            <li> color doesnt show.... its more like a face powder than blush.</li>
            <li> pretty color, good price, lasts well.</li>
            <li> Love it for the price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade at a stunning price! A perfect for all skin types!</li>
            <li> This blush is the perfect shade of pink.  It&#x27;s hard to find a shade of pink this light, and I hope Cover Girl will continue to make the product.</li>
            <li> the blush is natural pink not to much just right, i use cover girl very easy to apply very easy to open great price if you are looking for a new blush i would give this one a try.. You wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Small compact but perfect to carry in your purse and a little bit goes a long way as a tiny bit gives a nice glow to cheeks. The color shown is true to what I received which is always nice.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> It is okay. Good condition.</li>
            <li> I love covergirl. And I practically got this for free after clipping coupon and subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> the color is easy to use and not very overpowering</li>
            <li> This has decent staying power, no sparkle (which i&#x27;m happy about) and is a great smooth, finely milled texture.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best colors and brands of blushes that I have used!  I typically stay away from such a pink shade, but this is such a pretty, subtle pink, that I would imagine looks great on many different skin tones.  I have used many blushes from higher end make up lines, but this one lasts longer and looks better than any of those.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Good deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the blush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use with Kabuki brush</li>
            <li> Love Cover Girl and this product looked very nice on my cheeks..</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, great color!</li>
            <li> I love this blush. it was cheap and it is so pretty on my cheeks.. this picture looks darker but it is actually really pink..make sure to apply a little or your cheeks will look really pink!</li>
            <li> The texture and color is so great.It is the perfect pink that complements my light, pale skin. I also ike the brush that comes along with it. It&#x27;s so soft and dense.</li>
            <li> this product is very good easy to use and easy to use it arrived faster then i anticipated and was packed well</li>
            <li> I had heard these blushes were the hidden blush gems of the drugstore world, so I was dying to try one.  Cheap, great color, long wear.  This blush was definitely all of those things, BUT I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.  It is SO STRONG.  And it stays with you for hours.  The smell finally faded about 4-5 hours later - I couldn&#x27;t smell it.  However my daughter said she could still smell it when she came super close for a smooch.  Can you imagine being on a DATE and having STRONG stinky makeup smell on your face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, it gets worse...  I&#x27;m guessing it was about 6 hours when my daughter said she could still smell it...  But I hopped in the shower later that evening.  As soon as a few droplets of water touched my cheeks, the smell was overwhelming.  So gross!  I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.  So disappointed since the color was so pretty.  :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try [[ASIN:B000W97M82 Physicians Formula Powder Palette Blush in Blushing Rose]] instead - a bit more expensive, but still drugstore prices.  PF also has great sales and coupons from time to time.  LOVE it!  Great color and no offensive smell.  :)</li>
            <li> Este blush on es bastante bueno, el color y el acabado al aplicarlo en el cutis es bastante natural, justo lo que queria..</li>
            <li> This blush is great for my days that I have the energy to give a crap about how I look. It lasts all day, and isnt overly pink or hideous. I wish the pack itself was a bit bigger for my brush to sweep across, but that&#x27;s small potatoes. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> The blush smells a bit like a petroleum product rather than a slight spicy scent I&#x27;d gotten with others of this exact product. Also, this particular container isn&#x27;t as easy to open and close as previous ones that I&#x27;d purchased at CVS.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I always buy this in store and would always buy them anywhere. Love it love it</li>
            <li> This came in perfect packaging and ready to use, but it is lighter than in the picture, so IT not really my color. But I&#x27;m gifting it to my mom!</li>
            <li> I really like this color.  It is a nice light natural blush.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that the powder did not crumble with use. It will be long lasting and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li> nice color, works well on my wife&#x27;s face. doesnt stay on all day and comes off easily in the evenings.</li>
            <li> This will be given to my niece in a gift basket for Christmas along with other make-up items</li>
            <li> My daughter is wearing make-up for the first time and this has been great for her.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Cover Girl blush is nice. I like the color that I bought. I just wish I did not have to &#x27;re-apply as often.</li>
            <li> Love this blush and you can&#x27;t beat the price of it on Amazon.  It stays on well even in humid weather.</li>
            <li> nice blush and good color ..</li>
            <li> This is a no-frills product that gets the job done for the right price. It&#x27;s not fancy and it smells kind of weird, but the colors are very pretty, and it lasts all day. As cheap as it is, definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and wants more make up now!</li>
            <li> I love this blush, it is simiple, and the colors are great, true to color, blends well, goes on well, stays on all day, not cakey, smooth, just like a great powder, great price, last for a long time, can mix it up with another shade if wanted, small so can carry with you if wanted, had no trouble receiving, came quickly, packaged well. cant say enough good things about this! so highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this blush and it goes on nicely. I would definately buy again. I&#x27;m a fair skin blonde so the shade works great for me.</li>
            <li> great product and perfect classic pink, just like it states. It&#x27;s a great size and the brush works well too.</li>
            <li> Love the way it stays on my cheeks all day. The color is just enough to give my cheeks a natural blush without looking fake.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding the right blush - too pink, too red, too orange...I read the reviews and this product is what they said...a great color.  Just enough coverage and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Great for pale skinned gals like myself! A nice blush that will do for daily makeup and touch ups on the go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, the price is reasonable. Although the brush is uncomfortable, but at least I did&#x27;t find any unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Works Great and classic pink is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> This has a nice, bright but sheer color to it without any glitter (finally)! It has a rather strong &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; smell to it, which some may mind more than others. I have not found that it lasts a whole day on my face as others have reported - but then again, no blush does (is my skin somehow more slippery?)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it either Waste of money I don&#x27;t satisfied really really disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Wish I can get my money back :(</li>
            <li> I like the Covergirl brand but I just didn&#x27;t like this blus.&lt;br /&gt;1. Lacks pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells bad and lingers all day&lt;br /&gt;3. Breaks me out</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture, excellent shipping, and good quality.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this color for years in the stores.  Bought 3 to make sure I have enough for a while.  Looks good on blondes with light skin.  It does have a shine and reflects light off your skin.</li>
            <li> Good blush. Easy on. Nice colors. BUT the smell is INCREDIBLY strong. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for ANYONE even if you like the smell because the smell is so strong, you&#x27;ll be bothering other people. My friend also tried this and just being in the car with her wearing this gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I love to read but not handling large books with small print.  As a senior adult, the non glare screen is a real help with the cataracts and the ability to easily adjust the print size has made this one of my best birthday presents.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love it the color is suitable for my skin and the delievery is good. Hope to buy more things from here.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken to bits</li>
            <li> Great brand &amp; perfect color. Was just as i expected. :)</li>
            <li> Cute and easy to apply! I&#x27;m not one for bright colors so originally it was a tad darker than expected but cute regardless!</li>
            <li> My only complaint about CoverGirl Cheekers Blush is that it should be in a slightly larger container, so that I could pick up more product when I use my own blush brush. That being said, the pros most definitely outweigh that little problem. The color is excellent. I can use this blush and get a fresh, rosy glow without ending up with a clown face when the oils of my skin start reacting to it during the day. The application is perfection -- I don&#x27;t have to constantly build to get any color saturation. It&#x27;s just right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new blush to add to your collection, but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot to try something new, you can&#x27;t go wrong with CoverGirl Cheekers Blush in Classic Pink.</li>
            <li> Works great. No complaints here. I like the color and the application.</li>
            <li> I bought it through a promotion code a found on Twitter, never realized on the color only thought it was a good deal, but when it arrived I realized of my mistake. I&#x27;m a brunette (not trying to be a racist) Indian skin color and didn&#x27;t like it at all how it look on my cheeks. The brush had some loose strings too. It was a life lesson.</li>
            <li> got this for $.77 !! thank you</li>
            <li> Great Product!&lt;br /&gt;Fast deliver!</li>
            <li> Covergirl must have stopped making this blush or stopped selling it in stores because I can&#x27;t find Classic Pink ANYWHERE anymore! It is my favorite for a bright summertime blush. I am so glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
