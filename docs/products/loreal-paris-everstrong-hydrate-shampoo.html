            <li>, I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s best to limit washes to every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>While it may please some, I don&#x27;t think this is the best shampoo for African-American hair.</li>
            <li>Wonderful shampoo.</li>

            <li>.......it&#x27;s the best!</li>

            <li>I have tried so many and I am very satisfied!</li>

            <li>Holy bejesus is it making an amazing difference.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was looking for a Sulfate Free Shampoo and this had great reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still shaking my hair tonight at almost midnight and loving the softness and movement.</li>
            <li>Two (enthusiastic) thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li>While I wish it was even more chemical free and safe for you hair, it is among the best options for color treated hair at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>One star for the creamy lather and nice scent.</li>
            <li>Before, it just felt kind of damaged.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome my hair is calm healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li>it smells kind of like walking through a evergreen forest.</li>
            <li>I liked it, it was nice on my hair and it made my hair smell nice</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair throughout the day because it feels so amazing.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a really good sulfate free shampoo and saw how pricey some products were,</li>
            <li>It smelled great and was nice, and I used the entire bottle happily.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, smells awesome, and shows almost no frizzies.  </li>
            <li>Amazing, considering how many products and techniques I have tried to do just that.</li>
            <li>So far I am impressed.</li>
            <li>Your best bet is Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my scalp feeling fresh (not tingly).</li>
            <li>It smells great, like salon quality products and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the clean smell vs. the fruity flowery stuff.</li>
            <li>good price, fast shipping and  good production.</li>
            <li>My hair became gradually more brittle and frizzy</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>The only thing good about it is it smells really great.</li>
            <li>This works better than anything I have tried.  </li>
            <li>However, most of the time I can do a blowout and just use a dot of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>It also has a lovely smell.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad that I found out.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I can tell its difference from the cheap shampoo you buy in grocery stores!</li>
            <li>I am seriously in love- even though I wish this was a fruity smell.</li>
            <li>LOVE THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSS&lt;</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>I also use the conditioner - love them both.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the L&#x27;oreal Everpure/Everstrong lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it more.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>It is better than most high-end shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This use to be my favorite product until I read ALL of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>This works as well or better at a quarter the price.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Much better for your scalp with the sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>just so I&#x27;ll have it if, like most products I favor, it disappears from the marketplace.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for awhile :)</li>
            <li>I tried many brands of shampoo before.  </li>
            <li>I have healthy hair to begin with</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell, the rosemary scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all..  </li>
            <li>/&gt;you&#x27;ll love this shampoo,..</li>
            <li>This shampoo and Dove&#x27;s intensive repair shampoo are definitely the best on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and much more healthy looking and feeling than before I started using it.  </li>
            <li>have switched to this more affordable shampoo from</li>
            <li>and this shampoo keeps my hair healthy and won&#x27;t fade away the colors your hair</li>
            <li>So this shampoo is not at all sulfate free!</li>
            <li>I love all Loreal products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>had bleached my hair and this alone will not keep it healthy, get some 10 products c:</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I still love it.  </li>
            <li>Except will say this, they both seem to do a good job making my hair feel clean, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>The first wash you can see you hair soo shiny in healthy clean way!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, LIke WEN better</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this L&#x27;Oreal product, being the parent company for Kerastase &amp; all the great reviews I read.</li>
            <li>I got pretty good stretch to my coils.</li>
            <li>On the positive side this shampoo smells really good, has a nice lather - despite being sulfate free, and my scalp did feel \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; and clean.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this entire line, this smells the most &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and gives me great results.</li>
            <li>I love the smell also, a light, non over bearing herbal scent.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m close to the end of the first set of tubes, I&#x27;m amazed at how my hair continues to get silkier and my scalp very healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo/conditioner and hope it will always be available.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo, nice clean scent, and makes my hair very soft, smooth, and shiny, which are precisely the things I&#x27;m looking for in a shampoo.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers very well, smells good, and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li>Rite Aid&#x27;s product just does NOT get that amazing herbal/Rosemary scent quite right, and it is heavenly.  </li>
            <li>This is the first of many shampoo products I&#x27;ve tried throughout the years that actually works and it smells wonderful too</li>
            <li>Not bad to start!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how something that is supposed to make my hair strong could make my hair so brittle.</li>
            <li>I strongly advise reviewing the ingredient list for this product before purchasing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for the last year and find it very good, leaves my hair smelling fresh and healthy</li>
            <li>My hair is growing so healthy and full.</li>
            <li>I often looked as if my hair was full of static.    </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it is ok when you follow with a good, deep conditioner, but still not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I think I have found the perfect shampoo for my hair type :) I recently bought the Eversleak Conditioner to go with this, but have just used it once so can&#x27;t give a real review on that just yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying new shampoos to find a good balance between oiliness and damage protection.</li>
            <li>With my fine hair I can&#x27;t use a cream rinse</li>
            <li>Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li>(I have had problems with joico and that bed head brand making me super itchy!)</li>
            <li>, scent is really mild and I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended I purchase sulfate free shampoo and conditioner after I had a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo when I saw this one.</li>
            <li>When my hair dried I could still smell the shampoo which smells awesome.</li>
            <li>so I bought one of each the moisture shampoo and smooth conditioner for my hair and the hydrate shampoo and the reconstruct conditioner for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and was looking for shampoo which is free from sulphate..</li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d try out a sulphate free product.</li>
            <li>Never knew what the heck sulfate free was</li>
            <li>My hair felt smooth when it was being rinsed out and it didn&#x27;t feel (and look) like tumbleweed when I let it airdry.</li>
            <li>The entire line of L&#x27;Oreal Ever- products is great.</li>
            <li>Although it says it is sulfate free it is not.</li>
            <li>If you have had a hair straightening treatment and must use sulfate free hair products, I recommend this.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo because it is sulfate free..</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo.......</li>
            <li>I love this product, it leaves my hair untangled, soft, smells great, and my hair feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Women of color really should use this product!!!</li>
            <li>It makes a rich lather</li>
            <li>Tons of rich lather.</li>
            <li>make you familiar with the situation)  </li>
            <li>I tried this since it is sulfate-free, however, I noticed significant hair falling out in the tub and over the sink after three uses over the course of a week.</li>
            <li>- this shampoo is so rich.</li>
            <li>This is honestly the best shampoo I have ever tried I have long highlighted hair and my hair stopped being dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>Smells medicated, like a minty Head &amp; Shoulders; 2) it lathers well, but does not leave hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Money well spend my hair is stays clean a lot longer</li>
            <li>Clean hair without sulfates to damage my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people say that the shampoos without the sulfites (the stuff that makes it bubbly) don&#x27;t feel like they make your hair clean.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and healthy feeling now!</li>
            <li>today is that my scalp feels amazingly stimulated, clean and alive.</li>
            <li>Since I use another conditioner, I&#x27;m sure about it moisturizing, but it does not take much product to get my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>Place orders on the third day, I received a parcel, freight quickly, and the product is very easy to use, and the price is very cheap,</li>
            <li>So I thought I would give it one last shot at finding a good product before I went and cut my hair off yet again.</li>
            <li>Always try the product yourself and buy from a retailer where you can get full refund.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a true sulfate-free shampoo, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>My hair was more easily manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is too strong and it is still noticeable and nice the next day (if you&#x27;re going to skip a day washing).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Aveda user</li>
            <li>It was far more damaging to my hair than even cheap shampoos with SLS.</li>
            <li>but found this little gem to be just as or more effective with our family&#x27;s hair type.</li>
            <li>It rarely tangles.</li>
            <li>I made sure to massage it into my scalp too, thinking it might remove old residue if it was there.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to have more body and natural bounce.  </li>
            <li>The product has a natural rosemary scent, which I love.</li>
            <li>I often use this shampoo for washing my hair and it let it more hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I hope this never goes off the market either, I am glad to find a high-quality product that&#x27;s both cruelty-free AND natural.</li>
            <li>Now it so soft and smooth, i don&#x27;t need conditioners anymore!</li>
            <li>This is the only kind I like, and I often use it as a body wash as well.  </li>
            <li>The overwhelming scent nearly gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and manageable and I love the fact it has no phosphates in it.</li>
            <li>If I used it without also using a conditioner, my hair was left significantly drier and more straw-like than before.  </li>
            <li>and i can only be glad that i got this when it was 5$ where as the 8$ its at right now!</li>
            <li>after even the first use of L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Hydrate Shampoo &amp; conditioner I felt a huge difference, it really worked.</li>
            <li>Recommend this product to anyone who wants to get clean hair without the damage.</li>
            <li>So the &#x27;Sulfate Free&#x27; label is a highly misleading bait.</li>
            <li>but I certainly hope they&#x27;ll bring a bigger size out, because I&#x27;ll pay for it :)!</li>
            <li>the color I paid to have in it was more translusent,my hair was easir to comb and style, I love this shampoo,it actually did what it said, put mosturre back in my hair made me feel younger, thank you for a true honest product..</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, blonde hair which goes flat with most hydrating products or gets tangled with most \\&quot;pure\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my hair in such great condition that I ran out and bought the overnight and weekly treatment.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even run my hands over my head, as one does when rinsing without them skidding (instead of a smooth swipe); 3) it left huge knots in my hair.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, there was enough shampoo left for three hair washings and the product itself is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I used the Loreal first.</li>
            <li>I looked at the reviews and it appeared to be exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>My hair already looks and feels healthier after the first use.</li>
            <li>the lid on the shamppo was open and most of the shampoo drained out...</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and its minty smell!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li>For the first time, I could actually go for more than 2 days without shampooing.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I think this one is way better than the body shop shampoo.</li>
            <li>Going back to my favorite product, Neutrogena Triple Moisture</li>
            <li>I have only used this product once, but I was so pleased with the results that I felt the need to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Afterward, my hair is soft and feels clean without being stripped.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I use the shampoo and conditioner together and my hair feels clean, soft, comb-able, shiny, and still manages to have some body.</li>
            <li>It feel soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m FAR too cheap for salon brands of gentle shampoo, so I was using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It is my favorite favorite find as of late.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it may be free of sodium lauryl sulfate, but the ingredients it uses as a substitute are just as harsh and damaging to hair.</li>
            <li>The produce was great at first and the sulfate-free formula ended up stopping some facial acne breakouts that I used to get when using other shampoos with SLS in them.</li>
            <li>Very little of this product is required to produce a really good lather.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all of these positive reviews.</li>
            <li>, pretty much since the moment it came out on the market.  </li>
            <li>The title pretty much says it all.  </li>
            <li>I have colored my hair in the past, which may have contributed to this, but I still was fairly dissatisfied with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was able to let it grow long!</li>
            <li>Just see the ingredient list at the back of this product - it has more chemicals (mostly unheard of) than any other shampoo I have seen.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d heard that sulphates in shampoos make hair even more dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different high end brands that are sulfate free and this shampoo is definitely comparable.</li>
            <li>I am an african american and I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I have fine longer length blonde hair.</li>
            <li>This is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>hair stays softer much longer.</li>
            <li>The conditioner feels like it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>and I have to keep reminding myself that I don&#x27;t need to use so much of the shampoo at once.  </li>
            <li>My hair no longer feels stripped of moisture and I am saving a lot of money on conditioner because I just don&#x27;t have to use as much anymore.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely hands on for me shampoo.</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>I can not believe how much of an improvement I have seen already</li>
            <li>and I have not even had these products for a whole week.</li>
            <li>I have medium curls that are a mix of coarse brittle and smooth hairs...</li>
            <li>This is one of the only shampoos in the store that is sulfate free</li>
            <li>I was reviewing sulfate free shampoos for hours before I finally decided to get it.</li>
            <li>it was thanks to what this shampoo did for me.</li>
            <li>It seems to be gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair color from being stripped and yet is light enough not to take away from the volume.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>It smells like shampoo, not a nasty smell or anything, just not much of a smell.  </li>
            <li>It really does hydrate and</li>
            <li>my hair is really think.</li>
            <li>but this stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is frizzy and often can look very untamed</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and helps to detangle the hair while I am washing.</li>
            <li>This is a really affordable sulfate-free shampoo for my colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>You can not expect too much with this price, but it deserves this price.</li>
            <li>I am glad a came back to my old stand by.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s soft and like other reviewers mention I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li>so therefore I want an all natural hair product, most of these \\&quot;natural or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; hair products claim to be natural but always have chemicals.</li>
            <li>Filled with chemicals that made my hair fall off more than usual!</li>
            <li>So far, of all the shampoos I have used, high end expensive &amp; drug store brands, this has been the best.</li>
            <li>It also contains many parabens and other damaging chemicals.</li>
            <li>It has improved this mop on my head more than any other thing I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Not only does it get my oily scalp clean and keep it that way</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s full of silicones which are very damaging to hair if not washed out properly.</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo that I only use when I take down my braids.</li>
            <li>Last night I used the overnight treatment for the first time and just after shampooing it out, the comb ran right through the damaged strands.</li>
            <li>We have tried many other (high dollar)</li>
            <li>It has nice fragnance and also lathers well with very little quantity..</li>
            <li>And this is comming from someone with wavy dry and fine hair.</li>
            <li>With its first use I noticed a complete difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However, this will definitely be a new staple of mine!</li>
            <li>First, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the few dollars more on this shampoo, so I got the Rite Aid brand knockoff of this product, right next to it on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>Somehow my wavy texture looked more neat and defined and less wirey.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair super silky, bouncy, and managible throughout the entire day...</li>
            <li>Only downside is that it runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>Our family enjoys this product because it is sulfate free and helps our hair type (thin blond) feel healthy.</li>
            <li>However, after about a week of using the product, my hair started to fall out in decent amounts during each shower.</li>
            <li>I have fine, normal to dry, color-treated hair, nothing overly temperamental.  </li>
            <li>It still makes a decent lather even without sulfates.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;d highly recommend this as a sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend it to people with chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and it has completely transformed my dry, brittle hair into soft, silky, moisturized hair.</li>
            <li>I originally got this to help from drying out my already dry hair.</li>
            <li>Both times, the shower drain was filled with hair and my hair had a horribly rough texture afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It really CHANGED the texture of my hair and my hair is so sleek, soft, and shiny that my husband who normally doesn&#x27;t notice things about my hair asked me what I was doing to it.</li>
            <li>My hair has thinned on my sides and bangs, the back is still pretty much all there.</li>
            <li>Have been using for over two years w no complaint.  </li>
            <li>and I saw that it was thick and covered my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this new shampoo line, so I bought the shampoo, conditioner and masque versions of this product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very concentrated so you only need a pea-size amount for rich later.</li>
            <li>Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight, very dark blonde/gray, medium to fine hair.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the rich lather (that you get from this product) is not really what you want in a conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried leaving it in for 5 minutes and air drying, hair is still super dry.</li>
            <li>I can use Pantene shampoo from Walmart the next day and lose maybe 2 or 3 hairs in the towel or in my hairbrush which appears to be a little more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out why my hair is a dry, tangled mess after I wash it, even if I also deep conditioned it with an excellent deep conditioner under the dryer for an hour.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My hair literally looks exactly like it did when I left for work this</li>
            <li>I wanted to like it, but it left my hair pretty oily.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft on the ends after using it!  </li>
            <li>I had wanted a rosemary mint set (I love the smell of Aveda but usually use L&#x27;Oreal)</li>
            <li>Suds up very well, but is gentle enough for everyday use-- though unless you&#x27;re exercising daily or have very fine, oily hair</li>
            <li>I have just placed now my second order for this shampoo and conditioner, because after just a week or so of regularly using them my hair was silky, smooth, soft, and completely manageable.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo on a wimb because the sulfate free tea tree shampoo I normally use was not available.</li>
            <li>I notice that the sulfate free shampoos are less drying and damaging to my hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product so much, and I did the first time I used it, but the second time it left greasy gunk in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several sulfate-free shampoos (even a very expensive \\&quot;Surface Bassu\\&quot;) and this has by far been the best.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t really see much difference from using it, until lately (several months later), my hair seems to be getting less dry.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER is improving the condition of my hair (from dry, thick, and brittle) to moisturized, breakage free, and shedding free (because for some reason a lot of my hair falls out...</li>
            <li>of the reviews I read on Amazon recently about this shampoo was to use it with Aveeno Pure Renewal conditioner (also sulfate</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been wedded to the same silicone-filled conditioner for my naturally curly hair, which I blow out straight every day  </li>
            <li>Took 2 weeks to clear up -</li>
            <li>Once I rinsed it out my hair was so soft and not striped.</li>
            <li>It has never been so soft and tamed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve color treated at home with L&#x27;Oreal hair color for 30 years and use Natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an early 30s</li>
            <li>I also work out almost every night of the week, so this combo is gentle enough to let me wash my hair every night, but also gives me no product build up or greasiness for the times on the weekend when I skip shampooing.  </li>
            <li>The reason I am switching from the generic brand of this shampoo to the branded product is really the smell.  </li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>My hair does feel soft though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural</li>
            <li>My hair was being over-stripped, even though it is natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; have had problems with lotions, soaps &amp; creams, but have never had a problem with shampoos or conditioners until I bought this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 times so far</li>
            <li>My brittle hair became soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li>your hair will be wonderfully soft and shiny - this shampoo is garbage.</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky hair</li>
            <li>but this price is much better, and actually sometimes WEn leaves my hair limp.</li>
            <li>(Other sulfate free haircare lines left my hair greasy, and sulfates shampoos made my hair experience over-compensation)</li>
            <li>The trouble with other sulfate-free shampoos is that there&#x27;s hardly any lather (if at all), but this one produces a fine, luxurious lather that is very satisfying.  </li>
            <li>The last time I tried one of their shampoos was about 10 years ago, and it did the exact same thing then.  </li>
            <li>Once stopped using it, got back to normal.</li>
            <li>saying that it is a rich shampoo, so if you have really oily hair probably not a good choice.  </li>
            <li>I have Indian 2B black hair and this works wonderfully to calm the frizz in my hair and</li>
            <li>and he had to pour on leave-in conditioner since he felt his hair was also much too dry.</li>
            <li>My hair has been pretty coarse and dry all my life.</li>
            <li>This product caused more hair loss than usual and caused my hair to be dry!</li>
            <li>I was shocked at how great it has been.  </li>
            <li>something natural redhead who occasionally gets a color glaze (non permanent) or two a year to boost the color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 19 yr old female who has battled oily hair since I was 12.</li>
            <li>have not had the same experience with Pantene&#x27;s and Aussie&#x27;s \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; or \\&quot;damage repair\\&quot; shampoos, both brands leaving a lot of residual junk near my roots.</li>
            <li>I was tired and sweaty and needed to wash my hair more often.</li>
            <li>But as soon as I go back to the Loreal EVERSTRONG hydrating shampoo, I will have a handful of at least 25-30 hairs in my hand and another handful lying on the drain, and I don&#x27;t scrub at my head really strong</li>
            <li>However, I noticed right away that it was breaking down the keratin faster than my regular no-lather sulfate-free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>For me, that&#x27;s totally worth the extra few bucks, and if you order from Amazon, that price difference is far smaller.    </li>
            <li>The only ones I could find for a long time were \\&quot;health food store\\&quot; brands, and they did work as far as allowing my scalp to heal up from the sensitivity to the harsh, drying chemicals in most shampoos but left my hair very dry and flyaway.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to other people because it cleans my hair really well.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to African American women with natural hair.</li>
            <li>With infrequent use of this shampoo (once weekly), and daily use of the conditioner and the leave-in balm, my hair is soft and finally not stripped, not sticky with product.</li>
            <li>to get the tangles out; 4) it left my hair dry &amp; frizzy (also used the conditioner to go with it) &amp; last, but not least it stripped a lot of color from my hair!</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much shinier, which is a bonus because my hair is dark.</li>
            <li>The point is - don&#x27;t buy a cosmetic product just because it touts the absence of a major &#x27;undesirable ingredient&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I expected to have completely dried out (but clean) hair after I finished washing, but this was not the case.</li>
            <li>The problem is that my hair has looked so old for about 4 years and really brittle and lifeless this past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Lastly, if you&#x27;ve been to a smoky bar or generally around cigarettes, this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that can get that cigarette smoke smell out.      </li>
            <li>My hair is never dry any more, no split ends, and my hair shedding/breakage has been at least cut in half.   </li>
            <li>First off a little goes a long way</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still shaking my hair tonight at almost midnight and loving the softness and movement.</li>
            <li> Two (enthusiastic) thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> While I wish it was even more chemical free and safe for you hair, it is among the best options for color treated hair at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> One star for the creamy lather and nice scent.</li>
            <li> Before, it just felt kind of damaged.  </li>

            <li> My hair is soft, smells awesome, and shows almost no frizzies.  </li>
            <li> Amazing, considering how many products and techniques I have tried to do just that.</li>
            <li> So far I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Your best bet is Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my scalp feeling fresh (not tingly).</li>
            <li> It smells great, like salon quality products and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the clean smell vs. the fruity flowery stuff.</li>
            <li> good price, fast shipping and  good production.</li>
            <li> My hair became gradually more brittle and frizzy</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> The only thing good about it is it smells really great.</li>
            <li> This works better than anything I have tried.  </li>
            <li> However, most of the time I can do a blowout and just use a dot of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> It also has a lovely smell.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad that I found out.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I can tell its difference from the cheap shampoo you buy in grocery stores!</li>
            <li> I am seriously in love- even though I wish this was a fruity smell.</li>
            <li> LOVE THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSS&lt;</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> I also use the conditioner - love them both.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love the L&#x27;oreal Everpure/Everstrong lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it more.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> It is better than most high-end shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This use to be my favorite product until I read ALL of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This works as well or better at a quarter the price.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Much better for your scalp with the sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> just so I&#x27;ll have it if, like most products I favor, it disappears from the marketplace.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for awhile :)</li>
            <li> I tried many brands of shampoo before.  </li>
            <li> I have healthy hair to begin with</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I also love the smell, the rosemary scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all..  </li>
            <li> /&gt;you&#x27;ll love this shampoo,..</li>
            <li> This shampoo and Dove&#x27;s intensive repair shampoo are definitely the best on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and much more healthy looking and feeling than before I started using it.  </li>
            <li> have switched to this more affordable shampoo from</li>
            <li> and this shampoo keeps my hair healthy and won&#x27;t fade away the colors your hair</li>
            <li> So this shampoo is not at all sulfate free!</li>
            <li> I love all Loreal products and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> had bleached my hair and this alone will not keep it healthy, get some 10 products c:</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I still love it.  </li>
            <li> Except will say this, they both seem to do a good job making my hair feel clean, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> The first wash you can see you hair soo shiny in healthy clean way!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, LIke WEN better</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this L&#x27;Oreal product, being the parent company for Kerastase &amp; all the great reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I got pretty good stretch to my coils.</li>
            <li> On the positive side this shampoo smells really good, has a nice lather - despite being sulfate free, and my scalp did feel \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; and clean.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this entire line, this smells the most &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and gives me great results.</li>
            <li> I love the smell also, a light, non over bearing herbal scent.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m close to the end of the first set of tubes, I&#x27;m amazed at how my hair continues to get silkier and my scalp very healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner and hope it will always be available.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, nice clean scent, and makes my hair very soft, smooth, and shiny, which are precisely the things I&#x27;m looking for in a shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers very well, smells good, and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li> Rite Aid&#x27;s product just does NOT get that amazing herbal/Rosemary scent quite right, and it is heavenly.  </li>
            <li> This is the first of many shampoo products I&#x27;ve tried throughout the years that actually works and it smells wonderful too</li>
            <li> Not bad to start!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how something that is supposed to make my hair strong could make my hair so brittle.</li>
            <li> I strongly advise reviewing the ingredient list for this product before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the last year and find it very good, leaves my hair smelling fresh and healthy</li>
            <li> My hair is growing so healthy and full.</li>
            <li> I often looked as if my hair was full of static.    </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it is ok when you follow with a good, deep conditioner, but still not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I think I have found the perfect shampoo for my hair type :) I recently bought the Eversleak Conditioner to go with this, but have just used it once so can&#x27;t give a real review on that just yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new shampoos to find a good balance between oiliness and damage protection.</li>
            <li> With my fine hair I can&#x27;t use a cream rinse</li>
            <li> Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> (I have had problems with joico and that bed head brand making me super itchy!)</li>
            <li> , scent is really mild and I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended I purchase sulfate free shampoo and conditioner after I had a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo when I saw this one.</li>
            <li> When my hair dried I could still smell the shampoo which smells awesome.</li>
            <li> so I bought one of each the moisture shampoo and smooth conditioner for my hair and the hydrate shampoo and the reconstruct conditioner for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and was looking for shampoo which is free from sulphate..</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d try out a sulphate free product.</li>
            <li> Never knew what the heck sulfate free was</li>
            <li> My hair felt smooth when it was being rinsed out and it didn&#x27;t feel (and look) like tumbleweed when I let it airdry.</li>
            <li> The entire line of L&#x27;Oreal Ever- products is great.</li>
            <li> Although it says it is sulfate free it is not.</li>
            <li> If you have had a hair straightening treatment and must use sulfate free hair products, I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo because it is sulfate free..</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo.......</li>
            <li> I love this product, it leaves my hair untangled, soft, smells great, and my hair feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Women of color really should use this product!!!</li>
            <li> It makes a rich lather</li>
            <li> Tons of rich lather.</li>
            <li> make you familiar with the situation)  </li>
            <li> I tried this since it is sulfate-free, however, I noticed significant hair falling out in the tub and over the sink after three uses over the course of a week.</li>
            <li> - this shampoo is so rich.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best shampoo I have ever tried I have long highlighted hair and my hair stopped being dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Smells medicated, like a minty Head &amp; Shoulders; 2) it lathers well, but does not leave hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Money well spend my hair is stays clean a lot longer</li>
            <li> Clean hair without sulfates to damage my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people say that the shampoos without the sulfites (the stuff that makes it bubbly) don&#x27;t feel like they make your hair clean.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and healthy feeling now!</li>
            <li> today is that my scalp feels amazingly stimulated, clean and alive.</li>
            <li> Since I use another conditioner, I&#x27;m sure about it moisturizing, but it does not take much product to get my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> Place orders on the third day, I received a parcel, freight quickly, and the product is very easy to use, and the price is very cheap,</li>
            <li> So I thought I would give it one last shot at finding a good product before I went and cut my hair off yet again.</li>
            <li> Always try the product yourself and buy from a retailer where you can get full refund.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a true sulfate-free shampoo, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My hair was more easily manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is too strong and it is still noticeable and nice the next day (if you&#x27;re going to skip a day washing).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Aveda user</li>
            <li> It was far more damaging to my hair than even cheap shampoos with SLS.</li>
            <li> but found this little gem to be just as or more effective with our family&#x27;s hair type.</li>
            <li> It rarely tangles.</li>
            <li> I made sure to massage it into my scalp too, thinking it might remove old residue if it was there.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to have more body and natural bounce.  </li>
            <li> The product has a natural rosemary scent, which I love.</li>
            <li> I often use this shampoo for washing my hair and it let it more hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I hope this never goes off the market either, I am glad to find a high-quality product that&#x27;s both cruelty-free AND natural.</li>
            <li> Now it so soft and smooth, i don&#x27;t need conditioners anymore!</li>
            <li> This is the only kind I like, and I often use it as a body wash as well.  </li>
            <li> The overwhelming scent nearly gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable and I love the fact it has no phosphates in it.</li>
            <li> If I used it without also using a conditioner, my hair was left significantly drier and more straw-like than before.  </li>
            <li> and i can only be glad that i got this when it was 5$ where as the 8$ its at right now!</li>
            <li> after even the first use of L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Hydrate Shampoo &amp; conditioner I felt a huge difference, it really worked.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product to anyone who wants to get clean hair without the damage.</li>
            <li> So the &#x27;Sulfate Free&#x27; label is a highly misleading bait.</li>
            <li> but I certainly hope they&#x27;ll bring a bigger size out, because I&#x27;ll pay for it :)!</li>
            <li> the color I paid to have in it was more translusent,my hair was easir to comb and style, I love this shampoo,it actually did what it said, put mosturre back in my hair made me feel younger, thank you for a true honest product..</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, blonde hair which goes flat with most hydrating products or gets tangled with most \\&quot;pure\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair in such great condition that I ran out and bought the overnight and weekly treatment.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even run my hands over my head, as one does when rinsing without them skidding (instead of a smooth swipe); 3) it left huge knots in my hair.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, there was enough shampoo left for three hair washings and the product itself is absolutely AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I used the Loreal first.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews and it appeared to be exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> My hair already looks and feels healthier after the first use.</li>
            <li> the lid on the shamppo was open and most of the shampoo drained out...</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and its minty smell!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li> For the first time, I could actually go for more than 2 days without shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I think this one is way better than the body shop shampoo.</li>
            <li> Going back to my favorite product, Neutrogena Triple Moisture</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once, but I was so pleased with the results that I felt the need to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Afterward, my hair is soft and feels clean without being stripped.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I use the shampoo and conditioner together and my hair feels clean, soft, comb-able, shiny, and still manages to have some body.</li>
            <li> It feel soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m FAR too cheap for salon brands of gentle shampoo, so I was using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is my favorite favorite find as of late.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it may be free of sodium lauryl sulfate, but the ingredients it uses as a substitute are just as harsh and damaging to hair.</li>
            <li> The produce was great at first and the sulfate-free formula ended up stopping some facial acne breakouts that I used to get when using other shampoos with SLS in them.</li>
            <li> Very little of this product is required to produce a really good lather.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of these positive reviews.</li>
            <li> , pretty much since the moment it came out on the market.  </li>
            <li> The title pretty much says it all.  </li>
            <li> I have colored my hair in the past, which may have contributed to this, but I still was fairly dissatisfied with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was able to let it grow long!</li>
            <li> Just see the ingredient list at the back of this product - it has more chemicals (mostly unheard of) than any other shampoo I have seen.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d heard that sulphates in shampoos make hair even more dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different high end brands that are sulfate free and this shampoo is definitely comparable.</li>
            <li> I am an african american and I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I have fine longer length blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> hair stays softer much longer.</li>
            <li> The conditioner feels like it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> and I have to keep reminding myself that I don&#x27;t need to use so much of the shampoo at once.  </li>
            <li> My hair no longer feels stripped of moisture and I am saving a lot of money on conditioner because I just don&#x27;t have to use as much anymore.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely hands on for me shampoo.</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> I can not believe how much of an improvement I have seen already</li>
            <li> and I have not even had these products for a whole week.</li>
            <li> I have medium curls that are a mix of coarse brittle and smooth hairs...</li>
            <li> This is one of the only shampoos in the store that is sulfate free</li>
            <li> I was reviewing sulfate free shampoos for hours before I finally decided to get it.</li>
            <li> it was thanks to what this shampoo did for me.</li>
            <li> It seems to be gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my hair color from being stripped and yet is light enough not to take away from the volume.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> It smells like shampoo, not a nasty smell or anything, just not much of a smell.  </li>
            <li> It really does hydrate and</li>
            <li> my hair is really think.</li>
            <li> but this stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy and often can look very untamed</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and helps to detangle the hair while I am washing.</li>
            <li> This is a really affordable sulfate-free shampoo for my colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> You can not expect too much with this price, but it deserves this price.</li>
            <li> I am glad a came back to my old stand by.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s soft and like other reviewers mention I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li> so therefore I want an all natural hair product, most of these \\&quot;natural or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; hair products claim to be natural but always have chemicals.</li>
            <li> Filled with chemicals that made my hair fall off more than usual!</li>
            <li> So far, of all the shampoos I have used, high end expensive &amp; drug store brands, this has been the best.</li>
            <li> It also contains many parabens and other damaging chemicals.</li>
            <li> It has improved this mop on my head more than any other thing I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Not only does it get my oily scalp clean and keep it that way</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s full of silicones which are very damaging to hair if not washed out properly.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo that I only use when I take down my braids.</li>
            <li> Last night I used the overnight treatment for the first time and just after shampooing it out, the comb ran right through the damaged strands.</li>
            <li> We have tried many other (high dollar)</li>
            <li> It has nice fragnance and also lathers well with very little quantity..</li>
            <li> And this is comming from someone with wavy dry and fine hair.</li>
            <li> With its first use I noticed a complete difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> However, this will definitely be a new staple of mine!</li>
            <li> First, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the few dollars more on this shampoo, so I got the Rite Aid brand knockoff of this product, right next to it on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> Somehow my wavy texture looked more neat and defined and less wirey.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair super silky, bouncy, and managible throughout the entire day...</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> Our family enjoys this product because it is sulfate free and helps our hair type (thin blond) feel healthy.</li>
            <li> However, after about a week of using the product, my hair started to fall out in decent amounts during each shower.</li>
            <li> I have fine, normal to dry, color-treated hair, nothing overly temperamental.  </li>
            <li> It still makes a decent lather even without sulfates.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;d highly recommend this as a sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend it to people with chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and it has completely transformed my dry, brittle hair into soft, silky, moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> I originally got this to help from drying out my already dry hair.</li>
            <li> Both times, the shower drain was filled with hair and my hair had a horribly rough texture afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It really CHANGED the texture of my hair and my hair is so sleek, soft, and shiny that my husband who normally doesn&#x27;t notice things about my hair asked me what I was doing to it.</li>
            <li> My hair has thinned on my sides and bangs, the back is still pretty much all there.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over two years w no complaint.  </li>
            <li> and I saw that it was thick and covered my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this new shampoo line, so I bought the shampoo, conditioner and masque versions of this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very concentrated so you only need a pea-size amount for rich later.</li>
            <li> Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight, very dark blonde/gray, medium to fine hair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the rich lather (that you get from this product) is not really what you want in a conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried leaving it in for 5 minutes and air drying, hair is still super dry.</li>
            <li> I can use Pantene shampoo from Walmart the next day and lose maybe 2 or 3 hairs in the towel or in my hairbrush which appears to be a little more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out why my hair is a dry, tangled mess after I wash it, even if I also deep conditioned it with an excellent deep conditioner under the dryer for an hour.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> My hair literally looks exactly like it did when I left for work this</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but it left my hair pretty oily.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft on the ends after using it!  </li>
            <li> I had wanted a rosemary mint set (I love the smell of Aveda but usually use L&#x27;Oreal)</li>
            <li> Suds up very well, but is gentle enough for everyday use-- though unless you&#x27;re exercising daily or have very fine, oily hair</li>
            <li> I have just placed now my second order for this shampoo and conditioner, because after just a week or so of regularly using them my hair was silky, smooth, soft, and completely manageable.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo on a wimb because the sulfate free tea tree shampoo I normally use was not available.</li>
            <li> I notice that the sulfate free shampoos are less drying and damaging to my hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product so much, and I did the first time I used it, but the second time it left greasy gunk in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several sulfate-free shampoos (even a very expensive \\&quot;Surface Bassu\\&quot;) and this has by far been the best.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t really see much difference from using it, until lately (several months later), my hair seems to be getting less dry.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER is improving the condition of my hair (from dry, thick, and brittle) to moisturized, breakage free, and shedding free (because for some reason a lot of my hair falls out...</li>
            <li> of the reviews I read on Amazon recently about this shampoo was to use it with Aveeno Pure Renewal conditioner (also sulfate</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been wedded to the same silicone-filled conditioner for my naturally curly hair, which I blow out straight every day  </li>
            <li> Took 2 weeks to clear up -</li>
            <li> Once I rinsed it out my hair was so soft and not striped.</li>
            <li> It has never been so soft and tamed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve color treated at home with L&#x27;Oreal hair color for 30 years and use Natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an early 30s</li>
            <li> I also work out almost every night of the week, so this combo is gentle enough to let me wash my hair every night, but also gives me no product build up or greasiness for the times on the weekend when I skip shampooing.  </li>
            <li> The reason I am switching from the generic brand of this shampoo to the branded product is really the smell.  </li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> My hair does feel soft though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural</li>
            <li> My hair was being over-stripped, even though it is natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; have had problems with lotions, soaps &amp; creams, but have never had a problem with shampoos or conditioners until I bought this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times so far</li>
            <li> My brittle hair became soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li> your hair will be wonderfully soft and shiny - this shampoo is garbage.</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky hair</li>
            <li> but this price is much better, and actually sometimes WEn leaves my hair limp.</li>
            <li> (Other sulfate free haircare lines left my hair greasy, and sulfates shampoos made my hair experience over-compensation)</li>
            <li> The trouble with other sulfate-free shampoos is that there&#x27;s hardly any lather (if at all), but this one produces a fine, luxurious lather that is very satisfying.  </li>
            <li> The last time I tried one of their shampoos was about 10 years ago, and it did the exact same thing then.  </li>
            <li> Once stopped using it, got back to normal.</li>
            <li> saying that it is a rich shampoo, so if you have really oily hair probably not a good choice.  </li>
            <li> I have Indian 2B black hair and this works wonderfully to calm the frizz in my hair and</li>
            <li> and he had to pour on leave-in conditioner since he felt his hair was also much too dry.</li>
            <li> My hair has been pretty coarse and dry all my life.</li>
            <li> This product caused more hair loss than usual and caused my hair to be dry!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how great it has been.  </li>
            <li> something natural redhead who occasionally gets a color glaze (non permanent) or two a year to boost the color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 yr old female who has battled oily hair since I was 12.</li>
            <li> have not had the same experience with Pantene&#x27;s and Aussie&#x27;s \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; or \\&quot;damage repair\\&quot; shampoos, both brands leaving a lot of residual junk near my roots.</li>
            <li> I was tired and sweaty and needed to wash my hair more often.</li>
            <li> But as soon as I go back to the Loreal EVERSTRONG hydrating shampoo, I will have a handful of at least 25-30 hairs in my hand and another handful lying on the drain, and I don&#x27;t scrub at my head really strong</li>
            <li> However, I noticed right away that it was breaking down the keratin faster than my regular no-lather sulfate-free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> For me, that&#x27;s totally worth the extra few bucks, and if you order from Amazon, that price difference is far smaller.    </li>
            <li> The only ones I could find for a long time were \\&quot;health food store\\&quot; brands, and they did work as far as allowing my scalp to heal up from the sensitivity to the harsh, drying chemicals in most shampoos but left my hair very dry and flyaway.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to other people because it cleans my hair really well.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to African American women with natural hair.</li>
            <li> With infrequent use of this shampoo (once weekly), and daily use of the conditioner and the leave-in balm, my hair is soft and finally not stripped, not sticky with product.</li>
            <li> to get the tangles out; 4) it left my hair dry &amp; frizzy (also used the conditioner to go with it) &amp; last, but not least it stripped a lot of color from my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much shinier, which is a bonus because my hair is dark.</li>
            <li> The point is - don&#x27;t buy a cosmetic product just because it touts the absence of a major &#x27;undesirable ingredient&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I expected to have completely dried out (but clean) hair after I finished washing, but this was not the case.</li>
            <li> The problem is that my hair has looked so old for about 4 years and really brittle and lifeless this past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lastly, if you&#x27;ve been to a smoky bar or generally around cigarettes, this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that can get that cigarette smoke smell out.      </li>
            <li> My hair is never dry any more, no split ends, and my hair shedding/breakage has been at least cut in half.   </li>
            <li> First off a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My hair type is fine and oily, so I do have to wash everyday (drag) but this shampoo and conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged -- chemically processed and flat ironed daily!</li>
            <li> Normally after a shower the little hair that I do have is in a giant knot.</li>
            <li> I do notice that I occasionally have to put on a silicone product to smooth it after a blowout, but that&#x27;s to be expected with hair as long as mine and in an area of the country with seriously fluctuating weather.  </li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair - this shampoo still really dried out my hair, and I only used it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and requires less shampoo in your hand than other shampoos designed for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> For the price alone, there is no way I&#x27;ll ever go back to paying $15-$20 + for shampoo again as long as this is around.</li>
            <li> I can flat iron my hair without any addition of products.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair with is always felt like straw after flat iron before.</li>
            <li> PLUS, my hair naturally fell down straighter,</li>
            <li> However, having said that, each individual responds to cosmetics differently and so this just may work for you - but this DEFINITELY is NOT a safe, natural and universally beneficial product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks new.  </li>
            <li> I normally only wash my hair about twice a week because it is so dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about the last week and every time I use it my hair falls out in handfuls as I am attempting to dry it.  </li>
            <li> And this shampoo left my hair so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used even more expensive color safe/sulfate free shampoos that don&#x27;t perform half as well, sometimes even worse.</li>
            <li> Not significantly greater than shampoos I&#x27;ve used before nor does it leave a nice shampoo smell (doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything), but because of my hair slowly getting better without knowing the reasons behind it, I&#x27;m afraid of giving this product too much and too little credit to change to any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the only one ever to make my damaged, coarse, faded crap halo of hair so so shiny, soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair soft (still a little frizzy..</li>
            <li> so often with other shampoos I cant wash everyday or it will dry out my hair but with this shampoo it leaves it really clean without drying it out with harsh chemicals which also makes it brittle.</li>
            <li> When I joked that the products available in the salon were almost as expensive as the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I use to love this product but there are some disappointing ingredients.</li>
            <li> I took a break from this shampoo for a long while and I regret it.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> Considering that sulphates are a harsh detergent, I&#x27;m surprised that a shampoo without</li>
            <li> I started using this product while I was beginning a week long move to another place.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit harder to wash out than regular shampoo</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy, fine hair prone to tangling, and I think this shampoo probably made the tangling worse.  </li>
            <li> My scalp has ceased its torturous itching and my hair seems stronger and less brittle than before when I&#x27;d often experience a lot of fine broken hairs in my brush.</li>
            <li> As soon as I dried my hair, I noticed that my hair felt thick and full.  </li>
            <li> This will only dry out your hair so read the ingredients carefully before you buy anything.</li>
            <li> My scalp immediately broke out with red, itchy bumps that later turned into a scabby, flakey mess.  </li>
            <li> My beautician recommended that I would use only moisture shampoos and conditioners due to the overly processed of relaxers.</li>
            <li> It is naturally blonde and just the sun causes extreme damage.</li>
            <li> but every time, you just need to squeeze out little that is enough, personally.</li>
            <li> have used panteen and other shampoo&#x27;s all my life, and have never used a shampoo, that you can actually feel putting oil into your hair!</li>
            <li> This evidently has a high degree of silicones to produce an artificial shine.</li>
            <li> I find it lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already bad enough that sulfates strip and dry out the hair, but the shampoo I used the most often has Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, which is THE harshest sulfate.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged and dry from heat and chemicals.</li>
            <li> it did, it wasn&#x27;t dry looking anymore, my hair seemed to hair body in it,</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair does not feel stripped and dry.  </li>
            <li> And I go through less of it than the relatively thinner, cheaper conditioners like HerbalEssences.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, naturally curly (but relaxed) hair.</li>
            <li> and I feel like each time, my hair gets stronger and definitely breaks less.</li>
            <li> However, with this shampoo I washed everyday and it did not dry my hair out at all.</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy poofy untameable jew hair</li>
            <li> I am African American with relaxed hair, so it did add a small amount of moisture, not much.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it does not really clean my hair and I should wash my hair every day</li>
            <li> and this just did not clean it well enough.</li>
            <li> You only need a little</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like the other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells bad and it made my hair fall out more than normally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t only use these shampoos, though, because all of my products aren&#x27;t all-natural and you need sulfates to wash the build-up from them away, so I use a clarifying shampoo every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on salon brand shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well lathering up, but need a few months of use to determine whether it actually strengthens my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see anyone&#x27;s review mentioning that this is creamy (like Pantene shampoo) and i hate that because my hair is very long and as straight as a pin and they tend to oil much easier and faster when you use shampoo like that.</li>
            <li> I lost A LOT less hair during the detangling process because it wasn&#x27;t dry and breakage-prone.     </li>
            <li> They left my hair dull, frizzy, and dry.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I could have given it five stars, but I couldnt due to the amount of product that was lost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Kerastase user, but due to reversal of fortunes</li>
            <li> However maybe due to my nature of hair it sometimes leaves my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> do agree with other users who say that the list of other ingredients is a bit concerning.</li>
            <li> This sulfate free series by Loreal has literally transformed my hair (and I have used very expensive brands without effect, like Kerastase etc).</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not on the level of some of the other sulfate-free shampoos out there, as it is not as conditioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the overall changes in care</li>
            <li> I have used other L&#x27;Oreal shampoos &amp; conditioners before with no problem, but I&#x27;m staying away from them from now on.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and have tried all sorts of shampoos under the sun so thought why not this as well.</li>
            <li> I wonder now about the other posts.</li>
            <li> and I had other people tell me</li>
            <li> My hair is a little frizzy and dry</li>
            <li> This seems like a heavy concoction of damaging chemicals (without SLS just so that ignorant people looking for Sulfate Free shampoos rush to buy this like me) with an artificial, medicine like smell</li>
            <li> , my hair had a better balance of volume (A bad shampoo can leave my hair looking like a Christmas tree), and less frizz (for once an pledge kept!).</li>
            <li> High hopes were dashed - this stuff is very thick and does lather nicely - not sure what I think of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It managed in just three washes to make my hair extremely dry, brittle, and unmanageble.</li>
            <li> I tried the expensive types including Moroccan Oil and a few others and they all left my hair very greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> My normally dull, lifeless and drabby hair finally had some life to it...</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with this shampoo because I was expecting it to be like the L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Conditioner, which I love.</li>
            <li> I am in my forties with long, thin, coarse, color-treated (non-permanent) hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a medical condition that requires drugs that make my hair dry and thin.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super frizzy and very difficult to brush even if i use a ton of conditioner.</li>
            <li> chose not to use any other product on my hair before or after I blow dried this morning, just to see what this combo alone was going to do.</li>
            <li> i notice less shedding....</li>
            <li> alot less.</li>
            <li> no itchiness, no tightness, and less breakouts on my forehead under my bangs.  </li>
            <li> I typically experience a LOT of shedding and dryness.  </li>
            <li> significantly less frizz</li>
            <li> My subject line says it all.</li>
            <li> It seems like it may have even cut down a little on my hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I tried going back to my other usual products and then coming back to this to give it second, third chances but every time it was the same shocking result.</li>
            <li> and it left my hair extremely frizzy, thin, brittle and almost damaged.</li>
            <li> I always had a hard time finding one that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so dry dull and frizzy it doesn&#x27;t work for colored hair.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to have long hair because the ends look terrible.</li>
            <li> I like that it is less harsh on your hair</li>
            <li> Seriously I am not even being dramatic!</li>
            <li> Normaly I use mousse and a little hair</li>
            <li> There is little breakage</li>
            <li> I am a Black woman with very tightly coiled hair.</li>
            <li> so when I saw Loreal had this product I decided to by it (even though I was very nervous that it would make my hair feel dirty)  </li>
            <li> You will notice the difference in just a few washes.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair heavy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my house greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair every month with crazy colors (blue, red, green, etc.)</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t get fooled: don&#x27;t waste neither your money, nor your hair and/or health.</li>
            <li> I have found a few products that help, but nothing that compares to this.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy/curly long hair.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s less expensive than your current over-the-counter brand, I&#x27;d recommend it...</li>
            <li> My hair is worse than being at the river all week in the scorching sun while skiing &amp; boating all day long.</li>
            <li> We both have very thick, curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> eyes swollen shut, face resembling raw hamburger.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely shocked that a hair product that I purchased in a grocery store was able to outperform my expensive, high-end salon hair products.</li>
            <li> I suffered from a terrible dry scalp for years, often with lesions which would open and bleed for a long time, until finally after all testing was negative, a dermatologist recommended a hydrating and sulfate-free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> longer,and no more</li>
            <li> I found this and using it from past 3 yrs</li>
            <li> I definitely was not impressed with this shampoo at all</li>
            <li> it seems small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure), but I think it&#x27;s also something about how L&#x27;Oreal makes their hair products.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, neither does my hair feel dirty the next day like some conditioning shampoos leave it feeling.  </li>
            <li> When airdrying my hair, I would lose a lot of hairs during the difficult detangling process and, once dry, it would look as if I hadn&#x27;t moisturized it at all.     </li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged from highlighting and I was growing tired of the time it took to comb out the tangled mess it became after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard to find shampoo that works well for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made my hair feel very dry even with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t harm my hair or make it fall out as others have complained</li>
            <li> If there were negative stars I would have rated this with that.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The lather feels so thick and foamy.  </li>
            <li> I was seriously thinking of cutting my hair short to get rid of all the damage.</li>
            <li> I mean A LOT.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased a very expensive shampoo at a cosmetics specialty store before I found this product at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel worse, not better.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it does not have those nasty scents added that cause horrible allergic reactions:</li>
            <li> While I do still see my color draining when it&#x27;s washed, it&#x27;s not as bad as regular shampoo and my hair color</li>
            <li> This is not a good product, and I will throw away the remaining product.</li>
            <li> It works as well if not better than Moroccan Oil Shampoo and it is a fraction of the price!!</li>
            <li> I have terribly thin and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I have finicky hair, but this is the absolutely worse shampoo</li>
            <li> My boyfriend (who didn&#x27;t get a keratin treatment) thought it was even worse</li>
            <li> i am addicted to this sulfate-free products.</li>
            <li> Poor Product.  </li>
            <li> but I could see a dramatic difference in how my hair looked and felt immediately.</li>
            <li> (because it&#x27;s so thick), and my head weighed LIGHTER!!</li>
            <li> even when I tried expensive salon shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using Everstrong/Pure basically since the line was launched without any ill effects</li>
            <li> Even if it did not have that one ingredient it can be a bad product if it has other harmful artificial ingredients badly engineered in to the finished product.</li>
            <li> My hair was so badly damaged after highlighting, that is was irritating for me to touch it!</li>
            <li> Stinks like chemicals</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I also feel like my hair isn&#x27;t breaking as bad as it used to.  </li>
            <li> how bad it smelled.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo gave me a painful itchy rash on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in L&#x27;Oreal for touting this as a \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> but I hate it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However on using this I was shocked !</li>
            <li> Hated this product</li>
            <li> The SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) is actually very bad for you hair, so I said..</li>
            <li> just horrible!  </li>

            <li> My hairdresser recommended I purchase sulfate free shampoo and conditioner after I had a keratin treatment.  When I joked that the products available in the salon were almost as expensive as the treatment.  He then whispered that he would buy this and save the money.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this entire line, this smells the most &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and gives me great results. After years of damage this line is healing my hair!</li>
            <li> I am 64yrs., and I have used alot of different shampoos and conditions,&lt;br /&gt;and I have to tell you, My color has lastest 1 to 2wks. longer,and no more frizz.&lt;br /&gt;My hair stays softer much longer. I want to Thank You for this shampoo and&lt;br /&gt;conditioner. I will not use any other products.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You, Linda</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sulfate free shampoo when I saw this one. I always had a hard time finding one that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I saw this one and Organix hydrating teatree mint. I end up getting both. I used the Loreal first. With its first use I noticed a complete difference in my hair. (I&#x27;m a african american by the way) First off a little goes a long way and I saw that it was thick and covered my hair nicely. Once I rinsed it out my hair was so soft and not striped. I followed up with my staple VO5 conditioner. When my hair dried I could still smell the shampoo which smells awesome. I would definitely recommend this shampoo and as a added bonus to my hair i notice less shedding....alot less.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal -- please do not take this product off the market. I absolutely love this product and it has completely transformed my dry, brittle hair into soft, silky, moisturized hair. My hair was damaged -- chemically processed and flat ironed daily! Now when I comb my hair, I do not experience any breakage. My hair is super-moisturized and softer than I can describe. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair throughout the day because it feels so amazing. I am absolutely shocked that a hair product that I purchased in a grocery store was able to outperform my expensive, high-end salon hair products. I actually stopped using my $25 bottle of designer hair conditioner in favor of this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a really good sulfate free shampoo and saw how pricey some products were, so when I saw Loreal had this product I decided to by it (even though I was very nervous that it would make my hair feel dirty)  but in the contrary my hair has never looked better!!!!  The first wash you can see you hair soo shiny in healthy clean way!!!  I absolutely love this shampoo, along with the conditioner!!!  Which has never happened before since I change shampoos more than underwear!!  So definitely a STEAL!!!</li>
            <li> I have keratin-treated hair, and I purchased this shampoo because it is sulfate-free.  The trouble with other sulfate-free shampoos is that there&#x27;s hardly any lather (if at all), but this one produces a fine, luxurious lather that is very satisfying.  However, I noticed right away that it was breaking down the keratin faster than my regular no-lather sulfate-free shampoo.  After a few washes, the difference was very noticeable.  It doesn&#x27;t make any sense, because there&#x27;s nothing in it that would degrade the keratin, but that&#x27;s what happened... So anyone out there with keratin-treated hair should think twice.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d highly recommend this as a sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I took a break from this shampoo for a long while and I regret it. My hair became gradually more brittle and frizzy even when I tried expensive salon shampoos. They all had sulfates. I am glad a came back to my old stand by. Not only does it get my oily scalp clean and keep it that way (Other sulfate free haircare lines left my hair greasy, and sulfates shampoos made my hair experience over-compensation), my hair had a better balance of volume (A bad shampoo can leave my hair looking like a Christmas tree), and less frizz (for once an pledge kept!). My hair looks so much shinier, which is a bonus because my hair is dark. Somehow my wavy texture looked more neat and defined and less wirey. Seriously I am not even being dramatic! I love the smell also, a light, non over bearing herbal scent. Please stop dealing with damaged unruly hair and try this excellent shampoo!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Reminds me of a spa. I have very thick wavy/curly long hair. It has never been so soft and tamed. It rarely tangles. I also use the conditioner that goes along with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of these positive reviews. Were they written by Loreal?..    Gave this product a 1 week shot and my hair has never been dryer. The only thing good about it is it smells really great. That&#x27;s about it. The conditioner feels like it does absolutely nothing. I&#x27;ve tried leaving it in for 5 minutes and air drying, hair is still super dry. Yuck!</li>
            <li> I am an african american and I absolutely love this product! I use both the shampoo and conditioner and will not give it up for anything. My hair was so damaged and dry from heat and chemicals. Once I began using this product I saw a differnce in my hair instantly. My hair is growing so healthy and full. It looks shiny and gorgeous. Im always getting compliments on my hair now.</li>
            <li> So far, of all the shampoos I have used, high end expensive &amp; drug store brands, this has been the best. I have Indian 2B black hair and this works wonderfully to calm the frizz in my hair and smooth-en it. Thats all I ask for in a shampoo! Does not damage my hair, will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I am in my forties with long, thin, coarse, color-treated (non-permanent) hair.  This works better than anything I have tried.  It makes a rich lather and I have to keep reminding myself that I don&#x27;t need to use so much of the shampoo at once.  Hair is healthier than in years.  Only thing is, I don&#x27;t think the tube is recyclable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying to save some money and so I look around quite a bit before buying something. I couldn&#x27;t believe the price of this. I looked at the reviews and it appeared to be exactly what I needed. I got it and I&#x27;m beyond happy with it.</li>
            <li> You will notice the difference in just a few washes.  My hair no longer feels stripped of moisture and I am saving a lot of money on conditioner because I just don&#x27;t have to use as much anymore.  Went for a haircut this weekend, and my stylist was very impressed with the difference.  Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of product reviews before I decided to give this a shot. I&#x27;m 54 and probably 50% gray. I&#x27;ve color treated at home with L&#x27;Oreal hair color for 30 years and use Natural Blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have straight, very dark blonde/gray, medium to fine hair. My hair has thinned on my sides and bangs, the back is still pretty much all there. The problem is that my hair has looked so old for about 4 years and really brittle and lifeless this past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried one of the non-sulfate L&#x27;Oreal shampoos 2-3 years ago and returned it. It made my hair heavy and lifeless. Not enough suds for me and no body or shine afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviews I read on Amazon recently about this shampoo was to use it with Aveeno Pure Renewal conditioner (also sulfate free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried them both this morning. WOW! And I&#x27;m not kidding. MOVEMENT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a quarter sized amount of the shampoo. Tons of rich lather. I made sure to massage it into my scalp too, thinking it might remove old residue if it was there. Then I applied the Aveeno conditioner and left it on for about 4-5 minutes in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve kept noticing all day today is that my scalp feels amazingly stimulated, clean and alive. I&#x27;m feeling the softness and life of my hair around my ears and face that I have not felt for about 13 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose not to use any other product on my hair before or after I blow dried this morning, just to see what this combo alone was going to do. Normaly I use mousse and a little hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still shaking my hair tonight at almost midnight and loving the softness and movement. My hair literally looks exactly like it did when I left for work this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives me confidence to do something I&#x27;ve wanted for a while. Grow my short Bob out and get my look back.</li>
            <li> My hair is gray, so I lighten it blond and this shampoo keeps it from turning yellow.  Since I use another conditioner, I&#x27;m sure about it moisturizing, but it does not take much product to get my hair clean.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely hands on for me shampoo. I have tried so many and I am very satisfied! My beautician recommended that I would use only moisture shampoos and conditioners due to the overly processed of relaxers. I can tell a big difference in my hair, goodbye dryness and brittle. Hello life awakening hair. I  really like this product so I bought one of each the moisture shampoo and smooth conditioner for my hair and the hydrate shampoo and the reconstruct conditioner for my daughter. The smell of rosemary and juniper is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I have a medical condition that requires drugs that make my hair dry and thin. Have tried everything and then saw this. Since using this shampoo the shine has come back to my hair. There is little breakage and I think it is thicker. My hair seems to have more body and natural bounce.  Give this one a try. With my fine hair I can&#x27;t use a cream rinse and I don&#x27;t need it with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> And this is comming from someone with wavy dry and fine hair. so often with other shampoos I cant wash everyday or it will dry out my hair but with this shampoo it leaves it really clean without drying it out with harsh chemicals which also makes it brittle. My hair smells great and is noticeably softer....not from just me but from others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an early 30s something natural redhead who occasionally gets a color glaze (non permanent) or two a year to boost the color.  I switched to this shampoo after a friend recommended it (I&#x27;m FAR too cheap for salon brands of gentle shampoo, so I was using [[ASIN:B000N5QVOG Organix Hydrating Teatree Mint Shampoo 13 fl oz (384.5 ml)]]).  I was shocked at how great it has been.  First, I didn&#x27;t want to spend the few dollars more on this shampoo, so I got the Rite Aid brand knockoff of this product, right next to it on the shelf.  It smelled great and was nice, and I used the entire bottle happily.  However, I&#x27;ve been wedded to the same silicone-filled conditioner for my naturally curly hair, which I blow out straight every day  ([[ASIN:B000OLFXKW Herbal Essesnces None of Your Frizzness Smoothing Conditioner By Clairol, 10.17 Ounce]]), pretty much since the moment it came out on the market.  I go through a bottle of it every three weeks, because I coat my hair with it.    Last month, decided to take the plunge and get both the non-knock-off shampoo AND the moisturizing conditioner.  Holy bejesus is it making an amazing difference.  My hair is soft, smells awesome, and shows almost no frizzies.  I do notice that I occasionally have to put on a silicone product to smooth it after a blowout, but that&#x27;s to be expected with hair as long as mine and in an area of the country with seriously fluctuating weather.  However, most of the time I can do a blowout and just use a dot of [[ASIN:B000O9FRPK PureOlogy Shine Max 2.5 Oz]] and I&#x27;m good to go.  One of the best things I&#x27;ve noticed is how great my scalp feels - no itchiness, no tightness, and less breakouts on my forehead under my bangs.  Even though this shampoo and conditioner combo are on the pricier side for me (given the product size, especially), I&#x27;m hooked.  It&#x27;s really extending the length of my salon glazes, which are not cheap.  And I go through less of it than the relatively thinner, cheaper conditioners like HerbalEssences.  I also work out almost every night of the week, so this combo is gentle enough to let me wash my hair every night, but also gives me no product build up or greasiness for the times on the weekend when I skip shampooing.  Lastly, if you&#x27;ve been to a smoky bar or generally around cigarettes, this is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used that can get that cigarette smoke smell out.      The reason I am switching from the generic brand of this shampoo to the branded product is really the smell.  Rite Aid&#x27;s product just does NOT get that amazing herbal/Rosemary scent quite right, and it is heavenly.  For me, that&#x27;s totally worth the extra few bucks, and if you order from Amazon, that price difference is far smaller.    Two (enthusiastic) thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged from highlighting and I was growing tired of the time it took to comb out the tangled mess it became after shampooing and conditioning. It was stressful. I was seriously thinking of cutting my hair short to get rid of all the damage. Then I saw this in the drug store and bought the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo left my hair in such great condition that I ran out and bought the overnight and weekly treatment. Last night I used the overnight treatment for the first time and just after shampooing it out, the comb ran right through the damaged strands. Plus, it smells great. I can not believe how much of an improvement I have seen already and I have not even had these products for a whole week.</li>
            <li> My hair already looks and feels healthier after the first use. It smells great, like salon quality products and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo, nice clean scent, and makes my hair very soft, smooth, and shiny, which are precisely the things I&#x27;m looking for in a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo and conditioner set. I have a lot of fine, blonde hair which goes flat with most hydrating products or gets tangled with most \\&quot;pure\\&quot; products. Everstrong is the best of both worlds -it leaves my hair super silky, bouncy, and managible throughout the entire day...even after riding in my husbands topless jeep. I&#x27;m sticking with this brand from now on!</li>
            <li> I have medium curls that are a mix of coarse brittle and smooth hairs... I typically experience a LOT of shedding and dryness.  I&#x27;ve tried several sulfate-free shampoos (even a very expensive \\&quot;Surface Bassu\\&quot;) and this has by far been the best.  My hair is never dry any more, no split ends, and my hair shedding/breakage has been at least cut in half.   I&#x27;ve read complaints about the herbal and floral scents of these products and all I can say is it&#x27;s probably up to personal preference, but I like the smell... I don&#x27;t think it is too strong and it is still noticeable and nice the next day (if you&#x27;re going to skip a day washing).</li>
            <li> This is a really good shampoo. I have only used it once but I could see a dramatic difference in how my hair looked and felt immediately. I expected to have completely dried out (but clean) hair after I finished washing, but this was not the case. It was actually hydrated. Amazing, considering how many products and techniques I have tried to do just that. I am a Black woman with very tightly coiled hair. So far I am impressed. I also used the conditioner with it as well. I got pretty good stretch to my coils. Not bad to start! I will be using it again not just because the price is great, but it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different high end brands that are sulfate free and this shampoo is definitely comparable. It makes my hair soft and smells great. For the price alone, there is no way I&#x27;ll ever go back to paying $15-$20 + for shampoo again as long as this is around.</li>
            <li> I bought and used this in combination with the matching conditioner,and found that neither did great things for my hair.  I have slightly wavy, fine hair prone to tangling, and I think this shampoo probably made the tangling worse.  If I used it without also using a conditioner, my hair was left significantly drier and more straw-like than before.  I have colored my hair in the past, which may have contributed to this, but I still was fairly dissatisfied with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> the lid on the shamppo was open and most of the shampoo drained out...HOWEVER, there was enough shampoo left for three hair washings and the product itself is absolutely AMAZING! My normally dull, lifeless and drabby hair finally had some life to it...that was the good part..I wish I could have given it five stars, but I couldnt due to the amount of product that was lost.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and was looking for shampoo which is free from sulphate.. I found this and using it from past 3 yrs and this works well for me.. It has nice fragnance and also lathers well with very little quantity..</li>
            <li> My hair is a little frizzy and dry and I&#x27;d heard that sulphates in shampoos make hair even more dry. So I thought I&#x27;d try out a sulphate free product. I love this product.. it leaves my hair soft (still a little frizzy.. but I blame Mother Nature). I also like the rosemary-juniper scent.</li>
            <li> I have been having greasy hair for my entire life but last year I had them dyed. So now my roots are greasy and the ends are damaged.(to make you familiar with the situation)  I have tried so many hydrating and soothing shampoos but this one turned out to be the best. and the price is low compared to the others. It also has a lovely smell.  The only problem is that it does not really clean my hair and I should wash my hair every day</li>
            <li> I have terribly thin and damaged hair. It is naturally blonde and just the sun causes extreme damage. I have never been able to have long hair because the ends look terrible. So I thought I would give it one last shot at finding a good product before I went and cut my hair off yet again. Never knew what the heck sulfate free was but I&#x27;m so glad that I found out. My hair has never felt better. So soft. Normally after a shower the little hair that I do have is in a giant knot. When I get out of the shower now it almost feels silky. I love it! And I can&#x27;t forget to mention about the wonderful smell. I&#x27;ve always loved the clean smell vs. the fruity flowery stuff. The Rosemary Mint is amazing!! I will continue using this product as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and its minty smell! I would recommend it to other people because it cleans my hair really well. I can tell its difference from the cheap shampoo you buy in grocery stores!</li>
            <li> I have had a Brazillian Blowout treatment a year ago and the hair dresser said that i needed to buy shampoo without any sulfate in it. I tried the expensive types including Moroccan Oil and a few others and they all left my hair very greasy and heavy. This is one of the only shampoos in the store that is sulfate free and so i gave it a try. It works as well if not better than Moroccan Oil Shampoo and it is a fraction of the price!! It does not leave my house greasy or heavy AT ALL, it is great quality and smells good. Highly recommended. I am on my 3rd bottle and will continue to use. Only downside is that it runs out quickly. Wish they had bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> I am seriously in love- even though I wish this was a fruity smell. After I read all the reviews, I rushed to Target and got this + the conditioner. MY HAIR HAD A DRASTIC DIFFERENCE AND WAS SO LIGHT!! I was reviewing sulfate free shampoos for hours before I finally decided to get it. The SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) is actually very bad for you hair, so I said.. WHY NOT? I&#x27;ve used S factor, Neutrogena deep conditioner, Moroccan oil- but they&#x27;re all so temporary in regards to the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS HOWEVER is improving the condition of my hair (from dry, thick, and brittle) to moisturized, breakage free, and shedding free (because for some reason a lot of my hair falls out... No, I am not balding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an awesome shampoo and conditioner. I cannot wait to take another shower. LOVE THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I am Filipina if you wanna get an idea of what type of hair I have. I tied my hair up for hours and when I took my hair tie off, there was NO CRINGE and I KNOW 100% it was thanks to what this shampoo did for me. PLUS, my hair naturally fell down straighter, significantly less frizz (because it&#x27;s so thick), and my head weighed LIGHTER!! I guess it got rid of a bunch of built up product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so dry dull and frizzy it doesn&#x27;t work for colored hair. I color my hair with henna .</li>
            <li> I suffered from a terrible dry scalp for years, often with lesions which would open and bleed for a long time, until finally after all testing was negative, a dermatologist recommended a hydrating and sulfate-free shampoo.  The only ones I could find for a long time were \\&quot;health food store\\&quot; brands, and they did work as far as allowing my scalp to heal up from the sensitivity to the harsh, drying chemicals in most shampoos but left my hair very dry and flyaway.  I often looked as if my hair was full of static.    I have just placed now my second order for this shampoo and conditioner, because after just a week or so of regularly using them my hair was silky, smooth, soft, and completely manageable.  Now that I&#x27;m close to the end of the first set of tubes, I&#x27;m amazed at how my hair continues to get silkier and my scalp very healthy.  I love this shampoo/conditioner and hope it will always be available.  Definitely five stars!</li>
            <li> Admittedly I have finicky hair, but this is the absolutely worse shampoo I think I have ever used. I&#x27;m a Kerastase user, but due to reversal of fortunes I&#x27;m trying to cut costs. Had high hopes for this L&#x27;Oreal product, being the parent company for Kerastase &amp; all the great reviews I read. 1) The scent is tolerable, but not pleasing. Smells medicated, like a minty Head &amp; Shoulders; 2) it lathers well, but does not leave hair feeling clean. Feels like I washed my hair with a filmy bar of soap. No amount of rinsing helped. I couldn&#x27;t even run my hands over my head, as one does when rinsing without them skidding (instead of a smooth swipe); 3) it left huge knots in my hair. Took me 27 mins. to get the tangles out; 4) it left my hair dry &amp; frizzy (also used the conditioner to go with it) &amp; last, but not least it stripped a lot of color from my hair! I mean A LOT. My hair is worse than being at the river all week in the scorching sun while skiing &amp; boating all day long. I cannot imagine using this twice. What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Tried this twice.  Both times, the shower drain was filled with hair and my hair had a horribly rough texture afterwards.  I don&#x27;t understand how something that is supposed to make my hair strong could make my hair so brittle.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews and i was not that impressed after using it for about two weeks. I didn&#x27;t see anyone&#x27;s review mentioning that this is creamy (like Pantene shampoo) and i hate that because my hair is very long and as straight as a pin and they tend to oil much easier and faster when you use shampoo like that. It makes my hair super frizzy and very difficult to brush even if i use a ton of conditioner. I definitely was not impressed with this shampoo at all and i can only be glad that i got this when it was 5$ where as the 8$ its at right now!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, naturally curly (but relaxed) hair. Recently, I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out why my hair is a dry, tangled mess after I wash it, even if I also deep conditioned it with an excellent deep conditioner under the dryer for an hour. When airdrying my hair, I would lose a lot of hairs during the difficult detangling process and, once dry, it would look as if I hadn&#x27;t moisturized it at all.     Finally, I realized that it was my sulfate shampoos. It&#x27;s already bad enough that sulfates strip and dry out the hair, but the shampoo I used the most often has Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, which is THE harshest sulfate. Once I stopped using that shampoo and switched to sulfate-free L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong Hydrate Shampoo, I saw an immediate improvement! My hair felt smooth when it was being rinsed out and it didn&#x27;t feel (and look) like tumbleweed when I let it airdry. I lost A LOT less hair during the detangling process because it wasn&#x27;t dry and breakage-prone.     I will continue to use this, as well as all-natural shampoos, for the majority of my washes. I can&#x27;t only use these shampoos, though, because all of my products aren&#x27;t all-natural and you need sulfates to wash the build-up from them away, so I use a clarifying shampoo every few weeks. However, this will definitely be a new staple of mine!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very concentrated so you only need a pea-size amount for rich later. It leaves my hair silky and smooth! I also use the conditioner - love them both.</li>
            <li> A great product to have. It seems to be gentle on hair. However maybe due to my nature of hair it sometimes leaves my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair was so badly damaged after highlighting, that is was irritating for me to touch it! after even the first use of L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Hydrate Shampoo &amp; conditioner I felt a huge difference, it really worked. Even my hair stylist noticed the difference. Very happy and ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair - this shampoo still really dried out my hair, and I only used it on my scalp. I had to deep condition my hair immediately afterward. On the positive side this shampoo smells really good, has a nice lather - despite being sulfate free, and my scalp did feel \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; and clean. I would not recommend this product to African American women with natural hair.</li>
            <li> Money well spend my hair is stays clean a lot longer and I have bounce in my hair again, considering my my age (70) it feels good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is good for your hair. I find it lasts for a very long time. You only have to use a dime size dab to get lots of bubbles. I like to feel the bubbles some people dont. Anyway will always use this product.</li>
            <li> Works for my hair which has been chemically treated with a Brazilian blow out treatment. My hair dresser also recommended it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  It lathers up wonderfully and smells great.  My hair was more easily manageable and soft.  I will be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo every 2 - 3 days, but it was shipped to me with tape over&lt;br /&gt;a cuset in the plastic tube of shampoo.  Spilled all over counter and lost several&lt;br /&gt;tbps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on salon brand shampoos and conditioners. When I saw this product I found the ingredients to be just like one of the salon brands I use. I absolutely love it!! It&#x27;s sulfate free and has a wonderful smell to it. So now I don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune and it keeps my hair color from being stripped and yet is light enough not to take away from the volume.</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best shampoo I have ever tried I have long highlighted hair and my hair stopped being dry and brittle. Now it&#x27;s soft and like other reviewers mention I can&#x27;t stop touching it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this just did not clean it well enough. I wanted to like it, but it left my hair pretty oily.</li>
            <li> I love the L&#x27;oreal Everpure/Everstrong lines. While I wish it was even more chemical free and safe for you hair, it is among the best options for color treated hair at the drugstore. I&#x27;ve used even more expensive color safe/sulfate free shampoos that don&#x27;t perform half as well, sometimes even worse. While I do still see my color draining when it&#x27;s washed, it&#x27;s not as bad as regular shampoo and my hair color DOES last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with other users who say that the list of other ingredients is a bit concerning. I do think that they try to rope people in with the &#x27;no sulfate!&#x27; thing, but it doesn&#x27;t harm my hair or make it fall out as others have complained and I&#x27;ve been using Everstrong/Pure basically since the line was launched without any ill effects so I&#x27;m not too bothered.</li>
            <li> I tried this since it is sulfate-free, however, I noticed significant hair falling out in the tub and over the sink after three uses over the course of a week. Since this was the ONLY change in my regimen, I can only attribute it to this shampoo. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has had this experience.  One star for the creamy lather and nice scent.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time this morning.  My hair does feel lighter.  I like my hair to smell fruity, so I don&#x27;t really care for the smell of this.  It smells like shampoo, not a nasty smell or anything, just not much of a smell.  If it smelled like apples I&#x27;d like it more. My hair does feel soft though.  I used it in combination with the conditioner.  I think maybe a couple more uses then mist some fruity perfume over my hair lol.</li>
            <li> My hair has been pretty coarse and dry all my life. This sulfate free series by Loreal has literally transformed my hair (and I have used very expensive brands without effect, like Kerastase etc). I used to use lots of product to keep my curls manageable. With infrequent use of this shampoo (once weekly), and daily use of the conditioner and the leave-in balm, my hair is soft and finally not stripped, not sticky with product. The product has a natural rosemary scent, which I love. I will be exporting this series as a gift to my family in Europe. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It really does hydrate and my hair is really think. I also use the conditioner and overnight repair.</li>
            <li> Stinks like chemicals</li>
            <li> You only need a little - this shampoo is so rich. Love the smell. I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free. It is better than most high-end shampoos I&#x27;ve used. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Clean hair without sulfates to damage my hair and scalp.  Recommend this product to anyone who wants to get clean hair without the damage.</li>
            <li> I often use this shampoo for washing my hair and it let it more hydrated and soft. Is a good product  for my hair care.</li>
            <li> A lot of people say that the shampoos without the sulfites (the stuff that makes it bubbly) don&#x27;t feel like they make your hair clean. I disagree. This one does. And it is healthier for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have looked for years for a shampoo that does it all.  For the first time, I could actually go for more than 2 days without shampooing.  no tangles a plus.</li>
            <li> This use to be my favorite product until I read ALL of the ingredients. I&#x27;m natural so therefore I want an all natural hair product, most of these \\&quot;natural or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; hair products claim to be natural but always have chemicals. I use to love this product but there are some disappointing ingredients.</li>
            <li> This was so good for my hair that my granddaughter also started using it. We both have very thick, curly, dry hair. This has tamed our hair and made it softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various shampoos. I do like the Tresemme Naturals shampoo/conditioner but this stuff works very well. My hair is frizzy and often can look very untamed but now it feels softer and is starting to look healthier after only 2 washes. I hope this never goes off the market either, I am glad to find a high-quality product that&#x27;s both cruelty-free AND natural. The only downside is that it&#x27;s a smaller amount of shampoo. I&#x27;ll keep buying this but I certainly hope they&#x27;ll bring a bigger size out, because I&#x27;ll pay for it :)!</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to shampoo ever since getting my hair chemically straightened years ago. The entire line of L&#x27;Oreal Ever- products is great. Suds up very well, but is gentle enough for everyday use-- though unless you&#x27;re exercising daily or have very fine, oily hair, I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s best to limit washes to every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Love this! My hair was being over-stripped, even though it is natural. This stopped the fly away look. My hair loves it, and during the summer I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this shampoo! Although it says it is sulfate free it is not. It also contains many parabens and other damaging chemicals. This will only dry out your hair so read the ingredients carefully before you buy anything. Companies say a lot of BS to lure customers to their products. The stuff in this product disgusts me. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> If you have had a hair straightening treatment and must use sulfate free hair products, I recommend this. I initially purchased a very expensive shampoo at a cosmetics specialty store before I found this product at Amazon.  This works as well or better at a quarter the price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the only one ever to make my damaged, coarse, faded crap halo of hair so so shiny, soft and healthy. I can flat iron my hair without any addition of products. The ends of my hair with is always felt like straw after flat iron before. Now it so soft and smooth, i don&#x27;t need conditioners anymore! I love this shampoo. I hope loreal dont change the formula.</li>
            <li> Our family enjoys this product because it is sulfate free and helps our hair type (thin blond) feel healthy. We have tried many other (high dollar) Solan products but found this little gem to be just as or more effective with our family&#x27;s hair type.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it leaves my hair untangled, soft, smells great, and my hair feels so much healthier. I would recommend this product, I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair. This is what I needed during my hair growth journey.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo because it is sulfate free.. I am African American with relaxed hair, so it did add a small amount of moisture, not much. I would buy again though.</li>
            <li> This goes great with the matching conditioner. Much better for your scalp with the sulfate-free. I like the smell too.</li>
            <li> Having tried an Infusium 23 sulfate-free shampoo yet remaining a skeptic, I stumbled upon this L&#x27;Oreal offering and after using it daily for a month or two I bought another bunch of bottles (or tubes or whatever they call that dadgum thing) just so I&#x27;ll have it if, like most products I favor, it disappears from the marketplace. It has improved this mop on my head more than any other thing I&#x27;ve tried. My scalp has ceased its torturous itching and my hair seems stronger and less brittle than before when I&#x27;d often experience a lot of fine broken hairs in my brush. I&#x27;m taking a biotin supplement too and I recommend that to others in a similar condition.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I got a keratin treatment and didn&#x27;t want a shampoo that would strip it. Unfortunately, it made my hair feel very dry even with the conditioner. My boyfriend (who didn&#x27;t get a keratin treatment) thought it was even worse and he had to pour on leave-in conditioner since he felt his hair was also much too dry. Considering that sulphates are a harsh detergent, I&#x27;m surprised that a shampoo without it makes my hair feel worse, not better.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed with this shampoo because I was expecting it to be like the L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Conditioner, which I love. This shampoo is not on the level of some of the other sulfate-free shampoos out there, as it is not as conditioning. While it may please some, I don&#x27;t think this is the best shampoo for African-American hair. A closer look at the ingredients tells me why. Additionally, the rich lather (that you get from this product) is not really what you want in a conditioning shampoo. Nonetheless, it is ok when you follow with a good, deep conditioner, but still not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I originally got this to help from drying out my already dry hair. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t really see much difference from using it, until lately (several months later), my hair seems to be getting less dry. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the overall changes in care I&#x27;ve had for my hair, or changes in weather, or if this had any help at all, but overall, I like it. Not significantly greater than shampoos I&#x27;ve used before nor does it leave a nice shampoo smell (doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything), but because of my hair slowly getting better without knowing the reasons behind it, I&#x27;m afraid of giving this product too much and too little credit to change to any other shampoo. So, I&#x27;ll be sticking with this for awhile :)</li>
            <li> The title pretty much says it all.  I have sensitive skin &amp; have had problems with lotions, soaps &amp; creams, but have never had a problem with shampoos or conditioners until I bought this.  My scalp immediately broke out with red, itchy bumps that later turned into a scabby, flakey mess.  Took 2 weeks to clear up - just horrible!  I have used other L&#x27;Oreal shampoos &amp; conditioners before with no problem, but I&#x27;m staying away from them from now on.  Your best bet is Clear Scalp &amp; Hair Therapy.</li>
            <li> good price, fast shipping and  good production. i like this smell. it seems small. but every time, you just need to squeeze out little that is enough, personally.</li>
            <li> I am an african american woman. I bought this shampoo on a wimb because the sulfate free tea tree shampoo I normally use was not available. After using this shampoo, I will not use another. It really CHANGED the texture of my hair and my hair is so sleek, soft, and shiny that my husband who normally doesn&#x27;t notice things about my hair asked me what I was doing to it. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times so far and I feel like each time, my hair gets stronger and definitely breaks less. Women of color really should use this product!!!</li>
            <li> It seems to work well lathering up, but need a few months of use to determine whether it actually strengthens my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I highly reccommend it to people with chemically treated hair. It is very creamy and helps to detangle the hair while I am washing. It smells great and leaves my scalp feeling fresh (not tingly). Afterward, my hair is soft and feels clean without being stripped. I started using this product while I was beginning a week long move to another place.  I was tired and sweaty and needed to wash my hair more often. I normally only wash my hair about twice a week because it is so dry. However, with this shampoo I washed everyday and it did not dry my hair out at all.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo. Smells amazing. I like that it is less harsh on your hair will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, LIke WEN better but this price is much better, and actually sometimes WEn leaves my hair limp. This is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I tried many brands of shampoo before.  Personally, I think this one is way better than the body shop shampoo.</li>
            <li> have used panteen and other shampoo&#x27;s all my life, and have never used a shampoo, that you can actually feel putting oil into your hair! after my hair is rinsed out, my hair feels so soft&amp;moist. my hair used to tangle up after i get out of the shower, but i have been useing this shampoo for about 2 weeks, and it is a godsend!!! for all you out there that can&#x27;t decide on a shampoo, look no further, this shampoo R.O.C.K.S.!!!!  SO DOES THE CONDITIONER!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and healthy feeling now! Says a lot for all the damage I&#x27;ve done to it.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to sulfates so I have to use sulfate-free shampoo.  This is the only kind I like, and I often use it as a body wash as well.  Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;p.s. If you suffer from mouth sores, it&#x27;s probably the sodium lauryl sulfate in your toothpaste or mouthwash.</li>
            <li> My brittle hair became soft, shiny, and manageable. I was able to let it grow long! Best of all, it does not have those nasty scents added that cause horrible allergic reactions: eyes swollen shut, face resembling raw hamburger. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have healthy hair to begin with but I like to use sulfate-free \\&quot;fortifiers\\&quot; and \\&quot;repair\\&quot; stuff because it makes me feel like I&#x27;m protecting my hair from possible damage. I might be kidding myself. Anyway, I use the shampoo and conditioner together and my hair feels clean, soft, comb-able, shiny, and still manages to have some body. My hair type is fine and oily, so I do have to wash everyday (drag) but this shampoo and conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> It is very good and I love it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very good and I love it !  Good !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo!  It is super lathery and makes my hair feel wonderful.  And the scent is one of the best shampoo scents I&#x27;ve ever smelled!  I&#x27;ve been a loyal Aveda user but I am now switching to this shampoo for good.</li>
            <li> I have fine longer length blonde hair. I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It is my favorite favorite find as of late.  My hair feels so soft on the ends after using it!  Before, it just felt kind of damaged.  I also love the smell, the rosemary scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all..  it doesnt smell like medicine at all to me. The lather feels so thick and foamy.  I also feel like my hair isn&#x27;t breaking as bad as it used to.  I have pretty sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no problems with this product. (I have had problems with joico and that bed head brand making me super itchy!) I can&#x27;t wait to try the overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> my hair is dry,natural wavy,fine colored hair, after shampooing my hair the 4th time my hair felt heathy,. it did, it wasn&#x27;t dry looking anymore, my hair seemed to hair body in it,the color I paid to have in it was more translusent,my hair was easir to comb and style, I love this shampoo,it actually did what it said, put mosturre back in my hair made me feel younger, thank you for a true honest product..&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll love this shampoo,.. give it a try...what do u have to lose?</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a sulfate free shampoo.......This product caused more hair loss than usual and caused my hair to be dry! I thought it was supposed to hydrate? Going back to my favorite product, Neutrogena Triple Moisture.......it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> The produce was great at first and the sulfate-free formula ended up stopping some facial acne breakouts that I used to get when using other shampoos with SLS in them. However, after about a week of using the product, my hair started to fall out in decent amounts during each shower. I&#x27;ve stopped using the product since and the hair loss has decreased/stopped. I strongly advise reviewing the ingredient list for this product before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product so much, and I did the first time I used it, but the second time it left greasy gunk in my hair.  I have fine, normal to dry, color-treated hair, nothing overly temperamental.  It is a bit harder to wash out than regular shampoo (maybe something about the lack of sulfates? I&#x27;m really not sure), but I think it&#x27;s also something about how L&#x27;Oreal makes their hair products.  The last time I tried one of their shampoos was about 10 years ago, and it did the exact same thing then.  If you are going to use this, it&#x27;s probably best to switch it up with a clarifying shampoo to avoid the greasies.</li>
            <li> i am addicted to this sulfate-free products. my hair loves.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  It still makes a decent lather even without sulfates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 19 yr old female who has battled oily hair since I was 12. I also straighten my hair often. I&#x27;m always trying new shampoos to find a good balance between oiliness and damage protection. This shampoo and Dove&#x27;s intensive repair shampoo are definitely the best on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the same experience with Pantene&#x27;s and Aussie&#x27;s \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; or \\&quot;damage repair\\&quot; shampoos, both brands leaving a lot of residual junk near my roots.</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy poofy untameable jew hair and it&#x27;s really hard to find shampoo that works well for me.This stuff is awesome my hair is calm healthy and hydrated.This is the first of many shampoo products I&#x27;ve tried throughout the years that actually works and it smells wonderful too it smells kind of like walking through a evergreen forest.I will defiantly continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> My subject line says it all. I was skeptical at first and have tried all sorts of shampoos under the sun so thought why not this as well. I think I have found the perfect shampoo for my hair type :) I recently bought the Eversleak Conditioner to go with this, but have just used it once so can&#x27;t give a real review on that just yet. Except will say this, they both seem to do a good job making my hair feel clean, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo after reading lengthy reviews on how great a product it is.  I won&#x27;t ever try the product again.  I have been using it for about the last week and every time I use it my hair falls out in handfuls as I am attempting to dry it.  I can use Pantene shampoo from Walmart the next day and lose maybe 2 or 3 hairs in the towel or in my hairbrush which appears to be a little more reasonable.  But as soon as I go back to the Loreal EVERSTRONG hydrating shampoo, I will have a handful of at least 25-30 hairs in my hand and another handful lying on the drain, and I don&#x27;t scrub at my head really strong either so I don&#x27;t understand.  Poor Product.  I wonder now about the other posts.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gave me a painful itchy rash on my scalp.  I&#x27;ve never had something like this happen to me before.  I will never buy anything from L&#x27;Oreal again.</li>
            <li> High hopes were dashed - this stuff is very thick and does lather nicely - not sure what I think of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It managed in just three washes to make my hair extremely dry, brittle, and unmanageble. Hydrate? Just give yourself a regular treatment with organic coconut oil and your hair will be wonderfully soft and shiny - this shampoo is garbage.</li>
            <li> Very little of this product is required to produce a really good lather.  It adds shine to my hair and smells GREAT!  My hair is softer and much more healthy looking and feeling than before I started using it.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, neither does my hair feel dirty the next day like some conditioning shampoos leave it feeling.  It seems like it may have even cut down a little on my hair loss.  Try it - you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a Sulfate Free Shampoo and this had great reviews. However on using this I was shocked ! This seems like a heavy concoction of damaging chemicals (without SLS just so that ignorant people looking for Sulfate Free shampoos rush to buy this like me) with an artificial, medicine like smell and it left my hair extremely frizzy, thin, brittle and almost damaged. This evidently has a high degree of silicones to produce an artificial shine. I tried going back to my other usual products and then coming back to this to give it second, third chances but every time it was the same shocking result. It is inconsequential that this does not have SLS. It was far more damaging to my hair than even cheap shampoos with SLS. The point is - don&#x27;t buy a cosmetic product just because it touts the absence of a major &#x27;undesirable ingredient&#x27;. Even if it did not have that one ingredient it can be a bad product if it has other harmful artificial ingredients badly engineered in to the finished product. Just see the ingredient list at the back of this product - it has more chemicals (mostly unheard of) than any other shampoo I have seen. So the &#x27;Sulfate Free&#x27; label is a highly misleading bait. Always try the product yourself and buy from a retailer where you can get full refund. However, having said that, each individual responds to cosmetics differently and so this just may work for you - but this DEFINITELY is NOT a safe, natural and universally beneficial product. If there were negative stars I would have rated this with that.</li>
            <li> This is a really affordable sulfate-free shampoo for my colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have switched to this more affordable shampoo from Paul Mitchell awapuhi sulfate-free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to awapuhi, this one doesn&#x27;t lather up as easily.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, scent is really mild and I am satisfied with the results. It helps keep my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> Place orders on the third day, I received a parcel, freight quickly, and the product is very easy to use, and the price is very cheap,</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because I hear good reviews about it...but I hate it!!&lt;br /&gt;I only used it 2 or 3 times and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;It smells bad and it made my hair fall out more than normally.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, the smell was there all day and I had other people tell me how bad it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t help my hair in any way...at all. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this new shampoo line, so I bought the shampoo, conditioner and masque versions of this product. They left my hair dull, frizzy, and dry. I found the scent to be unpleasant. I wrote to L&#x27;Oreal, detailing my experience, and they are sending me a refund. This is not a good product, and I will throw away the remaining product.</li>
            <li> The overwhelming scent nearly gave me a headache. And this shampoo left my hair so dry and frizzy. Hated this product</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see much difference in my hair. If it&#x27;s less expensive than your current over-the-counter brand, I&#x27;d recommend it...however, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a salon-level shampoo.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair every month with crazy colors (blue, red, green, etc.) and this shampoo keeps my hair healthy and won&#x27;t fade away the colors your hair so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, kudos for being vegan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in L&#x27;Oreal for touting this as a \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; product. Sure, it may be free of sodium lauryl sulfate, but the ingredients it uses as a substitute are just as harsh and damaging to hair. FYI, Sodium Lauryl Sulfoacetate is a sulfate! So this shampoo is not at all sulfate free! Not only that, but it&#x27;s full of silicones which are very damaging to hair if not washed out properly. The irony is that you need a sulfate-based shampoo in order to wash out silicones, as they are not water soluble. This is a total marketing scam. If you&#x27;re looking for a true sulfate-free shampoo, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love all Loreal products and this one is no exception. I didn&#x27;t notice a conditioner, but when I find it, I will get it!</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I have ordered. Makes my hair soft and manageable and I love the fact it has no phosphates in it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, that&#x27;s all!... Filled with chemicals that made my hair fall off more than usual! I kept shedding and shedding... Once stopped using it, got back to normal. Please don&#x27;t get fooled: don&#x27;t waste neither your money, nor your hair and/or health.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo that I only use when I take down my braids. When not in braids I use rhassoul clay and ACV.</li>
            <li> You can not expect too much with this price, but it deserves this price. No improvements, just for daily needs.</li>
            <li> This is what a hair dresser told me to look for--no sulfates (foaming agents).  Gentler on your hair, but I think I feel build up now and then, so I alternate once in a while to whatever is on my shower shelf.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers very well, smells good, and rinses easily.  I treat my hair with both color and a Keratin smoothing process.  The shampoo has no sulfates and no sodium chloride, both of which remove chemical treatments from the hair.  It is very affordable and requires less shampoo in your hand than other shampoos designed for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the last year and find it very good, leaves my hair smelling fresh and healthy</li>
            <li> I liked it, it was nice on my hair and it made my hair smell nice&lt;br /&gt;I had bleached my hair and this alone will not keep it healthy, get some 10 products c:</li>
            <li> saying that it is a rich shampoo, so if you have really oily hair probably not a good choice.  This shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like the other shampoos.  I notice that the sulfate free shampoos are less drying and damaging to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once, but I was so pleased with the results that I felt the need to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous products that say that they will thicken or add volume to your hair.  I have found a few products that help, but nothing that compares to this.  I used both the shampoo and conditioner.  As soon as I dried my hair, I noticed that my hair felt thick and full.  If I pull my hair back and wrap my fingers around the pony tail, it feels as though I have twice the hair that I had prior to using this stuff.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also let my mom try it out and she loved it too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for a few weeks new.  I still love it.  My hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Hair does not feel stripped and dry.  It feel soft and clean.  Every time I try another shampoo I alway go back to this.  Have been using for over two years w no complaint.  Would definitely recommend.  I have natural kinky hair</li>
            <li> I had wanted a rosemary mint set (I love the smell of Aveda but usually use L&#x27;Oreal) but this shampoo is not rosemany mint (like the matching conditioner I bought) it is rosemary and juniper and smells quite a bit different.</li>
