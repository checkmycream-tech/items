    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This shaver does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>Great product when it works!</li>
            <li>It fills up the battery in 8 hours which is just perfect since you can put it to charge before you sleep and then wake up and remove it from the charging stand.  </li>
            <li>This is the best electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>- Excellent close shave  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up and five stars for this excellent shaver!</li>
            <li>Have been using Norelco electric shavers for over 25 years and this one has to be one of the best.</li>
            <li>It is still running perfectly today..</li>
            <li>In conclusion:  This is the best shaving system I ever tried.  </li>
            <li>A very good shaver.  </li>
            <li>Charging and battery life also seem to be very good.    </li>
            <li>Great workmanship and excellent support (NOT)!</li>
            <li>Works great for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>The flex tracker works great.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a dyed-in-the-wool foil shaver dude and have decided to try out a Norelco, this would be a great model to check out.</li>
            <li>For the price this is a great electric razor.</li>
            <li>The wet/dry function is great.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>This razor has a great look and feel.  </li>
            <li>it is great.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s say that I am happy I did.      </li>
            <li>The razor 7735x was a great razor</li>
            <li>and it works great in the shower.</li>
            <li>The smell of the conditioner is very nice as well.</li>
            <li>The shaving conditioner gave me good results, but is not so great to justify the cost.  </li>
            <li>I keep a three blade on hand to touch up the neck and nose areas, a good idea with any electric.    </li>
            <li>Good news</li>
            <li>If you shave in the shower, like I do, that&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>I received it as a Christmas gift and figured it was as good a time as any to stray away from the world of manual razors.    </li>
            <li>The Arcitec did a heckuva a good job</li>
            <li>Amazon delived quickly and at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The dispensing of the conditioner works great and is easy to refill.</li>
            <li>But this 8020x is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Yet when I got this shaver I tried in the shower and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>but this product kind of misleads.</li>
            <li>The Nivea lotion is nice.</li>
            <li>but you get some kind of battery gauge.</li>
            <li>I always liked the rotary shaving system, so I stuck with Norelco and purchased this unit.</li>
            <li>The floating heads contour to everything nice and fluently.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good shaver and noticed the outstanding reviews for this item.  </li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted :)</li>
            <li>$79.00 thats 22 cents a day not bad for a great shave.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is so far the best thing I have ever put on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I honestly think that was more than 10 years ago (probably longer)..</li>
            <li>But I find it works best in the shower using Nivea&#x27;s shaving gel which you can get pretty cheaply</li>
            <li>So if you aren&#x27;t interested in paying more for the conditioner this method works just great.</li>
            <li>Then when I get out of the shower I got patches that need touching up.  </li>
            <li>and I would love to try one,</li>
            <li>It is more durable than you think.</li>
            <li>feel obligated to run out and purchase more Nivea,[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The Nivea shaving gel for my money works better than the Nivea conditioner</li>
            <li>He has been extremely pleased with the quality of this product and the resulting shave.</li>
            <li>The manual specifically says not to take off more than one at a time as mixing the heads, would diminish your shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy that I bought this razor.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it can be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Just for the hack of it. :)</li>
            <li>I love that you can take this shaver into the shower.  </li>
            <li>In an effort to make the rotating heads more flexible, it appears that they&#x27;ve sacrificed power.</li>
            <li>You have check, because if you charge more than 8 hours, it can damage the battery.  </li>
            <li>and I generally enjoyed the sin out of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple more shaves with it though (and cleaning it)</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get into the world of electricity while shaving.  </li>
            <li>Again, great razor and highly recommended.    </li>
            <li>but this is a pretty darn good shaver.</li>
            <li>they said yes so this made me more comfortable about the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy applying shaving cream and then using this razor better than using the gel.    </li>
            <li>This, pherhaps is the most important area.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s MUCH MUCH more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>They are not expensive, so I own two of them to ensure I always have one charged.    </li>
            <li>The gel you can insert into it is a cool feature, but I see this as a way for them to get more of my $$</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this razor til it dies on me, but I&#x27;ve replaced the blade component once and it worked good as new.</li>
            <li>Philips is a good mark, but in this case the seller advertised the shaver as New.</li>
            <li>I bought this in December and it worked fine for 3 months.</li>
            <li>I used the previous generation of these razors (Norelco Coolskin 7775X) for almost 2 years and was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I am doing fine with my 8020x.     </li>
            <li>Very easy, just rinse the shaving heads using hot water (you can easily do this while you shower, or in the sink).  </li>
            <li>Looked good and my own mother got interested in it and bought it for me as an early birthday gift.  </li>
            <li>Keep it simple buy this one and enjoy a great shave for a year.</li>
            <li>make a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>It is light, slips freely over the skin with to the moisturizing system, shaves comparably to razors and I never get cut in a distraction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, easy to handle, holds a charge for a decent amount of time and provides a nice, comfortable close</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and I am happy enough to leave 5 stars.</li>
            <li>What you do get is a razor smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The shaver is build on light plastic, but feels sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Not just comfortable......    </li>
            <li>I just use regular shave gel in the shower and get a great shave.</li>
            <li>It is compact, comfortable and convenient.</li>
            <li>But I found that I actually get a better shave if I use the dispensing moisturizer in unison with a good face wash, and I can&#x27;timagine</li>
            <li>I have used it with a bit of shaving foam or gel (instead of the original lotion) with comparable results.</li>
            <li>Whats great about this shaver the heads do go a long way.</li>
            <li>Also, use of the built-in system seems to mandate more frequent and elaborate cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Clean shave, no irritation; a feeling I missed for years.    </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need special solution to clean.    </li>
            <li>Very close shave and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am sure this is a good product, unless you have course hair or otherwise just need to spend you time in the morning doing something other than shaving.      </li>
            <li>All this time I have used different Mach versions and they were increasingly good.     </li>
            <li>I was looking for a close, clean and quick shave.  </li>
            <li>It takes multiple passes to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>One full charge gave 30 minutes of continuos shaving (according to manual).  </li>
            <li>Anyone need 2 boxes of Cool Skin Shaving Gel?</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, just not for my face.</li>
            <li>This one is thinner, lighter and probably better one but does not do the job as good as previous generation razors.</li>
            <li>I finally parted with my former noreleco moisturing shaver of several years and decided to try the 8020X. Best shaver ever and as good a shave as I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great shaver for me</li>
            <li>I have been using mine for a year with a great smooth shave everyday.</li>
            <li>My second shave was more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great razor for first time electric razor users as well as long time veterans.</li>
            <li>After about the first month of use, it became clear that keeping this razor was the best decision I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>I tried it out and the first shave was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I had a cheap Norelco Shaver ($40.00).I thought this more expensive razor would be great.</li>
            <li>It also works great on the shaving oil without concern for missing spots.    </li>
            <li>Sometimes, when you hit the power button, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, even with a freshly charged battery.</li>
            <li>Although it is not necessary, I find it makes the shave more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Its like having a 5 o&#x27;clk shadow right after you shower.  </li>
            <li>Since I wash it very well after every shaving, the 2 or 3 times I opened the shaving head to clean</li>
            <li>In the early to mid-80&#x27;s, I tried using a Norelco and shaved dry with a pre-shave lotion (Williams Lectric Shave), but it never gave me a great shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my third Norelco, (my second wet/dry shaver) and by far the best of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about three years and have never regretted the purchase.  </li>
            <li>to troubleshoot, i got another one and put my first shaver in the new charger... works fine.</li>
            <li>This is a good little shaver that gets a lot of the whiskers laying close to your face.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is different and provides a great shave -- very close and comfortable with little to no irritation, and it did this from the very first shave -- no waiting the three weeks</li>
            <li>The razor is great, but the nivea lotion product is hard to find.</li>
            <li>I have also tried it in the shower and, although the result is the same, I do not save any time and spend a lot more water.</li>
            <li>Nice concept, just not very practical.</li>
            <li>I first used it in Iraq, it was a Godsend.</li>
            <li>Norelco consistently ups the ante by continually improving their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spend a ton more dough on a different shaver, by why bother?&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>of course, you must make sure to change the heads on a regular basis[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>That sounds like a bunch of bull, mumbo-jumbo to me, but I dont really want to find out if its true, since the put it in the manual in a very CYOA tone.        </li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon</li>
            <li>I love these guys, but there is something to be said about buying local (easier returns, etc...)</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to pay over $100 for a shaver, I want the thing to last more than a year.</li>
            <li>After I finished my first shave with it, I was a bit unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I have owned this razor since it first came out</li>
            <li>Norelco recommends that you only use the Nivea for Men shaving conditioner, but I tried with shaving gel, and I got better results in the confort and closeness department.  </li>
            <li>Not noisy, not uncomfortable,</li>
            <li>Its pretty close for an electric   shaver</li>
            <li>It is my first \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaver, but I find I prefer to use it over the sink and not in the shower.</li>
            <li>The 8020X shave is VERY smooth, the nivea stuff really does make your skin feel \\&quot;extra special\\&quot; afterwards.</li>
            <li>A pretty good alternative is Head Slick made by Head Blade that when applied directly to the face in a thin layer, works well with the Moisturizing Shaving System razor although you have to rinse the razor often---but the lubrication during shaving is excellent.  </li>
            <li>It does not have the same sophisticated feel as those shavers although it functions very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be short, sweet and to the point here; the razor is very nice, especially if you use it with traditional shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft on my skin, compact, looks cool</li>
            <li>I would certainly have gotten that too.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have the option to jump in the shower and shave with it, but i havent found that necessary yet(the 8060X did not say anywhere on the box that you could do the same, though I am sure at that price it would seem ridiculous not to be able to).         </li>
            <li>, I say if you want a nice shave and dont want to spend a ton of money and dont want to spend too little, and get the equivalent of road rash on your face because you did, get the 8020X.</li>
            <li>It would have made it much easier to see when it is time to refill the reservoir.</li>
            <li>gives a very close shave no doubt.</li>
            <li>I was really please till</li>
            <li>It lasts for 1 to 2 weeks of shaving depending on how fast you are.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is very quiet and light.</li>
            <li>I have found that using a face cleanser (like Phisoderm or others) along with the moisturizer you load in the razor make the shave much nicer.</li>
            <li>so maybe thats why the 8020X could feel so much</li>
            <li>Very lightweight</li>
            <li>You have to use it for 21 days straight and after that</li>
            <li>(i don&#x27;t care much about the look, though).</li>
            <li>In short, if you only plan to use this razor in the shower this is a great choice, but if you need to use the razor outside of the shower as well, you may want to choose something else.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li>He used the Norelco Christmas morning, and even though it normally takes a week or two for your face to get used to a rotary, it was the first shave ever where he didn&#x27;t have any redness or worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but, if you shave at the sink, probably not so much.</li>
            <li>Back to the cheap one.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with foil shavers, but I&#x27;ve decided to try a Panasonic ES8234A Arc IV Nano based on customer reviews.</li>
            <li>I had a Philips 8160XL, but it irritates so much my neck skin.  </li>
            <li>The body is slim and very confortable to handle.  </li>
            <li>Just skip the shaving conditioner and use shaving gel (but not too much, because you can choke the shaving heads).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m practically giddy about how much I like this shaver.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing shaving system works very well.</li>
            <li>It gave him a very close shave.</li>
            <li>My face tingled so much I was like</li>
            <li>If purchasing this again, I would step up to the 8040X just to cut the charge time in half and get the quick-charge feature and indicator light when charge is full.</li>
            <li>I bought another brand 5 years ago, and I remember the first shave very clearly because my face was on fire.  </li>
            <li>There are some other newer shavers like the  Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV which look really interesting</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I am in the Marine Corps right now, so we have to shave, Daily.  </li>
            <li>That being said, this does provide an acceptable shaving solution to those who would like to save money over the long haul and use a comfortable, lightweight shaving system.      </li>
            <li>Now that I have a personalized shaving system down, not only is my shave quick and close, but it&#x27;s also enjoyable.    </li>
            <li>The shaver is constructed well and is lighter and more compact than previous models.</li>
            <li>Still love the Norelco wet/dry products but this model seems a bit flimsy compared to previous models.</li>
            <li>The shave is not like a razor shave, but it is decent.  </li>
            <li>and I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this razor to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and full beard, and could never shave everyday without significant irritation, blade or electric shaver, and I can&#x27;t shave against the growth with a blade because of irritation.</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t as close an easy as other models I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>He is 92 years old and really seems to like the shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have to be careful to rinse the heads out frequently when I do this, but the experience is easily twice as fast as a razor shave and nearly as close.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough charge to use it right away.  </li>
            <li>The adaptation to the new shaving system was painless.</li>
            <li>What Im up against now is that the heads need to be replaced, so my dilemma is should I go for the $30 or buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Im going with the new shaver.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for a new one no way.</li>
            <li>It has a red light that comes on when the built-in battery is low, but does not regulate the charge like the Panasonic does.  </li>
            <li>The charging limitations kinda suck but that doesn&#x27;t really change the overall five-star experience much.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any men with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Now, it costs nearly $300, with replacement heads about $120!  </li>
            <li>I tried the shaver with a dry face, no conditioner: it doesn&#x27;t move smoothly over the face when dry and doesn&#x27;t really function well like this</li>
            <li>- Might feel a little cheap on the plastic side  -</li>
            <li>My results the second time around were a little more favorable.</li>
            <li>The main problem I find with this new design is that the heads/razors are floating and not encased as previous models and most other shavers.</li>
            <li>The overall quality is just as good as previous models and other Philips/Norelco products.   </li>
            <li>I replaced another in/out shower norelco shower with this because it was getting old.</li>
            <li>beef I had with my old Norelcos was their inability to get in close under my nose.  </li>
            <li>I never changed the blades on the old one</li>
            <li>So much so that I didn&#x27;t have even the slightest red irritation on any part of my face.</li>
            <li>When you shave that much your hair on your face gets stronger and comes back faster.  </li>
            <li>wow, I know what I&#x27;m getting my father for his birthday</li>
            <li>it felt like my face had become something epic like.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it obviously takes longer to shave than with a regular razor to get a good shave, but shaving everyday with a regular razor destroys my face.</li>
            <li>I find I can shave a lot faster with this model too as I don&#x27;t have to pause and wait for the rotaries to cool down.</li>
            <li>Also, to clean the heads it just flips open and you rinse underwater, as opposed to mine (8020X) which you have to manually twist of each individual head and put back together.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace a previous cool skin model that had lasted 3 years and then became unreliable.</li>
            <li>After a few more times of use, I decided to break down my shave a little more and read the instructions that came with the razor.</li>
            <li>as you can get a terrific shave with a decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I may or may not use it at some point, but it is definitely not necessary, particularly when you&#x27;re in the shower.    </li>
            <li>This is not a dry shaver that most are use to, so you do lose the portability of a late afternoon shave at the office or in your car.</li>
            <li>This shaver has a body very similar to the new line of Norelco: Arcitec.  </li>
            <li>And just don&#x27;t try it for a few days and decide it sucks; Be fair and give your beard a chance to get used to it.</li>
            <li>To me this is a major oversight and design flaw.  </li>
            <li>it were pointless: there was nothing yo clean.</li>
            <li>The way I see it: I can buy the same shaver for $69.00 at my local discount outlet which is double the cost for new heads or buy the new head and use it for another year.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really meant to be a wet shaver</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower as a completely wet system and it performs very well.  </li>
            <li>though is Norelco offers a 60 money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is expensive and I wound up using my own shaving gel with it instead.  </li>
            <li>For the last 6 years, I&#x27;ve have a closely trimmed full beard because I&#x27;ve always disliked shaving.</li>
            <li>It may be helpful to have a little background info first.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer they sell as part of the system is more expensive and not as readily available as common gel.  </li>
            <li>Using it outside of the shower is uncomfortable so it&#x27;s not the kind you want if you only want one.</li>
            <li>Just a few weeks ago I moved from the painfully hot Pulsonic to the Arcitec.</li>
            <li>yourself the first few times as you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;ll slobber off and drip onto you.    </li>
            <li>This launched my search for a new electric razor (previous one is over 10 years old).  </li>
            <li>, im not that lazy, and it wasnt worth the extra $75 bucks.  </li>
            <li>I use a common shaving gel applied directly to the face and it works very well.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This shaver does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Great product when it works!</li>
            <li> It fills up the battery in 8 hours which is just perfect since you can put it to charge before you sleep and then wake up and remove it from the charging stand.  </li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> - Excellent close shave  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up and five stars for this excellent shaver!</li>
            <li> Have been using Norelco electric shavers for over 25 years and this one has to be one of the best.</li>
            <li> It is still running perfectly today..</li>
            <li> In conclusion:  This is the best shaving system I ever tried.  </li>
            <li> A very good shaver.  </li>
            <li> Charging and battery life also seem to be very good.    </li>
            <li> Great workmanship and excellent support (NOT)!</li>
            <li> Works great for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> The flex tracker works great.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a dyed-in-the-wool foil shaver dude and have decided to try out a Norelco, this would be a great model to check out.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great electric razor.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry function is great.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor has a great look and feel.  </li>
            <li> it is great.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s say that I am happy I did.      </li>
            <li> The razor 7735x was a great razor</li>
            <li> and it works great in the shower.</li>
            <li> The smell of the conditioner is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> The shaving conditioner gave me good results, but is not so great to justify the cost.  </li>
            <li> I keep a three blade on hand to touch up the neck and nose areas, a good idea with any electric.    </li>
            <li> Good news</li>
            <li> If you shave in the shower, like I do, that&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> I received it as a Christmas gift and figured it was as good a time as any to stray away from the world of manual razors.    </li>
            <li> The Arcitec did a heckuva a good job</li>
            <li> Amazon delived quickly and at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> The dispensing of the conditioner works great and is easy to refill.</li>
            <li> But this 8020x is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Yet when I got this shaver I tried in the shower and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> but this product kind of misleads.</li>
            <li> The Nivea lotion is nice.</li>
            <li> but you get some kind of battery gauge.</li>
            <li> I always liked the rotary shaving system, so I stuck with Norelco and purchased this unit.</li>
            <li> The floating heads contour to everything nice and fluently.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good shaver and noticed the outstanding reviews for this item.  </li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted :)</li>
            <li> $79.00 thats 22 cents a day not bad for a great shave.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is so far the best thing I have ever put on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I honestly think that was more than 10 years ago (probably longer)..</li>
            <li> But I find it works best in the shower using Nivea&#x27;s shaving gel which you can get pretty cheaply</li>
            <li> So if you aren&#x27;t interested in paying more for the conditioner this method works just great.</li>
            <li> Then when I get out of the shower I got patches that need touching up.  </li>
            <li> and I would love to try one,</li>
            <li> It is more durable than you think.</li>
            <li> feel obligated to run out and purchase more Nivea,[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The Nivea shaving gel for my money works better than the Nivea conditioner</li>
            <li> He has been extremely pleased with the quality of this product and the resulting shave.</li>
            <li> The manual specifically says not to take off more than one at a time as mixing the heads, would diminish your shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy that I bought this razor.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it can be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Just for the hack of it. :)</li>
            <li> I love that you can take this shaver into the shower.  </li>
            <li> In an effort to make the rotating heads more flexible, it appears that they&#x27;ve sacrificed power.</li>
            <li> You have check, because if you charge more than 8 hours, it can damage the battery.  </li>
            <li> and I generally enjoyed the sin out of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple more shaves with it though (and cleaning it)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get into the world of electricity while shaving.  </li>
            <li> Again, great razor and highly recommended.    </li>
            <li> but this is a pretty darn good shaver.</li>
            <li> they said yes so this made me more comfortable about the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy applying shaving cream and then using this razor better than using the gel.    </li>
            <li> This, pherhaps is the most important area.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s MUCH MUCH more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> They are not expensive, so I own two of them to ensure I always have one charged.    </li>
            <li> The gel you can insert into it is a cool feature, but I see this as a way for them to get more of my $$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this razor til it dies on me, but I&#x27;ve replaced the blade component once and it worked good as new.</li>
            <li> Philips is a good mark, but in this case the seller advertised the shaver as New.</li>
            <li> I bought this in December and it worked fine for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I used the previous generation of these razors (Norelco Coolskin 7775X) for almost 2 years and was very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I am doing fine with my 8020x.     </li>
            <li> Very easy, just rinse the shaving heads using hot water (you can easily do this while you shower, or in the sink).  </li>
            <li> Looked good and my own mother got interested in it and bought it for me as an early birthday gift.  </li>
            <li> Keep it simple buy this one and enjoy a great shave for a year.</li>
            <li> make a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> It is light, slips freely over the skin with to the moisturizing system, shaves comparably to razors and I never get cut in a distraction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, easy to handle, holds a charge for a decent amount of time and provides a nice, comfortable close</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and I am happy enough to leave 5 stars.</li>
            <li> What you do get is a razor smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver is build on light plastic, but feels sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Not just comfortable......    </li>
            <li> I just use regular shave gel in the shower and get a great shave.</li>
            <li> It is compact, comfortable and convenient.</li>
            <li> But I found that I actually get a better shave if I use the dispensing moisturizer in unison with a good face wash, and I can&#x27;timagine</li>
            <li> I have used it with a bit of shaving foam or gel (instead of the original lotion) with comparable results.</li>
            <li> Whats great about this shaver the heads do go a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, use of the built-in system seems to mandate more frequent and elaborate cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Clean shave, no irritation; a feeling I missed for years.    </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need special solution to clean.    </li>
            <li> Very close shave and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am sure this is a good product, unless you have course hair or otherwise just need to spend you time in the morning doing something other than shaving.      </li>
            <li> All this time I have used different Mach versions and they were increasingly good.     </li>
            <li> I was looking for a close, clean and quick shave.  </li>
            <li> It takes multiple passes to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> One full charge gave 30 minutes of continuos shaving (according to manual).  </li>
            <li> Anyone need 2 boxes of Cool Skin Shaving Gel?</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, just not for my face.</li>
            <li> This one is thinner, lighter and probably better one but does not do the job as good as previous generation razors.</li>
            <li> I finally parted with my former noreleco moisturing shaver of several years and decided to try the 8020X. Best shaver ever and as good a shave as I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great shaver for me</li>
            <li> I have been using mine for a year with a great smooth shave everyday.</li>
            <li> My second shave was more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great razor for first time electric razor users as well as long time veterans.</li>
            <li> After about the first month of use, it became clear that keeping this razor was the best decision I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried it out and the first shave was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I had a cheap Norelco Shaver ($40.00).I thought this more expensive razor would be great.</li>
            <li> It also works great on the shaving oil without concern for missing spots.    </li>
            <li> Sometimes, when you hit the power button, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, even with a freshly charged battery.</li>
            <li> Although it is not necessary, I find it makes the shave more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Its like having a 5 o&#x27;clk shadow right after you shower.  </li>
            <li> Since I wash it very well after every shaving, the 2 or 3 times I opened the shaving head to clean</li>
            <li> In the early to mid-80&#x27;s, I tried using a Norelco and shaved dry with a pre-shave lotion (Williams Lectric Shave), but it never gave me a great shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my third Norelco, (my second wet/dry shaver) and by far the best of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about three years and have never regretted the purchase.  </li>
            <li> to troubleshoot, i got another one and put my first shaver in the new charger... works fine.</li>
            <li> This is a good little shaver that gets a lot of the whiskers laying close to your face.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is different and provides a great shave -- very close and comfortable with little to no irritation, and it did this from the very first shave -- no waiting the three weeks</li>
            <li> The razor is great, but the nivea lotion product is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have also tried it in the shower and, although the result is the same, I do not save any time and spend a lot more water.</li>
            <li> Nice concept, just not very practical.</li>
            <li> I first used it in Iraq, it was a Godsend.</li>
            <li> Norelco consistently ups the ante by continually improving their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spend a ton more dough on a different shaver, by why bother?&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> of course, you must make sure to change the heads on a regular basis[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> That sounds like a bunch of bull, mumbo-jumbo to me, but I dont really want to find out if its true, since the put it in the manual in a very CYOA tone.        </li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon</li>
            <li> I love these guys, but there is something to be said about buying local (easier returns, etc...)</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to pay over $100 for a shaver, I want the thing to last more than a year.</li>
            <li> After I finished my first shave with it, I was a bit unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor since it first came out</li>
            <li> Norelco recommends that you only use the Nivea for Men shaving conditioner, but I tried with shaving gel, and I got better results in the confort and closeness department.  </li>
            <li> Not noisy, not uncomfortable,</li>
            <li> Its pretty close for an electric   shaver</li>
            <li> It is my first \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaver, but I find I prefer to use it over the sink and not in the shower.</li>
            <li> The 8020X shave is VERY smooth, the nivea stuff really does make your skin feel \\&quot;extra special\\&quot; afterwards.</li>
            <li> A pretty good alternative is Head Slick made by Head Blade that when applied directly to the face in a thin layer, works well with the Moisturizing Shaving System razor although you have to rinse the razor often---but the lubrication during shaving is excellent.  </li>
            <li> It does not have the same sophisticated feel as those shavers although it functions very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be short, sweet and to the point here; the razor is very nice, especially if you use it with traditional shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft on my skin, compact, looks cool</li>
            <li> I would certainly have gotten that too.</li>
            <li> Its nice to have the option to jump in the shower and shave with it, but i havent found that necessary yet(the 8060X did not say anywhere on the box that you could do the same, though I am sure at that price it would seem ridiculous not to be able to).         </li>
            <li> , I say if you want a nice shave and dont want to spend a ton of money and dont want to spend too little, and get the equivalent of road rash on your face because you did, get the 8020X.</li>
            <li> It would have made it much easier to see when it is time to refill the reservoir.</li>
            <li> gives a very close shave no doubt.</li>
            <li> I was really please till</li>
            <li> It lasts for 1 to 2 weeks of shaving depending on how fast you are.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is very quiet and light.</li>
            <li> I have found that using a face cleanser (like Phisoderm or others) along with the moisturizer you load in the razor make the shave much nicer.</li>
            <li> so maybe thats why the 8020X could feel so much</li>
            <li> Very lightweight</li>
            <li> You have to use it for 21 days straight and after that</li>
            <li> (i don&#x27;t care much about the look, though).</li>
            <li> In short, if you only plan to use this razor in the shower this is a great choice, but if you need to use the razor outside of the shower as well, you may want to choose something else.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li> He used the Norelco Christmas morning, and even though it normally takes a week or two for your face to get used to a rotary, it was the first shave ever where he didn&#x27;t have any redness or worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, if you shave at the sink, probably not so much.</li>
            <li> Back to the cheap one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck with foil shavers, but I&#x27;ve decided to try a Panasonic ES8234A Arc IV Nano based on customer reviews.</li>
            <li> I had a Philips 8160XL, but it irritates so much my neck skin.  </li>
            <li> The body is slim and very confortable to handle.  </li>
            <li> Just skip the shaving conditioner and use shaving gel (but not too much, because you can choke the shaving heads).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m practically giddy about how much I like this shaver.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing shaving system works very well.</li>
            <li> It gave him a very close shave.</li>
            <li> My face tingled so much I was like</li>
            <li> If purchasing this again, I would step up to the 8040X just to cut the charge time in half and get the quick-charge feature and indicator light when charge is full.</li>
            <li> I bought another brand 5 years ago, and I remember the first shave very clearly because my face was on fire.  </li>
            <li> There are some other newer shavers like the  Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV which look really interesting</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I am in the Marine Corps right now, so we have to shave, Daily.  </li>
            <li> That being said, this does provide an acceptable shaving solution to those who would like to save money over the long haul and use a comfortable, lightweight shaving system.      </li>
            <li> Now that I have a personalized shaving system down, not only is my shave quick and close, but it&#x27;s also enjoyable.    </li>
            <li> The shaver is constructed well and is lighter and more compact than previous models.</li>
            <li> Still love the Norelco wet/dry products but this model seems a bit flimsy compared to previous models.</li>
            <li> The shave is not like a razor shave, but it is decent.  </li>
            <li> and I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this razor to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and full beard, and could never shave everyday without significant irritation, blade or electric shaver, and I can&#x27;t shave against the growth with a blade because of irritation.</li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close an easy as other models I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> He is 92 years old and really seems to like the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful to rinse the heads out frequently when I do this, but the experience is easily twice as fast as a razor shave and nearly as close.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough charge to use it right away.  </li>
            <li> The adaptation to the new shaving system was painless.</li>
            <li> What Im up against now is that the heads need to be replaced, so my dilemma is should I go for the $30 or buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Im going with the new shaver.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for a new one no way.</li>
            <li> It has a red light that comes on when the built-in battery is low, but does not regulate the charge like the Panasonic does.  </li>
            <li> The charging limitations kinda suck but that doesn&#x27;t really change the overall five-star experience much.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any men with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Now, it costs nearly $300, with replacement heads about $120!  </li>
            <li> I tried the shaver with a dry face, no conditioner: it doesn&#x27;t move smoothly over the face when dry and doesn&#x27;t really function well like this</li>
            <li> - Might feel a little cheap on the plastic side  -</li>
            <li> My results the second time around were a little more favorable.</li>
            <li> The main problem I find with this new design is that the heads/razors are floating and not encased as previous models and most other shavers.</li>
            <li> The overall quality is just as good as previous models and other Philips/Norelco products.   </li>
            <li> I replaced another in/out shower norelco shower with this because it was getting old.</li>
            <li> beef I had with my old Norelcos was their inability to get in close under my nose.  </li>
            <li> I never changed the blades on the old one</li>
            <li> So much so that I didn&#x27;t have even the slightest red irritation on any part of my face.</li>
            <li> When you shave that much your hair on your face gets stronger and comes back faster.  </li>
            <li> wow, I know what I&#x27;m getting my father for his birthday</li>
            <li> it felt like my face had become something epic like.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it obviously takes longer to shave than with a regular razor to get a good shave, but shaving everyday with a regular razor destroys my face.</li>
            <li> I find I can shave a lot faster with this model too as I don&#x27;t have to pause and wait for the rotaries to cool down.</li>
            <li> Also, to clean the heads it just flips open and you rinse underwater, as opposed to mine (8020X) which you have to manually twist of each individual head and put back together.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a previous cool skin model that had lasted 3 years and then became unreliable.</li>
            <li> After a few more times of use, I decided to break down my shave a little more and read the instructions that came with the razor.</li>
            <li> as you can get a terrific shave with a decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I may or may not use it at some point, but it is definitely not necessary, particularly when you&#x27;re in the shower.    </li>
            <li> This is not a dry shaver that most are use to, so you do lose the portability of a late afternoon shave at the office or in your car.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a body very similar to the new line of Norelco: Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> And just don&#x27;t try it for a few days and decide it sucks; Be fair and give your beard a chance to get used to it.</li>
            <li> To me this is a major oversight and design flaw.  </li>
            <li> it were pointless: there was nothing yo clean.</li>
            <li> The way I see it: I can buy the same shaver for $69.00 at my local discount outlet which is double the cost for new heads or buy the new head and use it for another year.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really meant to be a wet shaver</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower as a completely wet system and it performs very well.  </li>
            <li> though is Norelco offers a 60 money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer is expensive and I wound up using my own shaving gel with it instead.  </li>
            <li> For the last 6 years, I&#x27;ve have a closely trimmed full beard because I&#x27;ve always disliked shaving.</li>
            <li> It may be helpful to have a little background info first.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer they sell as part of the system is more expensive and not as readily available as common gel.  </li>
            <li> Using it outside of the shower is uncomfortable so it&#x27;s not the kind you want if you only want one.</li>
            <li> Just a few weeks ago I moved from the painfully hot Pulsonic to the Arcitec.</li>
            <li> yourself the first few times as you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;ll slobber off and drip onto you.    </li>
            <li> This launched my search for a new electric razor (previous one is over 10 years old).  </li>
            <li> , im not that lazy, and it wasnt worth the extra $75 bucks.  </li>
            <li> I use a common shaving gel applied directly to the face and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> (I should know, I&#x27;ve used the Braun as well, thanks to my roommate) if used correctly, and at half the price!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave behind as many hairs and my skin was less irritated and a lot smoother.    </li>
            <li> When I first used it, I was scared to say the least.</li>
            <li> Our teen aged son has sensitive skin and has had a rough go of it using a Remington shaver.  </li>
            <li> This might be the only thing I&#x27;ve owned this long in my life.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to gauge how easily certain spots on your face get irritated, so some irritation is just inevitable.</li>
            <li> The shave is very good, close without cutting or irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> However, all I received was a dull, hair left all over my neck and face, longer than a straight razor shave.  </li>
            <li> I had a Norelco dry shaver and didn&#x27;t actually like that one.</li>
            <li> You just have to go slow, and be gentle to avoid irritation, and go in a circular motion to pick up all the hairs on your face since they can be facing different directions.  </li>
            <li> I decided to slow my shave down, and give a little more attention to how I was maneuvering the razor.</li>
            <li> I had removed the electric shavers from my gadgetry a long time ago.</li>
            <li> 1 charge lasts about 5/6 days, depending on how long you take to shave.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this razor, I was VERY skeptical, being it was my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> Plain old Edge gel works</li>
            <li> 8020x requires 8 hours to get charged, on the other hand 8060x requires only 90 minutes and you are also getting the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> Shaves closer even dry.</li>
            <li> Just a note to people who dry shave that the shaver does not collect the whiskers</li>
            <li> It is less messy than shaving cream and feels good, even though it is little expensive.     </li>
            <li> This is not a high RPM shaver like the Panasonic wet and dry units.  </li>
            <li> The shaver feels slightly under powered but it&#x27;s whisper quiet.  </li>
            <li> Now, after just one year, I&#x27;m having the same problem as I had with the previous model.</li>
            <li> I can shave like this over the sink or in the shower without making a total mess.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to give back a little.    </li>
            <li> Norelco should tell you that you can use others products, not only Nivea (this little can cost $9.95 on amazon plus S/H).    </li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for 40+ years and this is by far the smoothest and easiest to get into the hard areas.</li>
            <li> I have minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I also tried it with just a dab of liquid body soap applied to a wet face and it worked just as well as the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shaving wet with this gets as close as a blade but without razor burn.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that the battery does not sense charging, and I have heard users have trashed the razor by charging it too long.</li>
            <li> I tried using it with other lotions and creams with no improvement.  </li>
            <li> I hope norelco/philips continues production of this shaver forever as i see no reason to every try any other.</li>
            <li> Its very hard for one to clear all the beard on the face, it does leave 1 or 2, which doesnt cut at all</li>
            <li> i would say: not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only negative comment has to do with the battery and the 8-hour charge time.</li>
            <li> and I believe it takes less time to get fully charged.</li>
            <li> This shaver is half the size, and half the cost of my previous Norelco shaver, and yet, it&#x27;s twice the product.     </li>
            <li> I have a little travel shaver that runs on AA batteries as a back-up that I bought at Wal Mart for $10 about 7 years ago.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time getting use to it.    </li>
            <li> The Nivea cream is expensive and so far I can&#x27;t find a cheaper alternative  -</li>
            <li> And with little to no irritation depending on how hard you press.</li>
            <li> not sure if it took a surge or something since i don&#x27;t have a protector in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> When I went on to review other electric razors I found that it is very common for electric razors to miss hairs, so I gave this product the benefit of the doubt and decided to give it another shot.    </li>
            <li> After a while, I want to return to an electric razor, for the long run savings, because razor blades are expensive.  </li>
            <li> This seems a little wasteful and unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> A little hard for big hands but not too bad.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment  is that I did not see an offer for the replacement blades and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> But the one sent to was used, dirty, locked and stuck with facial hair...</li>
            <li> I found that Norelco 9160XL shares the same cutting blades than the 8160XL, so I discarted.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and</li>
            <li> And I mean CLOSE.</li>
            <li> I have a very rough beard, and the shape of the shaving head allows me to even attack those difficult neck hairs.    </li>
            <li> given how the charger is $30 and the shaver is $70, its hard to say whether or not to return broken one or just have 2 with one charger...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still fiddling with it and hoping that this is just the shaver and that I can send it back and get a replacement if it is bad.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco Coolskin 7735X was a temptin option, but this shaver use NiCad batteries (this battery suffers from memory, and after some time, retain less shaving time per charge).  </li>
            <li> Problem is, I am somewhat tired of looking like a bum.  </li>
            <li> I have used the razor for over 1 month and it just gets worse.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the web site was confusing and it appeared that Norelco shaving gel packs were compatable with this system.</li>
            <li> A little about my shaving habits: Ever since college I have been in a habit of shaving literally once a week (Sunday morning) and then going \\&quot;gruff\\&quot; for the rest of the week - work doesn&#x27;t mind, wife doesn&#x27;t say anything, hate the nics &amp; cuts, etc...  </li>
            <li> The lotion is expensive and you need a ton to avoid irritation.</li>
            <li> better.(they were too expensive).  </li>
            <li> The travel bag is useless (not that I care)</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Why is this shaver so expensive?</li>
            <li> This razor is a very poor razor,  </li>
            <li> But, much to my disappointment I have had to return the product.  </li>
            <li> Its pulls the bread instead or cutting.  </li>
            <li> They were unable to trace my chat incident number and said that it is probably the razor head that was defective and needs to be replaced, however, the razor head is not covered under warranty!</li>
            <li> When trying to get close to the skin I&#x27;ve got some really bad razor burns on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Then one day, in kinda humid conditions, it was a painful as sin shave.</li>
            <li> The lack of a trimmer on this model and the manual pumping might be annoying but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Really disgusting.</li>

            <li> The razor is great, but the nivea lotion product is hard to find. A pretty good alternative is Head Slick made by Head Blade that when applied directly to the face in a thin layer, works well with the Moisturizing Shaving System razor although you have to rinse the razor often---but the lubrication during shaving is excellent.  I&#x27;ll use this razor til it dies on me, but I&#x27;ve replaced the blade component once and it worked good as new.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to use in the shower.  I have to fill the moisturizer holder twice per shave in the shower.  Then when I get out of the shower I got patches that need touching up.  The thing does not cut all that close.  Its like having a 5 o&#x27;clk shadow right after you shower.  When trying to get close to the skin I&#x27;ve got some really bad razor burns on my neck.  My hair is thick and course and they may be related to the problems I&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li> I had removed the electric shavers from my gadgetry a long time ago. At the time, to summarize, they were not comparable to razors. All this time I have used different Mach versions and they were increasingly good.     This shaver does an excellent job. It is light, slips freely over the skin with to the moisturizing system, shaves comparably to razors and I never get cut in a distraction. The adaptation to the new shaving system was painless. I have used it with a bit of shaving foam or gel (instead of the original lotion) with comparable results. I have also tried it in the shower and, although the result is the same, I do not save any time and spend a lot more water. Since I wash it very well after every shaving, the 2 or 3 times I opened the shaving head to clean it were pointless: there was nothing yo clean.</li>
            <li> I finally parted with my former noreleco moisturing shaver of several years and decided to try the 8020X. Best shaver ever and as good a shave as I have ever had. I only wish that they had made the housing for the moisturizer transparent. It would have made it much easier to see when it is time to refill the reservoir.</li>
            <li> Nice concept, just not very practical. Using it outside of the shower is uncomfortable so it&#x27;s not the kind you want if you only want one. The lotion is expensive and you need a ton to avoid irritation. It still irritates my neck no matter what I do. I tried using it with other lotions and creams with no improvement.  Not a bad product, just not for my face.</li>
            <li> upgraded to this from the 7 series. Shaves closer even dry. Works great for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> gives a very close shave no doubt. but this product kind of misleads. it gives you a waring that you will take sometime to adjust to this product and gives you trial period of 1 month. Its been 6 months that i have been using this but there are rashes each time i use this. Its very hard for one to clear all the beard on the face, it does leave 1 or 2, which doesnt cut at all and finally i have to use my razor for the final touches. i would say: not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I replaced another in/out shower norelco shower with this because it was getting old. I use this in the shower along with norelco shaving foam. The flex tracker works great. I have minimal irritation. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product when it works! I bought this in December and it worked fine for 3 months. After three months it just stopped. I initially went online and got chat support from the philips website. The person on the chat support determined that the razor is defective and told me I would get a replacement piece in 10 business days and provided me with a chat incident number. I was really please till 11 business days later I had not received my replacement and decided to call the philips support line. They were unable to trace my chat incident number and said that it is probably the razor head that was defective and needs to be replaced, however, the razor head is not covered under warranty! Great workmanship and excellent support (NOT)! How is a defective razor the consumer&#x27;s problem? In conclusion, if anyone does decide to purchase this product, be prepared to forgo your investment if it stops working like mine did!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver some time ago, and I&#x27;m just now getting to writing the review.  This is a good little shaver that gets a lot of the whiskers laying close to your face.  As opposed to a foil shaver where the whiskers need to be standing up to get cut, this shaver seems to get at them from a side angle.  The moisturizer is expensive and I wound up using my own shaving gel with it instead.  The shaver feels slightly under powered but it&#x27;s whisper quiet.  It fills up the battery in 8 hours which is just perfect since you can put it to charge before you sleep and then wake up and remove it from the charging stand.  It lasts for 1 to 2 weeks of shaving depending on how fast you are.  There are some other newer shavers like the  Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV which look really interesting and I would love to try one, but until then this shaver does the job.  You just have to go slow, and be gentle to avoid irritation, and go in a circular motion to pick up all the hairs on your face since they can be facing different directions.  Just a note to people who dry shave that the shaver does not collect the whiskers, it&#x27;s really meant to be a wet shaver and so it has holes to allow for that.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver i&#x27;ve ever had. Very close shave and very comfortable. I asked the norelco/philips people if the shaver could be used without the nivea conditioner before purchasing....they said yes so this made me more comfortable about the purchase. The dispensing of the conditioner works great and is easy to refill. Requires refilling after 3 shaves with my habits. The smell of the conditioner is very nice as well. I tried the shaver with a dry face, no conditioner: it doesn&#x27;t move smoothly over the face when dry and doesn&#x27;t really function well like this so i don&#x27;t recommend it. When face is wet/no conditioner it works acceptably but not as well with conditioner. I also tried it with just a dab of liquid body soap applied to a wet face and it worked just as well as the conditioner. So if you aren&#x27;t interested in paying more for the conditioner this method works just great. The shaver is very quiet and light. The shaver lasts about 3 weeks for my use before needing charging. I hope norelco/philips continues production of this shaver forever as i see no reason to every try any other.</li>
            <li> I have used the norelco wet/dry shaver for over 6 years now. I first used it in Iraq, it was a Godsend. Yes, it obviously takes longer to shave than with a regular razor to get a good shave, but shaving everyday with a regular razor destroys my face. Once you get used to this razor, I assure you you will practically look forward to shaving. I have found that using a face cleanser (like Phisoderm or others) along with the moisturizer you load in the razor make the shave much nicer. I am overseas again in support of Afghanistan and travel all over the place. This razor holds up during my travels with no issues. It is more durable than you think. 1 charge lasts about 5/6 days, depending on how long you take to shave. They are not expensive, so I own two of them to ensure I always have one charged.    Again, great razor and highly recommended.    LTC John K</li>
            <li> the included charger for my 8020x stopped working. to troubleshoot, i got another one and put my first shaver in the new charger... works fine. not sure if it took a surge or something since i don&#x27;t have a protector in the bathroom. something to consider though should you leave things plugged in when not in use. given how the charger is $30 and the shaver is $70, its hard to say whether or not to return broken one or just have 2 with one charger... either way, the shaver works well. as others have said, shower is the place to use, but ive not had an issue with hair in the car. perhaps run it under the water before running out the door and the hair will stay under the heads?</li>
            <li> Norelco consistently ups the ante by continually improving their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third Norelco, (my second wet/dry shaver) and by far the best of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about three years and have never regretted the purchase.  It&#x27;s light, easy to handle, holds a charge for a decent amount of time and provides a nice, comfortable close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One beef I had with my old Norelcos was their inability to get in close under my nose.  Not so with this model. It can get in close under my nose and tackle bothersome neck hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t feel obligated to run out and purchase more Nivea,[[ASIN:B002GJTYDW Philips Norelco HS803/14 Nivea for Men Shaving Conditioner and Replacement Cartridge (Pack of 3)]] as you can get a terrific shave with a decent shaving cream. Plain old Edge gel works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spend a ton more dough on a different shaver, by why bother?&lt;br /&gt;And of course, you must make sure to change the heads on a regular basis[[ASIN:B002GJU2YW Philips Norelco HS85 Nivea for Men Shaving Replacement Head]].  Norelco&#x27;s are notoriously unforgiving if the heads needs replacement: You might as well shave yourself with a damn rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a dyed-in-the-wool foil shaver dude and have decided to try out a Norelco, this would be a great model to check out. And just don&#x27;t try it for a few days and decide it sucks; Be fair and give your beard a chance to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I used the previous generation of these razors (Norelco Coolskin 7775X) for almost 2 years and was very happy with it.  This one is thinner, lighter and probably better one but does not do the job as good as previous generation razors.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great electric razor. The wet/dry function is great. Shaving wet with this gets as close as a blade but without razor burn.  Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> It may be helpful to have a little background info first. For the last 6 years, I&#x27;ve have a closely trimmed full beard because I&#x27;ve always disliked shaving. I have sensitive skin and full beard, and could never shave everyday without significant irritation, blade or electric shaver, and I can&#x27;t shave against the growth with a blade because of irritation. In the early to mid-80&#x27;s, I tried using a Norelco and shaved dry with a pre-shave lotion (Williams Lectric Shave), but it never gave me a great shave.  This shaver is different and provides a great shave -- very close and comfortable with little to no irritation, and it did this from the very first shave -- no waiting the three weeks Norelco recommends for your skin/beard to adjust. I&#x27;ve used the shaver both in and out of the shower, and it works well both ways. But I find it works best in the shower using Nivea&#x27;s shaving gel which you can get pretty cheaply (I bought a 7 oz. can of shaving gel for $2.50 at local grocery store). The Nivea shaving gel for my money works better than the Nivea conditioner and you don&#x27;t have to keep dispensing the gel once applied to the face.  The only negative comment has to do with the battery and the 8-hour charge time. If purchasing this again, I would step up to the 8040X just to cut the charge time in half and get the quick-charge feature and indicator light when charge is full. Other than that, this is a great shaver for me and I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A very good shaver.  I use it in the shower as a completely wet system and it performs very well.  The heads flex to accommodate facial contours just as advertised and overall I like the feel and operation of this unit.  It is lightweight and easy to hold and use.  The shave is very good, close without cutting or irritating the skin.  I&#x27;ve been using electrics for some time so I&#x27;m well beyond the habituation period.  I keep a three blade on hand to touch up the neck and nose areas, a good idea with any electric.    I have not used the built in moisturizer.  I use a common shaving gel applied directly to the face and it works very well.  This is just personal preference.  The moisturizer they sell as part of the system is more expensive and not as readily available as common gel.  You also are told to periodically replace the entire cassette that holds the moisturizer (sold together) for sanitary purposes.  This seems a little wasteful and unnecessary.  Also, use of the built-in system seems to mandate more frequent and elaborate cleaning.  I may or may not use it at some point, but it is definitely not necessary, particularly when you&#x27;re in the shower.    This is not a high RPM shaver like the Panasonic wet and dry units.  It does not have the same sophisticated feel as those shavers although it functions very well.  It has a red light that comes on when the built-in battery is low, but does not regulate the charge like the Panasonic does.  You have to put your charger on a lamp timer for eight hours or you&#x27;ll ruin the battery, which I do not believe is replaceable.    At $80 it&#x27;s overpriced.  It should have a built-in charging regulator to protect the battery as do the Panasonics (although this unit is lighter than the Panasonic). You CAN ruin this unit by overcharging.  You will also have to replace the heads at some point, so actual life span under daily use is open to question.</li>
            <li> Gift to husband who hasn&#x27;t used an electric razor in over 40 years.  He has been extremely pleased with the quality of this product and the resulting shave.</li>
            <li> Now im not a specialist in this area but this is a pretty darn good shaver. I bought another brand 5 years ago, and I remember the first shave very clearly because my face was on fire.  It last me for 5 years so I guess I cant complain.  I never changed the blades on the old one so maybe thats why the 8020X could feel so much better.(they were too expensive).  The 8020X shave is VERY smooth, the nivea stuff really does make your skin feel \\&quot;extra special\\&quot; afterwards. Now I did need to make a second pass on my neck area, but dont we all anyway?  My shave was like that with a razor, and none of the burn and irritation, especially on the neck.       I could have bought the more expensive one (8060X), but the difference is that it has a stand, and it auto-fills the lotion into the unit. BIG DEAL!!?, im not that lazy, and it wasnt worth the extra $75 bucks.  Also, to clean the heads it just flips open and you rinse underwater, as opposed to mine (8020X) which you have to manually twist of each individual head and put back together. The manual specifically says not to take off more than one at a time as mixing the heads, would diminish your shaving experience. That sounds like a bunch of bull, mumbo-jumbo to me, but I dont really want to find out if its true, since the put it in the manual in a very CYOA tone.        Overall I am very happy that I bought this razor. Its nice to have the option to jump in the shower and shave with it, but i havent found that necessary yet(the 8060X did not say anywhere on the box that you could do the same, though I am sure at that price it would seem ridiculous not to be able to).         Hope this helps someone make a decision, I say if you want a nice shave and dont want to spend a ton of money and dont want to spend too little, and get the equivalent of road rash on your face because you did, get the 8020X.</li>
            <li> Close shave. Easy to use and clean. My son gave to his dad and he loves it. Great shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor has a great look and feel.  Very lightweight and I love the fact that it can be used in the shower.  I was very excited to get into the world of electricity while shaving.  But, much to my disappointment I have had to return the product.  I was looking for a close, clean and quick shave.  However, all I received was a dull, hair left all over my neck and face, longer than a straight razor shave.  I am sure this is a good product, unless you have course hair or otherwise just need to spend you time in the morning doing something other than shaving.      Good news though is Norelco offers a 60 money back guarantee.  You have to use it for 21 days straight and after that if it is not what you are looking for send it back and they will refund you the price you paid for it.  So try and see if it is for you.  It is not for me.  Back to the blades... man I am so 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco dry shaver and didn&#x27;t actually like that one. But this 8020x is just amazing. I guess wet/dry shaver is the way to go. It&#x27;s soft on my skin, compact, looks cool (i don&#x27;t care much about the look, though). I don&#x27;t feel any razor burn or irritation anymore and that&#x27;s what matters to me.      The Nivea shaving conditioner that comes with it is great. You can use regular Nivea shaving cream but I would always use the shaving conditioner. This conditioner is so far the best thing I have ever put on my skin. It is less messy than shaving cream and feels good, even though it is little expensive.     Give the shaver 3/4 weeks time before you make your decision.     I have 8020x. 8040x comes with a travel case, 8060x comes with the travel case and a cleaning unit and I believe it takes less time to get fully charged. 8020x requires 8 hours to get charged, on the other hand 8060x requires only 90 minutes and you are also getting the cleaning unit. But you are paying almost double. Anyway, it&#x27;s up to you. I am doing fine with my 8020x.     I might give Panasonic Pro-Curve a try. Just for the hack of it. :)</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon cause I&#x27;m in Canada. Yet reading the reviews here helped me make up my mind so I decided to give back a little.    I&#x27;ve had problems with shaving all my life and the last 4 years I moved to trimming twice a week rather than shaving. Yet when I got this shaver I tried in the shower and it was amazing. Clean shave, no irritation; a feeling I missed for years.    Pros:  - Excellent close shave  - Lightweight  - Waterproof  - Not noisy  - Affordable    Cons:  - Might feel a little cheap on the plastic side  - The Nivea cream is expensive and so far I can&#x27;t find a cheaper alternative  - The travel bag is useless (not that I care)</li>
            <li> This is the third of Norelco&#x27;s waterproof series that I have owned.  The overall quality is just as good as previous models and other Philips/Norelco products.   The shaver is constructed well and is lighter and more compact than previous models. Charging and battery life also seem to be very good.    The main problem I find with this new design is that the heads/razors are floating and not encased as previous models and most other shavers. When using this shaver in the shower this is not a problem. However, when you use this shaver outside of the shower, the lack of casing around the heads means that all of the hair pieces fall from the shaver to the counter or wherever else you may be (I would not recommend using this shaver in the car unless you don&#x27;t mind getting yourself and your car covered with hair pieces). To me this is a major oversight and design flaw.  In short, if you only plan to use this razor in the shower this is a great choice, but if you need to use the razor outside of the shower as well, you may want to choose something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying \\&quot;No, you will not get a razor close shave.  Period.\\&quot;  That being said, this does provide an acceptable shaving solution to those who would like to save money over the long haul and use a comfortable, lightweight shaving system.      A little about my shaving habits: Ever since college I have been in a habit of shaving literally once a week (Sunday morning) and then going \\&quot;gruff\\&quot; for the rest of the week - work doesn&#x27;t mind, wife doesn&#x27;t say anything, hate the nics &amp; cuts, etc...  Problem is, I am somewhat tired of looking like a bum.  This launched my search for a new electric razor (previous one is over 10 years old).  Let&#x27;s say that I am happy I did.      I&#x27;ll be short, sweet and to the point here; the razor is very nice, especially if you use it with traditional shaving cream.  I have to be careful to rinse the heads out frequently when I do this, but the experience is easily twice as fast as a razor shave and nearly as close.  I can shave like this over the sink or in the shower without making a total mess.  The gel you can insert into it is a cool feature, but I see this as a way for them to get more of my $$ and I enjoy applying shaving cream and then using this razor better than using the gel.    Also, check your local Target because I found this product at the same price there AFTER I recieved my item from Amazon.  I love these guys, but there is something to be said about buying local (easier returns, etc...) if it is the same price.    There it is - no horror stories about my face being ripped up, took about 3 shaves to adjust to this, found a method to make it work and I am happy enough to leave 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised straight out of the box.  There&#x27;s enough charge to use it right away.  But then do charge it 8 hours for the next use.  Our teen aged son has sensitive skin and has had a rough go of it using a Remington shaver.  He used the Norelco Christmas morning, and even though it normally takes a week or two for your face to get used to a rotary, it was the first shave ever where he didn&#x27;t have any redness or worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up and five stars for this excellent shaver!</li>
            <li> I got this for my grandson and he just loves it.  My only disappointment  is that I did not see an offer for the replacement blades and conditioner.  I would certainly have gotten that too.</li>
            <li> I love that you can take this shaver into the shower.  It&#x27;s the third Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve owned that is water-proof.  The shave is not like a razor shave, but it is decent.  The Nivea lotion is nice.</li>
            <li> This razor is a very poor razor,  Its pulls the bread instead or cutting.  I have used the razor for over 1 month and it just gets worse.  The razor 7735x was a great razor so they quit  making that one.  Go figure</li>
            <li> Still love the Norelco wet/dry products but this model seems a bit flimsy compared to previous models. In an effort to make the rotating heads more flexible, it appears that they&#x27;ve sacrificed power. The shave isn&#x27;t as close an easy as other models I&#x27;ve used. It takes multiple passes to get a good shave. On the plus side, the shaving debris doesn&#x27;t collect inside the razor. It just fall through the exposed shaving heads. If you shave in the shower, like I do, that&#x27;s a good thing but, if you shave at the sink, probably not so much.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap Norelco Shaver ($40.00).I thought this more expensive razor would be great. WRONG. It burns my neck everytime I use it. I tried everything I know of to prevent it. So be warned. Back to the cheap one.</li>
            <li> I like simple things that work, and this one works. Have been using Norelco electric shavers for over 25 years and this one has to be one of the best. This is not a dry shaver that most are use to, so you do lose the portability of a late afternoon shave at the office or in your car. What you do get is a razor smooth shave. I have been using mine for a year with a great smooth shave everyday. What Im up against now is that the heads need to be replaced, so my dilemma is should I go for the $30 or buy a new shaver. The way I see it: I can buy the same shaver for $69.00 at my local discount outlet which is double the cost for new heads or buy the new head and use it for another year. Well it looks like Im going with the new shaver. Whats great about this shaver the heads do go a long way. Theres also the 8040X which goes for $100.00, same shaver but you get some kind of battery gauge. Keep it simple buy this one and enjoy a great shave for a year. $79.00 thats 22 cents a day not bad for a great shave. As for the charging of the battery, I go about 10-12 days on a 8 hour charge.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a previous cool skin model that had lasted 3 years and then became unreliable. Sometimes, when you hit the power button, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, even with a freshly charged battery. I always liked the rotary shaving system, so I stuck with Norelco and purchased this unit. Now, after just one year, I&#x27;m having the same problem as I had with the previous model. If I&#x27;m going to pay over $100 for a shaver, I want the thing to last more than a year. I have a little travel shaver that runs on AA batteries as a back-up that I bought at Wal Mart for $10 about 7 years ago. It still works every time, but I can&#x27;t shave in the shower with it. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with foil shavers, but I&#x27;ve decided to try a Panasonic ES8234A Arc IV Nano based on customer reviews.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this razor, I was VERY skeptical, being it was my first electric razor. I received it as a Christmas gift and figured it was as good a time as any to stray away from the world of manual razors.    When I first used it, I was scared to say the least. I didn&#x27;t know how it would feel, perform, or how my skin would react to it. After I finished my first shave with it, I was a bit unsatisfied. It missed a lot of hair, and left my skin feeling irritated. When I went on to review other electric razors I found that it is very common for electric razors to miss hairs, so I gave this product the benefit of the doubt and decided to give it another shot.    My second shave was more enjoyable. I decided to slow my shave down, and give a little more attention to how I was maneuvering the razor. My results the second time around were a little more favorable. It didn&#x27;t leave behind as many hairs and my skin was less irritated and a lot smoother.    After a few more times of use, I decided to break down my shave a little more and read the instructions that came with the razor. Turns out, reading the instructions and following them make a HUGE difference. Who would&#x27;ve thought?    After about the first month of use, it became clear that keeping this razor was the best decision I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Now that I have a personalized shaving system down, not only is my shave quick and close, but it&#x27;s also enjoyable.    This razor cuts close. And I mean CLOSE. And with little to no irritation depending on how hard you press. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to gauge how easily certain spots on your face get irritated, so some irritation is just inevitable. The floating heads contour to everything nice and fluently. Philips Norelco advises the consumer to not buy any lotions or cremes to put on your face because it could possibly damage the razor. But I found that I actually get a better shave if I use the dispensing moisturizer in unison with a good face wash, and I can&#x27;timagine it doing any harm to the razor. It&#x27;s never caused me any problems.    All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this razor to anyone and everyone. It&#x27;s a great razor for first time electric razor users as well as long time veterans. It also shaves just as well as the Braun Pulsonic Series 7 (I should know, I&#x27;ve used the Braun as well, thanks to my roommate) if used correctly, and at half the price! Do your research, give yourself some time to form a shaving routine, and give this razor a chance. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor since it first came out and I honestly think that was more than 10 years ago (probably longer).. It is still running perfectly today.. I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for a new one no way. This might be the only thing I&#x27;ve owned this long in my life.  Research the refills though, they&#x27;re getting tougher to get.</li>
            <li> Philips is a good mark, but in this case the seller advertised the shaver as New. But the one sent to was used, dirty, locked and stuck with facial hair...lots..Really disgusting.</li>
            <li> I had a Philips 8160XL, but it irritates so much my neck skin.  After that I bought a Panasonic linear electric shaver. Again, a lot of irritation on my neck, so I gave up and returned to razor blades.  After a while, I want to return to an electric razor, for the long run savings, because razor blades are expensive.  So I start looking.  Finally, I have 3 posibilities:  Norelco 9160XL, Norelco 8020X and Norelco coolskin 7735X.  I found that Norelco 9160XL shares the same cutting blades than the 8160XL, so I discarted.  The Norelco Coolskin 7735X was a temptin option, but this shaver use NiCad batteries (this battery suffers from memory, and after some time, retain less shaving time per charge).  Finally, I decided for the Norelco 8020X.    Shaver:  This shaver has a body very similar to the new line of Norelco: Arcitec.  The shaver is build on light plastic, but feels sturdy.  The body is slim and very confortable to handle.  You can use this shaver on the shower.  Norelco recommends that you only use the Nivea for Men shaving conditioner, but I tried with shaving gel, and I got better results in the confort and closeness department.  This is the reason why I tooked one star:  Norelco should tell you that you can use others products, not only Nivea (this little can cost $9.95 on amazon plus S/H).    Charging:  Is recommended that you drain the battery before charging.  This will prolong battery life.  Charginf take only 8 hours.  You have check, because if you charge more than 8 hours, it can damage the battery.  Philips should had designed a system that shut up the current when the battery is fully charged.  One full charge gave 30 minutes of continuos shaving (according to manual).  I used an entire week before I had to charge it again.    Cleaning:  Very easy, just rinse the shaving heads using hot water (you can easily do this while you shower, or in the sink).  You don&#x27;t need special solution to clean.    Confort:  This, pherhaps is the most important area.  This razon doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Inclusive, I can wash my face using a product with salicilic acid.  My recommendation is that you use shaving gel.  The shaving conditioner gave me good results, but is not so great to justify the cost.  In some days, I shave twice, and cero irritation.    In conclusion:  This is the best shaving system I ever tried.  It gave me no irritation on my skin, no matter how agressive my pre-shaving wash soap is. I highly recommend it to any men with sensitive skin.  The closeness is similar to the one when you shave with a blade following the grain.  Just skip the shaving conditioner and use shaving gel (but not too much, because you can choke the shaving heads).</li>
            <li> Just a few weeks ago I moved from the painfully hot Pulsonic to the Arcitec. The Arcitec did a heckuva a good job and I generally enjoyed the sin out of it. Then one day, in kinda humid conditions, it was a painful as sin shave. So I decided I&#x27;d give the MSS a try. Let me tell you.... let me tell you......    The shave is not quite as close as the Arcitec but it&#x27;s MUCH MUCH more comfortable. So much so that I didn&#x27;t have even the slightest red irritation on any part of my face. The lack of a trimmer on this model and the manual pumping might be annoying but that&#x27;s about it. The charging limitations kinda suck but that doesn&#x27;t really change the overall five-star experience much.    I find I can shave a lot faster with this model too as I don&#x27;t have to pause and wait for the rotaries to cool down. It also works great on the shaving oil without concern for missing spots.    A little hard for big hands but not too bad. Not noisy, not uncomfortable, nothing....    Don&#x27;t over-goop yourself the first few times as you&#x27;ll notice it&#x27;ll slobber off and drip onto you.    I&#x27;m practically giddy about how much I like this shaver. It was a COMFORTING experience shaving this morning. Not just comfortable......    And I never, EVER, though I&#x27;d say that about shaving. -Ali</li>
            <li> I just use regular shave gel in the shower and get a great shave. I like the styling and the performance of this shaver. Its pretty close for an electric   shaver and it works great in the shower. In fact I recommend only using it in the shower otherwise you get hair on you because of the open head design.</li>
            <li> This shaver is half the size, and half the cost of my previous Norelco shaver, and yet, it&#x27;s twice the product.     It is compact, comfortable and convenient. It is my first \\&quot;wet\\&quot; shaver, but I find I prefer to use it over the sink and not in the shower. The moisturizing shaving system works very well. Although it is not necessary, I find it makes the shave more comfortable. You dispense the shaving lotion by pressing a dispensing button (blue) above the power button (white) as needed. It takes a little time getting use to it.    I have a very rough beard, and the shape of the shaving head allows me to even attack those difficult neck hairs.    The only negative is that the battery does not sense charging, and I have heard users have trashed the razor by charging it too long. I use a wall timer (Radio Shack) to limit recharging to 8 hours    Amazon delived quickly and at an excellent price. Unfortunately the web site was confusing and it appeared that Norelco shaving gel packs were compatable with this system. They are not. Anyone need 2 boxes of Cool Skin Shaving Gel?</li>
            <li> This was for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day.  He is 92 years old and really seems to like the shaver.  It gave him a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I am in the Marine Corps right now, so we have to shave, Daily.  Not only that, but sometimes you have to shave 2-3 times a day.  When you shave that much your hair on your face gets stronger and comes back faster.  I was looking for a good shaver and noticed the outstanding reviews for this item.  Looked good and my own mother got interested in it and bought it for me as an early birthday gift.  I tried it out and the first shave was fantastic.  My face tingled so much I was like \\&quot;Oh wow, I know what I&#x27;m getting my father for his birthday this year.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple more shaves with it though (and cleaning it) it felt like my face had become something epic like.  I didnt fully notice it until I got to work and went to the restroom and looked in the mirror that I saw the shaver didn&#x27;t cut as close as it did before.  Nothing changed in my shaving, not the time, nothing.  I&#x27;m still fiddling with it and hoping that this is just the shaver and that I can send it back and get a replacement if it is bad.  If not, well... It was good while it lasted :)</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for 40+ years and this is by far the smoothest and easiest to get into the hard areas.</li>
            <li> Why is this shaver so expensive? I bought mine from Sears about 4 years ago, paid about $100. Now, it costs nearly $300, with replacement heads about $120!  This is insane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips website quotes replacement heads @ $49.99, maybe I should buy them there. Oh wait, they say &amp;#34;No longer available&amp;#34; (HS85 replacement heads)</li>
