            <li>love thisproduct, I have used this product for 30 years</li>
            <li>Contains sulphur which doesn&#x27;t bleach skin like most over the counter products.</li>
            <li>Most days I skip the foundation and use this as a coverup with moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My favorite to hide &amp; cure blemishes.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff..</li>
            <li>#34;almay clear complexion light 100&amp;#34; with the wand is the best acne/redness concealer.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin, i.e. fair plus mild rosacea and acnomel has greatly improved the acne redness.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, but despite it&#x27;s darker appearance blends very well.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, but it goes away after it has been applied to my face.</li>
            <li>AVAILABLE...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and cannot use retinol-based acne creams, so Acnomel Adult Acne Cream is the perfect product for me.</li>
            <li>Originally purchased from</li>
            <li>I kept taking all sorts of over the counter creams, dermatologist medications etc, but nothing seemed to work for my super oily skin.</li>
            <li>It has no negative effect on the healthy skin around the problem areas.  </li>
            <li>I have blue undertones and the color blends nicely.</li>
            <li>I suggest using it on ripening, freshly popped, or healing pimples at night before bed</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and have had adult acne for most of my life.</li>
            <li>dermatologist- but much cheaper here.</li>
            <li>The tube lasts quite a while (much longer than the stuff they sell in the stores) and THIS PRODUCT WORKS.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really works...</li>
            <li>(my skin is very oily).  </li>
            <li>(sometimes I even use a pea size amount and apply to my whole face as a nighttime mask), also works as a concealer since it&#x27;s tinted (but is a tad transparent so would require drying and layers)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product I use it along with De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment Cream.</li>
            <li>I first got the product in our local drug store and found it worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I dont normally use it during the day since the shade of color is pronounced.</li>
            <li>Rate: wow! 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>Has worked well to clear up long-term acne, including cystic version.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For adult acne, nothing else comes close.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend Adult Acnomel.</li>
            <li>It is tinted so it can be worn modestly.</li>
            <li>This in combination with Rainbow Light Active Teen Vitamins with skin clearing ingredients are like a miracle!!!!  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to just about any kind of cream that always sent me running from sunlight and layering on oily sunblock that only made things worse.</li>
            <li>Once I placed my order and the charge was billed to my card; HBA zone, inc. contacted me via e-mail and informed me that my order was no longer available due to an online catalog change apparently, they sent me back to the site where now the charge is $23 and something for the same item.  </li>
            <li>For larger spots, I will wait for my face to dry and apply a little bit more as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li>Acnomel has helped to clear up my acne entirely.</li>
            <li>However, after trying to order it through Amazon and the third party seller, HBA zone, inc., I was very upset due to the fact they advertised the 1 ounce acnomel in a three pack for a total cost of $13.77.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little chalky and requires skill to blend and a little oil free moisturizer and poof acne begone.</li>

            <li> Tiny bit on a zit dries it up.</li>
            <li> This product works!!! I kept taking all sorts of over the counter creams, dermatologist medications etc, but nothing seemed to work for my super oily skin. My skin is sensitive to just about any kind of cream that always sent me running from sunlight and layering on oily sunblock that only made things worse. My makeup never quite covered the damage, but this product is perfect. I&#x27;m Hispanic and the cream looks like my foundation so it blends in perfectly. It&#x27;s a little chalky and requires skill to blend and a little oil free moisturizer and poof acne begone. I love it because it covers while it medicates and it&#x27;s perfect to wear under makeup.</li>
            <li> love thisproduct, I have used this product for 30 years and I will continue to use it for the rest of my life,</li>
            <li> my college daughter uses this product all the time.  it&#x27;s a very good cream for your face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and cannot use retinol-based acne creams, so Acnomel Adult Acne Cream is the perfect product for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> A must have since 1960 !!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome for adult acne!</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on since I was in my teens. Now in my 60&#x27;s and this is the only thing that works.      Sondra</li>
            <li> Have tried the typical teenager products.  This works the best for older person acne. Sometimes I rub a little &amp;#34;Eminence Honeydew Body Lotion&amp;#34; in with Acnomel if skin eruption is due to ingrown hairs and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased from dermatologist- but much cheaper here. Great product for dying out a pimple.</li>
            <li> I first got the product in our local drug store and found it worked really well for me.  However, after trying to order it through Amazon and the third party seller, HBA zone, inc., I was very upset due to the fact they advertised the 1 ounce acnomel in a three pack for a total cost of $13.77. Once I placed my order and the charge was billed to my card; HBA zone, inc. contacted me via e-mail and informed me that my order was no longer available due to an online catalog change apparently, they sent me back to the site where now the charge is $23 and something for the same item.  I feel like a victim of false advertising--now I&#x27;m waiting to see if they will either refund my money or preferably honor the advertised price.</li>
            <li> This only dries out the places that need healing.  It has no negative effect on the healthy skin around the problem areas.  After the skin dries &amp; peels, then this cream doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin anymore.</li>
            <li> This does not stain or bleach your clothes like other acne medications. It can be drying like others but it provides coverage while drying out the acne.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST ACNE CREAM AVAILABLE...PERIOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For adult acne, nothing else comes close. The tube lasts quite a while (much longer than the stuff they sell in the stores) and THIS PRODUCT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why it is so difficult to find in stres is beyond me.</li>
            <li> great product...a relative bought a pack of three for her teenage children..&lt;br /&gt;it really works... dries up the area over night..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything at all to any of my acne.  I would not recommend Adult Acnomel.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Contains sulphur which doesn&#x27;t bleach skin like most over the counter products.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years and this is the best price that I have ever seen, very pleased to find on Amazon.  Great value on the bundle.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it .</li>
            <li> I have used Acnomel since my teens.  I battle sensitive skin, i.e. fair plus mild rosacea and acnomel has greatly improved the acne redness.  Most days I skip the foundation and use this as a coverup with moisturizer.  I have blue undertones and the color blends nicely.</li>
            <li> This is the only acne product I will use.  Yes, it dries out my skin BUT that&#x27;s what I need (my skin is very oily).  It dries ot my blemishes exceedingly well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acnomel for years.  I am 50 years old and have had adult acne for most of my life. I find this product not only helps prevent and heal acne, it also evens out my skin tone. I am fair skinned, but despite it&#x27;s darker appearance blends very well. I think it would work for any skin tone.</li>
            <li> My favorite to hide &amp; cure blemishes.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. Use it every night at bedtime-- apply a thin coating over the T zone and and any trouble spots. Wake up to pimples that have dried up. I dont normally use it during the day since the shade of color is pronounced. It is not overly drying or irritating,</li>
            <li> Rate: wow! 5 stars.  SAY NO TO BENZYL PEROXIDE this is the best acne spot treatment (or nighttime mask) I have used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User advice:  I suggest using it on ripening, freshly popped, or healing pimples at night before bed (sometimes I even use a pea size amount and apply to my whole face as a nighttime mask), also works as a concealer since it&#x27;s tinted (but is a tad transparent so would require drying and layers) personally I think &amp;#34;almay clear complexion light 100&amp;#34; with the wand is the best acne/redness concealer.</li>
            <li> Acnomel has helped to clear up my acne entirely. As another user suggested, I apply a pea sized drop to my entire face immediately after I cleanse. For larger spots, I will wait for my face to dry and apply a little bit more as a spot treatment. The smell is strong, but it goes away after it has been applied to my face.</li>
            <li> It works and its awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Discovered that applying twice a day was too drying for me.  Now I apply at night and leave on until morning.  Others may need to work up to that routine.  No irritation from this like I used to get from salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide preparations. Has worked well to clear up long-term acne, including cystic version.</li>
            <li> Best acne medication i have used. Can&#x27;t find in drugstore anymore. Works great if you get the cystic pimples..helps shrink it down before it becomes anything. And it also helps pimples heal way faster due to sulfur being the active ingredient. Amazing product. One tube should last a long time. It is tinted so it can be worn modestly.</li>
            <li> This is the only foundation I&#x27;ve used for years!  I keeps acne in check.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!  I started using it in my late teens for spot acne.  Now at age 45, I suddenly suffer with horrible hormonal acne - which I NEVER had before.  This in combination with Rainbow Light Active Teen Vitamins with skin clearing ingredients are like a miracle!!!!  Also....cut out all dairy!!!!</li>
            <li> This acne medicine WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne my entire life. I refuse to use Accutane. Now in my 40s I have tried everything and anything.  I highly recommend this product I use it along with De La Cruz Sulfur Ointment Cream. I started out using it twice a day . I had very dry and flaky skin. I cut down to once a day and worked back up to twice again. Took about a week and my skin evened out.  I used moisturizer and a dab of Olive Oil each time. Whatever you do don&#x27;t  give up.</li>
