            <li>It&#x27;s as good as anything for twice the price.</li>
            <li>This lotion has very good ingredients, nice light scent and</li>
            <li>Love this body lotion!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION!</li>
            <li>Felt great, scent is too strong for someone with chemical and scent sensitivities.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion, adsorbs quickly, nice smell.</li>
            <li>Nice compliment</li>
            <li>The Kirkland lotion is the best I have ever used and keeps my skin moist all day between showers and no allergic reations as it is all natural.</li>
            <li>A perfect all over body moisturizer for the entire family.</li>
            <li>I usually love kirkland brand but this lotion is somewhat oily and an hour or so after the application it feels like I never even put lotion on.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell ...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, creamy texture, just about perfect!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I so love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than most of brand name body lotion (e.g. Aveeno) .</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>You would think for the price, almost $12.00 per bottle it would be better.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for making this product available!</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin, soaks right it, acts just like the moisturizer it says it is.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, it completely hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also excited that this is paraben free!</li>
            <li>I tried this lotion before buying it from a friend and thought it was not greasy and lasted but it appears to be another lotion and does not cover well and also dries too easily.</li>
            <li>Almost a week later and that area between my fingers are silky smooth and feeling great.</li>
            <li>I think this is a fabulous lotion.</li>
            <li>Somewhere in between a body butter and a lotion,  which is great for those with super dry skin.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and smooth, has a very light scent, absorbs quickly and is not at all sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is clean and crisp, and vanishes once applied.</li>
            <li>I now use this moisturizer more than any of the (several) others I&#x27;ve purchased over time.</li>
            <li>Seriously this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I noticed such a huge improvement after the first day.</li>
            <li>you get two large bottles.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion....</li>
            <li>so I would pass on paying twice as much online.</li>
            <li>This lotion works very well.  </li>
            <li>For the price (more than 1/2 price less in costco) I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li>Not too thin or sticky, but you don&#x27;t need a lot for good coverage.</li>
            <li>I bought this last week (at the store) and applied it right when I came home.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>a 54 year old woman!</li>
            <li>This is my second year living in the mountains and once the cool air sets in the skin between my right pointer and middle finger gets incredibly dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>It has natural ingredients, including botanicals.  </li>
            <li>It got me by surprised with this Kirkland body lotion.</li>
            <li>Since I have used this lotion (about 1 month) people are always telling me how soft my hands are.  </li>
            <li>Parade free and no alcohols.</li>
            <li>The only new thing that I can add is that once I apply it to my hands, the dryness disappears and the wrinkles are reduced.</li>
            <li>My skin is a little more elastic with the moisturizer, and less likely to tear with minor trauma.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well as an every day lotion after showering.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there for the price.  I walk 120 miles a week and it rejuvinates my feet every night.</li>
            <li> Love this body lotion! It smells delicious and it is the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat the quality of moisturizing and the fragrance.  It has natural ingredients, including botanicals.  It&#x27;s as good as anything for twice the price.</li>
            <li> Felt great, scent is too strong for someone with chemical and scent sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft and smooth, has a very light scent, absorbs quickly and is not at all sticky or greasy. A perfect all over body moisturizer for the entire family.</li>
            <li> I usually love kirkland brand but this lotion is somewhat oily and an hour or so after the application it feels like I never even put lotion on.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion....and I love the smell ...not overpowering. I have been using it for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Not greasy or runny and the scent is not overpowering. Somewhere in between a body butter and a lotion,  which is great for those with super dry skin. Parade free and no alcohols. Plus its in bulk so you dont have to worry about it running out. It runs only $10 at Costco so I would pass on paying twice as much online.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin, soaks right it, acts just like the moisturizer it says it is.  The packaging is very handy.  My skin is a little more elastic with the moisturizer, and less likely to tear with minor trauma.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fabulous lotion. Lovely scent, creamy texture, just about perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a Kirkland product but I have never found it at Costco. You seem to have to purchase it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just as you would expect.</li>
            <li> I so love this lotion.  I bought it in Costco and shared with my BFF.  I don&#x27;t have a car so I ran out of the lotion and  deperate.  Then I thought &amp;#34;AMAZON&amp;#34; goodness.  Amazon has everything!!!  I add scented oils to the lotion and it just silk.  I LOVE THIS LOTION!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than most of brand name body lotion (e.g. Aveeno) . It got me by surprised with this Kirkland body lotion.</li>
            <li> The second and third ingredients are petrolatum and glycerin.  Petroleum IS a plant and animal fossil fuel, (meaning &amp;#34;rock oil&amp;#34; in Latin).  I continue to buy and use this.  I skipped renewing my costly COSTCO membership and happily purchase this from Amazon instead.  This lotion works very well.  Unable to find anything like this at drugstores.</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy this product in bulk quantities. It smells great, it completely hydrates my skin. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, adsorbs quickly, nice smell.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion before buying it from a friend and thought it was not greasy and lasted but it appears to be another lotion and does not cover well and also dries too easily. You would think for the price, almost $12.00 per bottle it would be better.</li>
            <li> This lotion has very good ingredients, nice light scent and you get two large bottles. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin moist for a long time. Love the product.</li>
            <li> Non greasy and does wonders for my skin.  Awesome product!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have spent a fortune on brand-name moisturizers, but none of them can compare to Kirkland&#x27;s.  The only new thing that I can add is that once I apply it to my hands, the dryness disappears and the wrinkles are reduced.</li>
            <li> This is my second year living in the mountains and once the cool air sets in the skin between my right pointer and middle finger gets incredibly dry and cracked. It is painful. I bought this last week (at the store) and applied it right when I came home. Wow! Seriously this stuff works great. I noticed such a huge improvement after the first day. Almost a week later and that area between my fingers are silky smooth and feeling great. I&#x27;ve tried several other lotions that hasn&#x27;t worked for my problem area, many of which actually burned pretty bad when I applied it to my cracked skin.Not this stuff.  I&#x27;m also excited that this is paraben free! For the price (more than 1/2 price less in costco) I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> Since I have used this lotion (about 1 month) people are always telling me how soft my hands are.  Nice compliment&lt;br /&gt;For a 54 year old woman!</li>
            <li> Love it. Not too thin or sticky, but you don&#x27;t need a lot for good coverage. My local Costco no longer carried it, so I was elated to find it at Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from exema all of my like and have used almost every lotion known to man. The Kirkland lotion is the best I have ever used and keeps my skin moist all day between showers and no allergic reations as it is all natural. The only other place I can find this lotion is at Cosco and unfortunately Cosco is not in my area. Thank you Amazon for making this product available!</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product because it received a poor rating (6) in EWG when I ran the ingredients.  The ingredients aren&#x27;t listed on this Amazon listing, but here they are off of the bottle I purchased from Costco:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;water, glycerin, petrolatum, butyrospermum parkii, capric triglyceride, ethylbexyl palmitate, helianthus annuus seed oil, stearic acid, sorbitan stearate, dimethicone, cetyl alcohol, ceteth-20 cetyl palmitate, polysorbate 20, dmdm hydantoin, carbomer, sodium hydroxide, distarch phosphate, phenoxyethanol, rosa caina fruit oil, simmondsia chinensis seed oil, parfum, tetrasodium edta, magnesium ferment, iron ferment, magnesium ferment, silicone ferment, zinc ferment, ascorbyl palmitate, tocopheryl acetate, lactic acid, squalance, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, camellia sinensis leaf extract, butylphenyl methylpropional, benzyl benzoate, hydroxyisohexyl 3-cyclohexene carboxaldehyde, alpha-isomethyl ionone, benzyl salicylate, citronellol, limonene, linalool, geraniol, hexyl cinnamal</li>
            <li> An excellent product. The fragrance is clean and crisp, and vanishes once applied. I now use this moisturizer more than any of the (several) others I&#x27;ve purchased over time.</li>
