            <li>Advanced anti wrinkle cream</li>
            <li>The important thing is to start.</li>
            <li>It is light weighted on the skin.</li>
            <li>The advanced anti-wrinkle cream has matrixyl-3000, shea butter and coffee extract.  </li>
            <li>I like the texture and the light scent</li>
            <li>nice and light, yet very creamy.</li>
            <li>Definitely got to get some more!!</li>
            <li>it feels light on my sensitive skin and keeps my makeup perfect all day long :-)</li>
            <li>;, so I may not need wrinkle cream a lot on my face for awhile yet, but for now, I am thrilled that the aging of my ankles and lower legs has been made less repulsive and practically &amp;#34;normal looking&amp;#34; while I&#x27;ve used these two products together.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty happy with ReVitaSure right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited with continued use.</li>
            <li>a long way!!&lt;br /&gt;It made my face feel great and my skin glow</li>
            <li>I never have to top it up from using first thing in morning, and then after cleansing at nighttime.  </li>
            <li>I very have sensitive skin and have experienced no problems with this cream.</li>
            <li>I loved this product along with the serum my skin was smooth and silky, wrinkles are not as deep.</li>
            <li>I apply this cream twice a day on clean face.</li>
            <li>This is important to me because many I&#x27;ve used before pump too much or revolves around all over the place.</li>
            <li>I apply this cream twice a day on clean face.</li>
            <li>Applying this was easy to rub in to my face and my face soaked this right up.</li>
            <li>And at such a good price in comparison to others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The Vitamin C Complex has a wonderful pump.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, I&#x27;m not too far gone in the wrinkle department yet, but when offered a nice discount coupon, I had to give this a</li>
            <li>The jar contains 1 full once.  </li>
            <li>but it is not bad either.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy my skins texture right after application and throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It also contains Matrixyl 3000 which (I did my research) is a combination of two peptides, palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 and palmitoyl oligopeptide, resulting in an entirely new super peptides which is the most advanced technology on the market for eliminating wrinkles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not very oily and it spread very nicely.</li>
            <li>i have used this product for a few days and have loved the outcome!</li>
            <li>It just overall looked more appealing.  </li>
            <li>It almost feels like a challenge that for winning you get better, younger, softer, hydrated, elastic improved skin!</li>
            <li>The many other ingredients are listed on the nice jar and the box it is shipped in for delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like this Advanced Anti Wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>she looks better than ever thanks you so much.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>There is no strong scent noted and think it is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use this product on my neck and face didn&#x27;t notice results right away but after 2 weeks of use I started noticing the wrinkles</li>
            <li>This one pumps the right amount</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to find a skincare that as natural as possible, my skin feels fantastic, so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of ReVitaSure products because they contain all natural organic ingredients and are paraben free; more importantly they are NOT tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products from this company and have been very pleased with them</li>
            <li>was notice the nice package that it comes in,you open it up and the container is not some small tube but a really good size container.</li>
            <li>we both from same brand, this will help more on the wrinkle around eyes and neck.</li>
            <li>This first thing I did when I opened this Advance Anti Wrinkle cream up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a sense of my skin looking younger, but it just feels better</li>
            <li>I makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first night I used it after I removed my make-up.</li>
            <li>I will tell you that I fell in love with it that 1st next morning.  </li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>First, I want to talk about the packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are diminished and my face is more supple and younger feeling.</li>
            <li>I makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product has left a positive impression and I would recommend everyone to try this anti wrinkle cream by ReVitaSure , to help with keeping your skin healthy, glowing, and to look youthful.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are high quality, natural, organic, and paraben free.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt really nice after I used it and the wrinkles that I do have looked less pronounced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen much impact on the wrinkles and fine lines just yet, but it certainly makes my skin feel nice and soft</li>
            <li>I liked the way it soaked into my dry skin and made it feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It protects my skin from sun damage and prevents dehydration, actually healing my skin of fine lines and wrinkles and strengthening my skin.</li>
            <li>If you simply want a moisturizer it will probably be fine for you.</li>
            <li>My first impression of this product when I opened the box is that this must be a high quality cream that you could buy in a department store.  </li>
            <li>I have already shared with friends about your amazing product and a few of them have mentioned that they want to try it themselves.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really a drastic change because I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, but my skin does seem tighter and firmer since I&#x27;ve started using this Anti-Wrinkle Cream and that&#x27;s what you would really want.</li>
            <li>The cream is very lightweight and non greasy.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this Adv</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about lotions and creams because I do not like my skin to feel smothered, sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell that much</li>
            <li>I love that once this is massaged in the only thing you feel is soft, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Oddly, right before I ran into ReVitaSure, I started getting some really old looking wrinkles around my ankles.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the whole ReVitaSure product line.</li>
            <li>Its a light weight cream that goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The same is true for the pump on the Neo Hydrate Gold Serum.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different options and this is the only one from now on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You can tell as soon as you receive the product you are getting a high quality cream.</li>

            <li>My skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The cream does not feel heavy or greasy, actually it is light weight and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin too, and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li>This product went on smoothly and did not feel heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it daily and can really see and feel a difference of the skin on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Start early, and be proactive, but even if you didn&#x27;t get a jump on it, you can start now.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work well and with my sensitive skin I have no breakouts.</li>
            <li>When it works well with my sensitive skin I always consider that as a plus.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no waste.</li>
            <li>My makeup did not melt away early in the day</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>Even my 5 yr old daughter notices a difference</li>
            <li>The Neo Hydrate Gold Serum, The Vitamin C Complex and the advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really used creams too much</li>
            <li>I am starting to notice little wrinkles on my face here and there, laugh lines, crows feet, some starting on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and this cream is moist and absorbant.  </li>
            <li>Really calms down the cats.....</li>
            <li>A little bit of cream goes a long way, so you will feel like you are getting your money worth.</li>
            <li>I accidently put to much on my finger because I noticed a little goes</li>

            <li> /&gt;Luckily, I&#x27;m not too far gone in the wrinkle department yet, but when offered a nice discount coupon, I had to give this a</li>
            <li> The jar contains 1 full once.  </li>
            <li> but it is not bad either.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my skins texture right after application and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It also contains Matrixyl 3000 which (I did my research) is a combination of two peptides, palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 and palmitoyl oligopeptide, resulting in an entirely new super peptides which is the most advanced technology on the market for eliminating wrinkles.</li>

            <li> There is no strong scent noted and think it is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my neck and face didn&#x27;t notice results right away but after 2 weeks of use I started noticing the wrinkles</li>
            <li> This one pumps the right amount</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find a skincare that as natural as possible, my skin feels fantastic, so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of ReVitaSure products because they contain all natural organic ingredients and are paraben free; more importantly they are NOT tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products from this company and have been very pleased with them</li>
            <li> was notice the nice package that it comes in,you open it up and the container is not some small tube but a really good size container.</li>
            <li> we both from same brand, this will help more on the wrinkle around eyes and neck.</li>
            <li> This first thing I did when I opened this Advance Anti Wrinkle cream up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sense of my skin looking younger, but it just feels better</li>
            <li> I makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it after I removed my make-up.</li>
            <li> I will tell you that I fell in love with it that 1st next morning.  </li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> First, I want to talk about the packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are diminished and my face is more supple and younger feeling.</li>
            <li> I makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product has left a positive impression and I would recommend everyone to try this anti wrinkle cream by ReVitaSure , to help with keeping your skin healthy, glowing, and to look youthful.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are high quality, natural, organic, and paraben free.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt really nice after I used it and the wrinkles that I do have looked less pronounced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen much impact on the wrinkles and fine lines just yet, but it certainly makes my skin feel nice and soft</li>
            <li> I liked the way it soaked into my dry skin and made it feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It protects my skin from sun damage and prevents dehydration, actually healing my skin of fine lines and wrinkles and strengthening my skin.</li>
            <li> If you simply want a moisturizer it will probably be fine for you.</li>
            <li> My first impression of this product when I opened the box is that this must be a high quality cream that you could buy in a department store.  </li>
            <li> I have already shared with friends about your amazing product and a few of them have mentioned that they want to try it themselves.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really a drastic change because I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, but my skin does seem tighter and firmer since I&#x27;ve started using this Anti-Wrinkle Cream and that&#x27;s what you would really want.</li>
            <li> The cream is very lightweight and non greasy.</li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this Adv</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about lotions and creams because I do not like my skin to feel smothered, sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell that much</li>
            <li> I love that once this is massaged in the only thing you feel is soft, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Oddly, right before I ran into ReVitaSure, I started getting some really old looking wrinkles around my ankles.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the whole ReVitaSure product line.</li>
            <li> Its a light weight cream that goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The same is true for the pump on the Neo Hydrate Gold Serum.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different options and this is the only one from now on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You can tell as soon as you receive the product you are getting a high quality cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s made in the USA, no Animal testing, and all natural products!</li>
            <li> Bought the ReVitaSure products recently as looking to find a pure product, as natural as possible, but also very moisturizing for my skin.</li>
            <li> she is 45 years old.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The cream does not feel heavy or greasy, actually it is light weight and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin too, and have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> This product went on smoothly and did not feel heavy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it daily and can really see and feel a difference of the skin on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Start early, and be proactive, but even if you didn&#x27;t get a jump on it, you can start now.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work well and with my sensitive skin I have no breakouts.</li>
            <li> When it works well with my sensitive skin I always consider that as a plus.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no waste.</li>
            <li> My makeup did not melt away early in the day</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> Even my 5 yr old daughter notices a difference</li>
            <li> The Neo Hydrate Gold Serum, The Vitamin C Complex and the advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used creams too much</li>
            <li> I am starting to notice little wrinkles on my face here and there, laugh lines, crows feet, some starting on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and this cream is moist and absorbant.  </li>
            <li> Really calms down the cats.....</li>
            <li> A little bit of cream goes a long way, so you will feel like you are getting your money worth.</li>
            <li> I accidently put to much on my finger because I noticed a little goes</li>
            <li> as like I said a tiny drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin feeling soft after one use and I began to see the crows feet lines begin to fade after a few days of using this cream.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin, it makes my skin feel and look like silk.  </li>
            <li> I reccommend that customers with very dry skin who do not want a greasy oily feeling on their skin use this product.  </li>
            <li> dry, delicate facial skin is losing some elasticity, but there&#x27;s enough fat to keep the shape.</li>
            <li> This cream can be used even if you use other skin cream.</li>
            <li> It can either go on after the use of serums or before the use of other creams/cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell I like using this cream.</li>
            <li> Like the other ReVitaSure products I did not have any reactions to using it.</li>
            <li> story short, using this with ReVitaSure&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum w/24k Gold has smoothed out the wrinkles and minimized the lines left behind.</li>
            <li> The cream feels silky smooth to the touch and while it does have a slight odor it is not an unpleasant one.</li>
            <li> I think I look at least 5 years younger than I did.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There is a typical expectation of this product, and that is by day 15 you should see 15% less wrinkles and by week 8 you should notice a reduction of about 45%.</li>
            <li> I received this at little or at no cost.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday since I have gotten it</li>
            <li> Heavy &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li> I do notice a big difference after using this product and its not that expensive.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this advanced anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> I have noticed subtle difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just horrible and</li>

            <li> What a great face cream! My skin feels soft and hydrated. I live in a very dry climate and this cream is moist and absorbant.  The cream does not feel heavy or greasy, actually it is light weight and absorbs well into the skin. After application my skin feels great and smooth! A small amount goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been only using for about a couple weeks, but I can already notice a difference in the appearance of my skin. I feel like there is more of a glow and fine lines are not as visible. Hyaluronic acid is great for hydration. I like that there is coffee bean extract to help fight sun damage and prevent from wrinkles! I&#x27;m excited with continued use.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for a few days and have loved the outcome! My skin is fresher and softer, and my fine lines have diminished greatly!</li>
            <li> In additional of the serum we both from same brand, this will help more on the wrinkle around eyes and neck. my wife loves it, it works!</li>
            <li> this product is the best.  I have dry skin, it makes my skin feel and look like silk.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar, and I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> This product first of all smells amazing. I use it nightly and it makes my face feel so smooth and refreshed afterwards. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product looks like those fancy creams you see in the department stores, but without the department store price. You can tell as soon as you receive the product you are getting a high quality cream. The glass jar it comes in is very nice and stylish. It&#x27;s made in the USA, no Animal testing, and all natural products! The cream is very lightweight and non greasy. Their isn&#x27;t even an odor. I very have sensitive skin and have experienced no problems with this cream. I apply it in the morning, before I put on my makeup, and again at night after I apply the Hyaluronic Acid Serum made by ReVitasure.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet, but Im hoping with usiing this product now, will help prevent those pesky wrinkles from even making an appearance. I received this product for an honest and unbiased review and all the opinions are my own</li>
            <li> love this product , it leave my skin feeling great</li>
            <li> For me, this is the perfect product because I like my moisturizers to be non greasy because I have oily skin. But, I need to be able to keep the aging process at bay. This product moisturizes my skin without OVER moisturizing it. I have sensitive skin too, and have not had any problems. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I received this at little or at no cost. This first thing I did when I opened this Advance Anti Wrinkle cream up was notice the nice package that it comes in,you open it up and the container is not some small tube but a really good size container. I opened it up and noticed no foul odor,it was nice and was a nice pleasant odor.I washed my face and decided to try it out. I accidently put to much on my finger because I noticed a little goes a long way!!&lt;br /&gt;It made my face feel great and my skin glow,I use it daily and I love it!! It&#x27;s great to have and it will last for a good while so no need to worry about the price (which is really a good price) as like I said a tiny drop goes a long way. I have already noticed great results with it,my wrinkles are looking a lot better already.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product,if I like it ,I&amp;#34;m sure you will love it!!!</li>
            <li> Bought the ReVitaSure products recently as looking to find a pure product, as natural as possible, but also very moisturizing for my skin. I have been using the ReVitaSure products almost two weeks and I love it.  All three products work really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anti Wrinkle Eye Serum  has Vitamin C, Rosehip, Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00PYNWUME Anti Wrinkle Eye Serum - ReVitaSure]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream has With Matrixyl 3000, Shea Butter, Coffee Seed Extract&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00PYMVPEY Advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream 1 oz With Matrixyl 3000, Shea Butter, Coffee Seed Extract - Advanced Anti Aging Cream For Men &amp; Women - ReVitaSure]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ReVitaSure Neo Hydrate Gold has Neodermyl, 24 Gold Dust, Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00PYOD2PW Hyaluronic Acid Serum - ReVitaSure]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s great to find a skincare that as natural as possible, my skin feels fantastic, so soft and supple. I never have to top it up from using first thing in morning, and then after cleansing at nighttime.  I liked the way it soaked into my dry skin and made it feel soft and hydrated. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen much impact on the wrinkles and fine lines just yet, but it certainly makes my skin feel nice and soft and I don&#x27;t feel the need to cover it with foundation. It&#x27;s not a sense of my skin looking younger, but it just feels better and I&#x27;ve ditched foundation for a light BB cream.  And at such a good price in comparison to others I have tried.  Love it!  Well done! I received these products at a discount in exchange for my review, but all opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> great moisturizer, it last all day.  it makes my skin hydrated all day.  I have both serum and moisturizer.  It always good to use serum in conjunction with moisturizer, It maximize the result.  I can&#x27;t say if it reduce wrinkle because I don&#x27;t have wrinkle, but I do choose anti wrinkle for preventative measure.</li>
            <li> I loved this product along with the serum my skin was smooth and silky, wrinkles are not as deep. I would purchase product again.</li>
            <li> I have been looking at the reviews on Amazon to determine which product would be best to try that would help moisturize and keep my skin healthy, now that I am in my mid 30&#x27;s.  My first impression of this product when I opened the box is that this must be a high quality cream that you could buy in a department store.  This product went on smoothly and did not feel heavy on my skin.  This product left my skin feeling soft after one use and I began to see the crows feet lines begin to fade after a few days of using this cream.  This product has left a positive impression and I would recommend everyone to try this anti wrinkle cream by ReVitaSure , to help with keeping your skin healthy, glowing, and to look youthful.  Thank you ReVitaSure for providing me with the opportunity to try this product at a discounted price, in exchange for an unbiased review.   I have already shared with friends about your amazing product and a few of them have mentioned that they want to try it themselves.</li>
            <li> I really like this Adv&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with this wrinkle cream. It reduces the wrinkles and fine lines on my face. I started using the day i received it in the mail. I use it before any cosmetics. I apply this cream twice a day on clean face. I have noticed subtle difference on my skin. I makes my skin soft and smooth. The smell is pleasant and soft. It is light weighted on the skin. It does not make the skin greasy. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> nice and light, yet very creamy. It leaves my face feeling very silky soft. I have been using it for a few days and I love the feeling of my face when I use this one. There is no strong scent noted and think it is a great moisturizer. I used this after using the ReVitasure serum. I think it is a great combination and works well together. I really enjoy my skins texture right after application and throughout the day. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice non greasy moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel oily at all. Its a light weight cream that goes a long way. I do notice a big difference after using this product and its not that expensive. I want my skin to retain how youthful it looks and I will be reordering this product because I am a believer in it and its well within range of what I can afford for my  beauty needs. Definitely try this product.</li>
            <li> Cream is very lightweight, easy to apply, smells great and continuous use will get results.</li>
            <li> This cream works well for me. I use it every morning and night a see my lines diminishing.  The ingredients are high quality, natural, organic, and paraben free.  This cream locks the moisture in while nourishing my skin.  It has the best combination of wrinkle eliminating elements...works great.  I have been receiving many comments on my appearance and I attribute it to REVITASURE Products.  fast shipping. nice customer service.</li>
            <li> Advanced anti wrinkle cream I use this product on my neck and face didn&#x27;t notice results right away but after 2 weeks of use I started noticing the wrinkles were jus about gone...&lt;br /&gt;**I have been offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair and honest opinion</li>
            <li> I have just recently began using Anti-Wrinkle products. I turned 30 this year and I&#x27;ve heard the sooner you start the better of you will be. When I was chosen to test this out and my give my honest and unbiased opinion,  I was glad to do it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. I decided that I wanted this to be apart of my nightly routine before bed. The first night I used it after I removed my make-up. I will tell you that I fell in love with it that 1st next morning.  My skin was so soft and smooth. It just overall looked more appealing.  It wasn&#x27;t really a drastic change because I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet, but my skin does seem tighter and firmer since I&#x27;ve started using this Anti-Wrinkle Cream and that&#x27;s what you would really want. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this advanced anti wrinkle cream for a consumer review and it is the best. I have been using it daily and can really see and feel a difference of the skin on my face and neck. This cream can be used even if you use other skin cream. It can either go on after the use of serums or before the use of other creams/cosmetics. Take care of your facial skin. Once you start showing signs of aging it is easy to be discouraged. Start early, and be proactive, but even if you didn&#x27;t get a jump on it, you can start now. The important thing is to start. I love this cream because it does not make my skin feel greasy. I am very picky about lotions and creams because I do not like my skin to feel smothered, sticky or greasy. I love that once this is massaged in the only thing you feel is soft, hydrated skin. There is not an overpowering aroma, just a very light pleasant scent. The scent is gender neutral so this product can be used by men or women. My husband is just now starting to care about his skin and he loves to use this cream as well. One of the number one reasons he will use it is because &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t smell like a flower, a dessert or a woman&#x27;s perfume&amp;#34;. A little bit of cream goes a long way, so you will feel like you are getting your money worth. There is a typical expectation of this product, and that is by day 15 you should see 15% less wrinkles and by week 8 you should notice a reduction of about 45%. That is amazing. The longer you use it, the better you look. It almost feels like a challenge that for winning you get better, younger, softer, hydrated, elastic improved skin! Yes, please! This cream is made in America and is from a lab that is against animal testing. Those are definitely perks I look for when shopping for products. A great gift for adult children&#x27;s stocking for Christmas, or bridal and baby showers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with their serum and it seems to work well when used that way.The cream is fluffy and light not overbearing or heavy.I don&#x27;t really like the smell that much but it is not bad either.Applying this was easy to rub in to my face and my face soaked this right up.I have been using it everyday since I have gotten it and it seems to work well and with my sensitive skin I have no breakouts.When it works well with my sensitive skin I always consider that as a plus.Other than the smell I like using this cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 wonderful products from ReVitaSure. The Neo Hydrate Gold Serum, The Vitamin C Complex and the advanced Anti Wrinkle Cream. They are the perfect prescription for younger looking skin. First, I want to talk about the packaging. The Vitamin C Complex has a wonderful pump. This is important to me because many I&#x27;ve used before pump too much or revolves around all over the place. This one pumps the right amount so there&#x27;s no waste. The same is true for the pump on the Neo Hydrate Gold Serum. The Anti Wrinkle cream comes in a beautiful crystal jar that is pretty to look at on the counter. I love that these products have no scent. I&#x27;ve noticed that my wrinkles are diminished and my face is more supple and younger feeling. I have combination skin and have issues with products that are too greasy. This is not. I have areas where I was starting to get age spots but these products are stopping them in their tracks. I highly recommend the whole ReVitaSure product line.</li>
            <li> Great product processing. . . This is a non greasy moisturizer.  It works well with my primer and make up.  I reccommend that customers with very dry skin who do not want a greasy oily feeling on their skin use this product.  My makeup did not melt away early in the day</li>
            <li> This is an awesome face cream, I love beauty and maintaining and this is helping to prevent and smooth my lines. I just apply a little every night and it is wonderful because you almost do not feel it on and we have to always have to take care of our face&lt;br /&gt;It is not very oily and it spread very nicely. It is awesome</li>
            <li> Now that I am pushing 40 years of age I am starting to notice little wrinkles on my face here and there, laugh lines, crows feet, some starting on my forehead. So I thought I got to nip this in the bud and start searching for an anti-wrinkle cream. When I seen the chance to try this product out for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of it I seized the chance. I have tried other products from this company and have been very pleased with them so I knew that I would surely be happy with this as well and I was. The cream feels silky smooth to the touch and while it does have a slight odor it is not an unpleasant one. Like the other ReVitaSure products I did not have any reactions to using it. (I have sensitive skin) My skin felt really nice after I used it and the wrinkles that I do have looked less pronounced. You know something has to be working when your teenage daughter stops, looks at you and tells you that you are looking real nice.  I just love the fact that ReVitaSure products are made in the USA, I fully support products that are. It is also nice to know that this company is against animal testing. I am most happy with the ReVitaSure line of products and would gladly purchase more of them.</li>
            <li> Using the Anti Wrinkle Cream has lessened the wrinkles and almost diminished the crows feet.  With continued use i&#x27;m sure the remaining fine lines will be removed.</li>
            <li> Really calms down the cats.....they are basically not scratching my furniture like they did before.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily. I can see results around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Nice line of products!&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I&#x27;m not too far gone in the wrinkle department yet, but when offered a nice discount coupon, I had to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is rich and moisturizing without being greasy and it does not irritate my skin or have a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;My dry, delicate facial skin is losing some elasticity, but there&#x27;s enough fat to keep the shape. Oddly, right before I ran into ReVitaSure, I started getting some really old looking wrinkles around my ankles. Just horrible and depressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, using this with ReVitaSure&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum w/24k Gold has smoothed out the wrinkles and minimized the lines left behind. Who knew? Not this skeptic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m told that &amp;#34;Black Don&#x27;t Crack&amp;#34;, so I may not need wrinkle cream a lot on my face for awhile yet, but for now, I am thrilled that the aging of my ankles and lower legs has been made less repulsive and practically &amp;#34;normal looking&amp;#34; while I&#x27;ve used these two products together.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty happy with ReVitaSure right now.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this advanced anti-wrinkle cream. If you simply want a moisturizer it will probably be fine for you. I did not find the product serving as advertised. Heavy &amp; greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like this Advanced Anti Wrinkle cream. It reduces the wrinkles and fine lines on my face. I started using the day i received it in the mail. The It has great packaging. I use it before any cosmetics. I apply this cream twice a day on clean face. I have noticed great difference on my skin. I makes my skin soft and smooth. The smell is pleasant and soft. It is light weighted on the skin. It does not make the skin greasy. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> RevitaSure is a great product.  They have a great line of products.  The advanced anti-wrinkle cream has matrixyl-3000, shea butter and coffee extract.  The many other ingredients are listed on the nice jar and the box it is shipped in for delivery. The cautions are listed on the jar along with instructions.  The jar contains 1 full once.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I used this on myself and my mother I love this stuff it works if you are 36 or 63. Definitely got to get some more!!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product ! I&#x27;ve never really used creams too much but since I started I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference and this one is terrific ! I like the texture and the light scent is refreshing ! I love using it in tho A M ! I received this cream as part of a promotion and boy am I glad I did !! If you are considering this cream Buy it and if this is not one the creams you are looking at you should ! Even my 5 yr old daughter notices a difference lol</li>
