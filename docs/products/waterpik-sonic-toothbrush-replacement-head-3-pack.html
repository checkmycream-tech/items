            <li> Excellent product but if you are in Europe, don&#x27;t buy this. I ended up paying €95 ($112) for six brushes. On top of an odd €50 for the brushes, +€30 shipment, which is ourtrageous, +€24 tax duty. Never again.</li>
            <li> Fit great on my toothbush and clean nicely!</li>
            <li> Not  much to say.  I assume it&#x27;s Waterpik brand brushes.  They were well packaged in sealed plastic and arrived promptly.  They fit on my toothbrush handle well.</li>
            <li> Perfect--and it arrived earlier than promised!</li>
