            <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has worked better for me than Metrogel (a prescribed gel for rosacea).</li>
            <li>Prosacea isn&#x27;t as good as a prescription medication, but it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper and it does a pretty good job of keeping my Rosacea cleared up.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s so cheap, what do you have to lose? :)</li>
            <li>Cleared up the rosacea very quickly.</li>
            <li>have very mild rosacea and acne prone skin...</li>

            <li>And I have mild rosacesa</li>
            <li>Not bad at all, good enough until I get my shipment of clobetasol tropical steroid cream from Cuba; nothing that&#x27;s sold in the U.S over the counter or other wise works better than that particular cream.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, only problem is the price from amazon is way too high.</li>
            <li>Maybe it won&#x27;t work for everyone, but my personal results have been amazing.</li>
            <li>I use this product at the first signs of a rosacea breakout and it clears it up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does dry out my face if I use too much, but not anything a good face moisturizer can&#x27;t solve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>The redness is not always completely gone, but over the last couple of months she has seen great results and has had several days that were entirely free of redness.  </li>
            <li>I have had Rosacea for years and have used many different prescriptions</li>
            <li>Was pretty drying.  </li>
            <li>It actually works better than that stuff.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this nightly and it really seems to be helping with his seborrhea derm.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>Sure, it smells a little bit like sulphur</li>
            <li>My face is normal again.</li>
            <li>Normally it takes about 4-5 days for a flare up to go away, but with Prosacea mine was gone within two days.</li>
            <li>Had a strong sulfur smell to it, and I couldn&#x27;t wait long enough to wash it off.</li>
            <li>I have not used homeopathic treatments in the past, and might not have ever tried this if I&#x27;d realized that was what it was in the store, but I am so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Working so far!</li>
            <li>But the pimples, bumps, red, itchy and hot rash on my cheeks is no joke.</li>
            <li>so I applied my usual moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>Did initially clear skin.  </li>
            <li>This gel has completely cleared my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably diet related but who really knows.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried other products, or if they haven&#x27;t worked for you, Prosacea is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>It is the only topical that helps my rosacea when used consistently.</li>
            <li>My red spots are fading with skin flaking and new skin growing.  </li>
            <li>I saw this gel at the grocery store the other day, and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>I used prosacea last night after washing my face with the usual mild cleanser.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Nothing has worked this well for my condition. My face is normal again. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have had Rosacea for years and have used many different prescriptions and this product exceeds anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT! BETTER THANTHE RX ONE. WHE I SAW THERE IS SULFA IN IT I WAS SOLD. AGAIN! XCELLENT I WILL REORDER SOON TO HAVE IT HANDY</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  It has worked better than the multitude of prescriptions I&#x27;ve had over the years. If you have rosacea, give it a shot at least!  It is a bit drying, but the irritation of the rosacea itself made my face so oily this is a plus for me.  I was in a vicious cycle of redness, feeling like my face was on fire, then my face producing more oil.  This stuff is wonderful, ordering more now, although one tube lasts for months since it only takes a tiny amount to work.</li>
            <li> My wife has suffered from rosacea for the last several years and was reluctant to look for remedies.  Finally, I started looking for products that might help relieve her symptoms.  I bought Prosacea and a competitor product from a pharmacy chain.  She did a side-by-side test of the products, using them by label directions, one on each side of her face every day for a month.  Well, that was the plan, anyway. The Prosacea side showed such marked improvement after two weeks that she stopped using the other and began using Prosacea exclusively.  It&#x27;s been a great confidence booster for her.  The redness is not always completely gone, but over the last couple of months she has seen great results and has had several days that were entirely free of redness.  I&#x27;m buying it now because it ran out and she requested more.  If you haven&#x27;t tried other products, or if they haven&#x27;t worked for you, Prosacea is definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s cool so it feels great when you put it on and b</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this nightly and it really seems to be helping with his seborrhea derm.  This along with morning swabs of apple cider vinegar)</li>
            <li> My husband and my sister swear by this product. I have to keep a supply on hand</li>
            <li> makes my bumps on my face dissapear over night most the time 2 days tops</li>
            <li> I have used it for about six months to replace Metrogel and it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> It seemed to make my son break out bad at first then it cleared up fairly well. Baby aveno for exsecma works just as well and it&#x27;s cheaper</li>
            <li> I have used this product before purchased from a local store.  It is the only topical that helps my rosacea when used consistently.</li>
            <li> Had a terrible breakout. Cleared it right up.</li>
            <li> Prosacea isn&#x27;t as good as a prescription medication, but it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper and it does a pretty good job of keeping my Rosacea cleared up.</li>
            <li> This gel works!  My red spots are fading with skin flaking and new skin growing.  I see a definite improvement after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> Wanted to find something that was not a prescription, as even with insurance, it was getting pricey. Have been dealing with rosecea for almost two decades now and was getting tired of either going to the doctor or having a prescription phoned in when needed, and did I mention the price of rosecea prescriptions? This stuff is great! Works great on my rosecea! No side effects, it just works! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, only problem is the price from amazon is way too high.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything other than dry my face out. And I have mild rosacesa</li>
            <li> After one use saw noticeable difference. Cleared up the rosacea very quickly. My skin looked horrible and looks so much better now. Will not try another product after using this.</li>
            <li> This is the only treatment that is not an oral antibiotic that clears my skin.  I will not take antibiotics because of their risk (and they upset my stomach horribly).  For the past 15 years, I have had rosacea with lots of redness and pimples.  Not any more!  This gel has completely cleared my skin.  I wish the tubes were larger, but a little does go a long way.  I have not used homeopathic treatments in the past, and might not have ever tried this if I&#x27;d realized that was what it was in the store, but I am so glad I bought it.  Maybe it won&#x27;t work for everyone, but my personal results have been amazing.</li>
            <li> Not too obvious treatment, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Yet another OTC product that does not work.</li>
            <li> I saw this gel at the grocery store the other day, and used it for the first time last night. Usually my nose is really red by about 6pm every day, but today it didn&#x27;t get red at all!</li>
            <li> Did initially clear skin.  Was pretty drying.  Did remove redness.  No initial smell but did have a noticeable sulphur smell later.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all, good enough until I get my shipment of clobetasol tropical steroid cream from Cuba; nothing that&#x27;s sold in the U.S over the counter or other wise works better than that particular cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very mild rosacea and acne prone skin...this stuff helps the bumps on my face go down faster than anything I have ever used, and it helps prevent them from forming. I also like how it keeps oil at bay, and sometimes I even wear it under my makeup to help my makeup stay on longer while simultaneously drying up any bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry out my face if I use too much, but not anything a good face moisturizer can&#x27;t solve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff and is now a part of my daily routine!</li>
            <li> Only used this product once. Was extremely drying on my skin. It felt like it sucked all the moisture out of my skin. Had a strong sulfur smell to it, and I couldn&#x27;t wait long enough to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I had run out of my prescription and couldn&#x27;t get in to see the dermatologist. I decided to try this in the meantime. It actually works better than that stuff. Make sure to gently massage it in.</li>
            <li> Working so far! I&#x27;ve only used the product twice since yesterday so I can&#x27;t comment on the long term use but I did see overnight results with one application. I&#x27;ve had rosacea for years but it has been under control for a very long time. I wasn&#x27;t even using anything specific for it, other than my Origins moisturizer and cleanser. I noticed since I went wheat-free my skin has been looking great but recently I fell off the wheat-free wagon and had beer, some baked goods and spicy food. This week my face completely erupted into the worst flare up I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s probably diet related but who really knows. Rosacea is a mystery. But the pimples, bumps, red, itchy and hot rash on my cheeks is no joke. Not to mention my face is puffy like I got punched. Not attractive or comfortable..even my eyes were burning. I used prosacea last night after washing my face with the usual mild cleanser. Sure, it smells a little bit like sulphur but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I felt a cooling sensation as it began to reduce the swelling..I also took Aleve to combat the inflammation. It did feel a bit tight, like it could be drying my skin so I applied my usual moisturizer on top. By morning the swelling had decreased considerably and the redness was less as well. Not a miracle but definitely helped. I also put a little on the worst spots under my moisturizer and make up during the day today. I will continue to use this product because I already feel some relief after 2 applications..rx products never really worked for me in the past.</li>
            <li> This product has been a lifesaver for me. I first used this gel during a horrible flare up (red, dry skin, pustules and papules) and saw results within two hours. The redness had faded and the pustules/papules had reduced in size. Normally it takes about 4-5 days for a flare up to go away, but with Prosacea mine was gone within two days. Several people state that this product is very drying; I have not experienced this however that could be because I put on a high quality moisturizer 5 minutes after application of Prosacea. This allows time for it to soak in but adds any moisture the Prosacea may be taking from your skin. I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is suffering from Stage 2 rosacea (pustules and papules). It has worked better for me than Metrogel (a prescribed gel for rosacea). Since it&#x27;s so cheap, what do you have to lose? :)</li>
            <li> I use this product at the first signs of a rosacea breakout and it clears it up quickly.  recommend it!</li>
            <li> Does what it claims to do and keeps my roseacea at bay</li>
            <li> After years of having rosacea, I am astonished to have found a product that actually controls the symptoms. My skin began clearing in 24 hours and continued clearing over the next few days. After two weeks of using it, I have only the occasional blemish. I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
