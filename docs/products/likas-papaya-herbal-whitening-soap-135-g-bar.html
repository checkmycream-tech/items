            <li>I was so happy because it was working.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a great change in the color of my skin as well as texture.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m gonna give this a try I gave it 5 stars because of the review that 18 people liked so</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash your face with Likas and leave it on for 3 to five minutes before you wash it off, it works sooo good.</li>
            <li>I love this product and services are all good</li>
            <li>I love this soap makes my skin look and feel good after I use it.</li>
            <li>My acne marks are really faded now and my face has a much more even complexion now, still not close to perfect</li>
            <li>love love!</li>
            <li>and I found that extraderm was much more effective.</li>
            <li>So far, it is a WONDERFUL cleanser, but a crappy lightening agent.</li>
            <li>It does lighten complexion and I love the smell. :)</li>
            <li>This has to be the most overrated, overly hyped \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; soap out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fad and most people are just imagining things.</li>
            <li>and yes it worked better than any cream, any washes I have used.</li>
            <li>, just about everyone I know who has had success with this soap reports that they lather up with it BEFORE getting into the shower so that it can sit on the skin for a while, then be rinsed off: so this is a good way to go about it, I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>I will use this forever :-)</li>
            <li>ok so I&#x27;ve tried everything and came across likas because of the number one review I&#x27;m trying waiting for my order I got 4 bars</li>
            <li>Soap is ok, I did find something better, theses soap started to make my face brakeout, can&#x27;t use anymore..</li>
            <li>Noxema Is way better</li>
            <li>Will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>On my 3rd bar and must say am very impressed with my results .</li>
            <li>Okay,  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 weeks now, maybe 4.</li>
            <li>This also drys out your skin so make sure you apply lotion afterwards...</li>
            <li>Found a much better soap</li>
            <li>Still going to use this though :)</li>
            <li>at first it was working good</li>
            <li>, you can skip days and get results, make sure to use a strong sunscreen (I use 100 proof from Neutrogena)</li>
            <li>This product smells pretty good and is easy to store.</li>
            <li>It is very drying though, so I do use a good lotion on my body (eucerin, keri, Lubriderm, etc) and i use cocoa butter or shea butter on my face.</li>
            <li>That was really good because my face was very oily before using this product.</li>
            <li>but I was able to see a significant change.</li>
            <li>that is it doesnt get mushy easily.</li>
            <li>What i don&#x27;t like is the smell but is fine</li>
            <li>is fine.</li>
            <li>The soap is kinda cheap (without shipping included.</li>
            <li>Now I feel comfortable wearing tang tops</li>
            <li>my chest, legs, arms and face are light.</li>
            <li>when I ordered this I read a lot of reviews like my own (praising the likas) and just never believed it really.</li>
            <li>I wanted to start using whitening products, so i started off with this cheap soap.</li>
            <li>but it is great on toning the skin giving it a supple nice smooth look its hard to describe I just really like this for my face and body feels like a exfoliator and seems to even help my make up look smoother when I apply it!!!</li>
            <li>The scent is strong but not unpleasant and does not remain on your skin after use.</li>
            <li>I began using this soap last fall and the results have been amazing!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about this soap when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant lightening on the rest of my body though...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited I truly believe this will work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna keep my fingers crossed and see I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li>Once again, I love this soap so much!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it, and there is no result on my skin and may be this product is not the original.</li>
            <li>There were some periods of time where I could noticeably tell my skin had lightened - but keeping in mind that we always have warm, sunny weather, most of the time Likas wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to write a review til I got the full effects of it, but after awhile of not seeing ANY improvements, I am going to go ahead and do this review.</li>
            <li>The only thing good I can say about this soap is...</li>
            <li>I had fantastic success, and results in three days.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice and leaves your skin feeling soft though.</li>
            <li>It made my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>recently order 20 of these soap from Asian&#x27;s Best.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quick way to lighten your skin, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>It defiantly make your skin more radiant without overdoing it keeps it very natural</li>
            <li>I also combined it with Bello skincare products and fresh lemons in the works.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>so, if you wanna splurge and just try the soap for kicks, go right ahead.</li>
            <li>but all in all its inexpensive and is a great way to lighten your complexion or dark underarms (anything really).</li>
            <li>My skin is a lot more even and clear, and my hands look BEAUTIFUL, before they were really dark and discolored now they are as clear as water.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this stuff after seeing Patricia Bright on the YT rave about how it helped her remove some of her dark spots and discoloration on her face.</li>
            <li>For the most part, in my shower, I have body washes like Dove and such, so I only washed my darker areas with the soap and not the parts I was okay with.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a pretty visible improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently for a month and no results.</li>
            <li>I first bought Likas at the end of 2011 and decided to hold off my review until I saw the long-term effects of using this soap.</li>
            <li>Ive read reviews and some people dont like the scent, but i like it, its very soft and clean smelling to me.</li>
            <li>At first it made me look nice and glowed then later I started to itch for dear life and completely broke out.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say I&#x27;ve used a ton of skin lightening products, but I have used a lot of natural skin remedies [...] and to date, Likas soap has tended to bring much better results.</li>
            <li>but it certainly brightened it.</li>
            <li>The first use, I was excited because I THOUGHT I noticed my skin lighter the next day.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this, the only reason it&#x27;s not a 5/5 is because of the irritation that I experienced and the lack of information on the packaging regarding the active acid used.</li>
            <li>Just a little reminder that some times, ordering things over the internet is not as good as just going directly to the store and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance and does not moisturize.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep up with it since it really was helping my breakouts.</li>
            <li>Let me be very frank with you here: IT DOESN&#x27;T WHITEN.</li>
            <li>It really works.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product really works along with a bleaching lotion.</li>
            <li>so im really</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak for anyone else, but I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>I really havent notices any changes.</li>
            <li>This soap really did nothing for me at all.</li>
            <li>It really brightened my skin on my face and body.</li>
            <li>After using it for a couple weeks, it doesnt seem to be doing much anymore though.</li>
            <li>It helps lighten my skin so much.</li>
            <li>and i recommend that you get a thing of sunblock that you really like (non oil).</li>
            <li>if you dont use sunblock when you go outside your skin will be even more sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li>Today, I was actually quite taken aback by the beautiful deep golden even tone that my skin has developed, across my shoulders, down my arms (there used to be a more distinct tan line down my arms),</li>
            <li>I am not extremely dark, but I am like a coco brown color, I notice that the skin on my hands has lightened enough for me to see the color of my veins, something that I have never been able to do.</li>
            <li>My skin is back to its original color.</li>
            <li>this stuff works make a really ngood lather on your face work it in an rinse pat dry lightly in about awwek you will notice results</li>
            <li>Papaya soaps in general rarely ever give results like people claim.</li>
            <li>So, if I wore a bikini or were undressed around my husband (though he never sees the difference and says I am beautiful no matter what) I was uncomfortable because my body didn&#x27;t match.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get dramatic results, but a shade or two paler is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not all of them or not the whole soap, but it was just not like a brand new soap you would get from a store.  </li>
            <li>and you will tan even more than what your previous complexion was.</li>
            <li>The only positive I can say is that it will leave your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>My face looks really radiant and clear!</li>
            <li>If I dont use a high SPF</li>
            <li>So with that said, I would shout at the top  of a mountain and recommend this little natural soap to any and everyone because it REALLY WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I left the product on my skin for a couple minutes before washing it off, and I made sure to use a lotion in the event it would dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I burn easily and my skin becomes really dark, flaky and irritated.</li>
            <li>I run out of the other one and need something to use as I wait for my primary soap to get here.</li>
            <li>Does not look like brand new soap.  </li>
            <li>It also makes your skin very soft too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add that I usually do try the Likas in conjunction with another remedy or product, but no matter what treatment I do I always get better results from using it with the Likas.</li>
            <li>Also, please wear spf when using this product especially during the hot days.</li>
            <li>The complexion and tone of my skin have improved drastically and the discoloration issues have almost completely subsided!</li>
            <li>I notice a difference on my face right away but not so much for my the dark color between my legs or under my arms or knees.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this every day and the area that I want to lighten is more or less the same.</li>
            <li>There was a significant and visible improvement two bars down.</li>
            <li>I check every single soap bar and most of them were kind of dirty.</li>
            <li>Also, when I received the soap by mail, I was surprised to find that the box containing the soap had already been opened.</li>
            <li>After three weeks my face was clear of pimples but still sported old acne marks.</li>
            <li>it made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>far as breaking out my face, I could never tell what breaks  out my face because it has its moments and have not found anything to help it but intibiotic capsuls from my doc.</li>
            <li>Even of the commercial remedies, nothing else yet has really beat this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works though but not for me, my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be surprised.  </li>
            <li>So far its been about a month using this product</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s medium size, it gets smaller so fast</li>
            <li>At the time of this review, I still have not gone through a complete bar of Likas.</li>
            <li>I did not want to waste any more money by returning it back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle (but be warned, it WILL irritate your face the first few times you use it, so use some moisturizer afterwards) and works well for a soap!</li>
            <li>Nothing permanent of course and that doesn&#x27;t set this soap apart from all the other brands that also make skin softer, right?</li>
            <li>I live in Southern California and tan very easily (Vietnamese), so I&#x27;m used to dark skin year round.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light skin african american who had gotten darker due to over exposure to the sun this summer.</li>
            <li>I later email them and they said the soap are all brand new.  </li>
            <li>They only sell brand new items.</li>
            <li>The soap really does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much and it makes your skin really dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad bud doesn&#x27;t smell great, either.</li>
            <li>First off, I will like to say that I have a dark complexion.</li>
            <li>It does seem to speed up the process of getting my skin back to its old color if I get tanned or burnt though.</li>
            <li>Recently I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my arms or legs, but still like to use the soap frequently.</li>
            <li>In fact, when I was on vacation and burning to a crisp, I caved in and splurged on another bar (speaking of which - I&#x27;m definitely not pleased to spend twice as much as the actual product on shipping).</li>
            <li>This soap should be used to help get you back to your natural tone and to even out your coloring.</li>
            <li>This product may make your skin red and irritable, so people with sensitive skin should use with caution.</li>
            <li>Down my first bar</li>
            <li>It left my face dry and didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>Although it does take some time I can really see the dark spots on my back clear up .</li>
            <li>After a vacation, I noticed that the skin on my face and neck had darkened considerably while my upper body remained the same.</li>
            <li>I have never bothered to write about a product I&#x27;ve used because no other product I&#x27;ve used actually worked 100% or deserves my time to comment.</li>
            <li>One bar of soap, half way through it, I couldnt believe my light chest and neck matched my dark stomach, back and buns!</li>
            <li>By the way I tried other products only on my face because I have mild acne problems and that also discolors my face though not as extreme as my body.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m so excited I truly believe this will work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna keep my fingers crossed and see I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li> Once again, I love this soap so much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, and there is no result on my skin and may be this product is not the original.</li>
            <li> There were some periods of time where I could noticeably tell my skin had lightened - but keeping in mind that we always have warm, sunny weather, most of the time Likas wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to write a review til I got the full effects of it, but after awhile of not seeing ANY improvements, I am going to go ahead and do this review.</li>
            <li> The only thing good I can say about this soap is...</li>
            <li> I had fantastic success, and results in three days.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice and leaves your skin feeling soft though.</li>
            <li> It made my skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> recently order 20 of these soap from Asian&#x27;s Best.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a quick way to lighten your skin, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> It defiantly make your skin more radiant without overdoing it keeps it very natural</li>
            <li> I also combined it with Bello skincare products and fresh lemons in the works.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> so, if you wanna splurge and just try the soap for kicks, go right ahead.</li>
            <li> but all in all its inexpensive and is a great way to lighten your complexion or dark underarms (anything really).</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot more even and clear, and my hands look BEAUTIFUL, before they were really dark and discolored now they are as clear as water.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this stuff after seeing Patricia Bright on the YT rave about how it helped her remove some of her dark spots and discoloration on her face.</li>
            <li> For the most part, in my shower, I have body washes like Dove and such, so I only washed my darker areas with the soap and not the parts I was okay with.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a pretty visible improvement in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I used it consistently for a month and no results.</li>
            <li> I first bought Likas at the end of 2011 and decided to hold off my review until I saw the long-term effects of using this soap.</li>
            <li> Ive read reviews and some people dont like the scent, but i like it, its very soft and clean smelling to me.</li>
            <li> At first it made me look nice and glowed then later I started to itch for dear life and completely broke out.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say I&#x27;ve used a ton of skin lightening products, but I have used a lot of natural skin remedies [...] and to date, Likas soap has tended to bring much better results.</li>
            <li> but it certainly brightened it.</li>
            <li> The first use, I was excited because I THOUGHT I noticed my skin lighter the next day.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this, the only reason it&#x27;s not a 5/5 is because of the irritation that I experienced and the lack of information on the packaging regarding the active acid used.</li>
            <li> Just a little reminder that some times, ordering things over the internet is not as good as just going directly to the store and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance and does not moisturize.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep up with it since it really was helping my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Let me be very frank with you here: IT DOESN&#x27;T WHITEN.</li>
            <li> It really works.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This product really works along with a bleaching lotion.</li>
            <li> so im really</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak for anyone else, but I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> I really havent notices any changes.</li>
            <li> This soap really did nothing for me at all.</li>
            <li> It really brightened my skin on my face and body.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple weeks, it doesnt seem to be doing much anymore though.</li>
            <li> It helps lighten my skin so much.</li>
            <li> and i recommend that you get a thing of sunblock that you really like (non oil).</li>
            <li> if you dont use sunblock when you go outside your skin will be even more sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li> Today, I was actually quite taken aback by the beautiful deep golden even tone that my skin has developed, across my shoulders, down my arms (there used to be a more distinct tan line down my arms),</li>
            <li> I am not extremely dark, but I am like a coco brown color, I notice that the skin on my hands has lightened enough for me to see the color of my veins, something that I have never been able to do.</li>
            <li> My skin is back to its original color.</li>
            <li> this stuff works make a really ngood lather on your face work it in an rinse pat dry lightly in about awwek you will notice results</li>
            <li> Papaya soaps in general rarely ever give results like people claim.</li>
            <li> So, if I wore a bikini or were undressed around my husband (though he never sees the difference and says I am beautiful no matter what) I was uncomfortable because my body didn&#x27;t match.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get dramatic results, but a shade or two paler is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Not all of them or not the whole soap, but it was just not like a brand new soap you would get from a store.  </li>
            <li> and you will tan even more than what your previous complexion was.</li>
            <li> The only positive I can say is that it will leave your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> My face looks really radiant and clear!</li>
            <li> If I dont use a high SPF</li>
            <li> So with that said, I would shout at the top  of a mountain and recommend this little natural soap to any and everyone because it REALLY WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I left the product on my skin for a couple minutes before washing it off, and I made sure to use a lotion in the event it would dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I burn easily and my skin becomes really dark, flaky and irritated.</li>
            <li> I run out of the other one and need something to use as I wait for my primary soap to get here.</li>
            <li> Does not look like brand new soap.  </li>
            <li> It also makes your skin very soft too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add that I usually do try the Likas in conjunction with another remedy or product, but no matter what treatment I do I always get better results from using it with the Likas.</li>
            <li> Also, please wear spf when using this product especially during the hot days.</li>
            <li> The complexion and tone of my skin have improved drastically and the discoloration issues have almost completely subsided!</li>
            <li> I notice a difference on my face right away but not so much for my the dark color between my legs or under my arms or knees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every day and the area that I want to lighten is more or less the same.</li>
            <li> There was a significant and visible improvement two bars down.</li>
            <li> I check every single soap bar and most of them were kind of dirty.</li>
            <li> Also, when I received the soap by mail, I was surprised to find that the box containing the soap had already been opened.</li>
            <li> After three weeks my face was clear of pimples but still sported old acne marks.</li>
            <li> it made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> far as breaking out my face, I could never tell what breaks  out my face because it has its moments and have not found anything to help it but intibiotic capsuls from my doc.</li>
            <li> Even of the commercial remedies, nothing else yet has really beat this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works though but not for me, my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be surprised.  </li>
            <li> So far its been about a month using this product</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s medium size, it gets smaller so fast</li>
            <li> At the time of this review, I still have not gone through a complete bar of Likas.</li>
            <li> I did not want to waste any more money by returning it back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle (but be warned, it WILL irritate your face the first few times you use it, so use some moisturizer afterwards) and works well for a soap!</li>
            <li> Nothing permanent of course and that doesn&#x27;t set this soap apart from all the other brands that also make skin softer, right?</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California and tan very easily (Vietnamese), so I&#x27;m used to dark skin year round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light skin african american who had gotten darker due to over exposure to the sun this summer.</li>
            <li> I later email them and they said the soap are all brand new.  </li>
            <li> They only sell brand new items.</li>
            <li> The soap really does dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much and it makes your skin really dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad bud doesn&#x27;t smell great, either.</li>
            <li> First off, I will like to say that I have a dark complexion.</li>
            <li> It does seem to speed up the process of getting my skin back to its old color if I get tanned or burnt though.</li>
            <li> Recently I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my arms or legs, but still like to use the soap frequently.</li>
            <li> In fact, when I was on vacation and burning to a crisp, I caved in and splurged on another bar (speaking of which - I&#x27;m definitely not pleased to spend twice as much as the actual product on shipping).</li>
            <li> This soap should be used to help get you back to your natural tone and to even out your coloring.</li>
            <li> This product may make your skin red and irritable, so people with sensitive skin should use with caution.</li>
            <li> Down my first bar</li>
            <li> It left my face dry and didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> Although it does take some time I can really see the dark spots on my back clear up .</li>
            <li> After a vacation, I noticed that the skin on my face and neck had darkened considerably while my upper body remained the same.</li>
            <li> I have never bothered to write about a product I&#x27;ve used because no other product I&#x27;ve used actually worked 100% or deserves my time to comment.</li>
            <li> One bar of soap, half way through it, I couldnt believe my light chest and neck matched my dark stomach, back and buns!</li>
            <li> By the way I tried other products only on my face because I have mild acne problems and that also discolors my face though not as extreme as my body.</li>
            <li> I would have tried it a month to see slow results, but the burning,itching and smell are not even worth one time use.</li>
            <li> I used this product for more than a month and say small results only very small results.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if it is real.</li>
            <li> , I guess it&#x27;s not fair to expect miracles right away.</li>
            <li> I do apply a good amount of perfume but this phenyl smell was making me feel terrible whole day</li>
            <li> Strange to say, my complexion appears to be even darker.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to wait long.</li>
            <li> You would have to use this for a long period of time to see results..</li>
            <li> Works.... very.... slowly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for the record I am not a dark skinned person, and I usually am just using Likas soap to lighten tans obtained from being in the sun too long, so I don&#x27;t know if it would work if your goal is actual bleaching of pigment.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Not an extreme difference, obviously since it is just soap&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> It made my skin so dry</li>
            <li> So I probably will buy for that purpose also it will dry pimples in a breeze.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend you have a moisturizer to use after using it because it can dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin extremely dry after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> You could do better things with your money though, like donate a few dollars here and there to a foundation if you&#x27;re really bored and need to spend money.</li>
            <li> (I think it&#x27;s because the skin on your hands is pretty thin)</li>
            <li> But I just gave it a try, I had nothing to loose.</li>
            <li> Black Female, 25 years old:&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> MONEY.THIS SOAP ACTUALLY GAVE ME BLACK HEADS AND PIMPLE</li>
            <li> recommendation:  buy at least 3 bars and commit to using them daily just like your regular soap.  </li>
            <li> I once went outdoors to paint some furniture and saw I&#x27;d darkened, and I just ran in and immediately applied an egg white remedy to my skin and washed it off with Likas (and some harsh scrubbing with a [[ASIN:B002BEHQWI Salux Cloth]]) and the color was gone at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I am a black American with fairly dark skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a bar for my sister who wanted to clear her marks and she had already given up and declared it a failure.</li>
            <li> and I go back to my usual color.</li>
            <li> BTW those other washes, creams and also exfloints caused me ample amount of cash, sons of bitches hit me over the head and took my wallet.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have stated, it is not an overnight sensation; it does take time to see improvement, but just be patient, and it will come.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my small spot of melisma and it didn&#x27;t do anything, bought the Chinese one and lightened immediately</li>
            <li> (Lather it up before you get in the shower, let it stay on your skin for a bit before washing it off as other reviewers have said).  </li>
            <li> Products always arrive days before the expected delivery!</li>
            <li> That can be drangerous for the liver (and other organs) if use is prolonged so I just ordered the \\&quot;black soap\\</li>

            <li> I used this product for dark underarms.</li>
            <li> My situation is that during my pregnancy I ended up with dark underarms.</li>
            <li> I use this soap as a face wash and it has lightened the dark spots that I have on my forehead along my hairline.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to brighten the skin discoloration and dark scarring but did not do anything.</li>
            <li> Dark areas are still visible.</li>
            <li> and it did already start to whiten those dark areas that I have from loosing weight!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> the dark arm pits are gone thank you likas.</li>
            <li> Lighten skin slightly.</li>
            <li> It has no smell to it, it doesn&#x27;t burn, and it leaves your skin feeling tight and smoove.</li>
            <li> Odd smell, didn&#x27;t whiten, lighten, or brighten anything after about 4 weeks of use on trouble spots.</li>
            <li> It got rid of the bad tan that I had and brought me back to my natural skin color.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING natural, expensive and all in between for my small-medium acne problems.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Black Female, 25 years old:&lt;br /&gt;This soap has changed my beauty routine. I love it! I use it in the summer time because my skin is so sensitve to sunlight. I burn easily and my skin becomes really dark, flaky and irritated. If I dont use a high SPF my skin looks terrible. I use this soap for about a week and I go back to my usual color. It is very drying though, so I do use a good lotion on my body (eucerin, keri, Lubriderm, etc) and i use cocoa butter or shea butter on my face. Ive read reviews and some people dont like the scent, but i like it, its very soft and clean smelling to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 2 weeks now. Didn&#x27;t want to write a review til I got the full effects of it, but after awhile of not seeing ANY improvements, I am going to go ahead and do this review. The first use, I was excited because I THOUGHT I noticed my skin lighter the next day. I&#x27;ve been using this every day and the area that I want to lighten is more or less the same. I feel like it&#x27;s just a regular hand soap, doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance and does not moisturize.</li>
            <li> First off, I will like to say that I have a dark complexion. After a vacation, I noticed that the skin on my face and neck had darkened considerably while my upper body remained the same. I bought the soap after reading the glowing reviews. I simply wanted to lighten my complexion to match the rest of my body. Well, after 2 months of usage, I can say that the soap did not work. Strange to say, my complexion appears to be even darker. This soap my work for people with a lighter complexion, but I do not think it works for those with a darker hue. Also, when I received the soap by mail, I was surprised to find that the box containing the soap had already been opened.</li>
            <li> recently order 20 of these soap from Asian&#x27;s Best. The delivery time was great. Didn&#x27;t have to wait long. It came on time. But when I received the package, all 20 bar of soap was opened. All the boxes was opened at both end.  I check every single soap bar and most of them were kind of dirty. Does not look like brand new soap.  I did not want to waste any more money by returning it back.  So I decided just to keep the items.  I have kept the products but just wanted to let the company know what was going on.  I later email them and they said the soap are all brand new.  They only sell brand new items. But some of the soap that i order was kind of dirty. Not all of them or not the whole soap, but it was just not like a brand new soap you would get from a store.  They said the box being opened at both end was because the way it was packaged and the boxes moving around and that was what cause it to open.  Yes, I can understand about the movement of the delivery, but to have all 20 boxes opened at both end is impossible.  Just a little reminder that some times, ordering things over the internet is not as good as just going directly to the store and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. Yes it dries your skin out but nothing a great all over body moisturizer can&#x27;t fix. My stomach was always the darkest part of my body now I am all over the same shade of brown. It does lighten complexion and I love the smell. :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about this soap when I first started using it. It left my face dry and didn&#x27;t seem to do much. Within a week, however, I noticed that some stubborn pimples I had were starting to respond. After three weeks my face was clear of pimples but still sported old acne marks. I bought a bar for my sister who wanted to clear her marks and she had already given up and declared it a failure. I decided to keep up with it since it really was helping my breakouts. Now it&#x27;s been a few months and everyone has just started to comment on how much clearer my complexion is. My acne marks are really faded now and my face has a much more even complexion now, still not close to perfect but hey at least there was some improvement! Give it some time, I guess it&#x27;s not fair to expect miracles right away. Will definitely keep using.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t work. I even soaked in the soap 2x a week for a month. I also combined it with Bello skincare products and fresh lemons in the works. Still nothing! I should&#x27;ve known as I did try this 10 years ago and I found that extraderm was much more effective. (I purchased at the local asian market in my city). Good luck!</li>
            <li> I used this product for dark underarms. There was a significant and visible improvement two bars down. It works slowly, but it does work.</li>
            <li> This has to be the most overrated, overly hyped \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; soap out there. Everyone recommends this soap as if it does wonders and miracles. Let me be very frank with you here: IT DOESN&#x27;T WHITEN. It doesn&#x27;t LIGHTEN. It also doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; (whatever the heck that&#x27;s supposed to mean). The only thing good I can say about this soap is...it made my skin soft. Nothing permanent of course and that doesn&#x27;t set this soap apart from all the other brands that also make skin softer, right? The soap is kinda cheap (without shipping included. LOL) so, if you wanna splurge and just try the soap for kicks, go right ahead. You could do better things with your money though, like donate a few dollars here and there to a foundation if you&#x27;re really bored and need to spend money. Did I mention, Likas doesn&#x27;t whiten skin like it claims? Yeah...no. Papaya soaps in general rarely ever give results like people claim. It&#x27;s a fad and most people are just imagining things. It does NOT work!</li>
            <li> I have tried several bleaches and was hesitant in trying this product. But I just gave it a try, I had nothing to loose. My situation is that during my pregnancy I ended up with dark underarms. It got worst after having my second child. I would use different skin bleaches but they never helped. So I bought the Likas Papaya Herbal Soap and to my surprise it helped. It is a slow process but I was able to see a significant change. Now I feel comfortable wearing tang tops and I don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable in showing my underarms. It really works.[[ASIN:B002UFJ66M Likas Papaya Herbal Whitening Soap 135 g Bar]]</li>
            <li> I have never bothered to write about a product I&#x27;ve used because no other product I&#x27;ve used actually worked 100% or deserves my time to comment. My skin color is medium to sort of light-african woman- but I had some discoloration (my stomach, my butt and my back were sort of bronze, darker than the rest of my body) my chest, legs, arms and face are light. So, if I wore a bikini or were undressed around my husband (though he never sees the difference and says I am beautiful no matter what) I was uncomfortable because my body didn&#x27;t match. By the way I tried other products only on my face because I have mild acne problems and that also discolors my face though not as extreme as my body. Those products never worked, I never saw the differenc with my face so when I ordered this I read a lot of reviews like my own (praising the likas) and just never believed it really. I just wanted to try it so I did, only on my body though because reviewers said it breaks out their face and such. For the most part, in my shower, I have body washes like Dove and such, so I only washed my darker areas with the soap and not the parts I was okay with. One bar of soap, half way through it, I couldnt believe my light chest and neck matched my dark stomach, back and buns! My body is one color after one soap, it is weird, unbelievable, shocking, and exciting all at once that this little soap WORKED! OMG this is rediculous, how is this possible? In the last itty bitty part of the soap I tried my face and yes it worked better than any cream, any washes I have used. BTW those other washes, creams and also exfloints caused me ample amount of cash, sons of bitches hit me over the head and took my wallet. Of course, with tiny-eye-squinting results or none at all! So with that said, I would shout at the top  of a mountain and recommend this little natural soap to any and everyone because it REALLY WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as breaking out my face, I could never tell what breaks  out my face because it has its moments and have not found anything to help it but intibiotic capsuls from my doc. That can be drangerous for the liver (and other organs) if use is prolonged so I just ordered the \\&quot;black soap\\&quot; a lot of people are saying it works on acne so if it works for me I will write about it. I have tried EVERYTHING natural, expensive and all in between for my small-medium acne problems. If this works I will die with excitment. I will let you know! Stay tuned...has its moments and have not found anything to help it but intibiotic capsuls from my doc.

            <li> A family member recommended this product after receiving it as a gift from a friend. I have been using it for about 2 months and I have seen a pretty visible improvement in my skin tone. I use this soap as a face wash and it has lightened the dark spots that I have on my forehead along my hairline. Like other reviewers have stated, it is not an overnight sensation; it does take time to see improvement, but just be patient, and it will come.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say I&#x27;ve used a ton of skin lightening products, but I have used a lot of natural skin remedies [...] and to date, Likas soap has tended to bring much better results. Even of the commercial remedies, nothing else yet has really beat this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the record I am not a dark skinned person, and I usually am just using Likas soap to lighten tans obtained from being in the sun too long, so I don&#x27;t know if it would work if your goal is actual bleaching of pigment. It does seem to speed up the process of getting my skin back to its old color if I get tanned or burnt though. I once went outdoors to paint some furniture and saw I&#x27;d darkened, and I just ran in and immediately applied an egg white remedy to my skin and washed it off with Likas (and some harsh scrubbing with a [[ASIN:B002BEHQWI Salux Cloth]]) and the color was gone at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just about everyone I know who has had success with this soap reports that they lather up with it BEFORE getting into the shower so that it can sit on the skin for a while, then be rinsed off: so this is a good way to go about it, I&#x27;d say. I&#x27;ll add that I usually do try the Likas in conjunction with another remedy or product, but no matter what treatment I do I always get better results from using it with the Likas.</li>
            <li> This product really works along with a bleaching lotion. It also makes your skin very soft too. I&#x27;m a light skin african american who had gotten darker due to over exposure to the sun this summer. My skin is back to its original color. Also, please wear spf when using this product especially during the hot days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for apprx 3 weeks in hopes of it lightening and evening my skin tone. I am a black American with fairly dark skin. I&#x27;ve discovered that it is way to overdrying for my face...to the point that it feels as though my face is burning. I&#x27;ve discontinued using it on my face as frequstly, however I continue to use it on my body.  So far, it is a WONDERFUL cleanser, but a crappy lightening agent. I will finish using the bar and update with any changes. Tootles</li>
            <li> I did not see any changes with using this and neither did my relatives...It is supposed to brighten the skin discoloration and dark scarring but did not do anything. A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t used this product yet so im really not sure I bought it to use under my arms. We&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak for anyone else, but I really like this soap. I&#x27;m about two bars in and I can already see a difference. My skin is a lot more even and clear, and my hands look BEAUTIFUL, before they were really dark and discolored now they are as clear as water. I am not extremely dark, but I am like a coco brown color, I notice that the skin on my hands has lightened enough for me to see the color of my veins, something that I have never been able to do. (I think it&#x27;s because the skin on your hands is pretty thin) I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant lightening on the rest of my body though...just my face and hands. I actually didn&#x27;t buy the soap to lighten my skin, just to even out my skin tone, and to get rid of some of my acne scars. If it lightens my hands anymore, I&#x27;ll have to discontinue use. It does work though. My face looks really radiant and clear!</li>
            <li> Great Soap I will use this forever :-) It defiantly make your skin more radiant without overdoing it keeps it very natural I love it !!</li>
            <li> it made my skin itchy. at first it was working good but after a while it made my skin terribly itchy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This product isn&#x27;t worth it. Dark areas are still visible. I would suggest a body scrub of some sort.</li>
            <li> ok so I&#x27;ve tried everything and came across likas because of the number one review I&#x27;m trying waiting for my order I got 4 bars I&#x27;m so excited I truly believe this will work so I will write another review again when I start nothing else has worked for me so I&#x27;m gonna give this a try I gave it 5 stars because of the review that 18 people liked so I&#x27;m gonna keep my fingers crossed and see I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li> Works.... very.... slowly. then runs out and its gone. Not the best, but its good, but i wish it worked faster.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference on my face right away but not so much for my the dark color between my legs or under my arms or knees. It made my skin so dry so I went back to my dove body wash. But the stuff works great for your face and cleared up all my pimples.</li>
            <li> At first it made me look nice and glowed then later I started to itch for dear life and completely broke out. Allergic reaction is what I definetly had. It works though but not for me, my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my small spot of melisma and it didn&#x27;t do anything, bought the Chinese one and lightened immediately and it had that citrus smell and the Lukas didn&#x27;t . So I&#x27;m not sure if it is real. The only positive I can say is that it will leave your skin super soft. So I probably will buy for that purpose also it will dry pimples in a breeze.</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash your face with Likas and leave it on for 3 to five minutes before you wash it off, it works sooo good. I would also recommend you have a moisturizer to use after using it because it can dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start using whitening products, so i started off with this cheap soap. It smells like phenyl, I just used t once in the morning and went off to work, could fell my face burning and itching. I do apply a good amount of perfume but this phenyl smell was making me feel terrible whole day, It was the worst experience. The ingredients are all chemicals, nothing herbal. Plus they charge 5$ shipping for a 3$ soap. I threw it into the bin. I am still looking for products on the market. I would have tried it a month to see slow results, but the burning,itching and smell are not even worth one time use.</li>
            <li> Did not like this product at all. Made my teenage daughter face break out really bad. This product I do not recommend for ebony skin.:(</li>
            <li> I really thought this soap was a waste but I bought 4 bars so I kept using it.  Today, I was actually quite taken aback by the beautiful deep golden even tone that my skin has developed, across my shoulders, down my arms (there used to be a more distinct tan line down my arms), my back and legs!  I would have to say the trick to this soap is patience and time as you incorporate it into your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:  buy at least 3 bars and commit to using them daily just like your regular soap.  (Lather it up before you get in the shower, let it stay on your skin for a bit before washing it off as other reviewers have said).  Then assess once the 3 bars are up.  I think you&#x27;ll be surprised.  It takes time but it actually works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 4 days now and yes I can see the difference not in change of color since this is not what I want but it is great on toning the skin giving it a supple nice smooth look its hard to describe I just really like this for my face and body feels like a exfoliator and seems to even help my make up look smoother when I apply it!!!</li>
            <li> This product smells pretty good and is easy to store. that is it doesnt get mushy easily. I bought the product to help done up some darker spots on my skin. I really havent notices any changes.</li>
            <li> Lighten skin slightly.</li>
            <li> I am African American and purchased this soap as a hope that it would help me with acne scars. This soap really did nothing for me at all. I used it consistently for a month and no results.</li>
            <li> this stuff does work , but needs to be combined with multiple scrubs and constant moisturising.</li>
            <li> So far its been about a month using this product and it did already start to whiten those dark areas that I have from loosing weight!&lt;br /&gt;Love love love!</li>
            <li> I use the soap every night. It really brightened my skin on my face and body. I was so happy because it was working. After using it for a couple weeks, it doesnt seem to be doing much anymore though. The soap really does dry out your skin. That was really good because my face was very oily before using this product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much and it makes your skin really dry. It made my skin really red and flakey to the point where it itched. I would no recommend.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this stuff after seeing Patricia Bright on the YT rave about how it helped her remove some of her dark spots and discoloration on her face. I went and did some research and went ahead and purchased this. After a week of use, I had to stop using this because it ended up CAUSING discoloration on my face. None of my dark spots were lightened; instead it lightened a small part of my face that had no skin issues at all. I have medium brown skin and the spot is a white color. Hopefully it goes away but I had to stop using it since I’m not sure why it did that.</li>
            <li> Products always arrive days before the expected delivery! I have had skin pigmentation problems the majority of my life and have tried various prescribed and personally purchased products with no avail. I began using this soap last fall and the results have been amazing! The complexion and tone of my skin have improved drastically and the discoloration issues have almost completely subsided!</li>
            <li> I love this product and services are all good thank you</li>
            <li> It got rid of the bad tan that I had and brought me back to my natural skin color. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> What i don&#x27;t like is the smell but is fine is fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 15 and i am tan and It unfortunately didn&#x27;t made me any lighter and even though it&#x27;s medium size, it gets smaller so fast</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF DOES NOT WORK, DON&#x27;T BOTHER WASTING TIME OR MONEY.THIS SOAP ACTUALLY GAVE ME BLACK HEADS AND PIMPLE TOO. I NEVER GOT A PIMPLE IN MY LIFE UNTIL I USED THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California and tan very easily (Vietnamese), so I&#x27;m used to dark skin year round. I first bought Likas at the end of 2011 and decided to hold off my review until I saw the long-term effects of using this soap. The papaya soap DOES work, albeit slowly. There were some periods of time where I could noticeably tell my skin had lightened - but keeping in mind that we always have warm, sunny weather, most of the time Likas wasn&#x27;t enough. I use it twice daily to wash my face and my entire body when I shower. Recently I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my arms or legs, but still like to use the soap frequently. In fact, when I was on vacation and burning to a crisp, I caved in and splurged on another bar (speaking of which - I&#x27;m definitely not pleased to spend twice as much as the actual product on shipping). I would recommend Likas if you&#x27;re hesitant to use harsher methods to whiten skin. You won&#x27;t get dramatic results, but a shade or two paler is pretty good. It&#x27;s very gentle (but be warned, it WILL irritate your face the first few times you use it, so use some moisturizer afterwards) and works well for a soap! At the time of this review, I still have not gone through a complete bar of Likas.</li>
            <li> I love this soap makes my skin look and feel good after I use it.</li>
            <li> Soap is ok, I did find something better, theses soap started to make my face brakeout, can&#x27;t use anymore..Noxema Is way better</li>
            <li> Once again, I love this soap so much! It helps lighten my skin so much. Will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> On my 3rd bar and must say am very impressed with my results . Although it does take some time I can really see the dark spots on my back clear up .</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it lightened my skin but it certainly brightened it. It made my skin clean and fresh. I will definently buy this again.</li>
            <li> Okay,  I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 3 weeks now, maybe 4. I have noticed a great change in the color of my skin as well as texture. It has no smell to it, it doesn&#x27;t burn, and it leaves your skin feeling tight and smoove. I have to say ill be ordering another bar!</li>
            <li> You would have to use this for a long period of time to see results..but you will get them. This also drys out your skin so make sure you apply lotion afterwards...I dont think I will be purchasing again. Found a much better soap and I use this as a backup just in case I run out of the other one and need something to use as I wait for my primary soap to get here.</li>
            <li> Skin has lightened a bit from couple months of use. I will order again soon . I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> This soap dried up my face . My skin saw nooooo change I would not recommend&lt;br /&gt; This to anyone...all I can say itchy</li>
            <li> this product is a joke</li>
            <li> In the description it says whitneing soap but when you receive the product they block out whitening. So it say Herbal Papaya soap, it does not mention its used to whiten the skin. I used this product for more than a month and say small results only very small results. My skin still looks the same I compared it to pictures I took before using the soap and realized their was bearly even a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for close to a year and it doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad bud doesn&#x27;t smell great, either. It leaves your skin feeling rigid. I have not noticed any whitening or lightening. It was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The soap smells good but didn&#x27;t see and difference in skin</li>
            <li> most people are typically skeptical about skin lightening products, but this one i can say works for me.&lt;br /&gt;it takes quiet a while to start recognizing results (with any kinda product it usually does)and it makes your skin extremely dry after you get out of the shower. but all in all its inexpensive and is a great way to lighten your complexion or dark underarms (anything really). just remember to read the directions on the box and i recommend that you get a thing of sunblock that you really like (non oil). if you dont use sunblock when you go outside your skin will be even more sensitive to the sun and you will tan even more than what your previous complexion was. remember, take care of your skin and always wear sunblock!</li>
            <li> Need patience with this product. If you&#x27;re looking for a quick way to lighten your skin, this isn&#x27;t for you. It does work though, just slowly and over time. Down my first bar and I didn&#x27;t see any changes until I finished it. Still going to use this though :)</li>
            <li> It infact did lighten my skin as it said it would&lt;br /&gt; Not an extreme difference, obviously since it is just soap&lt;br /&gt;Was shipped on time and had everything as explained</li>
            <li> This soap should be used to help get you back to your natural tone and to even out your coloring. I had fantastic success, and results in three days. I left the product on my skin for a couple minutes before washing it off, and I made sure to use a lotion in the event it would dry my skin out. This product may make your skin red and irritable, so people with sensitive skin should use with caution. The scent is strong but not unpleasant and does not remain on your skin after use. My package arrived through standard shipping in three business days.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can skip days and get results, make sure to use a strong sunscreen (I use 100 proof from Neutrogena) so you don&#x27;t undo your progress.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, the only reason it&#x27;s not a 5/5 is because of the irritation that I experienced and the lack of information on the packaging regarding the active acid used.</li>
            <li> Odd smell, didn&#x27;t whiten, lighten, or brighten anything after about 4 weeks of use on trouble spots. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> this stuff works make a really ngood lather on your face work it in an rinse pat dry lightly in about awwek you will notice results im sorta carmel complexion now the dark arm pits are gone thank you likas.</li>
            <li> too awhile to see some results but after using it for 14 days, it work great, giving skin color that i wanted</li>
            <li> Its just regular soap.  nothing special</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, but it hasn&#x27;t been helping me though. Maybe, it&#x27;s just not for my skin.</li>
            <li> Seller stuck tape over where it said &#x27;whitening&#x27; on the product, probably because it does nothing to lighten your skin. It does smell nice and leaves your skin feeling soft though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, and there is no result on my skin and may be this product is not the original.</li>
