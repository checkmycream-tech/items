            <li>The one I ordered from seacret makes my skin feel realy nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>$ is just phenomenal.</li>
            <li>It is authentic Seacret product too.</li>
            <li>I have never had a mask that made my skin fell better and look better.</li>
            <li>and this is a much better deal</li>
            <li>So, when it comes to the mud, I can only be impressed.</li>
            <li>I will see a greater change in wrinkles.</li>
            <li>the best it&#x27;s been in a Long time</li>
            <li>You will be hooked because Seacret products are amazing and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Beginning fine lines in the cheeks from smiling.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin this is the perfect product, only 5 minutes and your skin will feel very smooth!!My clients love it!!</li>
            <li>Yes, it means minerals - and its rich.  </li>
            <li>I use it as both scrub and musk not bad at all works well for me and the oil moisturizes my skin</li>
            <li>I bought this in the mall originally but this product at Amazon it works great at a lot less money.</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>Im so lucky</li>
            <li>After the first use I could feel the difference in my skin, it was smooth and well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I guess because it said &amp;#34;Magnetic&amp;#34; but anyway-really did not notice much change and was not as easy to get off as described.  </li>
            <li>this mask got rid of fine lines around my eyes, and on my forehead; it is also very moisturizing and soothing.</li>
            <li>It was fun but as for results or changes, nothing.</li>
            <li>Its nice to pay 30 vs 200 for the same product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;my girlfriend like it very much.</li>
            <li>I use Seacret M4- Mineral-rich Magenetic Mud Mask and make me so younger and love to use it</li>
            <li>cos make me so younger and order it more.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and smooth afterwards</li>
            <li>Love this line, and this product, will definitely use everything from line more in the future!</li>
            <li>While I love the ease of use, it is the way my skin looks when I am finished that will make that a standard in my beauty regimen forever.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>On a recent trip to Israel I became acquainted with Seacret and their amazing products at Quamran near the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>This one broke me out &amp; is very greasy &amp; splotchy.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend like it very much&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;my girlfriend like it very much&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;my girlfriend like it very much&lt;</li>
            <li>Not only is this product fantastic, but buying it for 28$ as opposed to 200</li>
            <li>Although it was ordered from America through Amazon it still was much cheaper than buying in the UK</li>
            <li>The first time I used the mask they were all gone and my skin felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>I think this is just a money maker, the mud magnet trick is quite cool, but the mud also simply sticks to your (&amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34;&amp;#34; fingers if you wipe over it.</li>
            <li>Then this the new level of excellence, the magnetic mud cream.</li>
            <li>First, this is very different than any mask you&#x27;ve ever used before.  </li>
            <li>my skin is so clear</li>
            <li>Threw out your old face masks.  </li>
            <li>Packing look like old box.</li>
            <li>product old maybe?  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft for a week</li>
            <li>This is a fun product to use due to the fact that you have to use a magnet to remove the mud.  </li>
            <li>- you&#x27;ll feel cheated out of half the fun of leaving the oils on for a while.  </li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my face other leaving a soft serum on my face after the mask removal.</li>
            <li>The magnetic mud mask came off with ease and left the skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>did not have same results as buying direct from SEACRET</li>
            <li>Def different from the m4 that i order directly from seacret.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only buying directly from seacret now on.</li>
            <li>and it arrived much quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>Once you use the magnet to remove the  mud it leaves behind the oils which you then massage into your skin leaving it super soft.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, at the same time, not sure what the magnetic mud is really doing for me.  </li>
            <li> The mud mask leaves the skin very soft and well moisturised and hopefully after using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I bought a  similar mask while at the Dead Sea in Israel last year and was desperate to find more when I got home.  </li>
            <li> My face is usually dry and flaky and hasn’t been since I have been using it weekly.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and get very dry patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> after spreading the mask, instead of wiping off you have to place a tissue on your face then use the magnet to wipe it off which i think is not very smart way to remove any product off your face.</li>
            <li> Smell is old product and very dry really hard to put on</li>
            <li> Not worth the price in my opinion</li>
            <li> Other masks require repeated rinsing and often make mess.  </li>
            <li> If I paid the $200 it retails for id be furious but for the price I paid, I was just slightly bummed.</li>
            <li> Buying direct was too expensive.</li>
            <li> It was messy to remove the mud on my face.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference in your skin after 1 use, you can see if after a few weeks, if you use it weekly.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy it as the secret stand are charging $300 for the same product.</li>
            <li> this product is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied this product broke me out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how well this product works.  </li>
            <li> Just like the one in the home sales party I went to but much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if i got an expired one or a fake one?</li>
            <li> and I feel terrible not buying from her, really awful, , but I bought this and 7 other seacret products for LESS than this mud mask costs normally.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately i don&#x27;t notice any difference in my completion and</li>
            <li> whoever designed this is crazy!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have dry skin and get very dry patches on my face.  The first time I used the mask they were all gone and my skin felt so soft.  I will continue using this product as I am amazed at the quality of the mask.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the mall originally but this product at Amazon it works great at a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied this product broke me out. Thus produce did not do what it said it was going to do.</li>
            <li> Hoping the mud mask will work wonders on my 60 + face.  I like buying products from Israel. Buying direct was too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a fun product to use due to the fact that you have to use a magnet to remove the mud.  However, at the same time, not sure what the magnetic mud is really doing for me.  After tje mud is removed, there is a layer of serum/oilmen that&#x27;s left on the face.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting a miracle for the type of product it was-I guess because it said &amp;#34;Magnetic&amp;#34; but anyway-really did not notice much change and was not as easy to get off as described.  I do not think I would purchase again-expensive.</li>
            <li> Super product. Once you use the magnet to remove the  mud it leaves behind the oils which you then massage into your skin leaving it super soft. Love tHis product</li>
            <li> I put the mud mask on my face and literally after I took the mask off my face.  My face felt like it was breathing cleanliness. My pores must have been clogged forever and I noticed a diminshed in my acne scares.  Oh boy I love this stuff.  It is truely amazing.  Please ladies do not pass up this great product.  It really works.  Threw out your old face masks.  Trust me this is it. Instant results.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this is the perfect product, only 5 minutes and your skin will feel very smooth!!My clients love it!! and the price is lower than the seacret website!</li>
            <li> I tried this Mask while on vacation in Israel really liked what it felt like on my hand but didn’t purchase it.  When I got home I did some research and found it.  I love it!  After the first use I could feel the difference in my skin, it was smooth and well moisturized.  My face is usually dry and flaky and hasn’t been since I have been using it weekly.  I would definitely recommend it to family and friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally</li>
            <li> Packing look like old box. Smell is old product and very dry really hard to put on face.&lt;br /&gt;I am not empress with this.</li>
            <li> The magnetic mud mask came off with ease and left the skin feeling soft.  It&#x27;s a great addition to my collection of products I already have.</li>
            <li> this mask got rid of fine lines around my eyes, and on my forehead; it is also very moisturizing and soothing. this is the best mask I have ever used !</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever.  Try it you&#x27;ll feel like it took off 10 years instantly.  Do one side of your face and take a pic after.  You will freak out.</li>
            <li> I use Seacret M4- Mineral-rich Magenetic Mud Mask and make me so younger and love to use it cos make me so younger and order it more.</li>
            <li> If I paid the $200 it retails for id be furious but for the price I paid, I was just slightly bummed. Did absolutely nothing for my face other leaving a soft serum on my face after the mask removal. It was fun but as for results or changes, nothing.</li>
            <li> The only way to remove this magnetic mud mask is thru the use of the magnet enclosed with this order.  My skin felt soft and smooth afterwards but I&#x27;m not sure how well this product works.  It was messy to remove the mud on my face.</li>
            <li> First, this is very different than any mask you&#x27;ve ever used before.  You don&#x27;t wash it off - you take it off with a MAGNET!  Yes, it means minerals - and its rich.  And after you take it off - you may not want to do this mask if you plan to put make up on immediately - you&#x27;ll feel cheated out of half the fun of leaving the oils on for a while.  Some like to use the mask before bed and then put a towel on their pillow.  I prefer to just plan a day when I am not going anywhere - either way, it&#x27;s an experience, not just a mask.</li>
            <li> This is are lie last time I bought is out of date is being used are lying.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy any more</li>
            <li> product old maybe?  did not have same results as buying direct from SEACRET</li>
            <li> Just like the one in the home sales party I went to but much less expensive.  Applies to kiosks sales too</li>
            <li> Not sure if i got an expired one or a fake one? Def different from the m4 that i order directly from seacret. This one broke me out &amp; is very greasy &amp; splotchy. The one I ordered from seacret makes my skin feel realy nice &amp; smooth. Hence the price difference. I learned my lesson &amp; I&#x27;m only buying directly from seacret now on.</li>
            <li> I use it as both scrub and musk not bad at all works well for me and the oil moisturizes my skin</li>
            <li> Everything it claims to do, it does , more than met my expectations !</li>
            <li> Not worth the price in my opinion</li>
            <li> my girlfriend like it very much&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend like it very much&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend like it very much&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend like it very much.</li>
            <li> Great price, great purchase. Was purchased as a gift...recipient received, tried and loves it!!</li>
            <li> Not only is this product fantastic, but buying it for 28$ as opposed to 200$ is just phenomenal. One of my good friends is a Seacret rep and I feel terrible not buying from her, really awful, , but I bought this and 7 other seacret products for LESS than this mud mask costs normally. It was delivered in just a couple days and with free shipping!!!  It is authentic Seacret product too. Leaves skin soft for a week and it&#x27;s just so cool!!!</li>
            <li> I have never had a mask that made my skin fell better and look better.</li>
            <li> Love this line, and this product, will definitely use everything from line more in the future! Cant wait to use again!</li>
            <li> I was totally amazed when I tried this product!  You apply it and then after about 10 minutes you remove it with a magnet!  Leaves moisturizer after you take it off...</li>
            <li> this product is not easy to use.  after spreading the mask, instead of wiping off you have to place a tissue on your face then use the magnet to wipe it off which i think is not very smart way to remove any product off your face. whoever designed this is crazy!  i threw it out and bought Aveda products(cleanser, toner, moisturizeds)instead which i love 100% better than this junk!</li>
            <li> i tried the product but unfortunately i don&#x27;t notice any difference in my completion and for that reason i also feel the product is overpriced.</li>
            <li> a tiempo perfecto de entrega, pienso seguir comprandole a ustedes, los recomiendo 100%. el paquete a la medida porque compre dos productos a la misma tienda</li>
            <li> I think this is just a money maker, the mud magnet trick is quite cool, but the mud also simply sticks to your (&amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34;&amp;#34; fingers if you wipe over it. It did not improve my skin</li>
            <li> I bought a  similar mask while at the Dead Sea in Israel last year and was desperate to find more when I got home.  You put it on and 5 minutes later just wipe it off with the magnet that is included and a tissue.  Other masks require repeated rinsing and often make mess.  While I love the ease of use, it is the way my skin looks when I am finished that will make that a standard in my beauty regimen forever.</li>
            <li> Excellent product great price this stuff is awesome my skin is so clear the best it&#x27;s been in a Long time the price off amazon is so affordable.</li>
            <li> use product for 2 years do not buy at the mall it is over price and this is a much better deal</li>
            <li> This is secrets magic potion!! It sells for over 200.00 retail. Grab this up and see how miraculous it is. Im 35 and now taking an interest in my skin. I began with acne prone skin in my 30&#x27;s! Beginning fine lines in the cheeks from smiling. This product works instantly. Its a must have/try. You will be hooked because Seacret products are amazing and worth every penny. Its nice to pay 30 vs 200 for the same product. Im so lucky</li>
            <li> I am very content of this amazing Seacret M4 Mineral-rich Magnetic Mud Mask and I reccomand to all because it makes miracles, has incredible effects.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! You can feel the difference in your skin after 1 use, you can see if after a few weeks, if you use it weekly.</li>
            <li> The mud soap is great. So, when it comes to the mud, I can only be impressed. Then this the new level of excellence, the magnetic mud cream. It works great on hypo-allergenic skin. It actually reduces some blemishes. Great delivery time. Good job with packaging.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes the skin seem almost FLAWLESS after use!  After using it ONCE, my grandmother asked me &amp;#34;Son, do you have on make-up!?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> On a recent trip to Israel I became acquainted with Seacret and their amazing products at Quamran near the Dead Sea. I&#x27;ve been using them and loving them, but was concerned how to get more. Then I found this company through Amazon. Their service has been amazing, their prices great, and their product arrived over a week before the estimated time of arrival. I&#x27;m sold. I use the Seacret nail products as well as skin care products and now have a great place to get them all. I&#x27;m telling my friends. Thank you! Shalom!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, made my skin feel really good. Will continue to buy it as the secret stand are charging $300 for the same product.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the Seacret magnetic mud mask and also the eye gel and have already recommended them to friends. The mud mask leaves the skin very soft and well moisturised and hopefully after using it for a few weeks I will see a greater change in wrinkles. I am already seeing a change! Although it was ordered from America through Amazon it still was much cheaper than buying in the UK and it arrived much quicker than I expected.</li>
