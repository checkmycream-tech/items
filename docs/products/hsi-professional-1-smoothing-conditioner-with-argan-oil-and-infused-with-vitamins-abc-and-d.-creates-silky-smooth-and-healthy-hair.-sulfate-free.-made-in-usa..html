            <li>It smells amazing and leave your hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>well that is true its not going to create a ton of suds</li>
            <li>In addition (and most importantly), my hair has stopped falling out and new hair has started growing in.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I got this it has been so easy to brush my hair and it has made my hair look so much healthier</li>
            <li>I will add that since I have gone completely sulfate-free on my shampoos (about 4 months now), my hair is in MUCH better condition.  </li>
            <li>Both brands lather well, clean and condition fabulously and smell terrific.  </li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>Love the entire line!</li>
            <li>and I love that it leaves my hair smoother than regular conditioner.</li>

            <li>I can easily de-tangle my hair in the shower or after, and when it dries it&#x27;s definitely softer.</li>
            <li>It works great when applied on either wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>She is all about cruelty free products so this was a double brownie pointer.</li>
            <li>I read reviews that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This shampoo (with the conditioner) makes my hair so shiny and stick straight</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want/need as much conditioning).  </li>
            <li>(after I straighten it lightly) all day long</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and you only need a tiny drop of it.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new go-to set!</li>
            <li>She tells me everyday how much she loves this shampoo and conditioner and how her hair has never been so healthy.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this shampoo, as well as [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Highly recommend HSI Shampoo, Conditioner and Leave-in Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really soft and manageable after use.</li>
            <li>it is rinsed out, my hair did not remain soft, and it tangled easily.&lt;br /&gt;Price; for the amount</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparable product: Herbal Essence Hello Hydration Conditioner; it performs just as well on hair while it&#x27;s in, with the benefit of leaving hair soft and moisturized when it is rinsed out.</li>
            <li>Hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft after using it in conjunction with the shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a vital part of my hair care routine.</li>
            <li>My hair is much thicker (like it used to be when I was younger).  </li>
            <li>I have very curly, dry and tangly hair, and this definitely smooths and conditions it.</li>
            <li>HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER flat iron thermal protector leaves hair silky and shiny 4oz BOTTLE]].8 oz]].  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very big bottle and a little quantity goes a long way, me and my husband we both are using it from last 4 months and the bottle is still almost full.</li>
            <li>I hope that people will at least try it even if you read bad reviews about this because I really don&#x27;t think there is a possibility to have this product cause anything but beautiful hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great and great for my hair. Since I started using this product my hair is fuller and easy to manage. Now when I go to the hairdresser instead of them trying to sell me products they just say keep doing what you&#x27;re doing. After shampoo just leave in your hair 3 to 5 minutes and then rinse.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, coarse, grey/white hair and this conditioner is excellent in for it. My hair is really soft and manageable after use.</li>
            <li> Awesome conditioner. I have the shampoo as well. My hair loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for X-mas. She is all about cruelty free products so this was a double brownie pointer. She tells me everyday how much she loves this shampoo and conditioner and how her hair has never been so healthy. She has EXTREMELY thick course hair and she said that this shampoo is helping to shave time off of her straightening and curling by helping her hair feel thinner and more manageable. I am not going to lie I had to see what all the hype is about. I read reviews that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather very well... well that is true its not going to create a ton of suds however I had no issue massaging it into my hair and it seems to lather a &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; amount. The product makes my wifes hair smell like she just came from the salon. (love it!)</li>
            <li> Really like it! Makes my hair smooth and moisturized!</li>
            <li> Not good!  Leaves hair dry and tangled!  Reviews are inaccurate!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft,healthier,and smell great.Ever since I got this it has been so easy to brush my hair and it has made my hair look so much healthier then what I had before.</li>
            <li> Horrible scent. Can not use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Silky Conditioner!  Great purchase.  I have long hair and am constantly either curling or flat ironing.  This helps to keep my hair nourished and smooth.  I also use HSI oil for after I wash and it&#x27;s a wonderful combination.  Would not be without it.</li>
            <li> About my hair: I have Natural African American hair, texture ranging from 4a -4b; my hair is dense and not very porous.&lt;br /&gt;How I used this product: As a conditioner following a clarifying shampoo, and as a co-wash (conditioner wash). Used product in this manner 3 times each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner feels great while it&#x27;s in your hair&lt;br /&gt;Has nice &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; so that it&#x27;s easy to de-tangle hair while it&#x27;s in&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Look at the ingredients on the bottle; THERE IS NO ARGAN OIL IN THIS PRODUCT! That it boats to have argan oil, argan oil is not listed among the ingredients on the bottle, and I read the ingredients list several times to make sure.&lt;br /&gt;Once it is rinsed out, my hair did not remain soft, and it tangled easily.&lt;br /&gt;Price; for the amount and it&#x27;s average performance, I feel like it is overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparable product: Herbal Essence Hello Hydration Conditioner; it performs just as well on hair while it&#x27;s in, with the benefit of leaving hair soft and moisturized when it is rinsed out.</li>
            <li> In love! best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Smooth &amp; Silky... you will love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner! It is very smooth and you only need a tiny drop of it. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this shampoo - I am a repeat purchaser. This shampoo (with the conditioner) makes my hair so shiny and stick straight (after I straighten it lightly) all day long and I love it. I will buy this forever and ever and ever. Yes. That long.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! My hairdresser recommended something with Argan Oil so did a search on Amazon. I was going to buy the Moroccanoil brand, but this was much cheaper, came with more, had a convenient pump, and most importantly, had great reviews. I have very curly, dry and tangly hair, and this definitely smooths and conditions it. I can easily de-tangle my hair in the shower or after, and when it dries it&#x27;s definitely softer. I liked it so much I got the shampoo as well. The set is great for colored, dry, and/or damaged hair. Perfect to use before straightening or curling my hair. This is definitely my new go-to set!</li>
            <li> Works great! This product is amazing</li>
            <li> Love the entire line!</li>
            <li> Hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft after using it in conjunction with the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Ironically - it seemed that the shampoo made my hair softer BEFORE I put the conditioner in.&lt;br /&gt;Once I explained the issue to HSI - they were kind enough to replace the product - awesome customer service!</li>
            <li> This is my absolutely favorite product, since I started using it I never went to any other conditioner.It smells amazing and leave your hair feeling soft and silky.It&#x27;s a vital part of my hair care routine.It&#x27;s a very big bottle and a little quantity goes a long way, me and my husband we both are using it from last 4 months and the bottle is still almost full.Would highly recommend it.I got this for free as part of promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s sulfate free and I love that it leaves my hair smoother than regular conditioner. I have long blond  hilighted hair and it also has helped (I think) keep the color longer.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite conditioner.  I love the smell and I love the way it makes my hair feel.  It is a very thick and moisturizing conditioner.  I use this conditioner, along with the shampoo from [[ASIN:B004D8T7F4 Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner Liter Combo Set 33.8 oz]].  I like both the Agadir and HSI brands Argan Oil shampoos and conditioners.  The Agadir conditioner is not as thick/heavy as the HSI brand (so I use it on days I don&#x27;t want/need as much conditioning).  Both brands lather well, clean and condition fabulously and smell terrific.  They are both perfect for guys and gals.  NOTE: I only paid $20 for the 32oz size in Dec 2014.    I will add that since I have gone completely sulfate-free on my shampoos (about 4 months now), my hair is in MUCH better condition.  In addition (and most importantly), my hair has stopped falling out and new hair has started growing in.  My hair is much thicker (like it used to be when I was younger).  I falsely believed that those cheaper (and even expensive) shampoos with sulfates were not negatively affecting my hair.  Not until I started noticing my hair thinning and started looking for causes did I realize how sulfates (which I had used my entire life) were affecting my hair.  I will never use a shampoo with sulfates again.  Highly recommend this shampoo, as well as [[ASIN:B004D8T7F4 Agadir Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner Liter Combo Set 33.8 oz]].    I also like [[ASIN:B007Q0WW0S HSI PROFESSIONAL Argan Oil LEAVE IN CONDITIONER flat iron thermal protector leaves hair silky and shiny 4oz BOTTLE]].8 oz]].  It works great when applied on either wet or dry hair.  A little goes a long way.  I use less than 2 drops (on hair slightly longer than shoulder length).  It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.  It also calms the frizzies and fly aways.  I like the HSI oil (which is not 100% argan oil) because it can also be applied on dry hair without leaving it greasy-looking.  When I apply 100% argan oil on my hair when it&#x27;s dry, it leaves my hair greasy/oily looking.    Highly recommend HSI Shampoo, Conditioner and Leave-in Argan Oil.

            <li> This product is a miracle literally and smells so great I have told everyone I know about it because of it making my hair feel and look just like I had just been to a salon and had a Brazilian Blowout done.  I obviously didn&#x27;t so I have told people I don&#x27;t even know who have commented on my hair I hope that people will at least try it even if you read bad reviews about this because I really don&#x27;t think there is a possibility to have this product cause anything but beautiful hair. Thank you for having it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Gill</li>
