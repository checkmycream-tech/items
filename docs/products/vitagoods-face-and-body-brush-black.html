            <li>My daughter loves this and says it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>One of the best face cleaners ever.</li>
            <li>Can we talk about how awesome this spin brush is for the face and body?</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>I think everyone should own one it is great</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it does work.  </li>
            <li>does a good job cleaning my face and not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Better than my Clarisonic</li>
            <li>I guess I don&#x27;t want to tear up my face, but I&#x27;d love to see firmer brushes available for purchase.</li>
            <li>I did not notice anything in terms of pore reduction, but do notice and feel that I am getting a better clean than I would get without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product,  the fresh and clean felling you start getting after using it is amazing and it is gentle enough to not hurt the skin,  the battery situation is not the best but for 30$ it really do not matter.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product; in the beginning it worked amazing for my skin</li>
            <li>BUT I would have given this product 5 stars if the face scrub was clean and the foot scrub didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>I really did love it while it worked.  </li>
            <li>I received mine in April this year and within the first two months the brush got more and more sensitive to the point where it could no longer spin.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to just hand washing my wash, this brush clears my skin so much faster and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very thoroughly and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>My skin actually cleared up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I noticed it and was able to close it back up before any water got</li>
            <li>I really like face and body cleansing brush!</li>
            <li>I messed up the first one)</li>
            <li>Once I used normal AA batteries, it started right up.</li>
            <li>I loved it while it lasted; however, the first time I dropped it in the shower the back opened up, the inside got wet, and it never worked again.  </li>
            <li>I first noticed a change when I shaved after three days of use and noticed that shave was extra smooth, and where I would normally nick myself</li>
            <li>Gives a deep clean</li>
            <li>The new one works very well.</li>
            <li>I use everyday :-)</li>
            <li>I have had the Clairsonic Mia in my wishlist for a while debating whether this type of device actually worked and whether it was worth paying $170 for.  </li>
            <li>Spin brush was in brand new box and came with vitagoods coupon.</li>
            <li>When this similar product went on sale for $35, it was at a price point that I was willing to see.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as waterproof vs water resistance.  </li>
            <li>Skin is extreme soft after using and washes of make up very well, for tanners use vitagood before tanning, tan appears very even after use.</li>
            <li>It is just a very tight fit that you slide off and on when you need to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li>I bought the exact same brush from the Vanity Planet site and still wanted to write a review to potentially warn others.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to add into your daily face cleaning routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten at last 7 uses out of one set of AA&#x27;s so far.</li>
            <li>My first purchase was dead on arrival,  returned for exchange.  </li>

            <li> I put in new batteries and had accidentally purchased two, so I even tried the second brush and in less than a week it had the same result.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face well and the batteries have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the brushes that come with it are VERY soft.</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;ve been using the product daily for a little over a month, and it is still going.  </li>
            <li> Shipping took longer than expected.</li>
            <li> to be clear, neither brush arrived damaged or broken, they wore out with very conscious usage as I had read a review similar to my experience and though skeptical had taken extra care to maintain the brushes.</li>
            <li> I could not find anything from the company that states yea or nay, but from reviewing other reviews, it appears to be water resistant, not water proof.</li>
            <li> The battery housing is not very secure, there isn&#x27;t a tab or lock to keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> ...hands down.</li>
            <li> I tried using Energizer Recharge batteries, but the batteries did not fit to where it would touch the coils.  </li>
            <li> Reviewers who talk about taking a bath usually complain about it not working while those that take showers have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> but I was pretty disappointed with the life span it</li>
            <li> For the $35 price, it is hard to complain about not being rechargeable.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product delivers what it claims. Use it with a face cleanser which suits you (I have a oily skin i use it with benzoyl peroxide topical cream wash). After using it for a month break outs reduces to almost 80-90%. I would highly recommend this to add into your daily face cleaning routine.</li>
            <li> I loved it while it lasted; however, the first time I dropped it in the shower the back opened up, the inside got wet, and it never worked again.  If you have one or buy one, I would duct tape the back on just in case.  I really did love it while it worked.  My skin actually cleared up nicely.  I will get another one, but not this brand.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a budget alternative to the clairsonic. I always wanted to try one of these out. Doesn&#x27;t eat batteries as some of the reviews here say it does. I&#x27;ve gotten at last 7 uses out of one set of AA&#x27;s so far. My only complaint would be the brushes that come with it are VERY soft. I guess I don&#x27;t want to tear up my face, but I&#x27;d love to see firmer brushes available for purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it a lot</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and says it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. My face has definitely gotten clearer after a week of using it. I&#x27;d recommend it. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the brushes already show a little bit of wear after a week of usage.</li>
            <li> Excellent product,  the fresh and clean felling you start getting after using it is amazing and it is gentle enough to not hurt the skin,  the battery situation is not the best but for 30$ it really do not matter.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve have noticed a reduction in breakouts since I started using this.</li>
            <li> One face scrub seemed to be used and the foot scrub broke before me using it. Skin is extreme soft after using and washes of make up very well, for tanners use vitagood before tanning, tan appears very even after use. I would recommend BUT I would have given this product 5 stars if the face scrub was clean and the foot scrub didn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> One of the best face cleaners ever. Really good product. It cleans very thoroughly and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really like face and body cleansing brush! I use everyday :-) I think everyone should own one it is great</li>
            <li> Can we talk about how awesome this spin brush is for the face and body? Better than my Clarisonic...hands down.</li>
            <li> I have had the Clairsonic Mia in my wishlist for a while debating whether this type of device actually worked and whether it was worth paying $170 for.  When this similar product went on sale for $35, it was at a price point that I was willing to see.  Surprisingly it does work.  It may have different results for different people, but I did not see anything physically for a week.  I first noticed a change when I shaved after three days of use and noticed that shave was extra smooth, and where I would normally nick myself, I did not have any nicks.  The next thing I noticed was a reduction in blemishes after a week.  I did not notice anything in terms of pore reduction, but do notice and feel that I am getting a better clean than I would get without it.&lt;br /&gt;As far as waterproof vs water resistance.  I could not find anything from the company that states yea or nay, but from reviewing other reviews, it appears to be water resistant, not water proof. Reviewers who talk about taking a bath usually complain about it not working while those that take showers have no complaints.  On that note though, I think I may have figured out why the company does not advertise it - the battery housing.  The battery housing is not very secure, there isn&#x27;t a tab or lock to keep it in place.  It is just a very tight fit that you slide off and on when you need to replace the batteries. After three weeks of use, the housing started to slide off at the end of my shower.  Luckily I noticed it and was able to close it back up before any water got in.&lt;br /&gt;Power source- the device uses 4 AA batteries, I&#x27;ve been using the product daily for a little over a month, and it is still going.  For the $35 price, it is hard to complain about not being rechargeable.  I can complain that the housing does not seem to take rechargeable AA batteries.  I tried using Energizer Recharge batteries, but the batteries did not fit to where it would touch the coils.  Once I used normal AA batteries, it started right up.</li>
            <li> Great buy. I am very happy with this. It cleans my face well and the batteries have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the second brush I&#x27;ve bought (my fault I messed up the first one) and there&#x27;s a reason I bought another.  I will never go back to just hand washing my wash, this brush clears my skin so much faster and feels great on my skin.  Do your face a favor.</li>
            <li> does a good job cleaning my face and not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li> Shipping took longer than expected. Spin brush was in brand new box and came with vitagoods coupon.</li>

I received mine in April this year and within the first two months the brush got more and more sensitive to the point where it could no longer spin. The moment it touched skin it would stop. I put in new batteries and had accidentally purchased two, so I even tried the second brush and in less than a week it had the same result. I really wanted to like this product; in the beginning it worked amazing for my skin but I was pretty disappointed with the life span it offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be clear, neither brush arrived damaged or broken, they wore out with very conscious usage as I had read a review similar to my experience and though skeptical had taken extra care to maintain the brushes.</li>
            <li> My first purchase was dead on arrival,  returned for exchange.  The new one works very well. Gives a deep clean</li>
