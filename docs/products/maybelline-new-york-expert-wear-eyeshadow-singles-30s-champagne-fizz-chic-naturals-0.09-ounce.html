            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>and this was perfect.</li>
            <li>Beautiful shade.</li>
            <li>Also a great highlighter for under the brow line for night time looks.</li>
            <li>Great eye shadow that I will use also as a highlighter...</li>
            <li>The price is great and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great quality, great price!!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>Nice to find something online</li>
            <li>makes a nice brow highlighter.</li>
            <li>Brilliant, there is a lot of nacre, perfectly lay down on eyelids, aren&#x27;t showered during the day.</li>
            <li>Good product, however the tone is more kinda for the night, as it is very bright, so just have it in mind in case you are searching for more of a day time single shadow</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline&#x27;s eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li>Very much were pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great natural color for use every day.  </li>
            <li>They are consistent and apply write nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s very pretty and elegant on the lid.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse and it is so light that I can wear it at work.</li>
            <li>It has that natural look when you put it on and it works really good with brown eyes.</li>
            <li>this shadow comes with and use my own soft makeup brush to apply this lightly under my eyes, also on the tip of my chin and my noise to do some highlighting and contouring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is nothing special....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Maybelline cosmetics for a long time and they&#x27;re still some of the best products on the market, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I actually have been using this eye-shadow as an under eye brightener for many months!</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and the color is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>And it came super fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so light that it doesn&#x27;t discolor my pale Swedish skin, but it highlights and brightens quite nicely.</li>
            <li>This is a pale opalescent eyeshadow, good for under the brow and around the inside of the tear duct.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really into neutrals right now</li>
            <li>Not real flashy but brightens up my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love to use this on my lid for a little different look.</li>
            <li>I also use it to highlight my inner corners since white looks a bit harsh against my warm toned skin.</li>
            <li>First off, be warned that this product is extremely shimmery, even for a champagne color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish Maybelline would add a small mirror on the back of the package for when one isn&#x27;t at home, but the color is pure Maybelline!</li>

            <li> This eyeshadow is too shimmery, it Also creases a lot and doesn&#x27;t stay on very Long.</li>
            <li> Almost colorless, it would go well with almost any other colors of makeup.  </li>
            <li> I like to just dust it over a base for a subtle sparkle to my eyes, but it can easily be worn as a regular shadow too.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m extremely pale and of Scandinavian descent.</li>
            <li> This color is very shimmery and works well as a base for other colors.</li>
            <li> I put them as base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.</li>

            <li> Love this color! And it came super fast</li>
            <li> smoother; not flaky; goes where wanted w/out spreading when blinking.</li>
            <li> I love this. I use this everyday. It has that natural look when you put it on and it works really good with brown eyes. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love to use this on my lid for a little different look.</li>

            <li> Great natural color for use every day.  Also a great highlighter for under the brow line for night time looks. I wish Maybelline would add a small mirror on the back of the package for when one isn&#x27;t at home, but the color is pure Maybelline!</li>
            <li> Excellent. It was shipped quickly and the color is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I actually have been using this eye-shadow as an under eye brightener for many months! Now, I&#x27;m extremely pale and of Scandinavian descent. This might not work for everyone, but it does for me.&lt;br /&gt;I discard the sponge tipped applicator this shadow comes with and use my own soft makeup brush to apply this lightly under my eyes, also on the tip of my chin and my noise to do some highlighting and contouring.&lt;br /&gt;It is so light that it doesn&#x27;t discolor my pale Swedish skin, but it highlights and brightens quite nicely. I like how the shine gives my complexion a dewy look.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at this as a lid eye-shadow. I can also vouch for Maybelline shadows. I&#x27;ve been using their shadows forever. They are consistent and apply write nicely. The price is great and the quality is good. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great eye shadow that I will use also as a highlighter...</li>
            <li> Color corresponds to the photo. Very much were pleasant. Brilliant, there is a lot of nacre, perfectly lay down on eyelids, aren&#x27;t showered during the day. I put them as base.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is too shimmery, it Also creases a lot and doesn&#x27;t stay on very Long. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a pale opalescent eyeshadow, good for under the brow and around the inside of the tear duct.  Almost colorless, it would go well with almost any other colors of makeup.  Nice to find something online that&#x27;s not available in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This is nothing special....just a champagne eyeshadow.  Get what you pay for.  It actually showed up under the *matte* category, which is what I wanted, but got this ...not matte.  Oh well...I use it and actually like the shadow.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great quality, great price!!</li>
            <li> First off, be warned that this product is extremely shimmery, even for a champagne color.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s very pretty and elegant on the lid. It does show up quite well even without a primer. It doesn&#x27;t clump up or anything. I like to just dust it over a base for a subtle sparkle to my eyes, but it can easily be worn as a regular shadow too. I also use it to highlight my inner corners since white looks a bit harsh against my warm toned skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really into neutrals right now and this was perfect.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade. Not real flashy but brightens up my eyes. I am a nurse and it is so light that I can wear it at work.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be matte finished, and it shimmers, so I will probably send it back.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline&#x27;s eyeshadows.  You cannot beat the price.  This color is very shimmery and works well as a base for other colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline cosmetics for a long time and they&#x27;re still some of the best products on the market, especially for the price. I like the shimmery quality of these eye shadows and the ivory shade makes a nice brow highlighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible. I put it on and i can&#x27;t even tell i have eye shadow on at all. It doesn&#x27;t have any shimmer on it whatsoever.</li>
