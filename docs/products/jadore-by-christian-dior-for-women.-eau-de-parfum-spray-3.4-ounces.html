            <li>she loves it, definitely at top of her perfumes</li>
            <li>I do absolutely love the bottle, but that still does not justify the price for me.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is so sexy, grown up yet playful.</li>
            <li>Love, love, this fragrance on me.</li>
            <li>Free throw!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and the bottle has been lasting for quite some time.</li>
            <li>the price was ok, but there were two site where you can find it chaper...., but they were out....</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS...</li>
            <li>Always get so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>I get many compliments and never tire of it myself.</li>
            <li>Throughout the day I find myself thinking about how WONDERFUL I smell, and that is a nice little pick-me-up.</li>
            <li>but there is a sticker in the bottom of the bottle, the original has no sticker!</li>
            <li>Easy to find at most perfume counters.</li>
            <li>Spells fantastic, I love getting this delievered.</li>
            <li>Love the eau de parfum... Have been wearing this scent since the day it was available.  </li>
            <li>A true masterpiece!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this perfume, Came with original box and price tag on the bottom</li>
            <li>I have a particular type of perfume that smells really good on me.</li>
            <li>It was packaged well and delivered quickly!  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>The price was great for the size but to me it smells differently than it did in the store.  </li>
            <li>What distinguishes this one is that it is light, but it lingers.</li>
            <li>The perfume wasn&#x27;t genuine</li>
            <li>guys, this will definitely make your girlfriend/wife happy.</li>
            <li>AND I GOT A BIG BOTTLE FOR A GREAT PRICE.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is cheap and the paint of the lid scratches off.</li>
            <li>Dior J&#x27;adore is an okay fragrance, but isn&#x27;t anything super special.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have purchased two bottles of the same fragrence on my own!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to say it smells great and stay a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe its an original fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Please go buy the original one.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally for my moms birthday</li>
            <li>It just has a clean scent.</li>
            <li>Nothing special or unique.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S A SPECIAL EDITION</li>
            <li>and she just opened it since she was waiting for a special ocassion...</li>
            <li>but it is not at all one of those sickly sweet varieties.  </li>
            <li>I was gifted this perfume when I was a teenager and fast forward</li>
            <li>scent is light yet powerful.</li>
            <li>but, i enjoyed it so much that im going to buy one for myself aswell.</li>
            <li>The perfume bottle was plastic, which Christian Dior would NEVER BE, and it was even 3/4 of the way full!!!  </li>
            <li>The fragrance everyone will say good things about and you&#x27;ll love the way it smells with little or no effort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I use Super Saver Shipping).</li>
            <li>We recently bought a bottle from the mall and construction of the bottle is different and the smell lasts for over 8 hours vs. about 2 hours from Best Sellers NY.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have absolutely loved this scent since I first purchased it in the Garre du Nord in Paris on my way back to London in 2007!  </li>
            <li>Be considerate and realize that less is more with regard to perfume!!</li>
            <li>Purchased directly from Amazon for a fabulous price!</li>
            <li>My wife smiled big when I gave it to her.</li>
            <li>Worth the $</li>
            <li>Wife loves this brand and price was right.</li>
            <li>and I discovered that the top it&#x27;s not at the same material that the regular bottles and, most importantly, they DON&#x27;T SMELL like J&#x27;Adore Eau de Parfum.</li>
            <li>I wear this scent when I want to feel special, as it is very glamorous.</li>
            <li>real stuff is wonderful this stuff is an epic waste of money.</li>
            <li>It does have decent staying power, but I was expecting a primarily orchid-based fragrance, and this smells very fruity to me for some reason.</li>
            <li>I wear only French perfume because I think the French make the very best perfume.  </li>
            <li>It is different on every woman and on me, it&#x27;s one I receive many compliments on.  </li>
            <li>First off, I did not buy my bottle on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like this Dior fragrance because it is light and floral- not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Be aware of this and go to your mall and buy this product.</li>
            <li>This perfume was much cheaper at amazon in comparison to Macys!  </li>
            <li>This is her favorite and we runs out about the same time every year.  </li>
            <li>WHICH I FIRST GOT</li>
            <li>No bargain--is about the same price as dept stores, but is the authentic product</li>
            <li>I love jadore and have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li>was priced a lot higher than I gave for this item.</li>
            <li>I wished i would have payed attention and opened it when we first got them...</li>
            <li>What a waste of good money and time.</li>
            <li>Packaging was good, although the box was a little large.  </li>
            <li>The scent is sensual but light enough to be fresh.</li>
            <li>The three bottles of J&#x27;Adore, Eau de Parfum Spray from Christian Dior arrived very quickly, but I just opened my three bottles</li>
            <li>This scent is pure heaven.</li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN.</li>
            <li>People beware this is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>my guess is it may be old because the scent is very week.even when i put on more then enough.</li>
            <li>this was my very 1st time using Amazon</li>
            <li>I like the light yet present smell.</li>
            <li>I ONLY WISH THE LOTION WAS AVAILABLE.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal,...</li>
            <li>It is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Please be warned that this product is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>When a perfume is at a discounted rate by 20 or 30% it is probably to good to be true and will be a fake.</li>
            <li>Its notes are considered: floral, fruity, white floral, watery, and sweet.</li>
            <li>bottle itself is a cheap imitation of the real perfume, particles are floating in the bottle, and does NOT smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li>this perfume gives girls my age maturity while giving older women a sense of youth.</li>
            <li>A GIFT EXPENSIVE BUT SMELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and lovely...</li>
            <li>To a fine department store and buy this or any other perfume.</li>
            <li>There is white stuff floating around in the bottle, the bottle seems cheap (uneven, plastic seam lines on the top), and the smell isn&#x27;t the same as I&#x27;ve smelled in the store.  </li>
            <li>It came in original package and was all that I expected.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what I purchased was authentic J&#x27;adore by Dior.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the other reviews, the bottle I received did appear to be right color, but upon wearing the perfume, it&#x27;s clear that it is not the real J&#x27;adore.</li>
            <li>Bought as a birthday present for my wife who is very picky for perfumes.</li>
            <li>The REAL Jadore has specific things on it&#x27;s bottle and this one does not.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was half full because it leaked and the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; had a alcohol/ gasoline like after scent.</li>
            <li>I love several Dior fragrances (Miss Dior, Miss Dior Cherie) and Jadore smells expensive, which I like very much.  </li>
            <li>It is very perfumey and has long lasting power.</li>
            <li>So glad as she was tired of me watching the commercials for it.</li>
            <li>This scent does not last as long as the original one sold in department stores and smells a little differently.</li>
            <li>I am very upset that the deodorant parfum is half the price of the Eau De Parfum Spray.  </li>
            <li>It is much stronger than my previous fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Anyone that left positive feedback must either work for you or never experienced the real Jadore.</li>
            <li>It dries down to a subtle flowery note but it is not at all powdery (like so many floral fragrances).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Dior J&#x27;adore is an okay fragrance, but isn&#x27;t anything super special.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have purchased two bottles of the same fragrence on my own!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say it smells great and stay a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe its an original fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Please go buy the original one.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for my moms birthday</li>
            <li> It just has a clean scent.</li>
            <li> Nothing special or unique.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A SPECIAL EDITION</li>
            <li> and she just opened it since she was waiting for a special ocassion...</li>
            <li> but it is not at all one of those sickly sweet varieties.  </li>
            <li> I was gifted this perfume when I was a teenager and fast forward</li>
            <li> scent is light yet powerful.</li>
            <li> but, i enjoyed it so much that im going to buy one for myself aswell.</li>
            <li> The perfume bottle was plastic, which Christian Dior would NEVER BE, and it was even 3/4 of the way full!!!  </li>
            <li> The fragrance everyone will say good things about and you&#x27;ll love the way it smells with little or no effort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I use Super Saver Shipping).</li>
            <li> We recently bought a bottle from the mall and construction of the bottle is different and the smell lasts for over 8 hours vs. about 2 hours from Best Sellers NY.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have absolutely loved this scent since I first purchased it in the Garre du Nord in Paris on my way back to London in 2007!  </li>
            <li> Be considerate and realize that less is more with regard to perfume!!</li>
            <li> Purchased directly from Amazon for a fabulous price!</li>
            <li> My wife smiled big when I gave it to her.</li>
            <li> Worth the $</li>
            <li> Wife loves this brand and price was right.</li>
            <li> and I discovered that the top it&#x27;s not at the same material that the regular bottles and, most importantly, they DON&#x27;T SMELL like J&#x27;Adore Eau de Parfum.</li>
            <li> I wear this scent when I want to feel special, as it is very glamorous.</li>
            <li> real stuff is wonderful this stuff is an epic waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does have decent staying power, but I was expecting a primarily orchid-based fragrance, and this smells very fruity to me for some reason.</li>
            <li> I wear only French perfume because I think the French make the very best perfume.  </li>
            <li> It is different on every woman and on me, it&#x27;s one I receive many compliments on.  </li>
            <li> First off, I did not buy my bottle on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this Dior fragrance because it is light and floral- not heavy.  </li>
            <li> Be aware of this and go to your mall and buy this product.</li>
            <li> This perfume was much cheaper at amazon in comparison to Macys!  </li>
            <li> This is her favorite and we runs out about the same time every year.  </li>
            <li> WHICH I FIRST GOT</li>
            <li> No bargain--is about the same price as dept stores, but is the authentic product</li>
            <li> I love jadore and have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> was priced a lot higher than I gave for this item.</li>
            <li> I wished i would have payed attention and opened it when we first got them...</li>
            <li> What a waste of good money and time.</li>
            <li> Packaging was good, although the box was a little large.  </li>
            <li> The scent is sensual but light enough to be fresh.</li>
            <li> The three bottles of J&#x27;Adore, Eau de Parfum Spray from Christian Dior arrived very quickly, but I just opened my three bottles</li>
            <li> This scent is pure heaven.</li>
            <li> THANKS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> People beware this is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> my guess is it may be old because the scent is very week.even when i put on more then enough.</li>
            <li> this was my very 1st time using Amazon</li>
            <li> I like the light yet present smell.</li>
            <li> I ONLY WISH THE LOTION WAS AVAILABLE.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal,...</li>
            <li> It is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Please be warned that this product is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> When a perfume is at a discounted rate by 20 or 30% it is probably to good to be true and will be a fake.</li>
            <li> Its notes are considered: floral, fruity, white floral, watery, and sweet.</li>
            <li> bottle itself is a cheap imitation of the real perfume, particles are floating in the bottle, and does NOT smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li> this perfume gives girls my age maturity while giving older women a sense of youth.</li>
            <li> A GIFT EXPENSIVE BUT SMELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and lovely...</li>
            <li> To a fine department store and buy this or any other perfume.</li>
            <li> There is white stuff floating around in the bottle, the bottle seems cheap (uneven, plastic seam lines on the top), and the smell isn&#x27;t the same as I&#x27;ve smelled in the store.  </li>
            <li> It came in original package and was all that I expected.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what I purchased was authentic J&#x27;adore by Dior.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviews, the bottle I received did appear to be right color, but upon wearing the perfume, it&#x27;s clear that it is not the real J&#x27;adore.</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday present for my wife who is very picky for perfumes.</li>
            <li> The REAL Jadore has specific things on it&#x27;s bottle and this one does not.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was half full because it leaked and the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; had a alcohol/ gasoline like after scent.</li>
            <li> I love several Dior fragrances (Miss Dior, Miss Dior Cherie) and Jadore smells expensive, which I like very much.  </li>
            <li> It is very perfumey and has long lasting power.</li>
            <li> So glad as she was tired of me watching the commercials for it.</li>
            <li> This scent does not last as long as the original one sold in department stores and smells a little differently.</li>
            <li> I am very upset that the deodorant parfum is half the price of the Eau De Parfum Spray.  </li>
            <li> It is much stronger than my previous fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Anyone that left positive feedback must either work for you or never experienced the real Jadore.</li>
            <li> It dries down to a subtle flowery note but it is not at all powdery (like so many floral fragrances).  </li>
            <li> One spray will last you all day long.</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long when put on</li>
            <li> Apparently no one has ever explained the difference between body mist and perfume.  </li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Wife thought the smell didn’t last long.</li>
            <li> Also,the smell does not last as long.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement since my last bottle was almost empty.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail as expected and was everything I expected overall</li>
            <li> It left a greasy film on my skin and didn&#x27;t smell as fragrant as a previous bottle I purchased at Dillard&#x27;s about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> So I must use little tiny sprays which go a longggggg way.</li>
            <li> Then on the 9th day after expected time, I get a notice stating, &amp;#34;last chance to claim&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Speedy service, proprly packed - not much else to say!</li>
            <li> I worried about it due to the below zero temp.  </li>
            <li> I was upset due to the fact I never&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li> Take heed to other customer reviews and don&#x27;t be persuaded by the sticker price.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I very carefully, in this PC world of ours, inquired what she wore, she told me, and I got some for my sweetie.  </li>
            <li> My roommate wants to smell expensive</li>
            <li> so she sprays this crap more than 9 times all over herself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing J&#x27;Adore for years and this one seems watered down.</li>
            <li> I gave this average perfume an average rating of 3 stars since it&#x27;s definitely not a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> You only need about 3 sprays, one behind each ear and one on the decolletage and the fragrance lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> order came within a few days just as promised.</li>
            <li> years later I am still addicted to this perfume.</li>
            <li> the bottle was off, looked old and fake, and the smell lets not even talk about it...</li>
            <li> Its expensive, but a little spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for Christmas, and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of her, if not, favorite perfumes in the world&lt;</li>
            <li> not a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Not a reputable company as I thought I was ordering from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from a department store however decided to buy from amazon.</li>
            <li> and I knew instantly it was fake.  </li>
            <li> complete disappointment...</li>
            <li> Invest in the eau de parfum and try out the essence version if you like to wear it very heavy as I do.</li>
            <li> this is a fake product, not really Dior</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this at least weekly</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is an average, stereotypical floral scent.</li>
            <li> It is ridiculously overpriced.</li>
            <li> i have been using jadore for 14 years and this is a bad joke, the bottle and the soap smell and the overall experience  </li>
            <li> Smells horrible, color of perfume isn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad that I wasted $80.</li>
            <li> I do not see how anyone could dislike this, although some people find it mature, too cloying, or boring.</li>
            <li> It smells expensive.  </li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with either the product or the seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4 years later, still drives me crazy, get it!!!</li>
            <li> The product that was sent to me seems to be a fake.  </li>
            <li> You should be REQUIRED to inform your potential customers that you are selling a FAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a fake and amazon should be ashamed of pushing this fake on everyone.</li>
            <li> They are fake.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re thinking \\&quot;wtf is this guy</li>
            <li> I think its a fake..</li>
            <li> Perfume is fake.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to be a fake. :(</li>
            <li> /stands as I&#x27;m very wary of fakes.</li>
            <li> i wish i could give it 0 stars, bad customer service, bad everything ,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, as it was a Christmas gift from my husband.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed in Amazon for not kicking you off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is a fake product, not really Dior</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite perfume! I love Jadore! It came in the mail as expected and was everything I expected overall</li>
            <li> The fragrance everyone will say good things about and you&#x27;ll love the way it smells with little or no effort.</li>
            <li> I loved how this product smelled on the shelves in the store.  I chose to wait and order it online.  The price was great for the size but to me it smells differently than it did in the store.  It still smells good it&#x27;s just slightly different in scent and color than I remember.</li>
            <li> There are many beautiful scents out there. What distinguishes this one is that it is light, but it lingers. I get compliments on this at least weekly and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift about two years ago and its absolutely wonderful. The scent is heavenly! Since then, I have purchased two bottles of the same fragrence on my own!</li>
            <li> Got it at a christmas present for my mom she likes its it came authentic and with no problems she happy so im happy</li>
            <li> Dior J&#x27;adore is an okay fragrance, but isn&#x27;t anything super special. It does have decent staying power, but I was expecting a primarily orchid-based fragrance, and this smells very fruity to me for some reason.</li>
            <li> This scent is beautiful and you will always get compliments.  It smells expensive.  But, there are alot of fakes out there.  Go to the department stores instead.  They have valuable gift sets this time of year.</li>
            <li> The perfume wasn&#x27;t genuine</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Will by perfume again.&lt;br /&gt;It was for my daughter,she is French and she like it</li>
            <li> My wife loves, loves, loves it.... So glad as she was tired of me watching the commercials for it.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with either the product or the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speedy service, proprly packed - not much else to say!</li>
            <li> 4 years later, still drives me crazy, get it!!!</li>
            <li> A good perfume but, not as good as the original.  No longer one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend of mind.  She will love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and we both love it!! It came in original package and was all that I expected. I would definitley buy this perfum again!</li>
            <li> The product that was sent to me seems to be a fake.  There is white stuff floating around in the bottle, the bottle seems cheap (uneven, plastic seam lines on the top), and the smell isn&#x27;t the same as I&#x27;ve smelled in the store.  I&#x27;m mad that I wasted $80.</li>
            <li> it finally arrived!!!! It was the post office&#x27;s fault.  I worried about it due to the below zero temp.  For over a week I kept checking the mail box.  Then on the 9th day after expected time, I get a notice stating, &amp;#34;last chance to claim&amp;#34;  I was upset due to the fact I never&lt;br /&gt;got any notices at all!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. The scent is sensual but light enough to be fresh. One spray will last you all day long. Throughout the day I find myself thinking about how WONDERFUL I smell, and that is a nice little pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> This seller is a thief! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. The color is off and the scent is off. It has the smell and staying power of dollar store perfume&lt;br /&gt;The real stuff is wonderful this stuff is an epic waste of money.</li>
            <li> I personally like the way it smells so I brought it for my wife and she love it, smell just as she like her perfume.  Can&#x27;t find it in some stores.</li>
            <li> The three bottles of J&#x27;Adore, Eau de Parfum Spray from Christian Dior arrived very quickly, but I just opened my three bottles and I discovered that the top it&#x27;s not at the same material that the regular bottles and, most importantly, they DON&#x27;T SMELL like J&#x27;Adore Eau de Parfum. I&#x27;m very disappointed. All this for 80 $ the bottle !!!!!! What to do now?</li>
            <li> Not OEM. It smells the same but the quality isn&#x27;t the same. Smell doesn&#x27;t last long when put on</li>
            <li> MY SISTER SEEMS TO LIKE THE GIFT THAT I BOUGHT HER.  I DIDN&#x27;T REALIZE THAT THE JADORE BY DIOR PARFUM THAT I PURCHASED ALSO HAD SPARKLING GLITTER IN THE BOTTLE.  I GUESS IT&#x27;S A SPECIAL EDITION ONE OR SOMETHING.  ANYWAYS, THE SELLER SHIPPED ON TIME AS PROMISED SO THAT IT WAS UNDER OUR TREE ON CHRISTMAS MORNING!  I WOULD ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.  THANKS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Spells fantastic, I love getting this delievered.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be a fake. :( I&#x27;m so disappointed, as it was a Christmas gift from my husband. I&#x27;ve been wearing J&#x27;Adore for years and this one seems watered down. It doesn&#x27;t hold the scent.</li>
            <li> delivered as promissed</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for Christmas, and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of her, if not, favorite perfumes in the world&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing! I highly recommend it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have absolutely loved this scent since I first purchased it in the Garre du Nord in Paris on my way back to London in 2007!  It&#x27;s fresh, delicious, sexy and sophisticated, with out the spice!  I also love the velvety lotion or body milk!  It was packaged well and delivered quickly!  I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviews, the bottle I received did appear to be right color, but upon wearing the perfume, it&#x27;s clear that it is not the real J&#x27;adore. Take heed to other customer reviews and don&#x27;t be persuaded by the sticker price.</li>
            <li> i absolutly love it, i love the scent, its made with oil so you can smell it longer... but watch out it may stain clothes because of the oil..</li>
            <li> Great Product... I love it</li>
            <li> Wife loves this brand and price was right.</li>
            <li> Great perfume and great buy.  I would recommend to anyone.  It will last forever and ever and ever.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> This product buy the gift for Valentine&#x27;s Day to my wife, and already using. Est wonder, very happy. The product is very good, I recommend it 100%, Greetings ...</li>
            <li> got this for my wife for valentine&#x27;s, the costliest perfume i&#x27;ve purchased for her. she loves it, definitely at top of her perfumes</li>
            <li> \\&quot;FRAUD!!!!! The item is shipped it what appears to be a real Jadore box but the perfume if a poor rendition of the real Jadore. You should be REQUIRED to inform your potential customers that you are selling a FAKE!!!! Highly disappointed in Amazon for not kicking you off. Anyone that left positive feedback must either work for you or never experienced the real Jadore. DONT FALL FOR THIS SCAM!!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My roommate wants to smell expensive so she sprays this crap more than 9 times all over herself.  Apparently no one has ever explained the difference between body mist and perfume.  It is strong!!!! Be considerate and realize that less is more with regard to perfume!!</li>
            <li> People beware this is not the real thing. This product is a fake and amazon should be ashamed of pushing this fake on everyone. What a waste of good money and time. Go. To a fine department store and buy this or any other perfume. They are fake.</li>
            <li> Love the eau de parfum... Have been wearing this scent since the day it was available.  Long lasting and lovely...Purchased directly from Amazon for a fabulous price!</li>
            <li> product complies with the specifications&lt;br /&gt;no to claims&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend to all</li>
            <li> This is a very sexy, feminine scent.  It is a floral fragrance but it is not at all one of those sickly sweet varieties.  I wear only French perfume because I think the French make the very best perfume.  This is a perfect example.  You only need about 3 sprays, one behind each ear and one on the decolletage and the fragrance lasts all day.  It dries down to a subtle flowery note but it is not at all powdery (like so many floral fragrances).  It is different on every woman and on me, it&#x27;s one I receive many compliments on.  I love several Dior fragrances (Miss Dior, Miss Dior Cherie) and Jadore smells expensive, which I like very much.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than cheap perfume.  Consider the purchase of Jadore an investment and one that you can reap the benefits of every day.  Great perfume is a woman&#x27;s best accessory.  I definitely recommend Jadore.</li>
            <li> i have been using jadore for 14 years and this is a bad joke, the bottle and the soap smell and the overall experience  i wish i could give it 0 stars, bad customer service, bad everything , do not order. I am so upset that amazon allows this</li>
            <li> sem duvida, um dos melhoressss.</li>
            <li> First off, I did not buy my bottle on Amazon. It is ridiculously overpriced. Also, beware of knock-offs and imitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now onto the perfume. This scent is pure heaven. It has a very bright, luminous, luxurious, sensual, happy, and confident scent, full of sunshine and love. I wear this scent when I want to feel special, as it is very glamorous. I do not see how anyone could dislike this, although some people find it mature, too cloying, or boring. It is very perfumey and has long lasting power. A true masterpiece! Its notes are considered: floral, fruity, white floral, watery, and sweet. I just love this perfume!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the best word I can use to describe J&#x27;adore: &amp;#34;Blah&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve yet to find out what the big deal is with this perfume. In my opinion this is an average, stereotypical floral scent. Nothing special or unique. I do absolutely love the bottle, but that still does not justify the price for me. I gave this average perfume an average rating of 3 stars since it&#x27;s definitely not a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I like this Dior fragrance because it is light and floral- not heavy.  It is my favorite. Easy to find at most perfume counters.</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes out there. You will love it!</li>
            <li> I am sure this product is really fake. It smells very different from the same perfume I brought from macy&#x27;s. The package is also low quality that</li>
            <li> I bought this from a nordstrom (not amazon) and use it as my car&#x27;s air freshener. I know, I know.. you&#x27;re thinking \\&quot;wtf is this guy thinking\\&quot;. But hey, the point is.. It smells amazing. Ladies, this will definitely attract whatever guy you&#x27;re trying to impress and guys, this will definitely make your girlfriend/wife happy. I&#x27;m 21 and I&#x27;d have to say.. this perfume gives girls my age maturity while giving older women a sense of youth.</li>
            <li> My wife smiled big when I gave it to her. Enough said!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this Parfum Spray for my mother. Wow! I got it within 4 days&lt;br /&gt;(I use Super Saver Shipping). I&#x27;d like to say it smells great and stay a long time. Thanks, amazon for great shopping!</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3.4 ounces Eau De Parfum Spray and received 3.4 ounces of Deodorant Parfum instead.  I am very upset that the deodorant parfum is half the price of the Eau De Parfum Spray.  Be aware of this and go to your mall and buy this product.</li>
            <li> not a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume on a woman and I loved it.  So of course I had to purchase some.  It is much stronger than my previous fragrance.  So I must use little tiny sprays which go a longggggg way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement since my last bottle was almost empty. SO, I have used this perfume for years and I know what it should smell like, feel like, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order came within a few days just as promised. However, upon opening it and spraying it, it was oily. It left a greasy film on my skin and didn&#x27;t smell as fragrant as a previous bottle I purchased at Dillard&#x27;s about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon further inspection, the bottle was mailed standard USPS from a Julio Flores of Elizabeth NJ. Not a reputable company as I thought I was ordering from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what I purchased was authentic J&#x27;adore by Dior. To all future buyers, BEWARE!</li>
            <li> i had smelled the scent before and used it before. my guess is it may be old because the scent is very week.even when i put on more then enough. this was my very 1st time using Amazon and i would like to return it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy.  My wife love this perfume and this offer is really good, I think is a nice gift, and is the original product</li>
            <li> I always come back to J&#x27;Adore. I pray it doesn&#x27;t become like Giorgio and go out of style. I like the light yet present smell. It is so sexy, grown up yet playful. It just has a clean scent. I prefer parfum over e toillette but I am sure that is good as well.</li>
            <li> Love, love, this fragrance on me. However it doesn&#x27;t last long. I don&#x27;t believe its an original fragrance.  Will repurchase only with Dior.com.</li>
            <li> I bought for my wife because I knew this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Always come home to remind me of this frangancia.&lt;br /&gt;Very good that frangrancia.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my wife when I noticed it on a co-worker...I very carefully, in this PC world of ours, inquired what she wore, she told me, and I got some for my sweetie.  We are both very pleased with it...highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> About the product, it&#x27;s excellent! the perfum is really awesome, high recommended. I&#x27;m not rating 5 stars because it came without the spray buttom and I had to buy it in a store. Seller problem.</li>
            <li> This perfume was much cheaper at amazon in comparison to Macys!  A stronger scent than I am used to, but I Ike it!  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My friend asked for this as a Christmas gift, a tantilizing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Packaging was good, although the box was a little large.  This is her favorite and we runs out about the same time every year.  Free throw!</li>
            <li> Jadore is GREAT!!! I have a particular type of perfume that smells really good on me. This was one of them. Its expensive, but a little spray goes a long way. Worth the $</li>
            <li> Very good gift for wife, I will buy it more! Jadore By Christian Dior For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray</li>
            <li> OMG This is the best fragrance ever ! The service wast perfect ! I&#x27;m laid up because of hip surgery and can&#x27;t get out so the delivery was in great timing ! Pricing was fine too since I&#x27;m not working !</li>
            <li> Product arrived in time for X-Mas. Girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> The best perfume I have had. Before Jadore, I have never received compliments for perfume before. It&#x27;s wonderful and the bottle has been lasting for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Bought this in 2012 from Best Sellers NY. Wife thought the smell didn’t last long. We recently bought a bottle from the mall and construction of the bottle is different and the smell lasts for over 8 hours vs. about 2 hours from Best Sellers NY. Recommend purchasing from your local retailer.</li>
            <li> i bought this parfum as a gift to my wife....she loves it...the price was ok, but there were two site where you can find it chaper...., but they were out....</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS...AND I GOT A BIG BOTTLE FOR A GREAT PRICE.  I ONLY WISH THE LOTION WAS AVAILABLE.  I HAVE YET TO FIND THAT EVEN IN THE DEPARTMENT STORES.  BUT I HAVE MY PERFUME WHICH I FIRST GOT AS A GIFT EXPENSIVE BUT SMELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li> As always - the best of the best!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing J&#x27;adore for years now -- it is my signature scent.  Always get so many compliments on it.  The product came in perfect condition and on time.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> No bargain--is about the same price as dept stores, but is the authentic product</li>
            <li> The bottle is cheap and the paint of the lid scratches off. The bottle was half full because it leaked and the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; had a alcohol/ gasoline like after scent. Not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I love jadore and have been using it for several years. I get many compliments and never tire of it myself. Invest in the eau de parfum and try out the essence version if you like to wear it very heavy as I do. I&#x27;ve never purchased it through amazon or generic perfume stores/stands as I&#x27;m very wary of fakes.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Love the smell of this perfume, Came with original box and price tag on the bottom was priced a lot higher than I gave for this item. Very satisfied with the seller:)</li>
            <li> I was gifted this perfume when I was a teenager and fast forward years later I am still addicted to this perfume. As with any name brand thing I advise it is best to buy in the department store. When a perfume is at a discounted rate by 20 or 30% it is probably to good to be true and will be a fake. However, with any perfume purchase I do it at a department store.&lt;br /&gt;This scent is light yet powerful. One spray on your wrists will excude the smell throughout the day. Perfect for a special night.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal,... It does NOT say &amp;#34;Eau de toilette&amp;#34; on it,... It is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Please go buy the original one. This scent does not last as long as the original one sold in department stores and smells a little differently.</li>
            <li> this is ~~eau the parfum~~ and there is ~~voile de parfum~~. i bought this one thinking that is voile de parfum. no prblem. thks.</li>
            <li> Beyond my expectations. The smell is beautiful and lasted throughout the day. Definitely will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday present for my wife who is very picky for perfumes. She liked it so it must be good.</li>
            <li> NO RECOMIENDO ESTE VENDEDOR COMPRE UN PERFUME  RESULTO UNA IMITACION  DE MUY MALA CALIDAD DE PASO ME LLEGO MEDIO FRASCO</li>
            <li> I think its a fake.. :/ I usually buy it from a department store however decided to buy from amazon. THe bottle LOOKS the same but there is a sticker in the bottom of the bottle, the original has no sticker! Also,the smell does not last as long.</li>
            <li> Perfume is fake.  Smells horrible, color of perfume isn&#x27;t right.  The REAL Jadore has specific things on it&#x27;s bottle and this one does not.  DON&#x27;T purchase!</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my mom. Her reaction was: its an amazing perfume!</li>
            <li> This arrived at my door two days later than promised.  When I opened the package, the box was white and silver (not white and gold) and the perfume was not J&#x27;adore.  I have been wearing this perfume for years and I knew instantly it was fake.  The perfume bottle was plastic, which Christian Dior would NEVER BE, and it was even 3/4 of the way full!!!  DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mother months ago and she just opened it since she was waiting for a special ocassion...what a surprise..the bottle was off, looked old and fake, and the smell lets not even talk about it...I wished i would have payed attention and opened it when we first got them...complete disappointment...</li>
            <li> This sent is absolutely the best. I bought this originally for my moms birthday but, i enjoyed it so much that im going to buy one for myself aswell.</li>
            <li> Please be warned that this product is not the real deal. DO NOT ORDER from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself is a cheap imitation of the real perfume, particles are floating in the bottle, and does NOT smell like the real thing.</li>
