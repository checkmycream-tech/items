            <li>Nice gift for my aunt who kept buying it.</li>
            <li>nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice perfume, would recommend</li>
            <li>Nice price.</li>
            <li>liked the scent , light and pleasant would recommend to friends also i will be purchasing it again for myself .</li>
            <li>The product comes in good state but not with many protection because I bought another products like these and came with more protection</li>
            <li>I feel that it is appropriate for all ages, though is probably more popular among women under 30.</li>
            <li>All Curves scents smell really good and leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I tried this out without having smelled it first since the price was great</li>
            <li>Good product quick shipping......</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but too strong.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is ok if you&#x27;re looking for a more floral scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells ok if floral is what you are after.  </li>
            <li>in cute metal box.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and I have used a third of it already.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I absolutely love Curve Crush, and for some reason, I thought it would be &amp;#34;special&amp;#34;, like Crush...</li>
            <li>I found this scent years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>it has a light touch which is nice.</li>
            <li>Thankfully my wife was more forgiving  and understanding about the damaged Curve lid..</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mix of dewy star fruit, exotic florals, sun-kissed woods, honeysuckle, ginger orchid, plumeria, hibiscus, passion flower, raspberry juice, lilies, sandalwood, driftwood, amber and musk.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I AM GLAMMING UP MY FEMININE CHARACTER LOVE</li>
            <li>just love it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent on my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of being a teenager and feeling sexy and carefree.</li>
            <li>it reminds me of a baby powder sent which I love</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic too, so I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!</li>
            <li>i love this..</li>
            <li>My sister fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>This cologne became my favorite.</li>
            <li>They love it too.</li>
            <li>any case, I love it.</li>
            <li>Best price, such a deal here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It lasts through most of the day.</li>
            <li>I think Curve Crush is a nicer scent, many compliments on that when I do wear it.</li>
            <li>My wife and i love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Item was as described, i love curve</li>
            <li>but it is SO overwhelming</li>
            <li>amazon did great here with price and size..not to sweet, not to bold..</li>
            <li>I love this EDT, it is fresh, smell very good and not expensive.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful soft fruity floral scent.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to find some online :-)</li>
            <li>and I wore the original Curve for years as a favorite (which it is nothing like).</li>
            <li>I like the scent it isn&#x27;t a strong smell</li>
            <li>so if you does not like strong smell</li>
            <li>We both love the scent, it is not over bearing but slichtly sweet.</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; arrived on expected delivery date :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great fragrance, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and feminine - a winning combination for me and my sweetie.</li>
            <li>It smells like a fantastic tropical summer.</li>
            <li>It smells to me like a cheap perfume you would buy at a discount store, sort of like a knock off.</li>
            <li>I read all the other reviews and thought that this would be great since I love the crush sent, but it just was not for me.</li>
            <li>Very clean scent like you&#x27;re fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a really strong bold scent, this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE TOTALLY GOT MY MY</li>
            <li>i was so excited .</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and the price is great</li>
            <li>It smells tropical and clean.</li>
            <li>it was like a sweet citrus grape fruit send with a clean almost baby powder mix to it.</li>
            <li>really wanted to love this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent,</li>
            <li>but again I noticed it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>i love the smell its very summery and fresh</li>
            <li>i love the scent, and glad I can actually find it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering,is a light pretty scent and comes in a storage tin.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty floral.</li>
            <li>Beautiful bottle and can, HOWEVER the lid was bent in a few places</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments, very young scent.</li>
            <li>$$$$$$$S WORTH.</li>
            <li>After receiving it I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what the other buyers were thinking but this perfume is ok.</li>
            <li>It smells nothing like the original Curve (I didn&#x27;t really expect it to, but...)</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li>WELL THIS IS MY FIRST DAY</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more if this.</li>
            <li>It smells soooo pretty.</li>
            <li>Fave Curve perfume out of the whole bunch!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for a casual night, going out with friends...</li>
            <li>It lasts really long and is sure to grab the attention of others when you enter the room.</li>
            <li>There is not too many like this one, I looked for it high and low.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, just enough of beauty.</li>
            <li>IRONIC IN MY PERSPECTIVE B/C</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really matter anyways because she didn&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>and it was just too much</li>
            <li>One of the other reviews mentioned that it&#x27;s more like a knock-off of another scent or a discount store item.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over excited about this product I just can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what this perfume would smell like, but based on the other reviews I thought I give it a try.</li>
            <li>is also a decent size so it will last a long time Overall its a great buy</li>
            <li>smells really good... last long !!!!!</li>
            <li>She said it smelled like something an older lady would wear</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s an older style smell</li>
            <li>just the right amount of fragrance..would recommend for teen thru elderly..</li>
            <li>To me the Curve Crush lasts a lot longer but its a little more over powerful sweet smell which I usually use on nights going out.</li>
            <li>I only use it on special occassions because it was always so hard to find at a store, so I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li>the cologne was in doesn&#x27;t appear to be in new condition.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance by Liz Claiborne, i received a small sample of this</li>
            <li>AND IT SMELLS CLASSY.</li>
            <li>I was concerned it would smell like an old lady floral perfume</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I put a little small drop and it is good</li>
            <li>but it fades so quickly within a few hours for me</li>
            <li>Fresh like spring, but it&#x27;s not sweet.</li>
            <li>I bought previously from Mall that one was real!</li>
            <li>It has a sweet subtle and clear scent.</li>
            <li>I thougth it might retain some of the original &amp;#34;curveness&amp;#34; if you know what I mean.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> i love the scent, and glad I can actually find it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering,is a light pretty scent and comes in a storage tin.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty floral.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle and can, HOWEVER the lid was bent in a few places</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments, very young scent.</li>
            <li> $$$$$$$S WORTH.</li>
            <li> After receiving it I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what the other buyers were thinking but this perfume is ok.</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like the original Curve (I didn&#x27;t really expect it to, but...)</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li> WELL THIS IS MY FIRST DAY</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more if this.</li>
            <li> It smells soooo pretty.</li>
            <li> Fave Curve perfume out of the whole bunch!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for a casual night, going out with friends...</li>
            <li> It lasts really long and is sure to grab the attention of others when you enter the room.</li>
            <li> There is not too many like this one, I looked for it high and low.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, just enough of beauty.</li>
            <li> IRONIC IN MY PERSPECTIVE B/C</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really matter anyways because she didn&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> and it was just too much</li>
            <li> One of the other reviews mentioned that it&#x27;s more like a knock-off of another scent or a discount store item.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over excited about this product I just can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what this perfume would smell like, but based on the other reviews I thought I give it a try.</li>
            <li> is also a decent size so it will last a long time Overall its a great buy</li>
            <li> smells really good... last long !!!!!</li>
            <li> She said it smelled like something an older lady would wear</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an older style smell</li>
            <li> just the right amount of fragrance..would recommend for teen thru elderly..</li>
            <li> To me the Curve Crush lasts a lot longer but its a little more over powerful sweet smell which I usually use on nights going out.</li>
            <li> I only use it on special occassions because it was always so hard to find at a store, so I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li> the cologne was in doesn&#x27;t appear to be in new condition.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance by Liz Claiborne, i received a small sample of this</li>
            <li> AND IT SMELLS CLASSY.</li>
            <li> I was concerned it would smell like an old lady floral perfume</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I put a little small drop and it is good</li>
            <li> but it fades so quickly within a few hours for me</li>
            <li> Fresh like spring, but it&#x27;s not sweet.</li>
            <li> I bought previously from Mall that one was real!</li>
            <li> It has a sweet subtle and clear scent.</li>
            <li> I thougth it might retain some of the original &amp;#34;curveness&amp;#34; if you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I never knew of any other curve brand besides the men because the only one I ever see sold at stores near me is the Curve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other perfumes since I couldn&#x27;t always find this at the store, but never liked them near as much.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt last as long as the Curve Crush.</li>
            <li> AND LAST A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> A scent that I can wear all season long!</li>
            <li> + it lasts for a very long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bland, generic cologne.  </li>
            <li> , I bought it for my wife because she has a soft, delicate scent.</li>
            <li> Wave is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> As I expected.  </li>
            <li> was not as I expected</li>
            <li> have had alot of trouble finding this perfume in our local stores..</li>
            <li> /&gt;As described and as expected, Reccommednded!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in a timely manner</li>
            <li> so had i been giving this to sum1 as a gift it would have seriously dampened the wow factor.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not real!</li>
            <li> If you &#x27;ve purchased any of the other Curves scents then you need to buy this one as well.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it had leaked all over, it had a fracture in the bottle enough for a slow leak.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if the sent lasted longer and believe me I spray myself down with it</li>
            <li> I feel a little playful when I wear this scent.  </li>
            <li> I wanted this one to get my everyday use perfume</li>
            <li> I am picky about my perfumes (I do not care for fruity or vanilla scents but also do not life perfumes with overpowering woodsy scents or the sometimes heavy scent of tuberose.</li>
            <li> a gift a few years ago and have searched all over for it since then is not sold in any stores i have been to</li>
            <li> Or at least when I would spray it</li>
            <li> Also it came late</li>
            <li> This has a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> this is not a good parfum for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t fake.  </li>
            <li> I have tons of fragrances in my collection, from inexpensive to very expensive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, you just have to be into freshy floral.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, per se...</li>
            <li> I purchased it as a gift so was disappointed in the condition.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This fragrance is ok if you&#x27;re looking for a more floral scent.  It smells nothing like the original Curve (I didn&#x27;t really expect it to, but...) I thougth it might retain some of the original &amp;#34;curveness&amp;#34; if you know what I mean.  This could just be any floral type perfume.  It smells ok if floral is what you are after.  It&#x27;s not my bag though.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, you just have to be into freshy floral.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you are thinking it smells ANYTHING like regular Curve.  It doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nice gift for my aunt who kept buying it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is definately for the summertime.It&#x27;s not overpowering,is a light pretty scent and comes in a storage tin.My husband said it smells good but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone over 30,unless your personality and clothing style are like Forever 21 status lol</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
            <li> Love it, price, size, and smell!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!! Haven&#x27;t been able to find this stuff in stores in my area in over 8 years! Was so excited to find some online :-) same smell as I remember it to be :-)&lt;br /&gt;Came in cute metal box. Works perfectly and I have used a third of it already.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I absolutely love Curve Crush, and for some reason, I thought it would be &amp;#34;special&amp;#34;, like Crush...a wonderful scent that always gets compliments whenever I wear it.  Wave is not what I expected.  It&#x27;s not a bad scent, just not one I will wear or order again.  One of the other reviews mentioned that it&#x27;s more like a knock-off of another scent or a discount store item.  I agree.  It&#x27;s a bland, generic cologne.  A waste of money, really.</li>
            <li> Good product quick shipping......</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!  Item is just as described!</li>
            <li> I ordered &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; but the condition of the tin the cologne was in doesn&#x27;t appear to be in new condition. I purchased it as a gift so was disappointed in the condition. I found that the spray on the bottle also doesn&#x27;t work. I tried to return it to Amazon but found out that you can&#x27;t return cologne to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I found this scent years ago and fell in love with it. I only use it on special occassions because it was always so hard to find at a store, so I&#x27;m so glad I found it on here. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s one of the cheapest of the curve scents, because I get complimented everytime I wear this. I&#x27;ve tried several other perfumes since I couldn&#x27;t always find this at the store, but never liked them near as much. My friend even chose this out of a selection of 6 choices from her bridesmaids (including some that were over $100 a bottle) to wear on her wedding day. If my friends and I meet at my house before going out together, they always want to wear this. It&#x27;s a great fragrance, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I like the scent it isn&#x27;t a strong smell it has a light touch which is nice.I will purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This has a subtle scent. Fresh like spring, but it&#x27;s not sweet. Very clean scent like you&#x27;re fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Delishes fragrance, fruity and floral mixed into one! Beautiful bottle and can, HOWEVER the lid was bent in a few places so had i been giving this to sum1 as a gift it would have seriously dampened the wow factor. Thankfully my wife was more forgiving  and understanding about the damaged Curve lid.. I&#x27;d deffi rebuy in the future..</li>
            <li> Buy it for my mom is excellent</li>
            <li> I have tons of fragrances in my collection, from inexpensive to very expensive. This scent is wonderful, holds well and I get many compliments. There is not too many like this one, I looked for it high and low.</li>
            <li> I had never smelled this perfume so when I got it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it smells.  The price was wonderful! Great deal.  Thanks a bunch!!!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my husband says when I wear this scent. It&#x27;s fresh and feminine - a winning combination for me and my sweetie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always received TONS compliments on this perfume......both by Woman &amp; Men! This has been my Singnature Perfume since it came out. I was VERY happy when I found it on Amazon! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Floral scent &amp; not overpowering. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews and thought that this would be great since I love the crush sent, but it just was not for me.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this when I was 21 - 22. I got so many compliments, very young scent. Because the price I didn&#x27;t know it was a product by Liz Claibourne. Very good price and it lasts for a while. It&#x27;s a mix of dewy star fruit, exotic florals, sun-kissed woods, honeysuckle, ginger orchid, plumeria, hibiscus, passion flower, raspberry juice, lilies, sandalwood, driftwood, amber and musk.&lt;br /&gt;Very floral but very good. Must try!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, was fulfilled sent to the estimated dates, loved the price and quality. I recommend it to all, it smells yummy.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED A CURVE PRODUCT B/C MY MOM HAD ONE AND SHE SMELLED GOOD ALL DAY AND NIGHT. WELL THIS IS MY FIRST DAY AND IT SMELLS CLASSY. IRONIC IN MY PERSPECTIVE B/C I AM GLAMMING UP MY FEMININE CHARACTER LOVE IT HONE LOVE LOVE LOVE TOTALLY GOT MY MY $$$$$$$S WORTH.</li>
            <li> I love this EDT, it is fresh, smell very good and not expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was a great price compared to department stores.  It came perfectly packaged and smells wonderful.  Its a stronger scent then I am used to so one pump does the trick, so it will last a while.  Great product for a great value!</li>
            <li> when the package arrived, was checked and verified that all came based on the invoice and a coming article in disrepair (curve Wave) I want to return this item for one like it. I appreciate your understanding and prompt response</li>
            <li> this isnt the 1st thime that ive bought this scent. just love it. + it lasts for a very long time</li>
            <li> Love the scent on my girlfriend. And all for a great price.</li>
            <li> I feel a little playful when I wear this scent.  It reminds me of being a teenager and feeling sexy and carefree.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Curve Crush which is the darker purple bottle and decided to give this one a try. I never knew of any other curve brand besides the men because the only one I ever see sold at stores near me is the Curve Crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this one. I loved the sent and the best way I could describe it was like a sweet citrus grape fruit send with a clean almost baby powder mix to it. Or at least when I would spray it the citrus would stand out and as it fades away it reminds me of a baby powder sent which I love but it doesnt last as long as the Curve Crush. To me the Curve Crush lasts a lot longer but its a little more over powerful sweet smell which I usually use on nights going out. I wanted this one to get my everyday use perfume but again I noticed it fades quickly. I would give it 5 stars if the sent lasted longer and believe me I spray myself down with it but it fades so quickly within a few hours for me but the scent is awesome, I love the scent of it.</li>
            <li> Great perfume. It smells tropical and clean. It lasts really long and is sure to grab the attention of others when you enter the room. Will definitely be buying more if this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over excited about this product I just can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> This perfume is not real! I bought previously from Mall that one was real! I guess that what you get for this $16 price((((</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and my girl freind. Its smells great on both there sexy bodies. Would recommend .great price great product. ....</li>
            <li> I tried this out without having smelled it first since the price was great and I wore the original Curve for years as a favorite (which it is nothing like). I was concerned it would smell like an old lady floral perfume or it just wouldn&#x27;t be to my taste but it smells delicious. It does have a floral scent but isn&#x27;t overpowering. If you&#x27;re looking for a really strong bold scent, this is not the one for you. It has a sweet subtle and clear scent. I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> liked the scent , light and pleasant would recommend to friends also i will be purchasing it again for myself .</li>
            <li> As I expected.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I loooooove this perfume. I am picky about my perfumes (I do not care for fruity or vanilla scents but also do not life perfumes with overpowering woodsy scents or the sometimes heavy scent of tuberose. This is a very pretty floral. It smells soooo pretty. I feel that it is appropriate for all ages, though is probably more popular among women under 30. The price was fantastic too, so I couldn&#x27;t pass it up!</li>
            <li> Great!!!!!!!  Smells so nice!!!!!  Clean and refreshing!!!!!</li>
            <li> smells really good... last long !!!!! great choice</li>
            <li> was not as I expected</li>
            <li> I buy this over and over for my girlfriend. We both love the scent, it is not over bearing but slichtly sweet.</li>
            <li> have had alot of trouble finding this perfume in our local stores..amazon did great here with price and size..not to sweet, not to bold..just the right amount of fragrance..would recommend for teen thru elderly..i love this..</li>
            <li> nice smell.  Compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent. I could not stop smelling the hand I sprayed it on when it arrived. My sister fell in love with the scent. I will be order 2, one for her and another for myself.</li>
            <li> This cologne became my favorite. Bought one for my daughter and the men cologne mtg son in law. They love it too.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but too strong. I put a little small drop and it is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister told me she had a headache when she put it on her so if you does not like strong smell this is not a good parfum for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any case, I love it. It&#x27;s perfect for a casual night, going out with friends...</li>
            <li> I got this scent for a second time. Best price, such a deal here on Amazon. It&#x27;s a beautiful soft fruity floral scent. It smells like a fantastic tropical summer. It may become my Sig.  It lasts through most of the day. 5 hrs or so. Orchid and star fruit are the stand outs in the scent. Beautiful!</li>
            <li> The product comes in good state but not with many protection because I bought another products like these and came with more protection</li>
            <li> Nice perfume, would recommend</li>
            <li> The only place I can find this perfume, I buy it only from here... Always ships and arrives on time. Will keep buying it until they no longer sell it.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for myself. They do not sell this perfume anymore in stores. I was Very Happy to find it on line!!</li>
            <li> My mom wanted to try this perfume so I bought her a bottle for her birthday. When it arrived it had leaked all over, it had a fracture in the bottle enough for a slow leak. Also it came late so it didn&#x27;t show up for her birthday. It didn&#x27;t really matter anyways because she didn&#x27;t like the scent. She said it smelled like something an older lady would wear and I did have to agree. Everyone has different taste. I think Curve Crush is a nicer scent, many compliments on that when I do wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance by Liz Claiborne, i received a small sample of this a s a gift a few years ago and have searched all over for it since then is not sold in any stores i have been to so when i found it on amazon i was so excited . i love the smell its very summery and fresh my boyfriend loves the smell he says it smells like flowers . It lasts all day long and the price is great so i couldn&#x27;t pass it up the bottle is also a decent size so it will last a long time Overall its a great buy and i would recommend to anyone .</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE. PERFECT. FAST SHIPPING. A+</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived undamamged in a timely fashion.  Definitely would order again.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what this perfume would smell like, but based on the other reviews I thought I give it a try. After receiving it I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what the other buyers were thinking but this perfume is ok. It smells to me like a cheap perfume you would buy at a discount store, sort of like a knock off. Idk maybe you will like it, all I know is that I will not wear it outside, will probably use it in the bathroom as an air freshener.</li>
            <li> The only perfume I actually use.  Not too strong, just enough of beauty.</li>
            <li> If you &#x27;ve purchased any of the other Curves scents then you need to buy this one as well. All Curves scents smell really good and leave you feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> i love the scent, and glad I can actually find it.  The product comes with the metal box and the stopper as shown.</li>
            <li> My wife and i love this perfume. everyone asks her &amp;#34;where did you get it&amp;#34;. great perfume for that price</li>
            <li> I had alot of compliments wearing this perfume</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance, I bought it for my wife because she has a soft, delicate scent. She likes people and todasnlas around you likes.</li>
            <li> Item was as described, i love curve so i got this for a friend and she too loved it.&lt;br /&gt;As described and as expected, Reccommednded!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in a timely manner</li>

            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, per se... but it is SO overwhelming i can&#x27;t breathe... and you can&#x27;t get it off unless you take a shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my bf said i smelled like a school teacher, lol.. which i don&#x27;t take as a diss but it&#x27;s an older style smell and it was just too much.. spray SPARINGLY!!!!</li>
            <li> Good price nice scent</li>
            <li> Fave Curve perfume out of the whole bunch! A scent that I can wear all season long! I would buy it over and over again!</li>
