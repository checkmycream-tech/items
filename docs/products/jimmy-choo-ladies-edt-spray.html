            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE</li>
            <li>I tried before the holidays but is easy to wear at the office--not flowery, not spicey--it&#x27;s more androgenous....</li>
            <li>Love Jimmy Choo perfume, but the Eau De Toilette Spray is a bit too light for my taste.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived very quickly and as advertised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I just hope that the scent is not fake or else its getting returned.</li>
            <li>the real deal  no replica version!</li>
            <li>Probably more favorable for younger people.</li>
            <li>So of course I went to Amazon to get a better price... big mistake.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would try this cologne based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Notes are green accord, pear, and ginger on top, middle notes of tea rose and</li>
            <li>DIDN&#x27;T LAST LONG REALLY GOOD SMELL I GOT</li>

            <li>The Jimmy Choo Perfume smell totally different and I would order from this company again fast delivery.</li>
            <li>There is just a subtle note of green and pear.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this Eau de Toilette.</li>

            <li> This Jimmy Choo cologne smelled like attempting to mask bad body odor with a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Other perfumes I can even smell on my shirt at the end of the day but not this one!!  </li>
            <li> A FEW COMMENTS ON IT</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> Tiger Orchid, with a base of cedar and woodsy notes.&lt;br /&gt;The woods, florals and ginger predominate on me, right off.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The box color is very dull and looks fake.  </li>
            <li> I may have bought  the wrong JC version than the one I tested.</li>
            <li> P.U. stinks</li>
            <li> some spillage from the bottle which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> If some of the low-star reviewers did mistakenly buy this after smelling the EDP, their disappointment is understandable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worst so called fragrance ever .</li>
            <li> worst than Ambush and Evening</li>
            <li> This is the worst perfume I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Horrible!  </li>

            <li> Love Jimmy Choo perfume, but the Eau De Toilette Spray is a bit too light for my taste.  Spray it on and within an hour, I can&#x27;t smell it anymore.  Next time, I&#x27;ll stick with the perfume.  As for the seller, great service.  Very happy with that end of the deal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the tester at Kohls I tried before the holidays but is easy to wear at the office--not flowery, not spicey--it&#x27;s more androgenous....I may have bought  the wrong JC version than the one I tested.</li>
            <li> I just received this perfume. I have not opened it to smell it because it is a Christmas gift.  But I compared the box to my jimmy choo box that I bought at Macys and the box does not look authentic. The box color is very dull and looks fake.  I just hope that the scent is not fake or else its getting returned.</li>
            <li> This product was given as a Christmas gift. The item arrived very quickly and as advertised. The recipient of this item was very pleased. Good experience all around. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this cologne based on all the positive reviews. Worst so called fragrance ever . worst than Ambush and Evening In Paris colognes. This Jimmy Choo cologne smelled like attempting to mask bad body odor with a cheap perfume. I promptly returned it.  P.U. stinks</li>
            <li> The scent complements my body chemistry well. I have had many people, friends as well as strangers, inquire about the fragrance I wear.</li>
            <li> This is the worst perfume I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I spray it on and within minutes the scent is gone.  It&#x27;s like I never even used any perfume.  Such a wast of money!  Other perfumes I can even smell on my shirt at the end of the day but not this one!!  I don&#x27;t smell it at all minutes after using it let alone end of day!!!  Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this!  Such a disappointment.  I have regular body lotion that has a scent that lasts longer this!!!</li>
            <li> Great price....was purchased in US to be brought to the Uk...some spillage from the bottle which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells wonderful!! It&#x27;s the same as in department stores. It brightens my mood!!&lt;br /&gt;Had to purchase another bottle..in love with Jimmy Choo EDT</li>
            <li> This is such a yummy smell.  Always get really nice comments when I wear it.  Read the description, this is the toilette not the parfum.  There is a difference in the smell between the two per my daughter.</li>
            <li> the real deal  no replica version! absolutely love this scent!</li>
            <li> I think  this perfume I purchased  is a knock off.....it doesn&#x27;t smell like Jimmy Choo perfume in the department store.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. One of my favorites. I wear it often and gets tons of compliments. Probably more favorable for younger people.</li>
            <li> Amazing, eloquent fragrance.</li>
            <li> We originally went to Macy&#x27;s and my wife loved this perfume.  So of course I went to Amazon to get a better price... big mistake.  This smells nothing like the Jimmy Choo in the stores- the best way to describe this is Mosquito Spray! Horrible!  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Definitely not the real thing, lesson learned!</li>
            <li> Notes are green accord, pear, and ginger on top, middle notes of tea rose and Tiger Orchid, with a base of cedar and woodsy notes.&lt;br /&gt;The woods, florals and ginger predominate on me, right off. There is just a subtle note of green and pear.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this Eau de Toilette. It&#x27;s light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I like the EDP, also, but this is an entirely different formula. If some of the low-star reviewers did mistakenly buy this after smelling the EDP, their disappointment is understandable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, and Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance for the spring/summer a very light scent. Caution make sure you order the right fragrance I ordered the Jimmy Choo Toilette. The Jimmy Choo Perfume smell totally different and I would order from this company again fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she loved it</li>
            <li> i love it!!! iÂ&#x27;m a fan of jimmy choo and the price donÂ&#x27;t do it justice! perfect for day and night</li>
            <li> Very nice, not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s great for day or night! Love my Jimmy Choo!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE DIDN&#x27;T LAST LONG REALLY GOOD SMELL I GOT A FEW COMMENTS ON IT I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN JUST TO HAVE</li>
