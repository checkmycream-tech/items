            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t invest any more money in it.</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer ever.  </li>
            <li>would like a more nuetral scent for this product</li>
            <li>and i just love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this Parisian delicacy.  </li>
            <li>so I was pleased to see it was more affordable through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Since I change my skin product to Sothys, my skin is much better.</li>
            <li>love love sothys, i use cleanser , toner and this hyrating cream,your face fells smooth and hydrated all day</li>
            <li>I also love the light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>however, this particular product is Not as good.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice before here in New York &amp; absolutely loved</li>
            <li>Particularly good for those who suffer the kind of dry skin caused by Thyroid issues.</li>
            <li>I lets face silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Even if your skin is oily I recommend that you use the light version of Sothys</li>
            <li>and they included free samples.</li>
            <li>The cream is light.</li>
            <li>The parfume in the cream is kind of strong when you just apply it, but fades away in a minute leaving just a slight pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s just not any better than many others out there at lesser cost.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see anything special about it.</li>
            <li>I temporarily strayed to Hope in a Jar, but came back to Sothys, as it is a better product at a better price.</li>
            <li>Hydradvance is light in texture yet provides so much moisture!</li>

            <li>I was fortunate to have a wonderful facial done by someone who used Sothys products a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>Solid quality and truly effective.  </li>
            <li>so had to make sure this did not irritate my skin which it did not after having my facial.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream and have been using it for a very long time</li>
            <li>I frequently get compliments on my smooth, soft skin!  </li>
            <li>It keeps my face very hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and have seen a real improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>The product has too much of a perfume scent for my liking.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but when they came up with this new system, I tried a sample of it then bought it.  </li>
            <li>it keep my skin very soft and i will continue to order this item</li>
            <li>Very light, a little goes a long way, absorbs very well.</li>

            <li> I recommend Sothys Hydradvance. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and love it. It keeps my face very hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to have a wonderful facial done by someone who used Sothys products a few years ago.  I suffered from very dry skin on my face and she recommended that I start using Sothys Hydradvance Comfort Hydrating Cream which I did and wow did my skin improve 100% in a very short time.

Love my skin now and get alot of compliments about how nice my face looks!</li>
            <li> Sothys hydraadvance comfort hydrating cream is a very good product . My wife have been using this product. For a couple of years.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used on skin care.  Solid quality and truly effective.  I would not consider anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and have been using it for a very long time</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I&#x27;ve purchased this product twice before here in New York &amp; absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I saw it was a lt. Less expensive, &amp; purchased it. however, this particular product is Not as good. It just was okay. It&#x27;s not as creamy, it doesn&#x27;t penetrate my skin like the sothys I bought before. Just ok.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years young and have been using this cream since it replaced Hydroptimale. I frequently get compliments on my smooth, soft skin!  This cream has a smooth (never sticky) consistency and a little goes a long way.  It is lightweight and I don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s on (only when it isn&#x27;t!)  I temporarily strayed to Hope in a Jar, but came back to Sothys, as it is a better product at a better price.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer.  I use it morning and night and have seen a real improvement in my skin.  I put in on under my foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times and I don&#x27;t see anything special about it. Maybe it&#x27;s just too lightweight. I bought what must be the trial size - 15 ml - and I won&#x27;t invest any more money in it. It&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s just not any better than many others out there at lesser cost.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I will use it again</li>
            <li> this is the best skin line ever.. love love sothys, i use cleanser , toner and this hyrating cream,your face fells smooth and hydrated all day</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer ever.  Particularly good for those who suffer the kind of dry skin caused by Thyroid issues. It&#x27;s a decent value for a terrific product.</li>
            <li> The product has too much of a perfume scent for my liking.  would like a more nuetral scent for this product</li>

            <li> The product arrived in perfect shape and before the estimated arrival date.  I have been using this cream for a while so I was pleased to see it was more affordable through Amazon.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great as a daytime moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have been using Sothys for 12 years.  And thought of changing brands, but when they came up with this new system, I tried a sample of it then bought it.  It is excellent - and after a year, can feel that my skin does not need as much.  Will continue to use it for the Fall, Winter, and Spring.  But will use a lighter cream for summer.  It has totally addressed my dry skin problems.  I ordered it through a second seller on Amazon - Dr. Skin Spa.  Also excellent service and they included free samples.</li>
            <li> Very light, a little goes a long way, absorbs very well. The parfume in the cream is kind of strong when you just apply it, but fades away in a minute leaving just a slight pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Since I change my skin product to Sothys, my skin is much better. Make your skin feel soft. The cream is light.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dehydrated despite my water intake, especially in the winter. Hydradvance is light in texture yet provides so much moisture! I&#x27;ve tried most brands at Sephora and Nordstrom and love Sothys the best! I also travel frequently and this moisturizer keeps my skin balanced between all of the travel.</li>
