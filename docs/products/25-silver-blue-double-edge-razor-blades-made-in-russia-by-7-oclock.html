            <li>These blades work great for me.</li>

            <li>Great blades, though.</li>
            <li>These razors are great.  </li>
            <li>These are great blades.  </li>
            <li>Also,  I have experienced irritation after some shaves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy these again happily.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, great blades.</li>
            <li>but I experienced a lot of tugging and skipping while shaving.</li>
            <li>My grandfather is so happy.</li>
            <li>As advertised , great blades</li>
            <li>Great razor blade at good price</li>
            <li>Good razors, what else can be said?</li>
            <li>Good deal.</li>
            <li>They are perfectly crafted and completely smooth with no imperfections.</li>
            <li>Good raiser blade.</li>
            <li>They are as good as those sampled.</li>
            <li>good blades....... not too aggresive...  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve gotten good results on all shaves.</li>
            <li>So are they a good blade?  </li>
            <li>I have come to the conclusion the best blades are made in Russia the same way the best creams and soaps come from the UK brushes from Spain and EDT from France......</li>
            <li>Considering the excellent price, I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love these blades!</li>
            <li>Great, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The blades are amazing.</li>
            <li>The type of razor you use, the quality of your shaving soap (or cream), sensitivity of your skin and the toughness of your beard are all factors in the kind of result you will get.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day these blades are good but just not my favorite</li>
            <li>I would say the blade is good to do that one more time.</li>
            <li>They are awesome, much smoother than the platinum.</li>
            <li>Best razors so far!  </li>
            <li>but i am saving money, getting very good shaves, and just think this stuff really is real and works.</li>
            <li>I like these better than Feather, to be honest.  </li>
            <li>of all the items I bought on that order this was by far the best and</li>
            <li>This blade is the best of the bunch that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>For some reason I liked these better in a sample pack.</li>
            <li>After one shave, I can enthusiastically state that these are clearly the best blades out there.  </li>
            <li>Gillette is the right balance of great quality and medium price.</li>
            <li>Clean crisp shave every time...fits my razors perfectly...</li>
            <li>These blades are very good quality and live up to the hype...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway these are very good blades, but so far I think I would stick with Astra because of the price difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to buy 100 blades at a time, so I appreciate being able to buy 25 blades.</li>
            <li>Possibly the best blade I have used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because they are even smother.  </li>
            <li>They are as close to perfect as you can possible get.</li>
            <li>Best overall blades.</li>
            <li>I have been testing several brands and the Gillettes always come out as some of the best.</li>
            <li>They are cheaper than those hideous cartridges and do a much better job.</li>
            <li>I think I could have bought a better blade.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with all the products</li>
            <li>While they&#x27;re better than the cheaper blades on the market, they aren&#x27;t my go to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>My favorite blades, a great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I purchesed Lord bladed which are much better for my face.</li>
            <li>I consider these blades to be the most valueable in my collection.</li>
            <li>I like the Dorco st 301 better..</li>
            <li>I love them and will get more soon.</li>
            <li>These are better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  Astra SP fan, but I like these just a hair better (pun intended).  </li>
            <li>I kept track of the results and found the Gillette Silver Blues to be the best overall.  </li>
            <li>Much better than most blades I have tried.</li>
            <li>These have become one of my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>I realize everyone&#x27;s face is different, but Silver Blues are perfect for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>They are ok,</li>
            <li>just ok.</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;m just use to those blades now since I&#x27;ve used them the most.</li>
            <li>Basically these blades are almost a millimeter wider from edge to edge resulting in more blade exposer/reveal (in my Edwin Jagger).</li>
            <li>Great blades and a decent quantity.  </li>
            <li>Great blades, I had original got a verity pack when i first started with a safety razor and found the Gillette 7 o clock to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but I hear some pretty good things about it just get them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
            <li>These are definately one of my go to blades and like my other favorites, these too are made in Russia, where they use good steel and make a great blade.  </li>
            <li>They had the most comfortable shave with the fewest nicks/cuts.  </li>
            <li>Still, based on pure results, Silver Blues are so far the best thing going for</li>
            <li>these blades are absolutely the most amazing thing I have ever shaved with.</li>
            <li>Loading the blade was easy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i can actually easily shave before the shower (which i prefer.)  </li>
            <li>Also these rust really easily, which seems to speak to the quality of the steel</li>
            <li>I combined these with some TOBS shaving cream, hands down best shave ever.</li>
            <li>When it came time to get some new ones I noticed good reviews on these and gave them a try.  </li>
            <li>I would think that these would work out just fine.  </li>
            <li>Good blade but for the money you can get blades just as good for less money.</li>
            <li>They ride smoothly across the face, and feel fine, but they cut just a bit too aggressively, taking a layer of skin from around the cheekbones.  </li>
            <li>but there is a huge difference in feel and quality.</li>
            <li>Depending on the toughness of your beard, you can get a week&#x27;s worth or more of smooth shaving from these blades.</li>
            <li>Really smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>that is how smooth these blades are even on the ATG pass.</li>
            <li>That is how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>These Gillette Silver Blues cut very effortlessly and gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>These felt extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li>not the best for heavy beards</li>
            <li>An unbelievably smooth result without cuts or burns.</li>
            <li>Fantastic blade.</li>
            <li>but the astra blades are not as smooth.</li>
            <li>so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day I&#x27;ve realized that I can get good shaves with almost any double edge blade depending on my prep and how many days of beard growth.</li>
            <li>So far; so good.</li>
            <li>While I will not gush over these blades like some of the other reviewers - they are an excellent choice and priced right.  </li>
            <li>Blades are very sharp and give a great, smooth Shave!</li>
            <li>For the last couple of years I have been using Wilkinson Swords, which are pretty good, but these top them easily.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re picky I would recommend trying them as part of a sampler kit first just to be safe</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different blades and the Gillette Silver Blue, are in my opinion, the best combination of sharpness and longevity (YMMV).</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Kai and Feather are simply much sharper and give a closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>These are my 3rd blade types and by far are the best.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and cooler than super hydro magnum razor cartridge sport blade seven hydro libricated cartridges.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get irritation super easy, but I do nick pretty easy and these blades in my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor give a great shave.</li>
            <li>I used with an old Gillette Blue Tip and this blade was perfect for my beard/skin.  </li>
            <li>So far the silver blue blade&#x27;s are the best I tried.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different when it comes to razor blades, but these have been the best blades I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>I have found some inconsistent blades, some very smooth others not so much.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much regarding longevity as I tend to change blades every  3  or 4 shaves, but for those 3 or 4, they give me a pretty nice shave.</li>
            <li>Wow these blades are amazing.</li>
            <li>good quality Russian blades.</li>
            <li>I bought the sensitive skin kind.  </li>
            <li>With a better shaving cream, these blades&lt;br /&gt;should perform very well indeed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new wet shaver and have found these the best .The</li>
            <li>Great razors, almost as sharp as Feathers.</li>
            <li>I came across these blades and said ok $8 is only 3 more than I need</li>
            <li>The 4th shave with this blade was as comfortable as the first.</li>
            <li>Pretty smooth and not too aggressive.</li>
            <li>While a little more forgiving than the Feather blade (Japanese and the sharpest blade on the market), it&#x27;s comparable and cuts perfectly through a weekend&#x27;s worth of stubble.</li>
            <li>in that it is every bit as as sharp but just smooth enough to get a perfect shave (</li>
            <li>If all are as good as this first blade, then the Feathers will be rapidly relagated to my back up blade.</li>
            <li>25 blades is a good number to focus on developing your technique using a single blade.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re face isn&#x27;t super sensitive you will probably love these.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like these blades,  because they were the right price and are easy to get, but they just gave me too much irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving them four stars just because they could be a little sharper, but for the money it&#x27;s a great buy.  </li>
            <li>For many days of growth I use feather blades, for 1 or 2 days of growth astra or wilkinson sword work fine, for daily shaving pop out the derby/merkur or these silver blues.</li>
            <li>But for the price these blades offered me a very close, smooth shave, without any burn or bumps.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, in my experience two blades (Kai and Feather) stand above ALL the others including: Astra, Gillette Silver, Derby, and Personna.</li>
            <li>Your face is worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about these blades.</li>
            <li>Otherwise these are well worth trying</li>
            <li>but I will say they are worth a try</li>
            <li>I have used lots of DE razors blades and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>and then top it off with Nivea after shave balm for sensitive skin[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>They are certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li>So far, I can&#x27;t tell which I like better, so will keep using both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a fresh blade I do three passes (w/,</li>
            <li>For the price, it was definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>so most blades do a good job cutting the hairs but the Silver Blues are the smoothest and most comfortable for my face.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoying old style shaving.</li>
            <li>Received my Edwin Jagger De89 and the Gillette Silver Blue DE razor blades today, and was excited to try the combination out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:  I&#x27;ve been using disposable cartridge razors for better part of 20 years, used electrics before that.  </li>
            <li>So if you want a great shave with a long lasting blade and a fair price, look no farther than Amazon for these Gillette Silver Blue blades.</li>
            <li>Good blades, sharp.</li>
            <li>good blades stays sharp</li>
            <li>just right for them and others that won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Not all blades are equal and not for everyone, so far the astra and Gillette 7 oclock are a perfect balance of sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seemed to have more pull, and left far more stubble than the first three brands I mentioned.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping....</li>
            <li>We will purchase again when needed as they are far superior to anything I can buy locally.</li>
            <li>I use these blades with a Parker Silvertip Badger brush and Proraso Red shaving cream and get a close, comfortable and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth  and almost equal to the 7 o clock yellows which are my favorites.</li>
            <li>I found this blade to be very gentle and forgiving.......</li>
            <li>Cheaper and also very gentle......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only bought 25 of them, I will be switching to another brand.</li>
            <li>Buy this blade it will hot disappoint</li>
            <li>Soft and smooth a must buy.</li>
            <li>they are only OK, not great.also, they are not Gillette quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>First got a 25 pack, then a 100 pack.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tested 10 different types of blades and these were among my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Try them first to see how your face likes them first.</li>
            <li>I tried and enjoyed Feather, Derby, Astra, Krystal and several others all under all kinds of conditions with all three of my razors, and all with, at one time or another, my best-performing shave creams.</li>
            <li>On my fourth shave I had to check my Gillette Fat Boy adjustable razor to be sure the blade was in there.</li>
            <li>If I were shaving a beard or hair that was more coarse</li>
            <li>These are definitely ranked at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>I just happen to have a face that works better with a different blade.  </li>
            <li>I tried many different blade from Feathers, Wilkinson Swords, Astra, etc.</li>
            <li>Everything combined has turned shaving from a necessary chore into a somewhat enjoyable ritual.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand]] and high quality</li>
            <li>Shaving right when I get out of the shower with shaving soap works best for me when I have a short stubble with no irritation to my skin and low drag from the hair.</li>
            <li>If I really want to extend the life I&#x27;ll do one more shave only w/ the grain.</li>
            <li>Bought these off the positive reviews on amazon and by watching YouTube.</li>
            <li>I was using the gilette platinum blades, I was weary to switch to these when they were discontinued, even with all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Pretty much all blades give me cuts and nicks.</li>
            <li>I had a minor throat scrape which I attribute to me learning how to use a safety razor, more than a problem with the equipment.  </li>
            <li>I am aware that this is not a very expensive razor, however I&#x27;ve found that it performs like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin....and not nicks or irritation.  </li>
            <li>They are both good blades, but the Gillette seems to be less harsh than the Feather, and more durable.  </li>
            <li>Cost really isn&#x27;t a factor because if you get seven shaves out of each blade you are spending 5.7 cents a shave.</li>
            <li>That includes Astra SP, Astra Stainless, Feather, PolSilver</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave with one pass on weekdays.</li>
            <li>After this, you&#x27;ll be ready to experiment a bit.</li>
            <li>but again YMMV it is a very subjective product.</li>
            <li>Cleanup was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are a fantastic daily blade...</li>
            <li>never thought I would thank the Russians for much,</li>
            <li>It gave a very close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>These blades shave very well.</li>
            <li>Received the shipment quickly thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Very efficient -- lasts forever (drain the water out after use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, with the cream, you have to wash your face after.  </li>
            <li>I much rather use the cheaper astra sp or derby...</li>
            <li>so I cannot speak to how these razors compare to others but for me they have worked very well.</li>
            <li>This was better than the Derby, Blue Bird, and Feather brands by far.  </li>
            <li>Was able to get a close shave without much blade drag or catch.</li>
            <li>There sharp and very smooth howecer they dont agree with my face.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave wtg / atg and every other way and no burn or razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I tried a Super Max stainless and THAT was super sharp.</li>
            <li>Long lasting with an amazingly close shave</li>
            <li>they shave nicely but don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Good for those looking for a more aggressive shave but might be a little rough for those w/ very coarse beards.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, yet also very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Shaves  very clean and extremely close.</li>
            <li>Not too much more expensive, much smoother on my face and more durable to boot.  </li>
            <li>exactly as described...arrived early.</li>
            <li>I first used these blades on a 1921 New Improved \\&quot;new standard\\&quot; model razor I was BBS over 24 hours</li>
            <li>They are more than Wilkinson Swords, but less than feather.  </li>
            <li>I know they are the most expensive blades (25%) more than even Feather blades</li>
            <li>Now all this great stuff said this is YMMV ( your mileage may vary ) as what is amazingly good on my face may be horrible for you</li>
            <li>A Gillette Fat Boy, a Slim (both on the number &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;6&amp;#34; setting) and a Gillette Super Speed Red Tip.</li>
            <li>IMO for a daily shaver the overall performance of this blade compared to say a Feather is better quaitly</li>
            <li>dermatologist once complained of not being able to find good razor blades for small removal procedures in the office.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I attribute this to high quality manufacturing process.</li>
            <li>a little pricey considering you can get 100 Astra SP&#x27;s for like $1 more</li>
            <li>Normally I shave with the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock razors</li>
            <li>The first time I used this gillette silver blue blade, i got a really close shave in 1 pass with the grain, which never happens on my face.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had them long enough to tell how many shaves</li>
            <li>I have thick and abundant stubbles.</li>
            <li>These are sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone getting into shaving or looking for a new blade.</li>
            <li>* - use new blades.</li>
            <li>I had been using Astra&#x27;s, but these are my new go to blades.  </li>
            <li>At $5 for 25-ish these are are cheap enough to be daily blades.  </li>
            <li>I do a very complete job of preping my beard and use a Parker Badger brush[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Sharp enough for sure.</li>
            <li>all I can say is wow!  </li>
            <li>Comparing them to my usual blade though; the Wilkinson Sword, The Wilkinson, still comes out on top.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and smooth....</li>
            <li>I consider my beard to be medium course but fast growing, daily shaving is normal routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough positive things about these.  </li>
            <li>I think Astra blades which are made in the same factory as these are a better blade for less money.</li>
            <li>They pull more than they should and because I have sensitive skin, it left my face red irritated all day long.  </li>
            <li>These blades last forever (2 months or so) and cut like they&#x27;re nearly brand new the whole time.  </li>
            <li>Brought back memories of the old &amp;#34;Gillette Super Blue Blades&amp;#34; from the fifties and sixties.  </li>
            <li>The sellers say Kai uses a higher gauge of stainless steel than other blades and this is clear just looking at the thickness of the DE blade.</li>
            <li>super sharp and well packaged with</li>
            <li>After three years of testing nearly every blade out there my quest has ended.  </li>
            <li>Very consistent sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>I have  tried  over 40 d e blades in  nearly  30 years  of  shaving  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Nothing works as well as the old Gillette blues we used to get,&amp;#34; he whined.</li>
            <li>Seem to work well so far.</li>
            <li>B005SRK0ZK Taylors of Old Bond Street</li>
            <li>(Tobs9) - Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t go against the grain because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised by the sharpness.  </li>
            <li>but I was kind of tired of them.  </li>
            <li>pre/post prep - result: muxh smoother blade performance but nowhere near the closeness I.e. good but not perfect shave.</li>
            <li>This certainly cost less than cartridge blades, and the experience is much more about slowing down and paying attention.</li>
            <li>With that said i put the gillette silver blues right behind feathers in sharpness and right behind polsilver for smoothness so overall its a sharp excellent blade</li>
            <li>Maybe not so much but no worse than any other razor blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, work well, and seem economical.</li>
            <li>shaving products are so personal, they may work better for you, but given my sensitive skin, they weren&#x27;t very different from what I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li>Solid DE blades for the price, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re better than my Lord&#x27;s for every day shaving.</li>
            <li>I figured these might be exactly the same as Astra SP since they are made at the same factory.  </li>
            <li>2nd shave (under exact same conditions as first - same razor/soap/brush same length of beard growth and</li>
            <li>They are similar to Astras but are possibly just a little bit better.</li>
            <li>Kai blades are very sharp but more forgiving and extremely consistent even over areas of my face which are more difficult either due to terrain or whisker thickness.</li>
            <li>Doing that with these blades is great and they last at least 5-6 shaves, if I shave everyday, without discomfort.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m knew to wet shaving</li>
            <li>I have found them to be consistent, comfortable, and very sharp - but not like a &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; for instance that requires the utmost respect and total focus if you have never used a blade that sharp.  </li>
            <li>I plan on trying several different types of blades, as I&#x27;ve just started using a DE razor, however as of right now I consider these my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; blade and will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li>They glide right down my face no problem.</li>
            <li>Not sharp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of the blades from several different sampler packs that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>But because they&#x27;re so cheap you really can&#x27;t complain because in the grand scheme of things they&#x27;re not much better or worse than any other razor blade.</li>
            <li>These blades are not sharp enough to cut through my thick hair growth, and when they do (which happens inconsistently) they don&#x27;t last more than 2 shaves.</li>
            <li>I have coarse beard and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>only thing I&#x27;d recommend is to watch the razor as it&#x27;s fixed into the handle.  </li>
            <li>I guess I have somewhat sensitive skin and daily growth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to know of those who gives them 5 or 4 stars how many have thin stubbles and non-abundant hair growth.</li>
            <li>I have been using Feather pretty much exclusively since I started wet shaving a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li>The second use was on a 1929-32 era NEW and same results no cuts ,weepers, irritation nothing</li>
            <li>Very sharp and last through more shaves than what I used previously.</li>
            <li>Sharp blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They are almost as sharp as a Feather but much smoother.</li>
            <li>first shave is actually probably the most dangerous in terms of cuts, i think.</li>
            <li>They strike me as extremely sharp, but have been remarkably gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have tried 4 different brands of double edge blades,so far.....</li>
            <li>Not sharp enough?  </li>
            <li>I find these very sharp, yet very forgiving, and work really well in my 60&#x27;s era Gillette Superspeed, and just about every other razor I&#x27;ve used them in.  </li>
            <li>Some blades are sharper but not smooth, some blades are smooth but not as sharp, some are balanced blades</li>
            <li>Worth spending a few cents per blade for these!  </li>
            <li>First shave with these blades was perfection - no hint of stubble even in trouble spots - not even against the grain.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty heavy beard and get 3-4 shaves out of each blade.</li>
            <li>I am relatively new to wet shaving with a de razor, been doing it for about 5-6 months now.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the Silver Blues are sharp but not crazy sharp.  </li>

            <li> Very good blade.  </li>
            <li> Both blades come from Russia and both are very good blades.</li>
            <li> Very good blade.</li>
            <li> Could be the best blade, great price.  </li>
            <li> These blades work great for me.</li>

            <li> Great reliable blades.</li>
            <li> Great blades, though.</li>
            <li> These razors are great.  </li>
            <li> These are great blades.  </li>
            <li> Also,  I have experienced irritation after some shaves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy these again happily.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, great blades.</li>
            <li> but I experienced a lot of tugging and skipping while shaving.</li>
            <li> My grandfather is so happy.</li>
            <li> As advertised , great blades</li>
            <li> Great razor blade at good price</li>
            <li> Good razors, what else can be said?</li>
            <li> Good deal.</li>
            <li> They are perfectly crafted and completely smooth with no imperfections.</li>
            <li> Good raiser blade.</li>
            <li> They are as good as those sampled.</li>
            <li> good blades....... not too aggresive...  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve gotten good results on all shaves.</li>
            <li> So are they a good blade?  </li>
            <li> I have come to the conclusion the best blades are made in Russia the same way the best creams and soaps come from the UK brushes from Spain and EDT from France......</li>
            <li> Considering the excellent price, I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love these blades!</li>
            <li> Great, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The blades are amazing.</li>
            <li> The type of razor you use, the quality of your shaving soap (or cream), sensitivity of your skin and the toughness of your beard are all factors in the kind of result you will get.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day these blades are good but just not my favorite</li>
            <li> I would say the blade is good to do that one more time.</li>
            <li> They are awesome, much smoother than the platinum.</li>
            <li> Best razors so far!  </li>
            <li> but i am saving money, getting very good shaves, and just think this stuff really is real and works.</li>
            <li> I like these better than Feather, to be honest.  </li>
            <li> of all the items I bought on that order this was by far the best and</li>
            <li> This blade is the best of the bunch that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> For some reason I liked these better in a sample pack.</li>
            <li> After one shave, I can enthusiastically state that these are clearly the best blades out there.  </li>
            <li> Gillette is the right balance of great quality and medium price.</li>
            <li> Clean crisp shave every time...fits my razors perfectly...</li>
            <li> These blades are very good quality and live up to the hype...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway these are very good blades, but so far I think I would stick with Astra because of the price difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to buy 100 blades at a time, so I appreciate being able to buy 25 blades.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best blade I have used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because they are even smother.  </li>
            <li> They are as close to perfect as you can possible get.</li>
            <li> Best overall blades.</li>
            <li> I have been testing several brands and the Gillettes always come out as some of the best.</li>
            <li> They are cheaper than those hideous cartridges and do a much better job.</li>
            <li> I think I could have bought a better blade.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with all the products</li>
            <li> While they&#x27;re better than the cheaper blades on the market, they aren&#x27;t my go to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> My favorite blades, a great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I purchesed Lord bladed which are much better for my face.</li>
            <li> I consider these blades to be the most valueable in my collection.</li>
            <li> I like the Dorco st 301 better..</li>
            <li> I love them and will get more soon.</li>
            <li> These are better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  Astra SP fan, but I like these just a hair better (pun intended).  </li>
            <li> I kept track of the results and found the Gillette Silver Blues to be the best overall.  </li>
            <li> Much better than most blades I have tried.</li>
            <li> These have become one of my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> I realize everyone&#x27;s face is different, but Silver Blues are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> They are ok,</li>
            <li> just ok.</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;m just use to those blades now since I&#x27;ve used them the most.</li>
            <li> Basically these blades are almost a millimeter wider from edge to edge resulting in more blade exposer/reveal (in my Edwin Jagger).</li>
            <li> Great blades and a decent quantity.  </li>
            <li> Great blades, I had original got a verity pack when i first started with a safety razor and found the Gillette 7 o clock to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li> but I hear some pretty good things about it just get them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good.</li>
            <li> These are definately one of my go to blades and like my other favorites, these too are made in Russia, where they use good steel and make a great blade.  </li>
            <li> They had the most comfortable shave with the fewest nicks/cuts.  </li>
            <li> Still, based on pure results, Silver Blues are so far the best thing going for</li>
            <li> these blades are absolutely the most amazing thing I have ever shaved with.</li>
            <li> Loading the blade was easy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i can actually easily shave before the shower (which i prefer.)  </li>
            <li> Also these rust really easily, which seems to speak to the quality of the steel</li>
            <li> I combined these with some TOBS shaving cream, hands down best shave ever.</li>
            <li> When it came time to get some new ones I noticed good reviews on these and gave them a try.  </li>
            <li> I would think that these would work out just fine.  </li>
            <li> Good blade but for the money you can get blades just as good for less money.</li>
            <li> They ride smoothly across the face, and feel fine, but they cut just a bit too aggressively, taking a layer of skin from around the cheekbones.  </li>
            <li> but there is a huge difference in feel and quality.</li>
            <li> Depending on the toughness of your beard, you can get a week&#x27;s worth or more of smooth shaving from these blades.</li>
            <li> Really smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> that is how smooth these blades are even on the ATG pass.</li>
            <li> That is how smooth it is.</li>
            <li> These Gillette Silver Blues cut very effortlessly and gave me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> These felt extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li> not the best for heavy beards</li>
            <li> An unbelievably smooth result without cuts or burns.</li>
            <li> Fantastic blade.</li>
            <li> but the astra blades are not as smooth.</li>
            <li> so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day I&#x27;ve realized that I can get good shaves with almost any double edge blade depending on my prep and how many days of beard growth.</li>
            <li> So far; so good.</li>
            <li> While I will not gush over these blades like some of the other reviewers - they are an excellent choice and priced right.  </li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp and give a great, smooth Shave!</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years I have been using Wilkinson Swords, which are pretty good, but these top them easily.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re picky I would recommend trying them as part of a sampler kit first just to be safe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different blades and the Gillette Silver Blue, are in my opinion, the best combination of sharpness and longevity (YMMV).</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Kai and Feather are simply much sharper and give a closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> These are my 3rd blade types and by far are the best.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and cooler than super hydro magnum razor cartridge sport blade seven hydro libricated cartridges.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get irritation super easy, but I do nick pretty easy and these blades in my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor give a great shave.</li>
            <li> I used with an old Gillette Blue Tip and this blade was perfect for my beard/skin.  </li>
            <li> So far the silver blue blade&#x27;s are the best I tried.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different when it comes to razor blades, but these have been the best blades I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> I have found some inconsistent blades, some very smooth others not so much.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much regarding longevity as I tend to change blades every  3  or 4 shaves, but for those 3 or 4, they give me a pretty nice shave.</li>
            <li> Wow these blades are amazing.</li>
            <li> good quality Russian blades.</li>
            <li> I bought the sensitive skin kind.  </li>
            <li> With a better shaving cream, these blades&lt;br /&gt;should perform very well indeed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new wet shaver and have found these the best .The</li>
            <li> Great razors, almost as sharp as Feathers.</li>
            <li> I came across these blades and said ok $8 is only 3 more than I need</li>
            <li> The 4th shave with this blade was as comfortable as the first.</li>
            <li> Pretty smooth and not too aggressive.</li>
            <li> While a little more forgiving than the Feather blade (Japanese and the sharpest blade on the market), it&#x27;s comparable and cuts perfectly through a weekend&#x27;s worth of stubble.</li>
            <li> in that it is every bit as as sharp but just smooth enough to get a perfect shave (</li>
            <li> If all are as good as this first blade, then the Feathers will be rapidly relagated to my back up blade.</li>
            <li> 25 blades is a good number to focus on developing your technique using a single blade.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re face isn&#x27;t super sensitive you will probably love these.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these blades,  because they were the right price and are easy to get, but they just gave me too much irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving them four stars just because they could be a little sharper, but for the money it&#x27;s a great buy.  </li>
            <li> For many days of growth I use feather blades, for 1 or 2 days of growth astra or wilkinson sword work fine, for daily shaving pop out the derby/merkur or these silver blues.</li>
            <li> But for the price these blades offered me a very close, smooth shave, without any burn or bumps.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, in my experience two blades (Kai and Feather) stand above ALL the others including: Astra, Gillette Silver, Derby, and Personna.</li>
            <li> Your face is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about these blades.</li>
            <li> Otherwise these are well worth trying</li>
            <li> but I will say they are worth a try</li>
            <li> I have used lots of DE razors blades and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> and then top it off with Nivea after shave balm for sensitive skin[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> They are certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> So far, I can&#x27;t tell which I like better, so will keep using both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a fresh blade I do three passes (w/,</li>
            <li> For the price, it was definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li> so most blades do a good job cutting the hairs but the Silver Blues are the smoothest and most comfortable for my face.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoying old style shaving.</li>
            <li> Received my Edwin Jagger De89 and the Gillette Silver Blue DE razor blades today, and was excited to try the combination out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:  I&#x27;ve been using disposable cartridge razors for better part of 20 years, used electrics before that.  </li>
            <li> So if you want a great shave with a long lasting blade and a fair price, look no farther than Amazon for these Gillette Silver Blue blades.</li>
            <li> Good blades, sharp.</li>
            <li> good blades stays sharp</li>
            <li> just right for them and others that won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Not all blades are equal and not for everyone, so far the astra and Gillette 7 oclock are a perfect balance of sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seemed to have more pull, and left far more stubble than the first three brands I mentioned.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping....</li>
            <li> We will purchase again when needed as they are far superior to anything I can buy locally.</li>
            <li> I use these blades with a Parker Silvertip Badger brush and Proraso Red shaving cream and get a close, comfortable and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth  and almost equal to the 7 o clock yellows which are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I found this blade to be very gentle and forgiving.......</li>
            <li> Cheaper and also very gentle......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only bought 25 of them, I will be switching to another brand.</li>
            <li> Buy this blade it will hot disappoint</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth a must buy.</li>
            <li> they are only OK, not great.also, they are not Gillette quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> First got a 25 pack, then a 100 pack.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tested 10 different types of blades and these were among my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Try them first to see how your face likes them first.</li>
            <li> I tried and enjoyed Feather, Derby, Astra, Krystal and several others all under all kinds of conditions with all three of my razors, and all with, at one time or another, my best-performing shave creams.</li>
            <li> On my fourth shave I had to check my Gillette Fat Boy adjustable razor to be sure the blade was in there.</li>
            <li> If I were shaving a beard or hair that was more coarse</li>
            <li> These are definitely ranked at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I just happen to have a face that works better with a different blade.  </li>
            <li> I tried many different blade from Feathers, Wilkinson Swords, Astra, etc.</li>
            <li> Everything combined has turned shaving from a necessary chore into a somewhat enjoyable ritual.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand]] and high quality</li>
            <li> Shaving right when I get out of the shower with shaving soap works best for me when I have a short stubble with no irritation to my skin and low drag from the hair.</li>
            <li> If I really want to extend the life I&#x27;ll do one more shave only w/ the grain.</li>
            <li> Bought these off the positive reviews on amazon and by watching YouTube.</li>
            <li> I was using the gilette platinum blades, I was weary to switch to these when they were discontinued, even with all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Pretty much all blades give me cuts and nicks.</li>
            <li> I had a minor throat scrape which I attribute to me learning how to use a safety razor, more than a problem with the equipment.  </li>
            <li> I am aware that this is not a very expensive razor, however I&#x27;ve found that it performs like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin....and not nicks or irritation.  </li>
            <li> They are both good blades, but the Gillette seems to be less harsh than the Feather, and more durable.  </li>
            <li> Cost really isn&#x27;t a factor because if you get seven shaves out of each blade you are spending 5.7 cents a shave.</li>
            <li> That includes Astra SP, Astra Stainless, Feather, PolSilver</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave with one pass on weekdays.</li>
            <li> After this, you&#x27;ll be ready to experiment a bit.</li>
            <li> but again YMMV it is a very subjective product.</li>
            <li> Cleanup was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are a fantastic daily blade...</li>
            <li> never thought I would thank the Russians for much,</li>
            <li> It gave a very close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> These blades shave very well.</li>
            <li> Received the shipment quickly thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Very efficient -- lasts forever (drain the water out after use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, with the cream, you have to wash your face after.  </li>
            <li> I much rather use the cheaper astra sp or derby...</li>
            <li> so I cannot speak to how these razors compare to others but for me they have worked very well.</li>
            <li> This was better than the Derby, Blue Bird, and Feather brands by far.  </li>
            <li> Was able to get a close shave without much blade drag or catch.</li>
            <li> There sharp and very smooth howecer they dont agree with my face.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave wtg / atg and every other way and no burn or razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I tried a Super Max stainless and THAT was super sharp.</li>
            <li> Long lasting with an amazingly close shave</li>
            <li> they shave nicely but don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Good for those looking for a more aggressive shave but might be a little rough for those w/ very coarse beards.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, yet also very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Shaves  very clean and extremely close.</li>
            <li> Not too much more expensive, much smoother on my face and more durable to boot.  </li>
            <li> exactly as described...arrived early.</li>
            <li> I first used these blades on a 1921 New Improved \\&quot;new standard\\&quot; model razor I was BBS over 24 hours</li>
            <li> They are more than Wilkinson Swords, but less than feather.  </li>
            <li> I know they are the most expensive blades (25%) more than even Feather blades</li>
            <li> Now all this great stuff said this is YMMV ( your mileage may vary ) as what is amazingly good on my face may be horrible for you</li>
            <li> A Gillette Fat Boy, a Slim (both on the number &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;6&amp;#34; setting) and a Gillette Super Speed Red Tip.</li>
            <li> IMO for a daily shaver the overall performance of this blade compared to say a Feather is better quaitly</li>
            <li> dermatologist once complained of not being able to find good razor blades for small removal procedures in the office.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I attribute this to high quality manufacturing process.</li>
            <li> a little pricey considering you can get 100 Astra SP&#x27;s for like $1 more</li>
            <li> Normally I shave with the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock razors</li>
            <li> The first time I used this gillette silver blue blade, i got a really close shave in 1 pass with the grain, which never happens on my face.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had them long enough to tell how many shaves</li>
            <li> I have thick and abundant stubbles.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone getting into shaving or looking for a new blade.</li>
            <li> * - use new blades.</li>
            <li> I had been using Astra&#x27;s, but these are my new go to blades.  </li>
            <li> At $5 for 25-ish these are are cheap enough to be daily blades.  </li>
            <li> I do a very complete job of preping my beard and use a Parker Badger brush[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Sharp enough for sure.</li>
            <li> all I can say is wow!  </li>
            <li> Comparing them to my usual blade though; the Wilkinson Sword, The Wilkinson, still comes out on top.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and smooth....</li>
            <li> I consider my beard to be medium course but fast growing, daily shaving is normal routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough positive things about these.  </li>
            <li> I think Astra blades which are made in the same factory as these are a better blade for less money.</li>
            <li> They pull more than they should and because I have sensitive skin, it left my face red irritated all day long.  </li>
            <li> These blades last forever (2 months or so) and cut like they&#x27;re nearly brand new the whole time.  </li>
            <li> Brought back memories of the old &amp;#34;Gillette Super Blue Blades&amp;#34; from the fifties and sixties.  </li>
            <li> The sellers say Kai uses a higher gauge of stainless steel than other blades and this is clear just looking at the thickness of the DE blade.</li>
            <li> super sharp and well packaged with</li>
            <li> After three years of testing nearly every blade out there my quest has ended.  </li>
            <li> Very consistent sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> I have  tried  over 40 d e blades in  nearly  30 years  of  shaving  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Nothing works as well as the old Gillette blues we used to get,&amp;#34; he whined.</li>
            <li> Seem to work well so far.</li>
            <li> B005SRK0ZK Taylors of Old Bond Street</li>
            <li> (Tobs9) - Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go against the grain because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by the sharpness.  </li>
            <li> but I was kind of tired of them.  </li>
            <li> pre/post prep - result: muxh smoother blade performance but nowhere near the closeness I.e. good but not perfect shave.</li>
            <li> This certainly cost less than cartridge blades, and the experience is much more about slowing down and paying attention.</li>
            <li> With that said i put the gillette silver blues right behind feathers in sharpness and right behind polsilver for smoothness so overall its a sharp excellent blade</li>
            <li> Maybe not so much but no worse than any other razor blades I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, work well, and seem economical.</li>
            <li> shaving products are so personal, they may work better for you, but given my sensitive skin, they weren&#x27;t very different from what I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> Solid DE blades for the price, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re better than my Lord&#x27;s for every day shaving.</li>
            <li> I figured these might be exactly the same as Astra SP since they are made at the same factory.  </li>
            <li> 2nd shave (under exact same conditions as first - same razor/soap/brush same length of beard growth and</li>
            <li> They are similar to Astras but are possibly just a little bit better.</li>
            <li> Kai blades are very sharp but more forgiving and extremely consistent even over areas of my face which are more difficult either due to terrain or whisker thickness.</li>
            <li> Doing that with these blades is great and they last at least 5-6 shaves, if I shave everyday, without discomfort.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m knew to wet shaving</li>
            <li> I have found them to be consistent, comfortable, and very sharp - but not like a &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; for instance that requires the utmost respect and total focus if you have never used a blade that sharp.  </li>
            <li> I plan on trying several different types of blades, as I&#x27;ve just started using a DE razor, however as of right now I consider these my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; blade and will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> They glide right down my face no problem.</li>
            <li> Not sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the blades from several different sampler packs that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> But because they&#x27;re so cheap you really can&#x27;t complain because in the grand scheme of things they&#x27;re not much better or worse than any other razor blade.</li>
            <li> These blades are not sharp enough to cut through my thick hair growth, and when they do (which happens inconsistently) they don&#x27;t last more than 2 shaves.</li>
            <li> I have coarse beard and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> only thing I&#x27;d recommend is to watch the razor as it&#x27;s fixed into the handle.  </li>
            <li> I guess I have somewhat sensitive skin and daily growth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to know of those who gives them 5 or 4 stars how many have thin stubbles and non-abundant hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Feather pretty much exclusively since I started wet shaving a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> The second use was on a 1929-32 era NEW and same results no cuts ,weepers, irritation nothing</li>
            <li> Very sharp and last through more shaves than what I used previously.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They are almost as sharp as a Feather but much smoother.</li>
            <li> first shave is actually probably the most dangerous in terms of cuts, i think.</li>
            <li> They strike me as extremely sharp, but have been remarkably gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different brands of double edge blades,so far.....</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough?  </li>
            <li> I find these very sharp, yet very forgiving, and work really well in my 60&#x27;s era Gillette Superspeed, and just about every other razor I&#x27;ve used them in.  </li>
            <li> Some blades are sharper but not smooth, some blades are smooth but not as sharp, some are balanced blades</li>
            <li> Worth spending a few cents per blade for these!  </li>
            <li> First shave with these blades was perfection - no hint of stubble even in trouble spots - not even against the grain.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty heavy beard and get 3-4 shaves out of each blade.</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving with a de razor, been doing it for about 5-6 months now.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the Silver Blues are sharp but not crazy sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have feathers and enjoy them also have other less sharp but smoother blades such as polsilver ir and perma-sharp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far, but it was an exceptionally sharp blade.</li>
            <li> So far, absolutely no negatives!</li>
            <li> The down side is the second week, I had to work a little harder to get as clean a shave as my #1 blade.</li>
            <li> They seem about middle of the road in how close they shave and how long they last.</li>
            <li> To me, these are sharper than the Astras if that is possible but still don&#x27;t last long,</li>
            <li> No exotic or &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; coatings on the blade just a very high quality precision edge.</li>
            <li> The Silver Blue also seems to be slightly wider than the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock razors but that could be my old eyes playing tricks on</li>
            <li> At least give the Gillettes a shot first.</li>
            <li> also, i find these blades last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I use both a Merker 23C Long Handle as well as a &#x27;58 Gillette FatBoy and the blades work equally as well in both.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not great either.  </li>
            <li> I could easily live with these though if the Wlkinson&#x27;s were not available. .</li>
            <li> I started buying and then using these blades after transitioning to a double edged single blade - and getting my face all chewed up using department/drug store blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they get dull fast.</li>
            <li> I use an old Gillete Fat boy adjustable razor and usually start at 4 and go back with a 9.</li>
            <li> Wet shave is the only way to get a close shave and Gillette blades make it happen.</li>
            <li> They seem sharper and last a lot longer than my prior yellow and green packaged blades.  </li>
            <li> Beats derby, shark, gillette 7 o&#x27;clock and merkur by a long shot.</li>
            <li> only con that I have for the Silver Blue &amp; Astra blades is the heavy wax spots they put on the inner wrappers.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different blades for use in Wet Shaving with my old gillette DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i hate this kind of stuff generally.  </li>
            <li> so it is possible the razor is slightly off (not parallel to)</li>
            <li> A thousand times better than the personna lab blades that I last purchased where every other blade I had to throw away cause they were ripping the hairs of my beard instead of  cutting them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This on the other hand last longer</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are made in Russia (only a problem if you politically motivated) and are on the higher end of the price spectrum for DE razors.  </li>
            <li> I get far fewer nicks and less irritation from this blade than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> Merkur is high quality thick grade metal</li>
            <li> So far these blades will last me about 3-5 shaves, and that&#x27;s just me liking to shave when they are incredibly sharp since I have a thick beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried, in no particular order: Shark, Feather, Astra and Derby.  </li>
            <li> I found them to be a little rougher with regular use - more nicks and cuts, and unpleasant dragging.</li>
            <li> A little sharper than the yellow 7 o&#x27;clock blades</li>
            <li> Other brands have been &amp;#34;used up&amp;#34; after a single shave</li>
            <li> but if you consider the quality of the shave, and shave-life of each blade they are money well spent.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard with a lot of different grain changes in my beard growth.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair so finding the right blade has bin tough</li>
            <li> Those were so sharp, flimsy and thin that they cut my skin too much even though they were sharp and shaved hair well.</li>
            <li> Yes they are sharper than a lot of blades I&#x27;ve tried, but not being as sharp as I&#x27;d like causes some minor nicks, and not a super close shave.  </li>
            <li> Almost as sharp as the Feather blades but noticeably smoother.  </li>
            <li> They stay sharp for days and have proven themselves in each of my 8 razors.</li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp for quite.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands like shark etc</li>
            <li> other products are up to par and do everything they say they do.</li>
            <li> I was eager to receive these blades after reading some of the other reviews of the blades.</li>
            <li> not as sharp and closest shave</li>
            <li> While they could be just a hair sharper, they do stay sharp for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Astra Sp and decided to give these a try due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Shave Balm, Active Comfort System, 3.3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]].</li>
            <li> I underestimated how sharp these blades are, they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Almost as sharp as feather with less irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li> my feather blades from a blade that seemed less sharp?</li>
            <li> My face felt smoother than it has in years after the commonly recommended third pass...no stubble could be found on my face.  </li>
            <li> But these Blues are consistently the smoothest, closest, least irritating blades I know of.</li>
            <li> My beard is average</li>
            <li> Sharp!</li>
            <li> Feathers are very sharp but...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of blade, and I don&#x27;t really believe there is such a thing as a bad brand.  </li>
            <li> I get less nicks with them than I do with feathers.</li>
            <li> the Astras, but still a lot less than the feathers</li>
            <li> They give a smoother, less pulling shave.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these are a little sharper than the Astra blades and due to this I did receive a few weepers.</li>
            <li> At first I wondered if the blade was even cutting, it was.  </li>
            <li> I suppose these spots are to help hold the wrapper tight to the blade, but they leave a mess on the blades.</li>
            <li> I have never had blades that slide over your skin with little effort.</li>
            <li> I end up with little to no irritation and a no nicks now that I have learned how to shave with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> My facial hair tends to be very thick and dense but my skin cannot hold up to an aggressive blade.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few of these now</li>
            <li> If you are tired of nics and cuts, buy these Gillette Silver Blue blades.</li>
            <li> I have struggled every time, some blades are too sharp, some to dull, etc...</li>
            <li> I thought I would put myself through a blind trial of a few different brands to figure out if I could tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> only problem is the cost, the 25 blade packs are a bit expensive on a per blade basis.</li>
            <li> I do not care what make or brand go past 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about that.</li>
            <li> I usually do a two pass</li>
            <li> D. Those were not memorable.</li>
            <li> Tried 7 other brands was not happy</li>
            <li> I have been through hell with Trig, Nacet Platinum, BIC, LORD (this is the absolute worst you can buy), Big Ben, Crown....</li>
            <li> Gets dull after 4th shave</li>
            <li> and I get at least 4 shaves before I feel tugging.  </li>
            <li> I think since I am a daily shaver I need something sharper because I am cutting shorter hairs closer to my skin.  </li>
            <li> These have provided me with the smoothest, with the least passes/irritation, shave yet.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick and tough beard, but after reading some other reviews of these blades, I thought they would work for me.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> Seriously this was a mistake</li>
            <li> w no irritated patches in tough spots or blood.</li>
            <li> Your experience may differ as everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, but I don&#x27;t believe anyone would have a bad experience with these maybe just not optimal at worst case.</li>
            <li> Terrible not  sharp  </li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> but nothing wrong with the item.</li>
            <li> but they are too expensive.</li>
            <li> These blades are very poorly made.</li>
            <li> May have had a bad blade - and if so I&#x27;ll edit this review - but not terribly impressed this morning with the results.  </li>
            <li> These blades didn&#x27;t come close to cutting my beard.</li>
            <li> these work the best..without razor burns or cutting my skin.....</li>
            <li> But it is very expensive..</li>
            <li> Man, was I disappointed.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing !!!!</li>
            <li> I tried Derbys and hated them.</li>
            <li> the worst  ever.</li>
            <li> , I turned around to see a bloody face in the mirror - and the face was mine!  </li>

            <li> I gave Gillette Silver three stars. Honestly, in my experience two blades (Kai and Feather) stand above ALL the others including: Astra, Gillette Silver, Derby, and Personna. Kai and Feather are simply much sharper and give a closer, more comfortable shave. Of these Kai is without equal. I know they are the most expensive blades (25%) more than even Feather blades but if you consider the quality of the shave, and shave-life of each blade they are money well spent. Kai blades are very sharp but more forgiving and extremely consistent even over areas of my face which are more difficult either due to terrain or whisker thickness. The sellers say Kai uses a higher gauge of stainless steel than other blades and this is clear just looking at the thickness of the DE blade. No exotic or &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; coatings on the blade just a very high quality precision edge. Cost really isn&#x27;t a factor because if you get seven shaves out of each blade you are spending 5.7 cents a shave. Five shaves per blade is 8 cents a shave.  Do yourself a favor and give them a try; you won&#x27;t go back to the others.  PS: I don&#x27;t have stock or any connection with the company. Driven to write only by my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Great blades and a decent quantity.  I don&#x27;t want to buy 100 blades at a time, so I appreciate being able to buy 25 blades.</li>
            <li> good quality Russian blades. I use mine with a Gillette Superspeed and personally like the results. If you&#x27;re picky I would recommend trying them as part of a sampler kit first just to be safe</li>
            <li> I tried Derbys and hated them. For the last couple of years I have been using Wilkinson Swords, which are pretty good, but these top them easily. Great, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best blade I have used.  That includes Astra SP, Astra Stainless, Feather, PolSilver</li>
            <li> Great blades, I had original got a verity pack when i first started with a safety razor and found the Gillette 7 o clock to be my favorite.  When it came time to get some new ones I noticed good reviews on these and gave them a try.  I&#x27;m glad I did because they are even smother.  Shaving right when I get out of the shower with shaving soap works best for me when I have a short stubble with no irritation to my skin and low drag from the hair.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different blades for use in Wet Shaving with my old gillette DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades blew my mind. They are as close to perfect as you can possible get. I was able to shave wtg / atg and every other way and no burn or razor bumps. NO irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these blades.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My Dad used Gillette blades and now after using this product for several months I know why. I was disposable razor guy for over forty years. Wet shave is the only way to get a close shave and Gillette blades make it happen. Your face is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Long lasting with an amazingly close shave</li>
            <li> Best overall blades. Very sharp and last through more shaves than what I used previously.</li>
            <li> These blades work great for me. I have never had blades that slide over your skin with little effort. Different skins take different blades.....keep switching u till you find one that&#x27;s made for you.</li>
            <li> they shave nicely but don&#x27;t last long. I get maybe two or three shaves then they are done.</li>
            <li> These are the best DE blades I&#x27;ve come across.  Almost as sharp as the Feather blades but noticeably smoother.  At $5 for 25-ish these are are cheap enough to be daily blades.  An excellent value.  Only the Voskhod Blades rival these in these.</li>
            <li> These blades are very poorly made. I&#x27;m glad I only bought 25 of them, I will be switching to another brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about these blades. They seem about middle of the road in how close they shave and how long they last.</li>
            <li> Great razor blade at good price</li>
            <li> Silver blues are my go-to razor blade. They are almost as sharp as a Feather but much smoother. I get far fewer nicks and less irritation from this blade than any other I have tried. They stay sharp for days and have proven themselves in each of my 8 razors. I&#x27;ll be a user for life.</li>
            <li> Good razors, what else can be said?</li>
            <li> Could be the best blade, great price.  Multi blade razors burn in hell</li>
            <li> These are my 3rd blade types and by far are the best.  They seem sharper and last a lot longer than my prior yellow and green packaged blades.  I am getting 2x the amount of shaves so I have zero complaints - great value and quality.</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp and give a great, smooth Shave! I use an old Gillete Fat boy adjustable razor and usually start at 4 and go back with a 9. Doing that with these blades is great and they last at least 5-6 shaves, if I shave everyday, without discomfort.</li>
            <li> I like these better than Feather, to be honest.  They are both good blades, but the Gillette seems to be less harsh than the Feather, and more durable.  It stays sharper longer than the Feather.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of blade, and I don&#x27;t really believe there is such a thing as a bad brand.  Technique is 99% of shaving.  But I just prefer these for some reason.</li>
            <li> Cheap and cooler than super hydro magnum razor cartridge sport blade seven hydro libricated cartridges.</li>
            <li> Really smooth close shave. I have a heavy beard with a lot of different grain changes in my beard growth. I get a very close shave with one pass on weekdays. Best shave ever on Saturday and Sunday with 3 passes. Buy this blade it will hot disappoint&lt;br /&gt;Kevin</li>
            <li> They work great, I find them to give me a smoother cut than a lot of blades I have tried. I don&#x27;t get irritation super easy, but I do nick pretty easy and these blades in my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor give a great shave. I end up with little to no irritation and a no nicks now that I have learned how to shave with a safety razor. I would recommend these to anyone getting into shaving or looking for a new blade.</li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp for quite. One blade will last up to two weeks and I shave every day. The only drawback I can see is the wax paper around the blade tends to stick. Otherwise these are well worth trying</li>
            <li> These are sharp and smooth. I get less nicks with them than I do with feathers. 25 blades is a good number to focus on developing your technique using a single blade. After this, you&#x27;ll be ready to experiment a bit. I&#x27;m a new wet shaver and have found these the best .The only problem is the cost, the 25 blade packs are a bit expensive on a per blade basis.</li>
            <li> I have been testing several brands and the Gillettes always come out as some of the best. They are cheaper than those hideous cartridges and do a much better job.</li>
            <li> Best blades ever. Tried other brands like shark etc but they get dull fast. This on the other hand last longer and it&#x27;s smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> Seriously this was a mistake I did not want these blades I needed to meet the minimum for a add on item so I started searching things I knew would be in the range I needed to get the add on items. I came across these blades and said ok $8 is only 3 more than I need but I hear some pretty good things about it just get them. It was not like I intentionally went looking for these blades. Oh my God !!! of all the items I bought on that order this was by far the best and it wasn&#x27;t even what I was going for !!! I first used these blades on a 1921 New Improved \\&quot;new standard\\&quot; model razor I was BBS over 24 hours I couldn&#x27;t even tell I was shaving that is how smooth these blades are even on the ATG pass. The second use was on a 1929-32 era NEW and same results no cuts ,weepers, irritation nothing I mean nothing !!!! I have used a few of these now and I must say I do not let any blade I do not care what make or brand go past 4 shaves. The 4th shave with this blade was as comfortable as the first. Now all this great stuff said this is YMMV ( your mileage may vary ) as what is amazingly good on my face may be horrible for you but I will say they are worth a try a little pricey considering you can get 100 Astra SP&#x27;s for like $1 more but there is a huge difference in feel and quality. I have come to the conclusion the best blades are made in Russia the same way the best creams and soaps come from the UK brushes from Spain and EDT from France...... but again YMMV it is a very subjective product.</li>
            <li> I think I could have bought a better blade. I may go for the &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; blade next time.&lt;br /&gt;The other products are up to par and do everything they say they do. I am satisfied with all the products</li>
            <li> Razors are an incredibly personal choice.  My facial hair tends to be very thick and dense but my skin cannot hold up to an aggressive blade.  I used with an old Gillette Blue Tip and this blade was perfect for my beard/skin.  Love these blades!</li>
            <li> Sharp! Great reliable blades.</li>
            <li> I recently switched with a double edge safety razor and after spending countless hours on the forums I decided to order these blades as well as as some feather blades. Compared to the blade that came with the razor (Derby) these blades are absolutely the most amazing thing I have ever shaved with. Soft and smooth a must buy. I combined these with some TOBS shaving cream, hands down best shave ever.</li>
            <li> Same as the Gillette 7 Oclock yellow..  But a bit stiffer...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good. Sharp enough for sure. Forgiving? Maybe not so much but no worse than any other razor blades I&#x27;ve used. Pretty much all blades give me cuts and nicks. These are no exception. But because they&#x27;re so cheap you really can&#x27;t complain because in the grand scheme of things they&#x27;re not much better or worse than any other razor blade. Good deal. If you&#x27;re face isn&#x27;t super sensitive you will probably love these. They&#x27;re last a WHILE.</li>
            <li> This is it!  This is the one you&#x27;ve been looking for!  After three years of testing nearly every blade out there my quest has ended.  These blades last forever (2 months or so) and cut like they&#x27;re nearly brand new the whole time.  I have been through hell with Trig, Nacet Platinum, BIC, LORD (this is the absolute worst you can buy), Big Ben, Crown....you name it.  This was better than the Derby, Blue Bird, and Feather brands by far.  Stop experimenting and just load up on these guys and spend your money on fancy soaps, aftershaves, etc instead.</li>
            <li> Solid DE blades for the price, but I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re better than my Lord&#x27;s for every day shaving. While they&#x27;re better than the cheaper blades on the market, they aren&#x27;t my go to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because shaving products are so personal, they may work better for you, but given my sensitive skin, they weren&#x27;t very different from what I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> they are NOT made in Russia, they are made in Japan! they are only OK, not great.also, they are not Gillette quality.</li>
            <li> My favorite blades, a great price, fast shipping. What are you waiting for.</li>
            <li> I added these to the rotation to try a different blade.Very smooth  and almost equal to the 7 o clock yellows which are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I was eager to receive these blades after reading some of the other reviews of the blades. Man, was I disappointed. These blades didn&#x27;t come close to cutting my beard. I have a very thick and tough beard, but after reading some other reviews of these blades, I thought they would work for me. NOT. These blades now reside in the trash dumpster.</li>
            <li> Received my Edwin Jagger De89 and the Gillette Silver Blue DE razor blades today, and was excited to try the combination out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:  I&#x27;ve been using disposable cartridge razors for better part of 20 years, used electrics before that.  I consider my beard to be medium course but fast growing, daily shaving is normal routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation Feedback: Loading the blade was easy.  My face felt smoother than it has in years after the commonly recommended third pass...no stubble could be found on my face.  I had a minor throat scrape which I attribute to me learning how to use a safety razor, more than a problem with the equipment.  Cleanup was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:  Give these a try.  I&#x27;ll buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Very consistent sharp blades.  I have coarse beard and sensitive skin and I get at least 4 shaves before I feel tugging.  Pretty smooth and not too aggressive.</li>
            <li> Started with a trial pack of DE blades. These were tops. First got a 25 pack, then a 100 pack.&lt;br /&gt;I use them in my 1959 FatBoy and SuperSpeed Red tip.&lt;br /&gt;I get about 2 (maybe 3)  shaves per. But come on. Dont be a cheapa** - use new blades. It&#x27;s your FACE we&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack because I wanted to try the Gillette Silver Blue razors.  Normally I shave with the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock razors but I was kind of tired of them.  Anyway, the Silver Blues are sharp but not crazy sharp.  The razors come individually wrapped inside of the box.  Each razor is glued to wax paper, and that in turn is wrapped up in a regular paper wrapper containing advertising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d recommend is to watch the razor as it&#x27;s fixed into the handle.  I found the Silver Blues slide around a bit so it is possible the razor is slightly off (not parallel to) the razor handle.  The Silver Blue also seems to be slightly wider than the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock razors but that could be my old eyes playing tricks on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Silver Blues.  They are sharp, work well, and seem economical.</li>
            <li> I am Currently using the Lord L6 razor.  I am aware that this is not a very expensive razor, however I&#x27;ve found that it performs like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For these Gillette blades - I can say that they are definitely smoother and sharper than the Lord blade that came with my razor.  As everyone says, blades are an extremely personal choice, so what works well for me, might not for you.  But for the price these blades offered me a very close, smooth shave, without any burn or bumps.  I plan on trying several different types of blades, as I&#x27;ve just started using a DE razor, however as of right now I consider these my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; blade and will definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> So far the silver blue blade&#x27;s are the best I tried. I have thick facial hair so finding the right blade has bin tough</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different brands of double edge blades,so far.....these work the best..without razor burns or cutting my skin.....</li>
            <li> The blades are amazing. There sharp and very smooth howecer they dont agree with my face. I purchesed Lord bladed which are much better for my face. At least give the Gillettes a shot first.</li>
            <li> I tested 10 different types of blades and these were among my favorite.  This certainly cost less than cartridge blades, and the experience is much more about slowing down and paying attention.</li>
            <li> While I will not gush over these blades like some of the other reviewers - they are an excellent choice and priced right.  I have found them to be consistent, comfortable, and very sharp - but not like a &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; for instance that requires the utmost respect and total focus if you have never used a blade that sharp.  These are a fantastic daily blade...never thought I would thank the Russians for much, but &amp;#34;spasibo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I had been using Astra&#x27;s, but these are my new go to blades.  Not too much more expensive, much smoother on my face and more durable to boot.  I seem to be getting 5 shaves vs 3 with the Astra&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of nics and cuts, buy these Gillette Silver Blue blades. They are perfectly crafted and completely smooth with no imperfections. I consider these blades to be the most valueable in my collection.</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough?  Yes they are sharper than a lot of blades I&#x27;ve tried, but not being as sharp as I&#x27;d like causes some minor nicks, and not a super close shave.  My astra blades are still the ones to beat for my shaving.  I guess I have somewhat sensitive skin and daily growth.  Not all blades are equal and not for everyone, so far the astra and Gillette 7 oclock are a perfect balance of sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li> I found this blade to be very gentle and forgiving.......But it is very expensive..I like the Dorco st 301 better..Cheaper and also very gentle......</li>
            <li> Very sharp and smooth.... Almost as sharp as feather with less irritation on my skin. Your experience may differ as everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, but I don&#x27;t believe anyone would have a bad experience with these maybe just not optimal at worst case. I love them and will get more soon. thank you</li>
            <li> May have had a bad blade - and if so I&#x27;ll edit this review - but not terribly impressed this morning with the results.  I&#x27;ve tried, in no particular order: Shark, Feather, Astra and Derby.  I started buying and then using these blades after transitioning to a double edged single blade - and getting my face all chewed up using department/drug store blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to have more pull, and left far more stubble than the first three brands I mentioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one so far, but it was an exceptionally sharp blade. Was able to get a close shave without much blade drag or catch. Will update this review as I continue to use these blades.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not great either.  I tried a Super Max stainless and THAT was super sharp.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of DE razors blades and these are by far my favorite. Smoother than feather blades not as sharp and closest shave I&#x27;ve had after a 3 pass shave. Beats derby, shark, gillette 7 o&#x27;clock and merkur by a long shot. Try them first to see how your face likes them first. Everyone is different for me this is the best</li>
            <li> Best razors so far!  I have been using DE Razors for years.....and this is the best blade I have found.  I have super sensitive skin....and not nicks or irritation.  Worth spending a few cents per blade for these!  Super fast shipping....and I will be ordering from this seller again!</li>
            <li> A little sharper than the yellow 7 o&#x27;clock blades A thousand times better than the personna lab blades that I last purchased where every other blade I had to throw away cause they were ripping the hairs of my beard instead of  cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend the Silver Blues</li>
            <li> I just loaded one of these into my Merkur Progress.  It gave a very close shave with no irritation.  I figured these might be exactly the same as Astra SP since they are made at the same factory.  These are better.  Like anything else in wet-shaving.. YMMV</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  Astra SP fan, but I like these just a hair better (pun intended).  As you can see they are a bit pricier tham the Astras, but still a lot less than the feathers</li>
            <li> These blades shave very well. I like the durability. I got 2 weeks out of them. The down side is the second week, I had to work a little harder to get as clean a shave as my #1 blade. The second week it did not have that butter cut like my #1 blade. There is something about those Personna Reds for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Terrible not  sharp  at  all.  I have  tried  over 40 d e blades in  nearly  30 years  of  shaving  these  are  one  of  the worst  ever.</li>
            <li> I underestimated how sharp these blades are, they are very sharp. I have feathers and enjoy them also have other less sharp but smoother blades such as polsilver ir and perma-sharp just so you get an idea of what i have experience with. With that said i put the gillette silver blues right behind feathers in sharpness and right behind polsilver for smoothness so overall its a sharp excellent blade you cant go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> We will purchase again when needed as they are far superior to anything I can buy locally.</li>
            <li> I tried and enjoyed Feather, Derby, Astra, Krystal and several others all under all kinds of conditions with all three of my razors, and all with, at one time or another, my best-performing shave creams. But these Blues are consistently the smoothest, closest, least irritating blades I know of. I&#x27;m stocking up.&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist once complained of not being able to find good razor blades for small removal procedures in the office. &amp;#34;Nothing works as well as the old Gillette blues we used to get,&amp;#34; he whined. I didn&#x27;t want to know what he was removing with razor blades, but I gave him one of my boxes, and now he is buying them in bulk. Not sure how I feel about that. Great blades, though.</li>
            <li> Received the shipment quickly thanks to Amazon. Two of the five boxes of five blades got bent and the blades are unusable since they cannot be loaded into my razor.</li>
            <li> After hearing that people react differently to blades I thought I would put myself through a blind trial of a few different brands to figure out if I could tell the difference.  I tried four different blades: Personna, Feather, Gillette Silver Blues, and a generic brand I picked up from Rite Aid.  I had my wife swap the blades out after shaving with each twice.  I kept track of the results and found the Gillette Silver Blues to be the best overall.  They had the most comfortable shave with the fewest nicks/cuts.  Unfortunately they are made in Russia (only a problem if you politically motivated) and are on the higher end of the price spectrum for DE razors.  Still, based on pure results, Silver Blues are so far the best thing going for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone cares, Feather came in second, followed by Rite Aid and Personna.</li>
            <li> Seem to work well so far.</li>
            <li> Tried 7 other brands was not happy so I ordered these and the feather brand. The feath</li>
            <li> My go too Razor blades for my TTO DE razors.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So far these blades will last me about 3-5 shaves, and that&#x27;s just me liking to shave when they are incredibly sharp since I have a thick beard. Much better than most blades I have tried.</li>
            <li> These razors are great.  I&#x27;m giving them four stars just because they could be a little sharper, but for the money it&#x27;s a great buy.  Will order them again.  While they could be just a hair sharper, they do stay sharp for quite some time.</li>
            <li> This blade is the best of the bunch that I have tried so far. On my fourth shave I had to check my Gillette Fat Boy adjustable razor to be sure the blade was in there. That is how smooth it is. No nicks, cuts or razor burn. I do a very complete job of preping my beard and use a Parker Badger brush[[ASIN:B002RJC1HC Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand]] and high quality Taylor shave cream[[ASIN:B005SRK0ZK Taylors of Old Bond Street (Tobs9) - Shaving Cream for Sensitive Skin 150g - Made in England]]. Final rinse with Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel[[ASIN:B000PP15L8 Thayer Witch Hazel Toner AF w/Aloe Vera Formula Vitamin E, Lavender 12 oz]] and then top it off with Nivea after shave balm for sensitive skin[[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm, Active Comfort System, 3.3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]]. Best shave ever.</li>
            <li> Good raiser blade. Gets dull after 4th shave</li>
            <li> I have tried astra, Shark, Merkur, and the Gillette silver blue blades. These Gillette Silver Blues cut very effortlessly and gave me a nice close shave. I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different blades and the Gillette Silver Blue, are in my opinion, the best combination of sharpness and longevity (YMMV). My beard tends to be on the coarse side and I have three razors in my rotation. A Gillette Fat Boy, a Slim (both on the number &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;6&amp;#34; setting) and a Gillette Super Speed Red Tip. All three of these razors perform well paired with Silver Blue blades to give a BBS shave. The bonus is that they last me for up to a week of shaving every day, even making multiple passes (WTG, XTG, &amp; ATG) on every shave. Other brands have been &amp;#34;used up&amp;#34; after a single shave and I have pushed them for a second one only to regret it minutes later (thank goodness for Alum blocks). So if you want a great shave with a long lasting blade and a fair price, look no farther than Amazon for these Gillette Silver Blue blades.</li>
            <li> These are definately one of my go to blades and like my other favorites, these too are made in Russia, where they use good steel and make a great blade.  I find these very sharp, yet very forgiving, and work really well in my 60&#x27;s era Gillette Superspeed, and just about every other razor I&#x27;ve used them in.  I can&#x27;t say much regarding longevity as I tend to change blades every  3  or 4 shaves, but for those 3 or 4, they give me a pretty nice shave.</li>
            <li> These have become one of my favorite blades. I realize everyone&#x27;s face is different, but Silver Blues are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> First shave with these blades was perfection - no hint of stubble even in trouble spots - not even against the grain. 2nd shave (under exact same conditions as first - same razor/soap/brush same length of beard growth and pre/post prep - result: muxh smoother blade performance but nowhere near the closeness I.e. good but not perfect shave. I only use blades twice then replace because they all degrade noticibly to me. IMO for a daily shaver the overall performance of this blade compared to say a Feather is better quaitly in that it is every bit as as sharp but just smooth enough to get a perfect shave (if used only once) w no irritated patches in tough spots or blood. For multiple day growth Feather is still king. Tools:  Razor: Merkur Futur (set at 6) Brush: Semogue 2000 (face lather) Soap: Stirling. Post Shave: witchazel, Nivea shave balm.</li>
            <li> Wow these blades are amazing. They glide right down my face no problem. No nicks or tugs. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep buying these.</li>
            <li> These are great blades.  They are very sharp, yet also very smooth.  They are similar to Astras but are possibly just a little bit better.</li>
            <li> I have been using Feather pretty much exclusively since I started wet shaving a year and a half ago.  Feathers are very sharp but...I have found some inconsistent blades, some very smooth others not so much.  Also,  I have experienced irritation after some shaves.  I just tried these Gillette blades this morning, and all I can say is wow!  No cuts, no weepers, no irritation and my face is BBS.  These felt extremely smooth.  At first I wondered if the blade was even cutting, it was.  If all are as good as this first blade, then the Feathers will be rapidly relagated to my back up blade.</li>
            <li> Very good blade.  I highly recommend it.  But the biggest tip I can give?  Use shaving soap, not cream, to shave with a safety razor.  Use a badger brush and soap.  I like the Proraso (I think spelled like that) soap.  I bought the sensitive skin kind.  Very efficient -- lasts forever (drain the water out after use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, with the cream, you have to wash your face after.  with the soap -- it is soap.  rinse your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can actually easily shave before the shower (which i prefer.)  the soap plus these blades are excellent.  If i want an extra close shave i lather twice...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love safety razor shaving.  and i hate this kind of stuff generally.  but i am saving money, getting very good shaves, and just think this stuff really is real and works. also, i find these blades last a long time.  i think i&#x27;m going on a seventh shave with the current blade.  so far, so good.  first shave is actually probably the most dangerous in terms of cuts, i think.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different when it comes to razor blades, but these have been the best blades I have found so far.  They strike me as extremely sharp, but have been remarkably gentle on my face.  They are certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these blades,  because they were the right price and are easy to get, but they just gave me too much irritation.  They pull more than they should and because I have sensitive skin, it left my face red irritated all day long.  I think since I am a daily shaver I need something sharper because I am cutting shorter hairs closer to my skin.  If I were shaving a beard or hair that was more coarse I would think that these would work out just fine.  All depends on you skin and your use I guess.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t even heard of Gillette Silver Blue blades until a couple months ago. I bought 25 of these to compare with the Astra blades I&#x27;ve been using. Both blades come from Russia and both are very good blades. So far, I can&#x27;t tell which I like better, so will keep using both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I have for the Silver Blue &amp; Astra blades is the heavy wax spots they put on the inner wrappers. I suppose these spots are to help hold the wrapper tight to the blade, but they leave a mess on the blades. I don&#x27;t know if this affects the shave or not, but I guess all blades made in that facility in Russia have the same wax spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway these are very good blades, but so far I think I would stick with Astra because of the price difference.</li>
            <li> I picked them from a sample pack before ordering.They are as good as those sampled.Everybody&#x27;s beard is different but I get 4-5 shaves from each one.</li>
            <li> good blades....... not too aggresive...  can make a mistake and not totally gouge yourself.</li>
            <li> not the best for heavy beards I don&#x27;t think but nothing wrong with the item.</li>
            <li> Thought these would be sharper.  They are more than Wilkinson Swords, but less than feather.  They are ok, just ok.</li>
            <li> Work so well with my Merkur 34C HD. An unbelievably smooth result without cuts or burns. I attribute this to high quality manufacturing process. Don&#x27;t confuse &amp;#34;aggressive&amp;#34; with sharpness. The type of razor you use, the quality of your shaving soap (or cream), sensitivity of your skin and the toughness of your beard are all factors in the kind of result you will get. I found that these blades feature superb sharpness and yet are quite forgiving when it comes to nicks and burns. And they last! Depending on the toughness of your beard, you can get a week&#x27;s worth or more of smooth shaving from these blades. Considering the excellent price, I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sharp. I have thick and abundant stubbles. These blades are not sharp enough to cut through my thick hair growth, and when they do (which happens inconsistently) they don&#x27;t last more than 2 shaves. I&#x27;d like to know of those who gives them 5 or 4 stars how many have thin stubbles and non-abundant hair growth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic blade. Bought these off the positive reviews on amazon and by watching YouTube. Shaves  very clean and extremely close. one of the best blades I ever used.  AAA+++</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razor blades.</li>
            <li> While a little more forgiving than the Feather blade (Japanese and the sharpest blade on the market), it&#x27;s comparable and cuts perfectly through a weekend&#x27;s worth of stubble. I use both a Merker 23C Long Handle as well as a &#x27;58 Gillette FatBoy and the blades work equally as well in both. I&#x27;d buy these again happily.</li>
            <li> These blades are very good quality and live up to the hype...BUT after shaving with them for about a week they are just not for me. While the blades glide smoothly over the whiskers they left quite some stubble behind which required additional passes. I usually do a two pass shave(with grain then across grain) with touch up. I don&#x27;t go against the grain because I have sensitive skin but with these blades I had to make some against the grain strokes on tougher areas like my chin. Of course making those against the grain strokes lead to some razor burn and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison with astra sp blades I can do just a two pass shave and be done with it but the astra blades are not as smooth. In all honesty with all the blades I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve noticed that they all have some pros and cons. Some blades are sharper but not smooth, some blades are smooth but not as sharp, some are balanced blades but they still might not work for your skin and beard. At the end of the day I&#x27;ve realized that I can get good shaves with almost any double edge blade depending on my prep and how many days of beard growth. For many days of growth I use feather blades, for 1 or 2 days of growth astra or wilkinson sword work fine, for daily shaving pop out the derby/merkur or these silver blues. At the end of the day these blades are good but just not my favorite I much rather use the cheaper astra sp or derby...maybe I&#x27;m just use to those blades now since I&#x27;ve used them the most. Might not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Good blade but for the money you can get blades just as good for less money. I think Astra blades which are made in the same factory as these are a better blade for less money.</li>
            <li> Good blades, sharp. I have a pretty heavy beard and get 3-4 shaves out of each blade. Comparing them to my usual blade though; the Wilkinson Sword, The Wilkinson, still comes out on top. They give a smoother, less pulling shave. I could easily live with these though if the Wlkinson&#x27;s were not available. .</li>
            <li> So far; so good. These are definitely ranked at the top of my list. These have provided me with the smoothest, with the least passes/irritation, shave yet. I&#x27;ve only used three blades but I&#x27;ve gotten good results on all shaves. With a fresh blade I do three passes (w/, x, and a/). I would say the blade is good to do that one more time. If I really want to extend the life I&#x27;ll do one more shave only w/ the grain. After that, its must toss. Nonetheless, great blades.</li>
            <li> To me, these are sharper than the Astras if that is possible but still don&#x27;t last long, perhaps two shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was the cream I was using, Omega Crema da Barba.  With a better shaving cream, these blades&lt;br /&gt;should perform very well indeed.</li>
            <li> good blades stays sharp</li>
            <li> Clean crisp shave every time...fits my razors perfectly...super sharp and well packaged with each blade individually wrapped...exactly as described...arrived early.</li>
            <li> They provided a very close shave w/ a few passes but I experienced a lot of tugging and skipping while shaving. How did I get a closer shave than w/ my feather blades from a blade that seemed less sharp? Basically these blades are almost a millimeter wider from edge to edge resulting in more blade exposer/reveal (in my Edwin Jagger). Good for those looking for a more aggressive shave but might be a little rough for those w/ very coarse beards.</li>
            <li> I think I posted before but here goes... My grandfather is traditional and doesn&#x27;t use the electric shavers. I searched all over for these blades and was ecstatic when I found them on here. Great buy! My grandfather is so happy.</li>
            <li> For some reason I liked these better in a sample pack. I found them to be a little rougher with regular use - more nicks and cuts, and unpleasant dragging. Also these rust really easily, which seems to speak to the quality of the steel used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Made-in-Russia 7 o&#x27;clocks.</li>
            <li> As advertised , great blades</li>
            <li> Great razors, almost as sharp as Feathers.</li>
            <li> i have used the brand that begins with letter D. Those were not memorable. I have used Astra. Those were so sharp, flimsy and thin that they cut my skin too much even though they were sharp and shaved hair well. I have used Merkur. Merkur is high quality thick grade metal but they are too expensive. Gillette is the right balance of great quality and medium price.</li>
            <li> Best I have found to work for me.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m knew to wet shaving so I cannot speak to how these razors compare to others but for me they have worked very well. My only regret is buying the 25 pack instead of the 50 or 100 pack so they would be cheaper per blade.</li>
            <li> These blades are literally the BEST ones I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used many of the blades from several different sampler packs that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  I am relatively new to wet shaving with a de razor, been doing it for about 5-6 months now.  I have struggled every time, some blades are too sharp, some to dull, etc... The first time I used this gillette silver blue blade, i got a really close shave in 1 pass with the grain, which never happens on my face.  Unbelievable!  These blades, on my face any way, cut thru like butter.  I have yet to knick myself with these blades.  My hats off to Russia Gillette.  I just can&#x27;t say enough positive things about these.  So far, absolutely no negatives!</li>
            <li> For the price, it was definitely worth a try.  They are an excellent value.  They just are not for me.  They ride smoothly across the face, and feel fine, but they cut just a bit too aggressively, taking a layer of skin from around the cheekbones.  It didn&#x27;t nick or cause pain, but about five minutes after washing my face and walking away, I turned around to see a bloody face in the mirror - and the face was mine!  I would have been very upset if this had occurred on the way to church or at work instead of where I could catch it and wash off the dried blood.  So are they a good blade?  Comfort and ease of shave say yes.  I just happen to have a face that works better with a different blade.  Everyone who uses double edge blades will discover there will be blades that work just right for them and others that won&#x27;t.  This one wasn&#x27;t mine.</li>
            <li> After one shave, I can enthusiastically state that these are clearly the best blades out there.  I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
            <li> Very good blade. I have been using Astra Sp and decided to give these a try due to the reviews. I was not disappointed. I use a Merkur 34C and these provide an excellent shave. In my opinion, these are a little sharper than the Astra blades and due to this I did receive a few weepers. Once I adjusted for this, I my shaves were awesome. I have tried them with a variety of different soaps and the results were the same. I will be reordering these again.</li>
            <li> I recently changed to a safety razor for shaving and have tried various blades.  I tried many different blade from Feathers, Wilkinson Swords, Astra, etc. and find these the best for my face.  My beard is average but I have sensitive skin so most blades do a good job cutting the hairs but the Silver Blues are the smoothest and most comfortable for my face.  I use these blades with a Parker Silvertip Badger brush and Proraso Red shaving cream and get a close, comfortable and smooth shave.  Everything combined has turned shaving from a necessary chore into a somewhat enjoyable ritual.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I use!</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by the sharpness.  Haven&#x27;t had them long enough to tell how many shaves I&#x27;ll get.  Brought back memories of the old &amp;#34;Gillette Super Blue Blades&amp;#34; from the fifties and sixties.  Really enjoying old style shaving.</li>
            <li> I was using the gilette platinum blades, I was weary to switch to these when they were discontinued, even with all of the positive reviews. I almost bought the 100 pack but went with 25 to see how they would work. They are awesome, much smoother than the platinum. I will be buying the 100 pack soon.</li>
