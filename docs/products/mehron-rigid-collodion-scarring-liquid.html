            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, however the listing said 1/4 oz when in reality I recieved a 1/8 oz.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with how fast it arrived and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li>Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff, very easy to apply and has a really great effect.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping &amp; great product.</li>
            <li>The look turned out really good, it does smell strongly and irritated my skin after i removed it.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the smell is very strong and chemical.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, too.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Makes a great bite mark for zombies either \\&quot;healed\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh and bloody\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>There is an excellent instruction video on the Beautiful You channel on YouTube, and I&#x27;m sure many other channels as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a Great product I would recommend it to anyone look for great special effect for making realistic scars</li>
            <li>great fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>I found you have to layer it on a bit more than the pricier version, but for non-professional endeavors, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>this is perfect for create scars at Halloween I have purchased 5 bottles over the last 2 years...</li>
            <li>just had more work</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But besides that,I love this.</li>
            <li>Im glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more in the bottle for that price.</li>
            <li>(The tall guy played by Crispin Glover than the queen was in love with)</li>
            <li>More than once.</li>
            <li>This product works well for scars, in fact I haven&#x27;t seen anything work better for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I do wish it didn&#x27;t take so many coats to get the desired look, however.</li>
            <li>A lot of the magic that goes into the scar effect of this product is going to be achieved with shading and make up application, not the rigid collodion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of the finishing touch.</li>
            <li>Deeper scars require many applications which can be time consuming.</li>
            <li>As with all Mehron products... simply one of the best.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I needed this for Halloween and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s okay still</li>
            <li>We had a good laugh about that one.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this was going to work...</li>
            <li>Love it-the scars, not the smell.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The more layers you apply, the deeper the scar effect will be.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>look around your area before you spend more than $4 online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li>This worked WAY better than stick-on scars.</li>
            <li>It looks better when the pro uses it.</li>
            <li>I need  way More to do what I need to</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as intended!!!</li>
            <li>It was still in original packaging and works amazingly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good and for the price I will get more.</li>
            <li>This product arrived promptly and looked amazing with my DBZ costume, the special affect touch was spot on for my cosplay.</li>
            <li>Excited for halloween now!</li>
            <li>Easy to take off, no irritation what so ever on my side. :)</li>
            <li>smells strong but seems to work:)</li>
            <li>It applies quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>So, yeah we were thrilled with the purchase and highly recommend the seller!!!</li>
            <li>This sinks in the skin just perfectly.</li>
            <li>Other than that was awesome!</li>
            <li>Overall I Loved it!</li>
            <li>peels off too easily</li>
            <li>This stuff is easy to get the gist of after playing around with it.</li>
            <li>He had a scar design around his eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use, and</li>
            <li>easy to peel off too.</li>
            <li>Removal is not that easy, although it just requires peeling off the product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and remove.</li>
            <li>strong</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong and foul that she would not allow me to try it on her face.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong but it reminds me of the alcohol for nails.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a Halloween costume, I tested it out last night, works great</li>
            <li>and it was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I used it a few times and it worked perfectly!!!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap and works well.</li>
            <li>So lightly powder or use make up over it.</li>
            <li>You will need to apply several coats (like7-10) for you to see great results.</li>
            <li>Contrary to it being listed as a toy, I don&#x27;t recommend letting kids handle it, but the scars it makes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>rigid collodion is a great product,but i found it for $3.50 at a local costume shop.</li>
            <li>takes many strokes to make a good solid scar, but it works as intended and doesn&#x27;t use tons to make the scar.</li>
            <li>Super cool!</li>
            <li>Easy.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I do not have a good picture to share, but if you combine it with other sfx procedures, you will be able to create some amazing realistic effects!</li>
            <li>BUT still worth it!</li>
            <li>deffinetly worth the money!</li>
            <li>A must for any special effects junkie.</li>
            <li>A must for anyone doing special effects makeup.  </li>
            <li>For best results, you will want to have some makeup handy to provide color and blending into the skin, so you can create anything from a fresh, angry looking scar to something that has had some time to heal.</li>
            <li>it was like 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>I used the hair dryer on cool to help blow the fumes away.</li>
            <li>cool stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well for making believable scars.  </li>
            <li>Most people thought it was real.</li>
            <li>but you really won&#x27;t need many.  </li>
            <li>Still not bad</li>
            <li>Every person who I showed pictures of my costume to was amazed; very professional item and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to work with and remove, and it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>comes off pretty easily, but stays in place for hours, even under stage lights.</li>
            <li>I had never bought this or used it before, but I found out quickly</li>
            <li>I received many compliments on how realistic the scarring looked.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it has a very potent smell and can burn while applying (depending on where you are applying).</li>
            <li>I used a hair dryer on &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; to speed the process, so it didn&#x27;t take that long to create a good looking 3D scar.</li>
            <li>This stuff is going to have to be pretty darned impressive and produce some seriously icky wounds before I decide to try ordering it again and take the chance on getting another defective bottle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the smell as super offensive as some other people do but it isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>Original reason to purchase this was because the price was decent, I got free shipping</li>
            <li>I bought this for an experiment that I was doing for my final psychology project, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Looks and feels real!!</li>
            <li>The product is good, but you can make more realistic makeups in other ways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;ll actually make dents in your skin for a while.</li>
            <li>ask if the scars were real haha.</li>
            <li>It gives the appearance of a depressed shiny scar which can be greatly enhanced with a few touches of make up.</li>
            <li>This turned out amazingly and I was stopped several times by</li>
            <li>Saw someone using this on YouTube thought it was pretty cool</li>
            <li>fun to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The con about it is it smells,it kind od irratated my skin because its sensative I wish it was a lattle bigger</li>
            <li>Maybe this product would be better suited for an adult as opposed to a kid.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, but you do need a colored makeup pencil (in a pink/red tone) to create the realistic color of a fairly fresh scar, and foundation/powder to set it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be good for your skin to use it all the time, but for occasional use, it works really well.</li>
            <li>But I will have to hurry, especially considering the speed at which this stuff is disappearing on its own.  </li>
            <li>Makes realistic scars so easy to create for costumes and sfx.</li>
            <li>This product was a lot of fun to use.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is truly amazing...use it for Halloween or just use it for fun...</li>
            <li>Works great, but the size is super small.</li>
            <li>The effect is very cool, but there isn&#x27;t much here to do a large job.  </li>
            <li>Compliment with Ben Nye, and you&#x27;re own your way to a good dramatic film.</li>
            <li>I have used rigid collodion many times in the past and have never had to use so much to get a good look.</li>
            <li>It took about 5 coats per &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; to get the right amount of pull and indentation.</li>
            <li>This product is great for small scars.</li>
            <li>the product worked great and made a great deep scar, but the suplied brush made it difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li>Without using any other makeup, it looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>scars, burns and some old age effects are easy to make with this product.  </li>
            <li>We were overall happy with the appearance until later in the night.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and price was very reasonable for the effect the product gives!</li>
            <li>so now I have to return it, pay more money, and wait for it to hopefully come back as the right order.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used this brand of collodion.</li>
            <li>Thank you soo much!</li>
            <li>Shipping was extremely fast as well!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this stuff.</li>
            <li>best product for fake scaring.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using the collodion so if this is your first time using it,</li>
            <li>Also, it smells quite strongly at first.</li>
            <li>It took a few coats to get a good, visable scar.</li>
            <li>It may come loose very easily.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased this for my 11 year old who wanted to do up her face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a small bottle so use it wisely and test it on your skin first.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly what it says it is thanks again</li>
            <li>Overall, the product was very helpful and very realilistic, just make sure you know how to use it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a red or brown eyeliner to give it a realistic look.</li>
            <li>With a touch of color, this stuff makes the most realistic scars that can be achieved without actually injuring yourself.  </li>
            <li>It works great for creating scars, punctures, and as a light coating over the entire face with a second layer on the accent points, can give a wrinkled aged make up.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really anything special as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li>Only gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t come off as easy as it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;It should last all day, and removes easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>but you may want to make sure you&#x27;re able to seal it as tight as possible.</li>
            <li>Also it takes quite a few layers before making a &amp;#34;scar.&amp;#34; I found that if I applied liquid latex first and THEN the rigid collodian, it made for a much more realistic and deep scar without as many layers.</li>
            <li>Went to lab with a huge facial scar and my PI was like \\&quot;WHAT</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anybody who has a costume that needs scars!</li>
            <li>Worked extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
            <li>The product worked so well it looked so real.</li>
            <li>Looked real.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>I had just enough to do a couple of practice rounds and about 5 nicely detailed scars.</li>
            <li>people hat assumed the scars were real.</li>
            <li>One friend of mine thought that really got into an accident.</li>
            <li>Finishes fast</li>
            <li>Such a cool and easy way to create facial scarring!!</li>
            <li>They stuck on all night long, and came off easy.</li>
            <li>I ended up using a hefty dose of this stuff, then put some scar wax over the top and cut it with a butter knife and added in different fake blood and coloring, and it worked AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Can go on top of other product and still will work.</li>
            <li>I had seen reviews of this online and was so excited when I had finally received it.</li>
            <li>and I was able to put a nice &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; down his face with a few layers.</li>
            <li>To make it last longer, clean the skin with alcohol before applying, and to remove it you can just peel it off.  </li>
            <li>This product is really cool to use especially since it works quite well</li>
            <li>I am giving two stars simply because it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is used to create realistic scars for effects makeup.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so realistic</li>
            <li>Realistic as heck.</li>
            <li>We stopped trying to make it look better when we realized that the collodion was starting to run a bit low.</li>
            <li>I needed it for realistic shrapnel scars on my face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>If you put it on an area of high movement, such as your cheek, and then smile or frown, it can cause the rigid collodion to peel off.</li>
            <li>The product itself is great for making a fake scar.</li>
            <li>actually I had to pretty much use my nails</li>
            <li>It does look shiny, though, so I would suggest some foundation or powder to use on top of it if you want to leave the scar plain.</li>
            <li>Great product, looks real but it burned my skin pretty bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but a bit expensive for my tastes, and it goes pretty fast because you need to layer it.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to see how I could use it to create some new simulated wounds for disaster drills.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to make realistic scars for Halloween, cosplay, purposes, or anything you need them for!</li>
            <li>Mehron is always a trusty brand for special effects makeup and can&#x27;t really let you down.</li>
            <li>I put it on my 8 yr old and he thought it was realistic.</li>
            <li>This makes scars super simple to do, you can choose how deep the scar is by using more or less of the product.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, worth the price!</li>
            <li>It fooled people up close and far away, and my project went so well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard of it but was insanely surprised!</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I get lazy and just want a magic product that will give the skin a scarred look or help create aging without having to make a latex prosthetic that I have to then blend edges on, or in areas where a prosthetic isn&#x27;t going to hold well.  </li>
            <li>We used a little lipstick liner to provide a deeper look to the scars but they turned out well and were easy to take off at the end of the night.</li>
            <li>it was on my face for too long after I peeled it off and left a huge mark.</li>
            <li>This was, more or less, a last minutes Halloween custom.</li>
            <li>and I had more than half the bottle left at that time</li>
            <li>It made &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; that looked so realistic that people I live with had to stop and ask me what happened, even if they knew I hadn&#x27;t gotten any scars to my face recently.</li>
            <li>I wish it was bigger because I used nearly the whole thing in one scarring session.</li>
            <li>I saw this stuff used before and was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t as deep as I had seen, I really had to build it up to get some depth.</li>
            <li>It is a tiny bottle and drys and peels fast.</li>
            <li>but it only takes a couple of coats before the &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; starts to become really noticeable.</li>
            <li>Although I do not recommend if you have suoer sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Though, you might not want to use it too often in the same place, as it really puckers the skin around it.</li>
            <li>As soon as I walked into work, my boss did a double take, thinking it was real.</li>
            <li>My son wanted scars for Halloween and this was by far the easiest way to do it.  </li>
            <li>This looked so realistic that people actually thought I cut my face.</li>
            <li>Actually, once it&#x27;s dry, I am usually able to simply pull it off; I just scrape a little bit at the edge to lift it a little, and it pulls off, mostly in one piece.  </li>
            <li>Super realistic when you put enough on and let it set for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This stuff is actually really cool, but keep in mind you are only given a tiny bit...a tiny tiny bit...per bottle.</li>
            <li>Padded envelope containing the bottle smelled strongly of the product and the fluid level in the bottle was a bit low when I received it, even though the packaging did not appear to have been opened and the cap was tightly attached.  </li>
            <li>Bottle came with only half full and the brush was seperated from the stem.</li>
            <li>I smudged a little lip liner to my skin before applying the rigid collodion and it looked like a fresh scar.</li>
            <li>The bad is, It was a lot smaller than i thought and when i opened the pack the bottle wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top.</li>
            <li>Layering 10-15 thin coats took about 10-15 mins and made beautifully believable scarring on my face.</li>
            <li>looks crazy good.</li>
            <li>make sure you close tightly, mine dried out</li>
            <li>First coat you should pull and hold the skin tight until it drys.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in short order - works great, the smell isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li>Great..Did not dry out like some reviews said</li>
            <li>Just watch a few tutorials first.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, however the listing said 1/4 oz when in reality I recieved a 1/8 oz.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with how fast it arrived and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff, very easy to apply and has a really great effect.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping &amp; great product.</li>
            <li> The look turned out really good, it does smell strongly and irritated my skin after i removed it.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the smell is very strong and chemical.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, too.  </li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Makes a great bite mark for zombies either \\&quot;healed\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh and bloody\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> There is an excellent instruction video on the Beautiful You channel on YouTube, and I&#x27;m sure many other channels as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a Great product I would recommend it to anyone look for great special effect for making realistic scars</li>
            <li> great fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> its okay</li>
            <li> I found you have to layer it on a bit more than the pricier version, but for non-professional endeavors, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for create scars at Halloween I have purchased 5 bottles over the last 2 years...</li>
            <li> just had more work</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> But besides that,I love this.</li>
            <li> Im glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more in the bottle for that price.</li>
            <li> (The tall guy played by Crispin Glover than the queen was in love with)</li>
            <li> More than once.</li>
            <li> This product works well for scars, in fact I haven&#x27;t seen anything work better for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I do wish it didn&#x27;t take so many coats to get the desired look, however.</li>
            <li> A lot of the magic that goes into the scar effect of this product is going to be achieved with shading and make up application, not the rigid collodion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of the finishing touch.</li>
            <li> Deeper scars require many applications which can be time consuming.</li>
            <li> As with all Mehron products... simply one of the best.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I needed this for Halloween and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s okay still</li>
            <li> We had a good laugh about that one.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this was going to work...</li>
            <li> Love it-the scars, not the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The more layers you apply, the deeper the scar effect will be.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> look around your area before you spend more than $4 online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure</li>
            <li> This worked WAY better than stick-on scars.</li>
            <li> It looks better when the pro uses it.</li>
            <li> I need  way More to do what I need to</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as intended!!!</li>
            <li> It was still in original packaging and works amazingly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good and for the price I will get more.</li>
            <li> This product arrived promptly and looked amazing with my DBZ costume, the special affect touch was spot on for my cosplay.</li>
            <li> Excited for halloween now!</li>
            <li> Easy to take off, no irritation what so ever on my side. :)</li>
            <li> smells strong but seems to work:)</li>
            <li> It applies quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> So, yeah we were thrilled with the purchase and highly recommend the seller!!!</li>
            <li> This sinks in the skin just perfectly.</li>
            <li> Other than that was awesome!</li>
            <li> Overall I Loved it!</li>
            <li> peels off too easily</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy to get the gist of after playing around with it.</li>
            <li> He had a scar design around his eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use, and</li>
            <li> easy to peel off too.</li>
            <li> Removal is not that easy, although it just requires peeling off the product.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and remove.</li>
            <li> strong</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong and foul that she would not allow me to try it on her face.  </li>
            <li> The smell is strong but it reminds me of the alcohol for nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Halloween costume, I tested it out last night, works great</li>
            <li> and it was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and it worked perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap and works well.</li>
            <li> So lightly powder or use make up over it.</li>
            <li> You will need to apply several coats (like7-10) for you to see great results.</li>
            <li> Contrary to it being listed as a toy, I don&#x27;t recommend letting kids handle it, but the scars it makes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> rigid collodion is a great product,but i found it for $3.50 at a local costume shop.</li>
            <li> takes many strokes to make a good solid scar, but it works as intended and doesn&#x27;t use tons to make the scar.</li>
            <li> Super cool!</li>
            <li> Easy.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I do not have a good picture to share, but if you combine it with other sfx procedures, you will be able to create some amazing realistic effects!</li>
            <li> BUT still worth it!</li>
            <li> deffinetly worth the money!</li>
            <li> A must for any special effects junkie.</li>
            <li> A must for anyone doing special effects makeup.  </li>
            <li> For best results, you will want to have some makeup handy to provide color and blending into the skin, so you can create anything from a fresh, angry looking scar to something that has had some time to heal.</li>
            <li> it was like 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> I used the hair dryer on cool to help blow the fumes away.</li>
            <li> cool stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well for making believable scars.  </li>
            <li> Most people thought it was real.</li>
            <li> but you really won&#x27;t need many.  </li>
            <li> Still not bad</li>
            <li> Every person who I showed pictures of my costume to was amazed; very professional item and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to work with and remove, and it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> comes off pretty easily, but stays in place for hours, even under stage lights.</li>
            <li> I had never bought this or used it before, but I found out quickly</li>
            <li> I received many compliments on how realistic the scarring looked.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it has a very potent smell and can burn while applying (depending on where you are applying).</li>
            <li> I used a hair dryer on &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; to speed the process, so it didn&#x27;t take that long to create a good looking 3D scar.</li>
            <li> This stuff is going to have to be pretty darned impressive and produce some seriously icky wounds before I decide to try ordering it again and take the chance on getting another defective bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the smell as super offensive as some other people do but it isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> Original reason to purchase this was because the price was decent, I got free shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this for an experiment that I was doing for my final psychology project, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Looks and feels real!!</li>
            <li> The product is good, but you can make more realistic makeups in other ways.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;ll actually make dents in your skin for a while.</li>
            <li> ask if the scars were real haha.</li>
            <li> It gives the appearance of a depressed shiny scar which can be greatly enhanced with a few touches of make up.</li>
            <li> This turned out amazingly and I was stopped several times by</li>
            <li> Saw someone using this on YouTube thought it was pretty cool</li>
            <li> fun to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The con about it is it smells,it kind od irratated my skin because its sensative I wish it was a lattle bigger</li>
            <li> Maybe this product would be better suited for an adult as opposed to a kid.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, but you do need a colored makeup pencil (in a pink/red tone) to create the realistic color of a fairly fresh scar, and foundation/powder to set it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be good for your skin to use it all the time, but for occasional use, it works really well.</li>
            <li> But I will have to hurry, especially considering the speed at which this stuff is disappearing on its own.  </li>
            <li> Makes realistic scars so easy to create for costumes and sfx.</li>
            <li> This product was a lot of fun to use.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing...use it for Halloween or just use it for fun...</li>
            <li> Works great, but the size is super small.</li>
            <li> The effect is very cool, but there isn&#x27;t much here to do a large job.  </li>
            <li> Compliment with Ben Nye, and you&#x27;re own your way to a good dramatic film.</li>
            <li> I have used rigid collodion many times in the past and have never had to use so much to get a good look.</li>
            <li> It took about 5 coats per &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; to get the right amount of pull and indentation.</li>
            <li> This product is great for small scars.</li>
            <li> the product worked great and made a great deep scar, but the suplied brush made it difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Without using any other makeup, it looked pretty good.</li>
            <li> scars, burns and some old age effects are easy to make with this product.  </li>
            <li> We were overall happy with the appearance until later in the night.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and price was very reasonable for the effect the product gives!</li>
            <li> so now I have to return it, pay more money, and wait for it to hopefully come back as the right order.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used this brand of collodion.</li>
            <li> Thank you soo much!</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast as well!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this stuff.</li>
            <li> best product for fake scaring.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the collodion so if this is your first time using it,</li>
            <li> Also, it smells quite strongly at first.</li>
            <li> It took a few coats to get a good, visable scar.</li>
            <li> It may come loose very easily.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this for my 11 year old who wanted to do up her face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a small bottle so use it wisely and test it on your skin first.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what it says it is thanks again</li>
            <li> Overall, the product was very helpful and very realilistic, just make sure you know how to use it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a red or brown eyeliner to give it a realistic look.</li>
            <li> With a touch of color, this stuff makes the most realistic scars that can be achieved without actually injuring yourself.  </li>
            <li> It works great for creating scars, punctures, and as a light coating over the entire face with a second layer on the accent points, can give a wrinkled aged make up.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really anything special as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t come off as easy as it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;It should last all day, and removes easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> but you may want to make sure you&#x27;re able to seal it as tight as possible.</li>
            <li> Also it takes quite a few layers before making a &amp;#34;scar.&amp;#34; I found that if I applied liquid latex first and THEN the rigid collodian, it made for a much more realistic and deep scar without as many layers.</li>
            <li> Went to lab with a huge facial scar and my PI was like \\&quot;WHAT</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anybody who has a costume that needs scars!</li>
            <li> Worked extremely fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
            <li> The product worked so well it looked so real.</li>
            <li> Looked real.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Very versatile.</li>
            <li> I had just enough to do a couple of practice rounds and about 5 nicely detailed scars.</li>
            <li> people hat assumed the scars were real.</li>
            <li> One friend of mine thought that really got into an accident.</li>
            <li> Finishes fast</li>
            <li> Such a cool and easy way to create facial scarring!!</li>
            <li> They stuck on all night long, and came off easy.</li>
            <li> I ended up using a hefty dose of this stuff, then put some scar wax over the top and cut it with a butter knife and added in different fake blood and coloring, and it worked AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Can go on top of other product and still will work.</li>
            <li> I had seen reviews of this online and was so excited when I had finally received it.</li>
            <li> and I was able to put a nice &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; down his face with a few layers.</li>
            <li> To make it last longer, clean the skin with alcohol before applying, and to remove it you can just peel it off.  </li>
            <li> This product is really cool to use especially since it works quite well</li>
            <li> I am giving two stars simply because it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is used to create realistic scars for effects makeup.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so realistic</li>
            <li> Realistic as heck.</li>
            <li> We stopped trying to make it look better when we realized that the collodion was starting to run a bit low.</li>
            <li> I needed it for realistic shrapnel scars on my face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> If you put it on an area of high movement, such as your cheek, and then smile or frown, it can cause the rigid collodion to peel off.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great for making a fake scar.</li>
            <li> actually I had to pretty much use my nails</li>
            <li> It does look shiny, though, so I would suggest some foundation or powder to use on top of it if you want to leave the scar plain.</li>
            <li> Great product, looks real but it burned my skin pretty bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but a bit expensive for my tastes, and it goes pretty fast because you need to layer it.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to see how I could use it to create some new simulated wounds for disaster drills.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to make realistic scars for Halloween, cosplay, purposes, or anything you need them for!</li>
            <li> Mehron is always a trusty brand for special effects makeup and can&#x27;t really let you down.</li>
            <li> I put it on my 8 yr old and he thought it was realistic.</li>
            <li> This makes scars super simple to do, you can choose how deep the scar is by using more or less of the product.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, worth the price!</li>
            <li> It fooled people up close and far away, and my project went so well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of it but was insanely surprised!</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I get lazy and just want a magic product that will give the skin a scarred look or help create aging without having to make a latex prosthetic that I have to then blend edges on, or in areas where a prosthetic isn&#x27;t going to hold well.  </li>
            <li> We used a little lipstick liner to provide a deeper look to the scars but they turned out well and were easy to take off at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> it was on my face for too long after I peeled it off and left a huge mark.</li>
            <li> This was, more or less, a last minutes Halloween custom.</li>
            <li> and I had more than half the bottle left at that time</li>
            <li> It made &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; that looked so realistic that people I live with had to stop and ask me what happened, even if they knew I hadn&#x27;t gotten any scars to my face recently.</li>
            <li> I wish it was bigger because I used nearly the whole thing in one scarring session.</li>
            <li> I saw this stuff used before and was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t as deep as I had seen, I really had to build it up to get some depth.</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bottle and drys and peels fast.</li>
            <li> but it only takes a couple of coats before the &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; starts to become really noticeable.</li>
            <li> Although I do not recommend if you have suoer sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Though, you might not want to use it too often in the same place, as it really puckers the skin around it.</li>
            <li> As soon as I walked into work, my boss did a double take, thinking it was real.</li>
            <li> My son wanted scars for Halloween and this was by far the easiest way to do it.  </li>
            <li> This looked so realistic that people actually thought I cut my face.</li>
            <li> Actually, once it&#x27;s dry, I am usually able to simply pull it off; I just scrape a little bit at the edge to lift it a little, and it pulls off, mostly in one piece.  </li>
            <li> Super realistic when you put enough on and let it set for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually really cool, but keep in mind you are only given a tiny bit...a tiny tiny bit...per bottle.</li>
            <li> Padded envelope containing the bottle smelled strongly of the product and the fluid level in the bottle was a bit low when I received it, even though the packaging did not appear to have been opened and the cap was tightly attached.  </li>
            <li> Bottle came with only half full and the brush was seperated from the stem.</li>
            <li> I smudged a little lip liner to my skin before applying the rigid collodion and it looked like a fresh scar.</li>
            <li> The bad is, It was a lot smaller than i thought and when i opened the pack the bottle wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top.</li>
            <li> Layering 10-15 thin coats took about 10-15 mins and made beautifully believable scarring on my face.</li>
            <li> looks crazy good.</li>
            <li> make sure you close tightly, mine dried out</li>
            <li> First coat you should pull and hold the skin tight until it drys.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in short order - works great, the smell isn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> Great..Did not dry out like some reviews said</li>
            <li> Just watch a few tutorials first.</li>
            <li> Dries fast - not a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it for much else besides scars yet, but I want to use it to create the &amp;#34;mummy&amp;#34; effect used on Boris Karloff.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little bit of patience as you will need to apply it in layers and wait for each layer to dry before applying the next.  </li>
            <li> Your skin might have redness/indentation on it for a while, if you used a lot, but it doesnt last too long and its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> it does indeed peel off, however with sensitive skin it will leave a slight red mark if you forget lotion.</li>
            <li> The product requires several applications with time in between to dry.</li>
            <li> Yes it smells, but only until dry.</li>
            <li> Just paint it on in the shape you want and let it dry, multiple coats strengthen the effect</li>
            <li> This past Halloween, my teenage daughter used it as part of her costume, which was based on a videogame character, so her clothing looked quite normal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not completely upset that I bought it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Shave the area or use something to cover it that won&#x27;t pull the hair out, and be careful peeling it back off.</li>
            <li> The product took so long to arrive that the shooting ended and it had&#x27;t yet arrived.</li>
            <li> Please dont just peel it off, apply any oil based makeup remover on first and then slowly and carefully remove it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this again for my Joker costume as well as for other costumes.</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this and with a little bit of pink lip-liner, it&#x27;s very realistic!</li>
            <li> However, when I looked at the bottle today it was completely dry.</li>
            <li> Gotta say, pretty annoyed</li>
            <li> It will dry the skin and leave a red mark for a few hours to a day after you remove it.  </li>
            <li> More crazy make up for granddaughter to mess with</li>
            <li> It takes so little that I shared it with all of my friends and still had a bunch left over!</li>
            <li> only critique was it started to peel a little bit when I moved my face</li>
            <li> This horribly smelly stuf makes great scars that do not need undercoloring as some videos would suggest.</li>
            <li> So buyers need to be careful.</li>
            <li> Parts of it pealed and others had to wet and peal or just rub off.  </li>
            <li> It helps to dab some pink eyeshadow around the edges to create an irritated look.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> carefully- AVOID EYE AREA.  </li>
            <li> I guess I kinda dove into it, not really knowing what I was getting.</li>
            <li> But oh well it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> AS WIDE</li>
            <li> I expected.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this stuff normally smells so harsh, but for my daughter, she was having no part of it.  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t touch it again until Halloween and by the time it was over, we had less than half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> all considered I have used other products that you almost had to take a pumice stone to get off.  </li>
            <li> Scary for real!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, just wash your face with a washcloth, like you might any other day.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure if this is a general problem or just a defective bottle because after a month it completely dried up in the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dried crusty like elmer&#x27;s glue and dried raised above the skin instead of creating an indentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived half empty, as photo revealed, non working .</li>
            <li> I felt a light burning sensation and taking it off hurt SOOOO bad.</li>
            <li> I lost half the product before I even get a chance to use it.  </li>
            <li> The bottle would also not full close which probably accounts for why half the bottle was evaporated and had chunks of the product floating in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a few days of removing the bottle from the packaging, the remaining product had evaporated down half way while the bottle was still tightly capped.  </li>
            <li> NOT skin that is already  tight to the bone.  </li>
            <li> The product smelled a little (though that goes away after it dries).</li>
            <li> Adding a little color underneath adds to the realism of the product and we were looked upon sympathetically for our scars...</li>
            <li> I put a little on my face,had to run errands and forgot about it.</li>
            <li> We tried a little dab on her hand.  </li>
            <li> it takes a little practice</li>
            <li> It peels up after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It should also be used over &#x27;fatty&#x27; skin.</li>
            <li> The smell does go away once it dries in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> : so it&#x27;s been a few months since Halloween</li>
            <li> I did a few test runs on my hand and my boyfriend&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Add a thin streak, then paint a small reddish blue streak from a zombie wheel for a deadly treat.</li>
            <li> It was a bit cheaper than my usual, which is why I tried it.</li>
            <li> just a small bottle</li>
            <li> The only downside is being unable to make expressions without messing up the effect.</li>
            <li> The bottles small</li>
            <li> Mine was shipped in a small box</li>
            <li> However, I was pretty disappointed in the size of it.</li>
            <li> It smells really horrible, though, so be sure to use in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Really small bottle.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s listed under toys??&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a timely fashion and was just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Put a base on your skin first so that it doesn&#x27;t rip off any skin or hairs when you have to tear it off.</li>
            <li> Does not pull off so hard to get off your skin.</li>
            <li> Defined scarring is hard to accomplish without makeup additions.</li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s the product that is extremely volatile, or the bottle, but I was expecting it to last longer and was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> That was hard (read &amp;#34;painful) to get out.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it might be uncomfortable, but besides making the area where it is applied a little stiff, I didn&#x27;t notice any discomfort.</li>
            <li> Mehron, as usual, does not disappoint!  </li>
            <li> VERY small bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> It was very small bottel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some people on YouTube say that the smell is bad, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as bad as they make it sound.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the questions about this \\&quot;toy\\&quot; in the review is kinda ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Brush sticky and useless to apply the remaining collodion that wouldnt work due to the broken brush .</li>
            <li> Spirit glue and acetone smell worse, at least to</li>
            <li> And at the market after school, one woman pushed her cart into a checkout stand, not watching where she was going because she was staring at my daughter so hard!  </li>
            <li> The collodion peels really badly, but can be covered up with just a little bit of makeup.</li>
            <li> It is VERY painful to remove off of facial peach fuz.</li>
            <li> but it still shocked me to see how small it was and for $7.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m allergic to it</li>
            <li> product did not create fake scars like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong item in the mail</li>
            <li> He was Heath Ledger&#x27;s Joker and I was a twisted version of Harley Quinn.</li>
            <li> but it does work at fake scars</li>
            <li> It reminded me a bit of a when I get Elmer&#x27;s glue on my skin (a very thin layer) and pull it off after it dries.</li>
            <li> The stuff smells horrible when wet.  </li>
            <li> had people at conventions (not joking, because they had that tentative awkward tone)</li>
            <li> Not at all bad.</li>
            <li> People at school were afraid to ask her about her face, because they didn&#x27;t want to offend her or seem insensitive!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells realy bad!</li>
            <li> Horrible quality, horrible smell.</li>
            <li> AWFUL QUALITY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did my face as bride of Frankenstein and the neck looked insane.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Quick shipping &amp; great product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exactly what it says it is thanks again</li>
            <li> Amazing. Will be purchasing again soon.</li>
            <li> Great product, looks real but it burned my skin pretty bad</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my Halloween costume as the joker this year. Exactly what I was looking for. The product smelled a little (though that goes away after it dries). Other than that was awesome!</li>
            <li> peels off too easily&lt;br /&gt;smells strong&lt;br /&gt;very VERY small bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but its okay</li>
            <li> great product, perfect condition, excellent price.</li>
            <li> I wish it was bigger because I used nearly the whole thing in one scarring session. I don&#x27;t find the smell as super offensive as some other people do but it isn&#x27;t pleasant. Layering 10-15 thin coats took about 10-15 mins and made beautifully believable scarring on my face. It is VERY painful to remove off of facial peach fuz. eek! BUT still worth it!</li>
            <li> More crazy make up for granddaughter to mess with</li>
            <li> It is a tiny bottle and drys and peels fast.</li>
            <li> Product dose not work just peels off the skin when drying</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Halloween costume, I tested it out last night, works great and it was comfortable to wear. I highly recommend it to anybody who has a costume that needs scars!</li>
            <li> Works great for creating scars.  Be sure to use a red or brown eyeliner to give it a realistic look.</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this and with a little bit of pink lip-liner, it&#x27;s very realistic! Not only that, but it only takes a couple of coats before the &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; starts to become really noticeable. It takes so little that I shared it with all of my friends and still had a bunch left over!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used this brand of collodion. It was a bit cheaper than my usual, which is why I tried it. I found you have to layer it on a bit more than the pricier version, but for non-professional endeavors, it gets the job done. Also great for beginners who are practicing. Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for create scars at Halloween I have purchased 5 bottles over the last 2 years...I wish the bottle was bigger</li>
            <li> The product itself is great for making a fake scar. I liked the product, however the listing said 1/4 oz when in reality I recieved a 1/8 oz. It&#x27;s listed on the bottle as 0.125 oz. So buyers need to be careful.</li>
            <li> I saw this stuff used before and was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t as deep as I had seen, I really had to build it up to get some depth. That being said it did do what I wanted in the end... just had more work then I thought would be needed. This stuff is pretty good and for the price I will get more.</li>
            <li> This product turned out better than I had pictured! Excited for halloween now! Thank you soo much! :) A+.  !</li>
            <li> Works great but smells like hell. ALso, keep in mind the area you are applying because it will hurt when you remove it. I used it on my cheeks and forehead. Overall I Loved it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually really cool, but keep in mind you are only given a tiny bit...a tiny tiny bit...per bottle. I ordered two so I should have enough for the use I have in mind. Other than that, worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this for an experiment that I was doing for my final psychology project, and I absolutely love it! It made &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; that looked so realistic that people I live with had to stop and ask me what happened, even if they knew I hadn&#x27;t gotten any scars to my face recently. It fooled people up close and far away, and my project went so well! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to make realistic scars for Halloween, cosplay, purposes, or anything you need them for!</li>
            <li> Adding a little color underneath adds to the realism of the product and we were looked upon sympathetically for our scars...great fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this prduct! Worked extremely fast. Can go on top of other product and still will work. Although I do not recommend if you have suoer sensitive skin. Shipping was extremely fast as well!</li>
            <li> I feel like the questions about this \\&quot;toy\\&quot; in the review is kinda ridiculous. But besides that,I love this. Mehron is always a trusty brand for special effects makeup and can&#x27;t really let you down. This stuff is easy to get the gist of after playing around with it. I wish they had it in bigger containers. I put a little on my face,had to run errands and forgot about it. I saw my sister in law,and she though I must have burnt my face! It&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;ll actually make dents in your skin for a while. A must for any special effects junkie. Easy to take off, no irritation what so ever on my side. :)</li>
            <li> Well the good part is i got my order in a day sooner. The bad is, It was a lot smaller than i thought and when i opened the pack the bottle wasn&#x27;t even filled to the top. it was like 3/4 full. I want to test it out before Halloween but i don&#x27;t want to waist it. I probably try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> I tested this on a couple different places on my body. Doesn&#x27;t really do what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do. I thought it was going to make a deep &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; looking scar but it doesn&#x27;t really do that. I&#x27;m not completely upset that I bought it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Saw someone using this on YouTube thought it was pretty cool so I ordered it.  Arrived in short order - works great, the smell isn&#x27;t that bad.  Only gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t come off as easy as it was supposed to.  It was a chore but does not peal off like shown.  Parts of it pealed and others had to wet and peal or just rub off.  Still not bad all considered I have used other products that you almost had to take a pumice stone to get off.  Definitely would order this product again.</li>
            <li> This looked so realistic that people actually thought I cut my face. It helps to dab some pink eyeshadow around the edges to create an irritated look.</li>
            <li> I have used rigid collodion many times in the past and have never had to use so much to get a good look. I am giving two stars simply because it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
            <li> It was Perfect! Im glad that I bought this product. I just wish there was more in the bottle for that price.</li>
            <li> This is probably a great product, but it just wasn&#x27;t what I needed and didn&#x27;t work at all for me. It reminded me a bit of a when I get Elmer&#x27;s glue on my skin (a very thin layer) and pull it off after it dries. It wasn&#x27;t really anything special as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> I used this for a female knave of hearts from burton&#x27;s alice in wonderland. (The tall guy played by Crispin Glover than the queen was in love with) He had a scar design around his eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use, and fun to experiment with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had people at conventions (not joking, because they had that tentative awkward tone) ask if the scars were real haha. More than once. Others, just admired it and said it looked so real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to peel off too. Your skin might have redness/indentation on it for a while, if you used a lot, but it doesnt last too long and its not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved my rigid collodion and I used it for SFX makeup a lot. But I&#x27;m not sure if this is a general problem or just a defective bottle because after a month it completely dried up in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the product is amazing but you may want to make sure you&#x27;re able to seal it as tight as possible.</li>
            <li> This product works well for scars, in fact I haven&#x27;t seen anything work better for that purpose. I do wish it didn&#x27;t take so many coats to get the desired look, however. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> A lot of the magic that goes into the scar effect of this product is going to be achieved with shading and make up application, not the rigid collodion. It&#x27;s more of the finishing touch. The product requires several applications with time in between to dry. It gives the appearance of a depressed shiny scar which can be greatly enhanced with a few touches of make up. Deeper scars require many applications which can be time consuming. Additionally, the smell is very strong and chemical.</li>
            <li> I had never bought this or used it before, but I found out quickly you need to treat it like latex. Shave the area or use something to cover it that won&#x27;t pull the hair out, and be careful peeling it back off. It&#x27;s nice, but a bit expensive for my tastes, and it goes pretty fast because you need to layer it.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing. The con about it is it smells,it kind od irratated my skin because its sensative I wish it was a lattle bigger but the price was amazing! deffinetly worth the money!</li>
            <li> Thanks!! I used it a few times and it worked perfectly!!! I will buy it again and again for halloween</li>
            <li> Works exactly as intended!!! Sadly, I&#x27;m allergic to it but my husband isn&#x27;t and I was able to put a nice &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; down his face with a few layers. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> awesome for Gamora guardians of the galaxy scars on her face! this with silver pencil and the face paint. looks crazy good. just a small bottle so it lasted for 2 occasions.</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome product, I will buy it again if needed!!</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly! Used it for my daughter&#x27;s Jeff the Killer costume and everyone loved it!!</li>
            <li> This product arrived promptly and looked amazing with my DBZ costume, the special affect touch was spot on for my cosplay.</li>
            <li> This product is great for small scars. Add a thin streak, then paint a small reddish blue streak from a zombie wheel for a deadly treat. As with all Mehron products... simply one of the best. Compliment with Ben Nye, and you&#x27;re own your way to a good dramatic film.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It gives a really good scar look. Shipping was fast and price was very reasonable for the effect the product gives! I would so recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Will go well with my Halloween. Costume this year</li>
            <li> smells strong but seems to work:)</li>
            <li> you need a bigger bottel to do a lot of work and get the effect you want. shipping took forever</li>
            <li> The product worked so well it looked so real. I put it on my 8 yr old and he thought it was realistic. The fumes where a bit stronge so as I applied I used the hair dryer on cool to help blow the fumes away.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected. I needed this for Halloween and I was pleased with the results. The only thing is that it has a very potent smell and can burn while applying (depending on where you are applying). Also it takes quite a few layers before making a &amp;#34;scar.&amp;#34; I found that if I applied liquid latex first and THEN the rigid collodian, it made for a much more realistic and deep scar without as many layers.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed.  I feel like a bit of model glue could&#x27;ve done the same job cheaper.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality, horrible smell. Didn&#x27;t work at all... Make my skin look wrinkled not scarred...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It applies quickly and effectively. The only downside is being unable to make expressions without messing up the effect. If you put it on an area of high movement, such as your cheek, and then smile or frown, it can cause the rigid collodion to peel off.</li>
            <li> I used this product for halloween this year. I received many compliments on how realistic the scarring looked. It lasted all night and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. This was my first time using this stuff.The scars look so real.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s easy to work with and remove, and it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have tried the product and it didn&#x27;t do anything, will have to experiment with it.  No Fault of the seller, it was a prepackaged item</li>
            <li> I thought this was amazon prime but it took almost a week to get here. The product is good and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Makes great scars! And peels off like snake skin.</li>
            <li> Drama Class needed this, perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, to finish up his cosplay for Katsucon in February. I&#x27;d never heard of it but was insanely surprised! It&#x27;s the wildest stuff i&#x27;ve seen!!! So, yeah we were thrilled with the purchase and highly recommend the seller!!!</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this for my 11 year old who wanted to do up her face.  We tried a little dab on her hand.  The smell was so strong and foul that she would not allow me to try it on her face.  I am not sure if this stuff normally smells so harsh, but for my daughter, she was having no part of it.  Maybe this product would be better suited for an adult as opposed to a kid.</li>
            <li> The bottles small I thought it will be a bigger bottle that&#x27;s okay still a great product so three stars</li>
            <li> cool stuff. Looked real.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well for making believable scars.  Though, you might not want to use it too often in the same place, as it really puckers the skin around it.</li>
            <li> Not the best for making scars. It peels up after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This product is used to create realistic scars for effects makeup.  This past Halloween, my teenage daughter used it as part of her costume, which was based on a videogame character, so her clothing looked quite normal.  People at school were afraid to ask her about her face, because they didn&#x27;t want to offend her or seem insensitive!  And at the market after school, one woman pushed her cart into a checkout stand, not watching where she was going because she was staring at my daughter so hard!  We had a good laugh about that one.  The product is easy to use, but you do need a colored makeup pencil (in a pink/red tone) to create the realistic color of a fairly fresh scar, and foundation/powder to set it.  Removal is not that easy, although it just requires peeling off the product.  The stuff smells horrible when wet.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be good for your skin to use it all the time, but for occasional use, it works really well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Watched a tutorial online and then used this and it was awesome.  Looks and feels real!!</li>
            <li> Scary for real! Works as advertised in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!  Very easy to use.  Mehron has great products.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the product. The look turned out really good, it does smell strongly and irritated my skin after i removed it.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing to create scars for Halloween... we use it to create scars when we wear as pirates for the renaissance fairs. I love it !!!</li>
            <li> I felt a light burning sensation and taking it off hurt SOOOO bad. I got a lot of great comments about it on Halloween though</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I smudged a little lip liner to my skin before applying the rigid collodion and it looked like a fresh scar. Most people thought it was real.</li>
            <li> A must for anyone doing special effects makeup.  scars, burns and some old age effects are easy to make with this product.  comes off pretty easily, but stays in place for hours, even under stage lights.</li>
            <li> Padded envelope containing the bottle smelled strongly of the product and the fluid level in the bottle was a bit low when I received it, even though the packaging did not appear to have been opened and the cap was tightly attached.  Within a few days of removing the bottle from the packaging, the remaining product had evaporated down half way while the bottle was still tightly capped.  So not a fan of the packaging and the fact I lost half the product before I even get a chance to use it.  Still haven&#x27;t played with it, so I can&#x27;t comment on the quality or if it actually works as advertised.  But I will have to hurry, especially considering the speed at which this stuff is disappearing on its own.  Original reason to purchase this was because the price was decent, I got free shipping and I wanted to see how I could use it to create some new simulated wounds for disaster drills.  This stuff is going to have to be pretty darned impressive and produce some seriously icky wounds before I decide to try ordering it again and take the chance on getting another defective bottle.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered it on a Sunday and got it by Saturday. Two days earlier than planned and it&#x27;s cheap and works well. The smell is strong but it reminds me of the alcohol for nails. Mine was shipped in a small box so it wouldn&#x27;t be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a small bottle so use it wisely and test it on your skin first. It constricts your skin as you apply layers to make it look like the scar effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy from again!</li>
            <li> Works like it&#x27;s supposed to.  A warning.. It will dry the skin and leave a red mark for a few hours to a day after you remove it.  It should also be used over &#x27;fatty&#x27; skin. NOT skin that is already  tight to the bone.  Must be used carefully- AVOID EYE AREA.  Yes it smells, but only until dry. Since I teach Theatrical make-up I&#x27;ll give a hit on applying.  First coat you should pull and hold the skin tight until it drys.  Then each coat after that will make the scar deeper into the skin.  Don&#x27;t try to put it over an area such as an elbow or moving joint.  It may come loose very easily. It will be shiny. So lightly powder or use make up over it.</li>
            <li> INITIAL IMPRESSION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked AMAZING for scars for my Joker costume. GET IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, halfway through the night the scars will start to peel, and you&#x27;ll look even creepier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck &amp;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If the item does not hold up over time I WILL update my review and lend my experience to all of you.)</li>
            <li> Would never buy again. Does not pull off so hard to get off your skin.</li>
            <li> best product for fake scaring. only downside is the smell before it dries. Potent!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. AWFUL QUALITY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not create fake scars like it&#x27;s supposed to. It dried crusty like elmer&#x27;s glue and dried raised above the skin instead of creating an indentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this was going to work...but it did and it was awesome.  it takes a little practice but I was very happy with my Halloween makeup and scars!</li>
            <li> Bottle came with only half full and the brush was seperated from the stem. The bottle would also not full close which probably accounts for why half the bottle was evaporated and had chunks of the product floating in it.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This horribly smelly stuf makes great scars that do not need undercoloring as some videos would suggest. The smell does go away once it dries in a few minutes. Love it-the scars, not the smell.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I served a lot for what you buy.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it again. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;We were very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It took forever to take off actually I had to pretty much use my nails cause it was on my face for too long after I peeled it off and left a huge mark.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I get lazy and just want a magic product that will give the skin a scarred look or help create aging without having to make a latex prosthetic that I have to then blend edges on, or in areas where a prosthetic isn&#x27;t going to hold well.  This is when I reach for the Rigid Collodion.  It works great for creating scars, punctures, and as a light coating over the entire face with a second layer on the accent points, can give a wrinkled aged make up.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Comes of within a couple of hours. Defined scarring is hard to accomplish without makeup additions.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  Makes realistic scars so easy to create for costumes and sfx. I bought this for Halloween last year and put a scar on my face.  As soon as I walked into work, my boss did a double take, thinking it was real. I haven&#x27;t tried it for much else besides scars yet, but I want to use it to create the &amp;#34;mummy&amp;#34; effect used on Boris Karloff.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little bit of patience as you will need to apply it in layers and wait for each layer to dry before applying the next.  The more layers you apply, the deeper the scar effect will be.  I used a hair dryer on &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; to speed the process, so it didn&#x27;t take that long to create a good looking 3D scar. For best results, you will want to have some makeup handy to provide color and blending into the skin, so you can create anything from a fresh, angry looking scar to something that has had some time to heal. There is an excellent instruction video on the Beautiful You channel on YouTube, and I&#x27;m sure many other channels as well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some people on YouTube say that the smell is bad, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as bad as they make it sound.  Spirit glue and acetone smell worse, at least to me.&lt;br /&gt;It should last all day, and removes easily with soap and water. Actually, once it&#x27;s dry, I am usually able to simply pull it off; I just scrape a little bit at the edge to lift it a little, and it pulls off, mostly in one piece.  Otherwise, just wash your face with a washcloth, like you might any other day. Easy.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I do not have a good picture to share, but if you combine it with other sfx procedures, you will be able to create some amazing realistic effects!</li>
            <li> Great..Did not dry out like some reviews said</li>
            <li> I got the wrong item in the mail so now I have to return it, pay more money, and wait for it to hopefully come back as the right order.</li>
            <li> This is just a really good product to make some gnarly scars with. It is at a good price and works as it is to be intended. Bottom line, I love it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!!!!  Makes a great bite mark for zombies either \\&quot;healed\\&quot; or \\&quot;fresh and bloody\\&quot;.  This makes scars super simple to do, you can choose how deep the scar is by using more or less of the product.  Very versatile.</li>
            <li> The thing worked as advertised. However, I was pretty disappointed in the size of it. I guess I kinda dove into it, not really knowing what I was getting. It was very small bottel. Smaller than the regular nail polish bottle. I had just enough to do a couple of practice rounds and about 5 nicely detailed scars.</li>
            <li> I had seen reviews of this online and was so excited when I had finally received it. It was still in original packaging and works amazingly.</li>
            <li> Works great, but the size is super small. Smaller than a nail polish bottle. You will need to apply several coats (like7-10) for you to see great results.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for making scars! Will use again.</li>
            <li> Such a cool and easy way to create facial scarring!!</li>
            <li> This product is really cool to use especially since it works quite well but the reason for 3 stars is because of two things. 1. It said 3-5 day shipping when I took a week. 2. I know the product description gives you the amount it is but it still shocked me to see how small it was and for $7. But oh well it was money well spent. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> the product worked great and made a great deep scar, but the suplied brush made it difficult to apply.  Smells realy bad!</li>
            <li> Oh my gourd, this stuff is AWESOME!  Mehron, as usual, does not disappoint!  Contrary to it being listed as a toy, I don&#x27;t recommend letting kids handle it, but the scars it makes are fantastic.  With a touch of color, this stuff makes the most realistic scars that can be achieved without actually injuring yourself.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, too.  Just paint it on in the shape you want and let it dry, multiple coats strengthen the effect but you really won&#x27;t need many.  To make it last longer, clean the skin with alcohol before applying, and to remove it you can just peel it off.  Don&#x27;t put it on the same spot for days in a row, though, so it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.  I love this stuff, it&#x27;s so realistic and you don&#x27;t have to worry about color-matching it to your skin like with latex appliances.</li>
            <li> Arrived half empty, as photo revealed, non working . Brush sticky and useless to apply the remaining collodion that wouldnt work due to the broken brush .</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I did my face as bride of Frankenstein and the neck looked insane. Very effective.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product I would recommend it to anyone look for great special effect for making realistic scars</li>
            <li> rigid collodion is a great product,but i found it for $3.50 at a local costume shop. look around your area before you spend more than $4 online.</li>
            <li> I had seen someone use this on a youtube video to make scars, so I decided to give it a try for my upcoming Halloween look. I drew the line of the scar on with some lipliner and went over it with the rigid collodion. It took several (maybe 8 or 9) layers to get the look I wanted. Without using any other makeup, it looked pretty good. It does look shiny, though, so I would suggest some foundation or powder to use on top of it if you want to leave the scar plain. I was worried that it might be uncomfortable, but besides making the area where it is applied a little stiff, I didn&#x27;t notice any discomfort. It smells really horrible, though, so be sure to use in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> This product was a lot of fun to use.  My son wanted scars for Halloween and this was by far the easiest way to do it.  We used a little lipstick liner to provide a deeper look to the scars but they turned out well and were easy to take off at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff, very easy to apply and has a really great effect. Takes five - ten minutes to stop smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside- it does indeed peel off, however with sensitive skin it will leave a slight red mark if you forget lotion. So, remember to bring lotion!</li>
            <li> This was, more or less, a last minutes Halloween custom. This turned out amazingly and I was stopped several times by people hat assumed the scars were real.</li>
            <li> Went to lab with a huge facial scar and my PI was like \\&quot;WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE??!!\\&quot; I just said something about lab rivalry and publish or perish...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only critique was it started to peel a little bit when I moved my face a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2/13/2013: so it&#x27;s been a few months since Halloween and I had more than half the bottle left at that time, I figured I can keep it and use it again next Halloween. However, when I looked at the bottle today it was completely dry. I&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s the product that is extremely volatile, or the bottle, but I was expecting it to last longer and was a bit disappointed. So I lowered my rating on this product because of that reason.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Realistic as heck. I reccomend using this product and the source is reliable. Just watch a few tutorials first.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for me and my boyfriend&#x27;s Halloween costume. He was Heath Ledger&#x27;s Joker and I was a twisted version of Harley Quinn. I ordered the package on the Sunday before Halloween and it arrived the Wednesday before. I was very happy with how fast it arrived and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. I did a few test runs on my hand and my boyfriend&#x27;s face. It took a few coats to get a good, visable scar. We stopped trying to make it look better when we realized that the collodion was starting to run a bit low. We didn&#x27;t touch it again until Halloween and by the time it was over, we had less than half a bottle left. We did about three layers of the collodion on each of our scars. We were overall happy with the appearance until later in the night. The collodion peels really badly, but can be covered up with just a little bit of makeup. This was my first time using the collodion so if this is your first time using it, IF YOURE PUTTING SCARS ON YOUR MOUTH OPEN YOUR MOUTH AS WIDE AS YOU CAN.  When we tried to eat at a Halloween party, we ripped off the start of the scars by our mouths and by the time we started to head home, we had dangling scars. Overall, the product was very helpful and very realilistic, just make sure you know how to use it.</li>
            <li> Super cool! A bit smelly but great effects!</li>
            <li> Dries fast - not a strong smell.  I use this to create scars on arms/hands/face and it is AMAZINGLY simple.</li>
            <li> This worked WAY better than stick-on scars. I will definitely be using this again for my Joker costume as well as for other costumes. They stuck on all night long, and came off easy. The only problem I had was that I didn&#x27;t shave my beard all the way off, and the &amp;#34;scars&amp;#34; went through the hair from the corner of my mouth. That was hard (read &amp;#34;painful) to get out.</li>
            <li> Use this product with Care. Put a base on your skin first so that it doesn&#x27;t rip off any skin or hairs when you have to tear it off. Does the job nicely. I needed it for realistic shrapnel scars on my face. Very convincing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last Halloween to make scars for my joker&#x27;s costume.  This stuff is UNREAL.  Every person who I showed pictures of my costume to was amazed; very professional item and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Super realistic when you put enough on and let it set for a few minutes. One friend of mine thought that really got into an accident.</li>
            <li> Unlike advertised I received .125 fl oz of rigid collodion not .25  Gotta say, pretty annoyed</li>
            <li> Love it! Easy to use and remove. Please dont just peel it off, apply any oil based makeup remover on first and then slowly and carefully remove it. Dont just scratch off because it would just hurt.</li>
            <li> I bought for the makeup team of a film I was producing. The product took so long to arrive that the shooting ended and it had&#x27;t yet arrived. The product is good, but you can make more realistic makeups in other ways. Search about it on the internet!</li>
            <li> The bottle is teeny tiny. Smaller than a chapstick. The product didn&#x27;t work quite like I expected. I watched MadeYewLook on YouTube and saw this product used. It looks better when the pro uses it. Also, it smells quite strongly at first. Like to the point of almost making my eyes water.</li>
            <li> Really small bottle. Finishes fast but it does work at fake scars</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Not sure why it&#x27;s listed under toys??&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a timely fashion and was just as advertised.</li>
            <li> make sure you close tightly, mine dried out</li>
            <li> The bottle is way too tiny...I need  way More to do what I need to</li>
            <li> Not at all bad. takes many strokes to make a good solid scar, but it works as intended and doesn&#x27;t use tons to make the scar. it kinda itches and still looking for a solution to that, as the itching is probably caused by the skin tightening. but is good.</li>
            <li> The effect is very cool, but there isn&#x27;t much here to do a large job.  It took about 5 coats per &amp;#34;scar&amp;#34; to get the right amount of pull and indentation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing...use it for Halloween or just use it for fun...prob one of the best stuff I have ever used...totally recommend it</li>
            <li> This sinks in the skin just perfectly. I ended up using a hefty dose of this stuff, then put some scar wax over the top and cut it with a butter knife and added in different fake blood and coloring, and it worked AMAZING! God I love this stuff. Thank you for creating it! 5/5</li>
