            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>When he starts to run out, he tells me we&#x27;re &amp;#34;dangerously low&amp;#34; and I hurry to order more.</li>
            <li>You can go to the site www.marykay.com/cramlow and you can receive free shipping and free samples, and if you get two sets, you can even get a free gift!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually used in on my feet also and results were amazing!  :)</li>
            <li>Thank you for your quick response!</li>
            <li>I bought the set, and LOVE that it is fragrance free because I have sensitive skin that breaks out in rashes very easily, and I don&#x27;t need perfumes in my soap or lotions.</li>
            <li>the fact that my elbows have lost their callouses  and my hands look younger than I am instead of older is just a wonderful added plus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far one of the best products for getting my hands soft and smooth for the whole day - love this stuff</li>
            <li>This is a great help for my extremely dry hands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay facial products for a while, and have been thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine as far as softening the hands</li>
            <li>my hands were nice and soft not rough</li>
            <li>It is so quick and easy to use and my hands go from very rough to smooth and soft  quickly.</li>
            <li>I first received a small gift set, and loved it so much that I bought some for myself, and another set for my mom.  </li>
            <li>Hands are super soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>an official independent consultant to ensure that you receive fresh, full product.</li>
            <li>The softener is the first step, then the scrub, then after rinsing, you can enjoy the hand lotion, and you will have amazingly, wonderfully soft, younger looking hands.</li>
            <li>thank you for little gifts inside :)</li>
            <li>and my hands are baby soft!  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this set, it was given to me as a sample, and I washed my hands like normal all day long</li>
            <li>When I used the product my hands did feel satinly soft.  </li>
            <li>Just as the product name implies, my hands feel incredibly soft after using the set.  </li>
            <li>She has found this a way to help her hands feel soft again.</li>
            <li>I just completely love the look of my hands, now, and as a health care professional, I wash my hands constantly and work with anti-bacterial agents and rubbing alcohol and it dried my skin out before I started using these products.</li>
            <li>and they stayed super soft all day long, and looked amazingly younger!</li>
            <li>Every time my hands touch water, they get so dry, specially the finger tips where the skin sometimes gets a cut just from being dry.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just the general health of my skin,</li>
            <li>Now, I can wash my hands all day long and still have young, supple, soft hands all day.</li>
            <li>I only use the sensitive formula.</li>
            <li>I first used a version of this Mary Kay product a few years ago.  </li>

            <li> My hands have not been as rough as sandpaper and my elbows are no longer cracking and bleeding (there were times when my hands would too, my elbows were the worst)  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed to see that the products contained parabens.</li>
