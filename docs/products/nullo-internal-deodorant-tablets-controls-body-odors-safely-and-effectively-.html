            <li>I checked with my doctor to be sure there was nothing harmful to my system</li>
            <li>-term copper toxicity has been linked to stomach and lung cancers, so oral use of supplements with dangerously high levels of copper could greatly increase risk of stomach cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN AND AROUND THE PUBLIC.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is little comfort to suggest that the best way to tackle it is through diet and hiding it through bathroom products, as I know it is inadequate.</li>

            <li>I cut back to one pill and that is the dosage that is good for me.  </li>
            <li>Husband has permanent colostomy and these pills cut the smell of his colostomy irrigation tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t received my order yet, but from previous experience its a great product</li>
            <li>i feel that it was ok, it didn&#x27;t do everthing that i have hoped, maybe sometime in the near future it can be more potent, new and improved.</li>

            <li>It really does work like it says.</li>
            <li>I had so much faith in this chlorophyll</li>
            <li>it is a very worrying symptom and not a desirable long-term effect.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It eliminated any body odor better than any other product I tried.</li>
            <li>The side effects of using Nullo suggest it could contain far higher than safe amounts of copper, even taking 1/2/pill per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Symptoms of copper toxicity include black, tarry stools; stomach cramps;</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something in the pills that makes this happen, it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>you do use Nullo, consult a specialist GI doctor first, be conservative with doses (do not take whole pills at a time), monitor all of the side effects and have regular check ups.his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The only thing I would suggest is for the first two weeks to just take one pill a day so that way it gets into your body etc</li>
            <li>I only say that because when I was taking one pill day it just messed with my &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s all up to you and how much you can handle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Black tarry stools are symptomatic of bleeding in the stomach or gastrointestinal tract, it is a very worrying sign and if it occurs you should discontinue use and seek medical help.</li>
            <li>Only when I went to a specialist in bariatric surgery in New York City</li>
            <li>Green stools indicate that food has passed through the bowels too quickly, not allowing time for bile to healthily digest food.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Having green stools from using Nullo is not necessarily harmless either, and likely not caused by the chlorophyllin or a dye in the pills.</li>
            <li> Other symptoms include heart/chest pains or other pains such as shooting pains in the arms; fatigue and achiness.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> i have different beands in the past but for whatever strange resson when this moves through my system</li>
            <li> I definitely will not be buying this ever again and will be throwing the few remaining pills in the nearest trash can.</li>
            <li> , not only does it control odor, your poop is green in color.</li>
            <li> Bile is green when produced, but turns yellow and then brown in the bowel as food is emulsified and digested.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Copper is an ingredient of Nullo; other copper supplements are sold in 2mg tablets, with as little as 10mg/day being potentially harmful.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a dye in the pills (they&#x27;re green) or if it&#x27;s something natural in the pills themselves.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE BLACK PILL DEFINITELY WORKS!  </li>
            <li> Usually after about  10 days is when I notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to make this product part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> diarrhrea and/or constipation; other changes in bowel habits such as a long-term change in size, shape, colour or consistency, e.g. thin &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; stools could indicate a blockage in the stomach or bowel, potentially caused by a tumour or cancer.</li>
            <li> and after that you can cut your usage to half a pill a day.</li>
            <li> believe that Nullo pills contain toxic amounts of copper, even if you are taking as little as 1/2 or 1/4 of a pull per day.</li>

            <li> Besides body oders your poop won&#x27;t smell either, though it will turn green.</li>
            <li> The metabolism is a delicate balance and it is unnatural and harmful to speed it up in this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nothing else has worked as we&#x27;ll to treat my bad breath from constant nasal drainage.</li>
            <li> I understand and sympathise, but this is not a good solution.</li>

            <li> I have always had bad breath problems, even as a child.</li>
            <li> However, it gave me a bad stomach ache.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have bad breath or body odor.</li>
            <li> To say that I am very disappointed would be an understatement given the fact that I did not notice any reduction at all in body odor.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nullo did not work for me though I took the maximum dosage advised.Given the fact that I did not have ANY reaction at all to taking the pills, I upped the dosage to the maximum daily dose(3 pills) in the hopes of reducing body odor. To say that I am very disappointed would be an understatement given the fact that I did not notice any reduction at all in body odor. I definitely will not be buying this ever again and will be throwing the few remaining pills in the nearest trash can.</li>
            <li> I am a hunter and using Nullo keeps my body oder to a minimum. It is chlorophyll so I don&#x27;t have issues with taking an &#x27;over the counter&#x27; drug. Very safe at any dose.</li>
            <li> I have used this for some time, and it is very effective</li>
            <li> I waited about a year and did my research before I took the plunge and bought Nullo. It really does work like it says. The only thing I would suggest is for the first two weeks to just take one pill a day so that way it gets into your body etc and after that you can cut your usage to half a pill a day. I only say that because when I was taking one pill day it just messed with my &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s all up to you and how much you can handle.</li>
            <li> I have always had bad breath problems, even as a child. I floss, brush, scrape my tongue, and see my dentist regularly. This seems to help.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not this was being used on patients in a facility I was working at ,which is how I discovered it. IT WORKS folks. Besides body oders your poop won&#x27;t smell either, though it will turn green. There&#x27;s something in the pills that makes this happen, it&#x27;s normal. Not sure if it&#x27;s a dye in the pills (they&#x27;re green) or if it&#x27;s something natural in the pills themselves. Those who have a colostomy will find this helpful as well. Putting an aspirin in your colostomy bag also helps some.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - regret the doctor&#x27;s I&#x27;d been going to didn&#x27;t know anything about this over the counter product. Only when I went to a specialist in bariatric surgery in New York City did I find out this existed. I&#x27;m so grateful to Dr Mitch Roslyn for telling me about it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t received my order yet, but from previous experience its a great product</li>
            <li> this product is very effective for constipation., not only does it control odor, your poop is green in color.Wonderful choice</li>
            <li> I had so much faith in this chlorophyll i have different beands in the past but for whatever strange resson when this moves through my system i smelled of weed</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do!  I could see the change in about 8 to 10 days.</li>
            <li> I dislike taking pills but I do take one Nullo a day because it is so effective.  It does what it says, stops odors from your body.  When I first began taking it, I took two pills and got \\&quot;the trots.\\&quot;  I cut back to one pill and that is the dosage that is good for me.  I checked with my doctor to be sure there was nothing harmful to my system and she gave me the go ahead.  This is one great product.  Check around because the prices vary on line quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I got cramps and diarrhea from this product.  I had to discontinue using the product.  I would not reccomend it.</li>
            <li> This works, People!!!</li>
            <li> Please consult your doctor before use of this product, and keep in mind that it is a dietary supplement rather than a clinical medicine, meaning that it is not held to the same rigorous testing or safety requirements that prescription drugs are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copper is an ingredient of Nullo; other copper supplements are sold in 2mg tablets, with as little as 10mg/day being potentially harmful. The side effects of using Nullo suggest it could contain far higher than safe amounts of copper, even taking 1/2/pill per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Symptoms of copper toxicity include black, tarry stools; stomach cramps; diarrhrea and/or constipation; other changes in bowel habits such as a long-term change in size, shape, colour or consistency, e.g. thin &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; stools could indicate a blockage in the stomach or bowel, potentially caused by a tumour or cancer.

The symptoms of copper toxicity are similar to that of stomach cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having green stools from using Nullo is not necessarily harmless either, and likely not caused by the chlorophyllin or a dye in the pills. Bile is green when produced, but turns yellow and then brown in the bowel as food is emulsified and digested. Green stools indicate that food has passed through the bowels too quickly, not allowing time for bile to healthily digest food. Hand in hand with diarrhrea it is a very worrying symptom and not a desirable long-term effect. The metabolism is a delicate balance and it is unnatural and harmful to speed it up in this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that Nullo pills contain toxic amounts of copper, even if you are taking as little as 1/2 or 1/4 of a pull per day. Taking 2-3 pills a day is obscene, and one guideline for use of Nullo online suggests you can take 2-3 pills twice a day, which highlights the lack of consistency and legitimacy in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realise that many people reading this will suffer from crippling anxiety from chronic body odor issues caused by hormonal activity outside of their control. I understand and sympathise, but this is not a good solution. It is little comfort to suggest that the best way to tackle it is through diet and hiding it through bathroom products, as I know it is inadequate. Please do not take risks with your health. Do not let desperation to fix a problem overcome your sense and rationality.&lt;br /&gt;If you do use Nullo, consult a specialist GI doctor first, be conservative with doses (do not take whole pills at a time), monitor all of the side effects and have regular check ups.his way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that Nullo pills contain toxic amounts of copper, even if you are taking as little as 1/2 or 1/4 of a pull per day.

            <li> This product is great; smell wise. It eliminated any body odor better than any other product I tried. However, it gave me a bad stomach ache. Now maybe because I took 2 a day?? If I try it again I will find out, but each body is different.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE BLACK PILL DEFINITELY WORKS!  I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN AND AROUND THE PUBLIC.&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I works well and serves the purpose.  I have purchased it multiple times and will purchase it again as needed.</li>
            <li> works!!!!!!! works!!!!!!! works!!!!!!!!! I love this stuff!!!!  I will buy it again, great for travel, don&#x27;t have to worry about stinky pitts lol.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very effective in the removal of my body odor.</li>
            <li> Is good very good. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I received my order in a timely manner and, this is a great product. I decided to try Nullo for a while before posting a rating. Nullo works great for me.</li>
            <li> For those of us who have bad breath or body odor. Nothing else has worked as we&#x27;ll to treat my bad breath from constant nasal drainage.</li>
            <li> i feel that it was ok, it didn&#x27;t do everthing that i have hoped, maybe sometime in the near future it can be more potent, new and improved.</li>
            <li> Husband has permanent colostomy and these pills cut the smell of his colostomy irrigation tremendously.  EVERY colostomy patient should take these pills.  If you struggle with odour, buy these - one pill 2x a day.</li>
            <li> I used this product in the past and had great results. Usually after about  10 days is when I notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to make this product part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it for assisting to keep female dogs in season&lt;br /&gt;from being &amp;#34;too attractive&amp;#34; to the males and avoid breeding problems. It&lt;br /&gt;limits the time I need to separate them.</li>
