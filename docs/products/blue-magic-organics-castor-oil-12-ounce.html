            <li>and there are really good ingredients in it</li>
            <li>Shipping and packaging was good.</li>

            <li>The biggest drawback is this product is mostly Petroleum Jelly!</li>
            <li>Seller was very good, shipped and received very fast, this product has a heavenly scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this simply because theres a lady on the reviews exaggerating on how wonderful this product was to her son&#x27;s bald spot.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped someone :)</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>Yet, I was fooled because it&#x27;s mostly a jar of vaseline</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>I have dry hair, so softer curls is great for my hair.</li>
            <li>I would not mind buying this product again because it is very light on the hair, it is made with all natural ingredients, and it is super healthy for the hair.</li>
            <li>Anyways i got this mainly because my father has some bald spots on the sides and also because i have very fine baby hairs on my sides as well</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this a star is because it smells really good</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the smell, it&#x27;s a sort of sweet flowery/powdery scent.</li>
            <li>I have to make my own concoctions for my make-up too since I am mixed</li>
            <li>this product would be perfect for guys with braids or little ones that need that extra moisture.</li>
            <li>and I too have about 2 inches of new growth!!!</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp seem to like very much.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair care product, it delivers!  </li>
            <li>I read the review about the lady that used this on her son&#x27;s braids and later the hair had magically grown, wellll...</li>
            <li>, I bought this because I have been buying Blue Magic products all of my life.</li>
            <li>This has Shea Butter which makes hair super soft and it did for me.</li>
            <li>After I have applied this into my hair and brushed my hair, I see that there is less breakage, which is great.</li>
            <li>Then again my father and i havent been very persistent with the item either</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this as much as the Argan Oil and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>Not Blue Magic, it leaves my hair feeling soft and my scalp oil.</li>
            <li>It feels very light on my scalp and hair, doesn&#x27;t make it feel like it&#x27;s being weight down.</li>
            <li>It did grow my hair BETTER than Jamaican Black Castor oil (that took about 2 months)</li>
            <li>I like the black castor oil better.</li>
            <li>Keep a steady supply.</li>
            <li>is a main ingredient in here.</li>
            <li>I applied this and massaged it into my scalp, and my scalp felt very cooled and soft.</li>
            <li>Also i didnt like the fact that it has petrolatum listed as the main ingredient and as far as i know</li>
            <li>I love this product, it does wonders on my hair even though it is thick, i would adise not to use too much.</li>
            <li>But yea back to the product, every other ingredient is lovely, theres no parabens or chemicals</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact if this makes you feel any better it definitely aids into growing your lashes according to my sis who only used it once i cant speak for that myself since im always trying all sorts of different natural stuffs on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I needed a product that was natural, because I can&#x27;t use natural oils (example almond oil) on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Natural oil slide of my scalp and irate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I suggest you save your money unless you truly are \\&quot;old school\\&quot; like me (grease and water braid outs).</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c hair.</li>
            <li>My 4a hair was soft, moisturized, and defined when I combed it through over water and aloe vera.</li>

            <li> (so don&#x27;t even think about flat ironing your hair with this, the smoking point is very low).</li>
            <li> Us 4&#x27;s need heavier conditioners and oils to weigh our hair down since it is so soft, like cotton</li>
            <li> The ultimate test for me was \\&quot;broken bangs\\&quot;, as girls we have always had breakage right at the front hair line that NOTHING seems to fix, This did.</li>
            <li> It helps with his dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I had bought this for my hair because it is so dry,</li>
            <li> you loose your brows.</li>
            <li> , I went to put it on again because his scalp was itching again and noticed the bald spot had hair as long as his other hair, in fact it is thicker in that spot.</li>
            <li> Blue Magic needs to take this crap off the market.</li>
            <li> and I can melt it with  my other hair products.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair weighed down and greasy, had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t break-off anymore and there less hair in my comb.</li>
            <li> (yet others DO NOT want heavy products).</li>
            <li> And once a week on my scalp after I shampoo since it&#x27;s that heavy.</li>
            <li> I shit you not!</li>
            <li> any hair/skin product that consists of petrolatum, mineral oil etc listed in the ingredients is bad simply because it clogs your pores.</li>
            <li> It is rediculously thick and makes my hair feel 10 pounds!</li>
            <li> hair is thick caucasian hair but even if you have African hair, it is fricken awful!</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair break off really bad.</li>
            <li> So i dont know whether to like it or hate it?</li>
            <li> I have washed my hair 5 times to get this greasy crap out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I like how this is 100% natural which is good for your hair. This has Shea Butter which makes hair super soft and it did for me. I have dry hair, so softer curls is great for my hair. Aloe Vera is enriched in this which is very refreshing to the scalp. I applied this and massaged it into my scalp, and my scalp felt very cooled and soft. My roots got a great glossy shine and so did my hair. After I have applied this into my hair and brushed my hair, I see that there is less breakage, which is great. I recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair care product, it delivers!  I would not mind buying this product again because it is very light on the hair, it is made with all natural ingredients, and it is super healthy for the hair.</li>
            <li> Keep a steady supply.</li>
            <li> So i dont know whether to like it or hate it? I bought this simply because theres a lady on the reviews exaggerating on how wonderful this product was to her son&#x27;s bald spot. I found her mentioning this product in another review (i cant remember which). Anyways i got this mainly because my father has some bald spots on the sides and also because i have very fine baby hairs on my sides as well so i was hoping for a miracle. Then again my father and i havent been very persistent with the item either so i cant quite review it fully. Also i didnt like the fact that it has petrolatum listed as the main ingredient and as far as i know any hair/skin product that consists of petrolatum, mineral oil etc listed in the ingredients is bad simply because it clogs your pores. But yea back to the product, every other ingredient is lovely, theres no parabens or chemicals (well fragrance but no biggie) which is a +++ and there are really good ingredients in it is just the petrolatum that messes it up but this product could have potential. As a matter of fact if this makes you feel any better it definitely aids into growing your lashes according to my sis who only used it once i cant speak for that myself since im always trying all sorts of different natural stuffs on my lashes. Hope this helped someone :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I read that castor oil helps your hair grow. It is rediculously thick and makes my hair feel 10 pounds! The only reason I gave this a star is because it smells really good and I can melt it with  my other hair products. I will not but this again</li>
            <li> It really fantastic. My hair and scalp seem to like very much. I needed a product that was natural, because I can&#x27;t use natural oils (example almond oil) on my scalp. Natural oil slide of my scalp and irate my eyes. Not Blue Magic, it leaves my hair feeling soft and my scalp oil. My hair doesn&#x27;t break-off anymore and there less hair in my comb. The product doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers greasy after applying to my scalp. It feels very light on my scalp and hair, doesn&#x27;t make it feel like it&#x27;s being weight down. Definitely ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Giving this product 1 star was generous.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product thinking it was gonna work like Argan oil but my God! It didnt do anything!&lt;br /&gt;And I shit you not! I have washed my hair 5 times to get this greasy crap out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick caucasian hair but even if you have African hair, it is fricken awful!</li>
            <li> This is okay. I don&#x27;t use this as much as the Argan Oil and Vitamin E. My son likes it. It helps with his dry scalp. He&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t hardly experienced any dandruff since he started using this. Shipping and packaging was good.</li>
            <li> I read the review about the lady that used this on her son&#x27;s braids and later the hair had magically grown, wellll...IT&#x27;S TRUE!!! I bought this 3 weeks ago October 2012 and writing this November 2012 and I too have about 2 inches of new growth!!! Now, I am using on my eyelashes and it works on them too! (saw that tip on youtube). The biggest drawback is this product is mostly Petroleum Jelly! ugh! If you do not have #4 abc hair do not use this. Us 4&#x27;s need heavier conditioners and oils to weigh our hair down since it is so soft, like cotton (yet others DO NOT want heavy products). But I&#x27;m a girl from the 70&#x27;s where \\&quot;grease\\&quot; rules. I am not a fan of the smell, it&#x27;s a sort of sweet flowery/powdery scent. I mix this with a great smelling hair pomade from the dollar store (a whip) that didn&#x27;t work on my hair on it&#x27;s own and voila! I have to make my own concoctions for my make-up too since I am mixed race.&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought this because I have been buying Blue Magic products all of my life. When I saw that it was \\&quot;organic\\&quot; castor oil I was sold. Yet, I was fooled because it&#x27;s mostly a jar of vaseline (so don&#x27;t even think about flat ironing your hair with this, the smoking point is very low). I suggest you save your money unless you truly are \\&quot;old school\\&quot; like me (grease and water braid outs). Not too many of us out there. It did grow my hair BETTER than Jamaican Black Castor oil (that took about 2 months) this product would be perfect for guys with braids or little ones that need that extra moisture. I&#x27;m finishing out my jar on my eyelashes, cuticles, feet, and elbows. And once a week on my scalp after I shampoo since it&#x27;s that heavy. Hope my review helps.&lt;br /&gt;Oh! The ultimate test for me was \\&quot;broken bangs\\&quot;, as girls we have always had breakage right at the front hair line that NOTHING seems to fix, This did. Now I have even bangs, and I am very pleased with that!</li>
            <li> would reorder, works well.</li>
            <li> Seller was very good, shipped and received very fast, this product has a heavenly scent. My son has a habit of itching a spot on his scalp, I noticed he had a bald spot in that area. I had bought this for my hair because it is so dry, well I put it on his bald spot  for several days as he said it relieved the itching, I went to put it on again because his scalp was itching again and noticed the bald spot had hair as long as his other hair, in fact it is thicker in that spot. so I am putting it on my eye brows in order to grow them back as with age you loose your brows. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is good for my daughter and I natural hair grooming.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product for my girls hair. It smells awesome, just found my most favourite hair grease thank you!!</li>
            <li> I like the black castor oil better. I think if I had tried Blue Magic first I would have liked it better.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this zero stars. This stuff made my hair break off really bad. I washed it out and the breakage magically stopped. I don&#x27;t think my hair likes coconut oil and coconut oil is a main ingredient in here. I have natural 4c hair. I bought this to try and get hair to grow in a bald spot. Blue Magic needs to take this crap off the market.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!  My 4a hair was soft, moisturized, and defined when I combed it through over water and aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it does wonders on my hair even though it is thick, i would adise not to use too much.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair weighed down and greasy, had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I use this all over my body &amp; in my hair. It&#x27;s inexpensive. I like it, but would prefer a softer petroletum.</li>
