    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Fits perfectly and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>So glad I ordered this!</li>
            <li>Not as nice as pictured.</li>
            <li>This piece of metal does not resemble a snake nor does it securely fit on your ear.</li>
            <li>Just a piece of metal that doesnt even fit on your ear.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t fit on any type of ear, it just falls off.</li>
            <li>Super cute design, but extremely hard to bend in order to get a nice snug fit.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth returning to China.</li>
            <li>It does really resemble the picture on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have other ear cuffs and they all fit except this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have to make adjustments as the fit is not right.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time fitting it around my ear.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>It has no neck and the eyes barely show up.</li>
            <li>Still does not fit right when manipulating it.  </li>
            <li>Even from something as cheap as this I at least expected it to wrap around, not just be a plank.</li>
