            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I like this product although I honestly have not used the flesh tone side once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure in that case it would be way to cakey.</li>
            <li>I love it because it covers the redness on my checks.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for many years, however, I can never find it anymore at C.V.S. or Walgrens stores.  </li>
            <li>It covers ok</li>
            <li>Recommended by many makeup artists</li>
            <li>and I could not agree more.</li>
            <li>I love this for concealing those pesky blemishes.  </li>
            <li>It works great, I have no complaints so far and have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li>I use a really fine brush almost like a paint brush to put it on with.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and covers well, not noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent for small blemishes</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly.</li>

            <li>so I am just using this to spot cover not to cover any large area.</li>
            <li>but it really does seem to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This worked okay to cover up imperfections for about a week, and then it dried out and it&#x27;s very clumpy now.</li>
            <li>Love the green.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many Concealers, some even green</li>
            <li>The green covers the redness while the light covers the flaw completely.  </li>
            <li>The green side hides it pretty well.  </li>
            <li>She was so relieved when she saw pictures on all the social media the next day.</li>

            <li> She was so relieved when she saw pictures on all the social media the next day.</li>
            <li> I never left it open and only used it about 3 times before it started to dry out.</li>
            <li> and it last for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> This concealer is so dry</li>
            <li> Not only does it not work on me, a freakishly pale white girl, because it&#x27;s too dark, but it&#x27;s a big slap in the face to women of color who are looking to conceal redness.</li>
            <li> It actually comes the closest to covering my dark circles of anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear though that I hardly wear any makeup</li>
            <li> I use the green after I put on my makeup just to cover the red acne spots.</li>
            <li> I never found the green or yellow version side to work well for anything, too noticeable.</li>
            <li> and when i put enough on to cover the green my face looked SO cake-y.</li>
            <li> I use the green concealer under my foundations for my red spots.</li>
            <li> Every woman should use this for dark puffy eyes and endless on the cheeks and around the nose and forehead.  </li>
            <li> The green takes out the redness all over my face and the concealer reduces the dark area under my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware of the green side.</li>
            <li> The green concealer doesn&#x27;t get rid of redness.</li>
            <li> So the green concealer is pointless.</li>
            <li> Instead, you  just end up with weird greenish smears on your face and the same redness as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I usually end up reapplying it at least once a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on makeup</li>
            <li> The product Is a bit thick and cakey, but it covers redness well.</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s thick, meaning it stays</li>
            <li> But the green is way too hard to cover up!!</li>
            <li> but I ended up preferring the ELF concealer I got at K-Mart, and the ELF concealer is less expensive.</li>
            <li> Bad smell!!!!</li>

            <li> Good concealer perfect for blemishes</li>
            <li> Love this! It actually comes the closest to covering my dark circles of anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> This concealer is so dry and it has low coverage! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> covers up all my blemishes! love it!</li>
            <li> works and stays in place, perfect concealer, try it, you will love it, order it now, u won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I like this product although I honestly have not used the flesh tone side once. I use the green after I put on my makeup just to cover the red acne spots. I use a really fine brush almost like a paint brush to put it on with. It seems to do the trick and it last for a fairly long time. I&#x27;m hard on makeup so I usually end up reapplying it at least once a day but it really does seem to do the trick. Let me be clear though that I hardly wear any makeup so I am just using this to spot cover not to cover any large area. I&#x27;m sure in that case it would be way to cakey.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I put on makeup. The green takes out the redness all over my face and the concealer reduces the dark area under my eyes. I also use a similar product and it works well together with this. Every woman should use this for dark puffy eyes and endless on the cheeks and around the nose and forehead.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I love it because it covers the redness on my checks.  I have been using it for many years, however, I can never find it anymore at C.V.S. or Walgrens stores.  Please do not discontinue this product.  My daughter uses it also.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great at concealing skin imperfections.  Easy to apply &amp; simple to take off at the end of the day. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Light concealer side is perfect. Goes on smooth and covers well, not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of the green side. I never found the green or yellow version side to work well for anything, too noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for years and I don&#x27;t trust anything else.  The green covers the redness while the light covers the flaw completely.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> The green concealer doesn&#x27;t get rid of redness. Instead, you  just end up with weird greenish smears on your face and the same redness as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, why the hell does the company include the &amp;#34;skin tone&amp;#34; concealer? Not only does it not work on me, a freakishly pale white girl, because it&#x27;s too dark, but it&#x27;s a big slap in the face to women of color who are looking to conceal redness.</li>
            <li> This worked okay to cover up imperfections for about a week, and then it dried out and it&#x27;s very clumpy now. I never left it open and only used it about 3 times before it started to dry out.</li>
            <li> Great concealer. Love the green.</li>
            <li> It covers ok but I ended up preferring the ELF concealer I got at K-Mart, and the ELF concealer is less expensive.</li>
            <li> The product Is a bit thick and cakey, but it covers redness well.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly. But the green is way too hard to cover up!! and when i put enough on to cover the green my face looked SO cake-y. So the green concealer is pointless.</li>
            <li> I use the green concealer under my foundations for my red spots. It works great, I have no complaints so far and have been using it for about a month. The only issue is the brush, it&#x27;s losing its bristles and they stay stuck in the concealer aside from that is a good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent for small blemishes</li>
            <li> Perfect combo that I was looking for! Recommended by many makeup artists and I could not agree more.</li>
            <li> Straight to the trash can!! Bad smell!!!! Can&#x27;t imagine putting it on my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Concealers, some even green then I&#x27;d have to use another Concealer to help area&#x27;s that aren&#x27;t red. This has both AND it&#x27;s thick, meaning it stays ON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this and won&#x27;t buy anything else ever again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teen daughter to wear the night of a big event. When she gets hot, her cheeks flame!  With this product under foundation , she maintained an even skin tone all evening. She was so relieved when she saw pictures on all the social media the next day.</li>
            <li> I love this for concealing those pesky blemishes.  Also, I have a noticeable scar on my cheek that is still pink and sensitive. The green side hides it pretty well.  It&#x27;s definitely one of my makeup essentials.</li>
