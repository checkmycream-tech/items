            <li>Love Tartes amazonian clay mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara is my new favorite!!  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It goes on so easily, maximizes lash&#x27;s length and fullness, doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day and nourishes my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Easy to remove with a bit of baby oil or makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I really liked Tarte brand mascara and tried the Amazonian Clay Smart Mascara after reading favorable reviews.  </li>
            <li>Tarte overall has great products but this is not one of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every mascara under the sun, from the cheap Maybelline drugstore staple to the Diors and Guerlains, and this is the best--bar none.</li>
            <li>As I get older, it seems my lashes get more and more sparse.  </li>
            <li>after many, many uses or after being very old.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this mascara after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Love the fast that it is natural and good for your eye</li>
            <li>I was excited to think that this might be the mascara of my dreams.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, smells good and comes off easily enough after all day wear.  </li>
            <li>Because of the ingredients, it&#x27;s important to get this mascara fresh.</li>
            <li>Got this product last week and love it!</li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>In fact, I like how this mascara colors and separates better than my old L&#x27;Oreal favs.  </li>
            <li>To be clear, I love this product and have used it every day for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes makeup fun.</li>
            <li>I wish the tube lasted longer, but I continue to re-order - superior to any other brand I have tried!</li>
            <li>Goes on clean with no clumps and makes my lashes look sky high.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the waterproof Tarte mascara but based on the product description (won&#x27;t ever transfer) and some good reviews I thought this was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>This is the first mascara I have used that I would recommend to others.  </li>
            <li>I applied it to my top lashes, and an hour later I yawned</li>
            <li>I try not to wear such chemical laden cosmetics and this one is pretty natural which is nice.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, its not my number one</li>
            <li>Found out that Tarte mascara has much safer ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, and mostly wear mineral powders when I do, it&#x27;s nice that this mascara can be worn without much other makeup and not look out of place.  </li>
            <li>Did not think it looked any better on my lashes than other mascaras which are much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Competes with my other favorite L&amp;#34;Oreal Voluminous.</li>
            <li>the wooden container is so cool.</li>
            <li>Even though I live in Guam, I got it within 10 days, which is a miracle out here!</li>
            <li>I find the other one to clump and rub off easily even though its water proof.</li>
            <li>Too much work to apply &amp; look natural.</li>
            <li>For instance I bought this because I wanted something that I could wear that isn&#x27;t toxic and full of metals and harmful chemicals in the long run that could cause any damage.</li>
            <li>Its just a normal mascara.</li>
            <li>(I live in a humid climate).  </li>
            <li>Once that was done I took a short two mile bike ride only to return, look in the mirror and discover I had an unmistakable set of raccoon eyes despite only using the product on the top lashes.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and clump-free, and keeps my lashes dark and sultry all day with nary a smudge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells  and chemicals</li>
            <li>Its comfortable to wear feels more natural to the eye and makes my lashes which are thick anyway even look thicker to where they look false.  </li>
            <li>In the future, I will wait out the one week ship time and purchase directly from Tarte.</li>
            <li>so I can only use natural or organic products.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make the lashes fuller or more dramatic.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have Tarts other mascara (lights camera lashes)</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on well and goes on dark.  </li>
            <li> I used to be strictly a waterproof mascara user because I couldn&#x27;t stand the look of mascara running down my face.  </li>
            <li> I felt it performed no better than the usual drug store brands</li>

            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the mascara was returned.</li>
            <li> This was an expensive failed experiment.</li>
            <li> it smears underneath your eyes when you are trying to remove it and the clay in this stuff sticks like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive for subpar quality!</li>
            <li> The product was impossible to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>

            <li> Easy to apply and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, its not my number one but I would definetly recommend it, it volumizes my lashes and separates them.</li>
            <li> Did not think it looked any better on my lashes than other mascaras which are much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. Product was very thick &amp; gloppy coming out of the tube. Too much work to apply &amp; look natural. Tarte overall has great products but this is not one of them. I gave up on it within a week. Too expensive for subpar quality!</li>
            <li> This company uses materials that are safe. For instance I bought this because I wanted something that I could wear that isn&#x27;t toxic and full of metals and harmful chemicals in the long run that could cause any damage. It applies well and looks appealing. It is mascara , it does what it says. I feel like the negative reviewers don&#x27;t know about this company&#x27;s products and why they are the price they are.</li>
            <li> It was okay. It didn&#x27;t make the lashes fuller or more dramatic. Its just a normal mascara. Putting on layers is all i could do but even that got clumpy. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the waterproof Tarte mascara but based on the product description (won&#x27;t ever transfer) and some good reviews I thought this was worth trying.  The product was impossible to apply evenly. It came out of the tube thick and gloppy and I had to do quite a bit of fussy dabbing with tissues to get some lash definition. Once that was done I took a short two mile bike ride only to return, look in the mirror and discover I had an unmistakable set of raccoon eyes despite only using the product on the top lashes.  If you&#x27;re a person has lots of patience and stays indoors this might work for you.</li>
            <li> I threw out all of my L&#x27;Oreal mascaras when I learned that the ingredients are pretty nasty.  Found out that Tarte mascara has much safer ingredients.  I used to be strictly a waterproof mascara user because I couldn&#x27;t stand the look of mascara running down my face.  (I live in a humid climate).  This mascara is my new favorite!!  It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it doesn&#x27;t smudge like some others and the lash definition is really, really great.  Much better than I was expecting. In fact, I like how this mascara colors and separates better than my old L&#x27;Oreal favs.  What I do sometimes though is put this non-waterproof formula on my upper lashes and then use the waterproof equivalent on my lower lashes...especially if I&#x27;m going to an event like a wedding, funeral, church etc...  I wish I would have discovered this mascara a long time ago...</li>
            <li> it smears underneath your eyes when you are trying to remove it and the clay in this stuff sticks like crazy.  You can actually see the clay on your eye lashes in big clumps, yuk!</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have used that I would recommend to others.  It goes on well, smells good and comes off easily enough after all day wear.  Since I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, and mostly wear mineral powders when I do, it&#x27;s nice that this mascara can be worn without much other makeup and not look out of place.  Good for every day wear.</li>
            <li> I really liked Tarte brand mascara and tried the Amazonian Clay Smart Mascara after reading favorable reviews.  I agree! It goes on so easily, maximizes lash&#x27;s length and fullness, doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day and nourishes my lashes.  I wish the tube lasted longer, but I continue to re-order - superior to any other brand I have tried!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Its comfortable to wear feels more natural to the eye and makes my lashes which are thick anyway even look thicker to where they look false.  Easy to remove.  Competes with my other favorite L&amp;#34;Oreal Voluminous.</li>
            <li> To be clear, I love this product and have used it every day for years. I don&#x27;t recommend buying it from a reseller in this fashion. Because of the ingredients, it&#x27;s important to get this mascara fresh. In the future, I will wait out the one week ship time and purchase directly from Tarte.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this mascara after reading the reviews.  I&#x27;m highly sensitive to smells  and chemicals so I can only use natural or organic products.  As soon as I opened the mascara I had a reaction to the smell.  It&#x27;s very strong!  I couldn&#x27;t even use the product.  Thant&#x27;s the reason for the two stars.  Sadly, the mascara was returned.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  It&#x27;s makes makeup fun. the wooden container is so cool. The mascara goes on well and goes on dark.  I have blonde eye lashes and this mascara shows up and stays on! I love the ingredients.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes. Some mascaras make my eyes water and Tarte products don&#x27;t. I love how healthy they are.  Love it!</li>
            <li> the best mascara ever!!! Love the fast that it is natural and good for your eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying this product for sure, Very pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> I love Tarte cosmetics.  I decided to order this Amazonian Clay Smart Mascara and am I ever happy I did! It is awesome!  As I get older, it seems my lashes get more and more sparse.  This mascara makes them show, again!  I am very happy about this.  It doesn&#x27;t smear, nor does it clump.  But it does show!  It makes my lashes thicker and longer.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> i like the product, but it was already clumpy when i opened it, which might be just the way the product is... but i&#x27;ve only ever seen mascara clump like that after many, many uses or after being very old. like i said, i&#x27;ve never bought that brand before, so it could just be &amp;#34;the way it is,&amp;#34; but i&#x27;ve been happier. especially for $30.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! Even though I live in Guam, I got it within 10 days, which is a miracle out here!</li>
            <li> Got this product last week and love it! I try not to wear such chemical laden cosmetics and this one is pretty natural which is nice. It gives the lashes great length which doesn&#x27;t always happen with the more organic items. I would definitely purchased this again.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to see a difference with this mascara. I felt it performed no better than the usual drug store brands and there was some clumping.</li>
            <li> definitely exceeded my expectations. The reviews had said that it lengthened lashes and it did that for me as well. I love this mascara with a passion &amp;#60;3 xo</li>
            <li> Love Tartes amazonian clay mascara. Goes on clean with no clumps and makes my lashes look sky high. I have Tarts other mascara (lights camera lashes) and i prefer this one over it. I find the other one to clump and rub off easily even though its water proof. CHOOSE THIS ONE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mascara under the sun, from the cheap Maybelline drugstore staple to the Diors and Guerlains, and this is the best--bar none. Goes on smoothly and clump-free, and keeps my lashes dark and sultry all day with nary a smudge. Easy to remove with a bit of baby oil or makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I was excited to think that this might be the mascara of my dreams. I applied it to my top lashes, and an hour later I yawned and my eyes watered.  The next thing I knew, I had raccoon eyes. I cleaned the mascara off immediately, and this morning, after only wearing it for an hour last night, my eyes were swollen from an allergic reaction to something in the mascara. This was an expensive failed experiment. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This mascara is wonderful for anyone who is allergic to mascara and wants one that&#x27;s gluten free.  It doesn&#x27;t have parabens, SLS, or mineral oil.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that this arrived with no packaging or safety seal.  How do I know that it has not be used before?  Nothing that I read suggested that it would be shipped this way.  Not happy.</li>
