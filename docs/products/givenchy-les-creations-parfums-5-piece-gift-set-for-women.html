            <li>Great way to try different scents without having a huge bottle laying around if it isn&#x27;t liked.</li>
            <li>is ok if the cost is free</li>
            <li>You can enjoy some fragance with this product.  </li>
            <li>wanted to sample these before committing to a larger bottle of any of them, but they&#x27;re all so great</li>
            <li>and its not smell like the original givenchy perfumes that i smell from macys.</li>
            <li>Un air d&#x27;escapade is light, sweet, and flirty, and so is eau demoiselle.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it fast and it came greatly packaged with each individual perfume in an exquisitly adorable mini replica bottle of each perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that important if it is original because the whole thing is better than a gift.</li>
            <li>There are many sample perfumes in this set, and my wife and I both really like all of them.  </li>
            <li>good set, nice for small gifts</li>
            <li>Love that I have the option to try many different scents.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try and find a new favorite.</li>
            <li>Not bad considering how much these cost for a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>Nice for travel or just sampling a fragrance before investing in a larger size.  </li>
            <li>My mom likes it very much...</li>
            <li>I bought this set for my mother for her birthday, she loves Organza, and I thought she would enjoy other Givenchy perfumes along with her favorite, Organza.</li>
            <li>These perfumes in cute, nice-looking bottles are appropriate to give away as small tokens/gifts when visiting friends abroad/domestic.  </li>
            <li>bottle is a cute, collectible splash bottle that look awesome on my little vanity.</li>
            <li>- Demoiselle, maybe not spelled right - lovely fragrance, though not very long lasting.</li>
            <li>If you want to celebrate a real lady, I recommend giving her this gift set.</li>
            <li>Very Irresistible is seductive with its spicy notes and licorice.</li>
            <li>very well protected</li>
            <li>i love that each one is individually packaged, so i got 5 presents for 5 different ladies,</li>
            <li>Each little bottle is cute.  </li>
            <li>Ange ou demon le secret is bright and breezy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was a great way for her to sample a few different scents and not have to smell the same everyday!</li>
            <li>This gives the the opportunity to try new ones with out the commitment of a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>Have only used one so far</li>
            <li>The scents are very subtle, being Eau de Toilette, next we&#x27;ll purchase the Perfume version of her top favorites.</li>

            <li> The bottles are too small.</li>
            <li> I realize that the bottles would be small because of the number of ounces stated</li>
            <li> The small bottles are very delicate and the  feminine fragrances of the perfumes are enticing.</li>
            <li> and not able spray it.&lt;br /&gt;really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think the price is very expensive.</li>

            <li> Wife liked them all. Enjoys the sampling.</li>
            <li> I ordered  Givenchy Les Creations Parfums De Givenchy Perfume Women Giftset to give to my daughter-in-law. She couldn´t have been happier! And, of course, my son and me as well. The small bottles are very delicate and the  feminine fragrances of the perfumes are enticing. If you want to celebrate a real lady, I recommend giving her this gift set.</li>
            <li> 5 out of 5!  There are many sample perfumes in this set, and my wife and I both really like all of them.  She wears another scent exclusively, but now she uses all of this.  The scents are very subtle, being Eau de Toilette, next we&#x27;ll purchase the Perfume version of her top favorites.</li>
            <li> wonderful scents.  I liked the packaging and I love the way they smell on me.  I have worn the same scent for years and lately the scent no longer agrees with my chemistry.  This gives the the opportunity to try new ones with out the commitment of a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Good looking presentation. Cute sizes. It&#x27;s not that important if it is original because the whole thing is better than a gift. It is absolutely a nice collection.</li>
            <li> The bottles are too small. and its not smell like the original givenchy perfumes that i smell from macys. and not able spray it.&lt;br /&gt;really disappointed. never recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> every one of these was well received.  this is Haute Coutre perfume; only one drop is needed for neck and wrists.  i love that each one is individually packaged, so i got 5 presents for 5 different ladies, all in one package and for a great price.. well designed perfumes: they give off different &amp;#34;notes&amp;#34; throughout the day.  ooh-la-la!</li>
            <li> you can wear a different one every day.</li>
            <li> I realize that the bottles would be small because of the number of ounces stated but I was surprised at how small.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love that I have the option to try many different scents. They all smell good in their own way. My favorite though is eaudemoiselle.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and find a new favorite. Not bad considering how much these cost for a full size bottle. It gave me options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m From Venezuela, and i&#x27;m happy for this Perfums</li>
            <li> Smells great!!! Love this very much great purchase:)</li>
            <li> You can enjoy some fragance with this product.  It´s very beautiful, but the bottles are very little.  I think the price is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my mom for Christmas.  She love Givenchy perfumes but I never know which one to get.  This was a great way for her to sample a few different scents and not have to smell the same everyday!</li>
            <li> Nice for travel or just sampling a fragrance before investing in a larger size.  Have only used one so far - Demoiselle, maybe not spelled right - lovely fragrance, though not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Nice product my wife like to have a mini perfumes collections and i will keep buying if the price is good shipping is ok if the cost is free</li>

Ange ou demon le secret is bright and breezy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to sample these before committing to a larger bottle of any of them, but they&#x27;re all so great I might have to get them all in larger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bottle is a cute, collectible splash bottle that look awesome on my little vanity.</li>
            <li> Wonderful array of scents.  Perfect for gift giving.</li>

            <li> These perfumes in cute, nice-looking bottles are appropriate to give away as small tokens/gifts when visiting friends abroad/domestic.  They smell wonderful, economical and attractive.  I might change my mind... instead of giving them away, I might just keep them for myself.  They are that good.  Good buy for the price.</li>
