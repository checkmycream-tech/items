            <li>I was impressed with this mascara being that I dont like any of smash box makeup.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara.</li>
            <li>I got a deluxe sample of this mascara with a Smashbox.com order and I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the saving of time and it looks great</li>
            <li>Have tried many, many mascaras, and this has to be the best ever.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was great and the seller was super nice!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Nice brush.</li>
            <li>As a model/actress and makeup artist- this is undoubtedly the absolute best mascara I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It has an oversized brush, which always leads to better results.  </li>
            <li>And I find it a bit more workable now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile.  </li>
            <li>and this is my favorite mascara i have used to date.</li>
            <li>Mary K mascara is better</li>
            <li>Very clean, easy to apply,</li>
            <li>Yet it washes off easily at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Easy application and washes off effortlessly with water.</li>
            <li>The reviews I read were much different than what I experienced with this mascara.</li>
            <li>I have naturally nice lashes to begin with (no false lashes)</li>
            <li>Easy to clean off too.</li>
            <li>Smashbox is now my new favorite makeup, and I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>They are great products and stay on all day long.</li>
            <li>I do use a mascara primer though to bring out the best from this product but at the end my eyelashes are long, big and bold!!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best mascaras I have ever used, as a professional makeup artist and as a private consumer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better than the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried and rivals my favorite mascara,</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and full and I get really good, thick, longer, non-clumpy looking lashes with this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>But since it does a good job on the first pass, I find that I can tolerate not giving it a second going-over.  </li>
            <li>I wear hard contacts and never have a problem with it flaking or anything absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>I received a trial size as a sample a year ago &amp; loved it so much it is the only one I use now.  </li>
            <li>First off, I got my Smashbox Full Exposure Mascara from A Place of  Beauty and it arrived way before the scheduled arrival date.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite brush and formula.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens of mascaras over the years in all price ranges and this one beat out those priced much higher.  </li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because its not waterproof and am pretty sure they don&#x27;t sell a waterproof version of this mascara.</li>
            <li>but so far so good, it hasn&#x27;t run, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have searched long and hard for the best mascara</li>
            <li>It is also very lash nourishing.  </li>
            <li>It lasts long and washes off easy.  </li>
            <li>And the mascara both thickens and elongates, more so than a lot of other mascaras.      </li>
            <li>So glad I read other reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try something new ..</li>
            <li>That makes putting on the first coat a bit of a challenge and putting on a second coat ill-advised.  </li>
            <li>(a step I&#x27;m lazy for most days).</li>
            <li>Not sure if its good in wet weather</li>
            <li>So much so that, even though I&#x27;ve stopped a couple of times to switch to another brand, I keep coming back to this one.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oversized brush gets each and eery lash without clumping plus makes them look natural.  </li>
            <li>no clumps, makes my lashes look much bolder and long without looking too made up and clumpy.</li>
            <li>Cant find anywhere a product that makes my eyelashes that long and with that much volume.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worst mascara EVER!  Irritates my eyes so they are tearing and red all day, it clumps and it flakes off.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! Great coverage and stays on all day. However, the application wand is a little big to me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  It does not clump, does not smear or turn into racoon eyes &amp; does not flake off even after wearing it 16 hours.  Yet it washes off easily at the end of the day.  I received a trial size as a sample a year ago &amp; loved it so much it is the only one I use now.  I have tried dozens of mascaras over the years in all price ranges and this one beat out those priced much higher.  It is not the least expensive mascara but it does last a long time and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now, and I do like it.  It has an oversized brush, which always leads to better results.  And the mascara both thickens and elongates, more so than a lot of other mascaras.      The problem is that it&#x27;s a bit clumpy.  That makes putting on the first coat a bit of a challenge and putting on a second coat ill-advised.  But since it does a good job on the first pass, I find that I can tolerate not giving it a second going-over.  And I find it a bit more workable now that I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile.  So much so that, even though I&#x27;ve stopped a couple of times to switch to another brand, I keep coming back to this one.    I used to be Max Factor 2000 Calorie Mascara girl.  Best mascara ever.  But since the company was sold off to Proctor and Gamble, and they shut down production/sales in the USA, I&#x27;ve been looking around for another product.  This may be the permanent replacement.      Overall I&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars (the .5 coming off for the clumping tendencies).</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. It&#x27;s oversized brush gets each and eery lash without clumping plus makes them look natural.  I only gave 4 stars because its not waterproof and am pretty sure they don&#x27;t sell a waterproof version of this mascara. Will def buy again!!</li>
            <li> Clumpy, seems old, not very happy with product. The reviews I read were much different than what I experienced with this mascara.</li>
            <li> First off, I got my Smashbox Full Exposure Mascara from A Place of  Beauty and it arrived way before the scheduled arrival date. The packaging was great and the seller was super nice! This is one of the best mascaras I have ever used, as a professional makeup artist and as a private consumer! Buy this mascara and buy it from A Place of Beauty!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got a deluxe sample of this mascara with a Smashbox.com order and I am very impressed.  I have naturally nice lashes to begin with (no false lashes) but I like to curl my lashes and wear mascara every day.  The brush is nice and full and I get really good, thick, longer, non-clumpy looking lashes with this mascara.  It&#x27;s far better than the drugstore brands I&#x27;ve tried and rivals my favorite mascara, Estee Lauder Sumptuous - even when worn without mascara primer (a step I&#x27;m lazy for most days).</li>
            <li> I now use Smashbox mascara and eye liner exclusively.  They are great products and stay on all day long. No need to retouch during the day.</li>
            <li> Best mascara there is.  I wear hard contacts and never have a problem with it flaking or anything absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> Smashbox is now my new favorite makeup, and I love this mascara. Very clean, easy to apply, no clumps, makes my lashes look much bolder and long without looking too made up and clumpy. Dries quickly. Nice brush. Easy to clean off too. Not sure if its good in wet weather but so far so good, it hasn&#x27;t run, and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have searched long and hard for the best mascara and now I have found it!!!!!!!  This is by far my favorite brush and formula. Try it. It lasts long and washes off easy.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As a model/actress and makeup artist- this is undoubtedly the absolute best mascara I have ever used.  It thickens lashes and lengthens to the max without looking spikey and clumpy.  It is also very lash nourishing.  Will never be without it!</li>
            <li> Have tried many, many mascaras, and this has to be the best ever.  So glad I read other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have very short thin eyelashes and this is my favorite mascara i have used to date. I do use a mascara primer though to bring out the best from this product but at the end my eyelashes are long, big and bold!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only one application needed vs the four applications I have used daily with other brands. I appreciate the saving of time and it looks great</li>
            <li> awful. flakes off and gets in your eyes and irritates them within an hour of application. squinting like the hunchback of notre dame all day is not pretty....I&#x27;d rather sport my regular eyelashes then go through the pain and humiliation!</li>
            <li> Easy application and washes off effortlessly with water.</li>
            <li> Best mascara of all times. Cant find anywhere a product that makes my eyelashes that long and with that much volume.</li>
            <li> Mary K mascara is better</li>
            <li> can be a little clumpy...but it is a great mascara! wish they had other colors than black.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try something new .. the mascara was halfway down my face by 10am. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this mascara being that I dont like any of smash box makeup.I would buy this again.....................</li>
