            <li>love this product and if I could, I would hug the inventor!!</li>
            <li>Plus the smell is not too pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>Good price for this product.</li>
            <li>But the product is good.</li>
            <li>I chose Nioxin because it is a professional-looking product that doesn&#x27;t make any sensational claims about curing baldness.</li>
            <li>The price is great for what you get, and it makes my hair and scalp feel fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Its  minty smelling, very refreshing to your scalp.</li>
            <li>Love the tingly mint smell and feel of this great shampoo.</li>
            <li>opening the bottle, I enjoyed the peppermint smell and then came the washing!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>She had noticed before that I was loosing my hair, but asked how the family hair looks, as I noticeably had more hair in the front than before!</li>
            <li>I am seeing amazing results</li>
            <li>its amazing</li>
            <li>Nice kit to start.</li>
            <li>Tried it and liked it.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair while using this product.  </li>
            <li>It took the nice curl out of my hair</li>
            <li>It smells nice, as does the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The leave-in conditional kind of reeks, but the minty scent of the shampoo and conditioner seems to cancel it out.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are quite nice, just very strong smelling.  </li>
            <li>The scent of this product is a very strong mint smell.  </li>
            <li>I bought this kit on the recommendation of a friend who also has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products for about six weeks, and I have noticed that my normally very fine hair looks and feels thicker.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, and using all three parts of the kit, help give it body and fullness.</li>
            <li>thanks to Chrystal!&lt;br /&gt;Chrystal, a close friend and cancer survivor had the most beautiful luxourious hair even though two years ago she went through chemo and lost it all.</li>
            <li>very nice product thanks again!</li>
            <li>love this product and if I could, I would hug the inventor!!eek of use, LONGER!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I heard many goo things about this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is really making me happy.</li>
            <li>more like its tingling</li>
            <li>This product does everything it is suppose to do and more.</li>
            <li>Saying that, I like Nioxin better than Ivanti.</li>
            <li>well its ok as fae as shampoos go but cant tell any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>The price is better than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I still balding but I do notice, if I don&#x27;t use it, i will lose more hair.</li>
            <li>sure what is in the stuff-</li>
            <li>The price was MUCH better than in a salon.l</li>
            <li>The hairline by my temples is receding faster than my widow&#x27;s peak area which would leave me an \\&quot;island\\&quot; of hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li>It is not a lot of hair, but I assume the more</li>
            <li>I could see my hair change for the better in just 2 weeks .</li>
            <li>and I was hoping to see better results</li>
            <li>, I still feel like I&#x27;m losing a lot of hair, but I won&#x27;t give up on it yet, maybe it just needs more time to work.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with thinning hair and have tried MANY shampoos and treatments and none have worked.  </li>
            <li>We all have fine hair that thins on the top front.</li>
            <li>Cool and tingly, unlike anything I had ever noticed before!</li>
            <li>I use this the more I may start to see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from keeping hair, this is a great shampoo/conditioner/treatment line that leave your hair feeling full and soft.</li>
            <li>this is  a great product, my hair is growing back and looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>Its a wintery smell, but the cool menthol effect on my head feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is that I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After towel drying my hair, I used the leave in spray and again, I was amazed at the cool, refreshing tingle.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I love the cool tingling feeling on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Recommended by my barber, this Nioxin seems to cleanse hair just fine.</li>
            <li>Its helped my hair grow tremendously!</li>
            <li>The Nioxin 3 step program is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Had an allergic reaction to this product, would not recommend it to people who have fair sun sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>I was turned onto this product b a friend, am so glad I listened and will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li>When I comb my hair out immediately after my shower, I never see more than one strand in the brush and my hair feels thick and full and the best part?</li>
            <li>When I comb my hair out immediately after my shower, I never see more than one strand in the brush and my hair feels thick and full and the best part?</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a significant thickness to my hair.</li>
            <li>I just wish it would be more consistent.</li>
            <li>Either way, I have not been able to tell since I purchased this July 11th if his hair has gotten thicker or not, I will say that it has been extremely soft and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>It is minty and cool.  </li>
            <li>I used the product for a full 60 days after two separate orders and followed all directions.</li>
            <li>full of hair falling out.</li>
            <li>The bottles are not small enough to fly with, but just traveling around works just fine.</li>
            <li>So as far as the shampoo and conditioner go so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>now im lucky to find three hairs@</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for folks with scalp issues or those looking for quick, noticeable growth.</li>
            <li>Whether or not this product stimulates new hair growth, my hair is shinier and more manageable, and</li>
            <li>It comes out in a little squirt which I found best to apply straight to the scalp, rather than squirting it in my hands first.</li>
            <li>I just got this product after a recommendation from a friend and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Everyone was nice and no one mentioned what was painfully obvious in the pictures I viewed afterwards.</li>
            <li>Yes it smells like medicine but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, has body, and has more body.  </li>
            <li>and it is definitely worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>before i would have a whole hand full.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this product to someone who has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>For years I have been trying all types of products to get volumizing results, most costing more than I was used to spending on shampoos and conditioners, few with recognizable or consistent results.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m seeing some improvement , I need more time to see full results, my hair is still falling out a lot , but pretty good, just be careful because the third step spray can give you a rash and irritate your scalp and skin.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the price tag.</li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably thicker and lighter, wtih more bounce and usually stays that way most of the day.  </li>
            <li>it strengthened  and thickened my hair on the first usage.</li>
            <li>WELL, VERY TINGLY!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the scalp treatment some of the spray landed on my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is filled with natural elements and tingles as it conditions your hair.  </li>
            <li>I think the perceived thickening effect is more likely users wanting to believe it is doing something extra for them, considering they shelled out more money.</li>
            <li>I wish I had more to say about the actual product and how it works, all I can say is that I have high hopes still, although this starter-kit is about through...</li>
            <li>My hair certainly didn&#x27;t seem thicker at all.</li>
            <li>It really makes a positive difference for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had fine hair and it definitely feels thicker since using it.     </li>
            <li>Really doubting it at this point though.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t bother me so much.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I used the whole system strictly according to the instructions but didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all in my hair.</li>
            <li>this system really worked for me</li>
            <li>He said the conditioner ran out too fast and that after he had used the whole system he didn&#x27;t see any improvement in his thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I notice dulled hair and others not so much.</li>
            <li>I would recommened this product to someone who is really concerned about thinning hair.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t know if it works or not</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a year and would recommend it to anyone who is having hair loss or your hair is not growing as fast as it  should .</li>
            <li>Really does make my hair feel fuller.  </li>
            <li>This system really showed promise, although I just stopped using it.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does seem to reduce the gray hairs falling into the sink when I brush.  </li>
            <li>my hair is very fine and started to fall out-since using these products have lost less hair-not thicker yet</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to remedy thinning hair, but I also want to say that patience is required to see significant results.</li>
            <li>Makes it feel like it my head is extra clean.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been fine and limp, but when I noticed the part on top of my head getting wider, I decided to try one of the products on the market made especially for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I am in my early fifties and my fine hair is starting to get thinner and recede.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell if it&#x27;s really doing anything.     </li>
            <li>The minty component in this product causes tingling and makes my scalp even more of a flaky mess.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>May be a high priced gimmick, or placebo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with thinning hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the shampoo and conditioner, though.  </li>
            <li>It is not a cheap treatment product, but I feel better after using it.  </li>
            <li>at least it did for me, kind of made it drier feeling.</li>
            <li>I figured that my condition (postpartum hairloss) wasn&#x27;t significant enough to cause any major side effects.</li>
            <li>The price was less exorbitant than many products on the market that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read that increased blood flow helps with new hair growth, so</li>
            <li>This product came as advertised and was brand new in the box.</li>
            <li>Tough to review the effectiveness as I&#x27;m also using other products and taking supplements, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with Nioxin.  </li>
            <li>and I lost a considerable amount of it from using Wen shampoo (I must be allergic to something in it sadly, because it is a GREAT hair product).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the shampoo/conditioner, but the daily application treatment (specifically the bottle with the spraying cap--see picture) has a great mild styling effect as if I&#x27;d used a small amount of gel.</li>
            <li>My mother is a balding 40 year old and the lights shine on my grandmothers exposed scalp!</li>
            <li>I have used this hair care line in the past, and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I had used Nioxin years ago before switching to Wen so my first reaction was to go back to the Nioxin.  </li>
            <li>I broke out in large red itchy welts anywhere except my scalp</li>
            <li>A week after beginning to use this, my hair certainly feels stronger and I would definitely say it has the appearance of being thicker.  </li>
            <li>I had recently had my hair cut and have had fine hair all my life, which became even finer following a diagnosis of a medical condition.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin or allergies.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine using this on sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>As far as helping regrow hair?  </li>
            <li>fall completely</li>
            <li>However, I was plesantly surprised that this product has worked as well as it does.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think much of it till a minute later when the burning and itching started on my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>That seems to be the only way this product is real.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and shinning.</li>
            <li>She also follows the old advice, brush your hair 100 times a day.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to show off my new curly perm that had finally laid down.</li>
            <li>Once your skin becomes acustomed, then it&#x27;s fine and will not occur again usually.  </li>
            <li>When I recieved the items I read through the ingredients and noticed that one of their main ingredients (SLS) actually contributes to some types of hairloss.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;hot scalp\\&quot; feeling of the spray is a bit annoying, but all in all, I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I am seeing new baby hair starting to grow in the places</li>
            <li>You only live once</li>
            <li>and about 2 weeks later, my hair was falling out so fast that it was clogging the drain DAILY!</li>
            <li>My head suddenly felt... alive!</li>
            <li>Salons usually have a significant markup.  </li>
            <li>The serum (step 3) can redden your scalp a little at first if you have sensitive skin such as myself, but I really could not tell and it does go away shortly afterward.  </li>
            <li>Kind of expensive</li>
            <li>as it used to be, I see new hair starting to grow, and I could swear that even though my hair is mostly white</li>
            <li>The product is a bit odd at first to get used to.  </li>
            <li>The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner was thick and rich and increased</li>
            <li>We have really hard water where I live and after one use, my hair felt so soft and felt so much healthier.</li>
            <li>The scalp treatment spray made my head itch a little bit after the first use, but after that I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it was just me and my body chemistry, but I went back to an all natural shampoo with biotin and niacin, haven&#x27;t seen as much hairloss after using a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>i have spent so much money on different products, and i have finally found what works.</li>
            <li>There is a tingling sensation the first few times when the shampoo and then the scalp treatment are used.  </li>
            <li>I now have feeling much nicer and fuller, just after a week and a half of use.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it for anyone with fine or thin hair.  </li>
            <li>As having not only fine hair but thin</li>
            <li>The shampoo is gentle and you only need a little bit.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The leave-in conditional kind of reeks, but the minty scent of the shampoo and conditioner seems to cancel it out.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are quite nice, just very strong smelling.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this product is a very strong mint smell.  </li>
            <li> I bought this kit on the recommendation of a friend who also has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for about six weeks, and I have noticed that my normally very fine hair looks and feels thicker.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and using all three parts of the kit, help give it body and fullness.</li>
            <li> thanks to Chrystal!&lt;br /&gt;Chrystal, a close friend and cancer survivor had the most beautiful luxourious hair even though two years ago she went through chemo and lost it all.</li>
            <li> very nice product thanks again!</li>
            <li> love this product and if I could, I would hug the inventor!!eek of use, LONGER!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I heard many goo things about this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is really making me happy.</li>
            <li> more like its tingling</li>
            <li> This product does everything it is suppose to do and more.</li>
            <li> Saying that, I like Nioxin better than Ivanti.</li>
            <li> well its ok as fae as shampoos go but cant tell any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> The price is better than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I still balding but I do notice, if I don&#x27;t use it, i will lose more hair.</li>
            <li> sure what is in the stuff-</li>
            <li> The price was MUCH better than in a salon.l</li>
            <li> The hairline by my temples is receding faster than my widow&#x27;s peak area which would leave me an \\&quot;island\\&quot; of hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li> It is not a lot of hair, but I assume the more</li>
            <li> I could see my hair change for the better in just 2 weeks .</li>
            <li> and I was hoping to see better results</li>
            <li> , I still feel like I&#x27;m losing a lot of hair, but I won&#x27;t give up on it yet, maybe it just needs more time to work.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with thinning hair and have tried MANY shampoos and treatments and none have worked.  </li>
            <li> We all have fine hair that thins on the top front.</li>
            <li> Cool and tingly, unlike anything I had ever noticed before!</li>
            <li> I use this the more I may start to see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from keeping hair, this is a great shampoo/conditioner/treatment line that leave your hair feeling full and soft.</li>
            <li> this is  a great product, my hair is growing back and looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> Its a wintery smell, but the cool menthol effect on my head feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this product is that I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After towel drying my hair, I used the leave in spray and again, I was amazed at the cool, refreshing tingle.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I love the cool tingling feeling on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> Recommended by my barber, this Nioxin seems to cleanse hair just fine.</li>
            <li> Its helped my hair grow tremendously!</li>
            <li> The Nioxin 3 step program is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction to this product, would not recommend it to people who have fair sun sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> I was turned onto this product b a friend, am so glad I listened and will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li> When I comb my hair out immediately after my shower, I never see more than one strand in the brush and my hair feels thick and full and the best part?</li>
            <li> When I comb my hair out immediately after my shower, I never see more than one strand in the brush and my hair feels thick and full and the best part?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a significant thickness to my hair.</li>
            <li> I just wish it would be more consistent.</li>
            <li> Either way, I have not been able to tell since I purchased this July 11th if his hair has gotten thicker or not, I will say that it has been extremely soft and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> It is minty and cool.  </li>
            <li> I used the product for a full 60 days after two separate orders and followed all directions.</li>
            <li> full of hair falling out.</li>
            <li> The bottles are not small enough to fly with, but just traveling around works just fine.</li>
            <li> So as far as the shampoo and conditioner go so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> now im lucky to find three hairs@</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for folks with scalp issues or those looking for quick, noticeable growth.</li>
            <li> Whether or not this product stimulates new hair growth, my hair is shinier and more manageable, and</li>
            <li> It comes out in a little squirt which I found best to apply straight to the scalp, rather than squirting it in my hands first.</li>
            <li> I just got this product after a recommendation from a friend and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Everyone was nice and no one mentioned what was painfully obvious in the pictures I viewed afterwards.</li>
            <li> Yes it smells like medicine but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, has body, and has more body.  </li>
            <li> and it is definitely worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> before i would have a whole hand full.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product to someone who has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> For years I have been trying all types of products to get volumizing results, most costing more than I was used to spending on shampoos and conditioners, few with recognizable or consistent results.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m seeing some improvement , I need more time to see full results, my hair is still falling out a lot , but pretty good, just be careful because the third step spray can give you a rash and irritate your scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was the price tag.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably thicker and lighter, wtih more bounce and usually stays that way most of the day.  </li>
            <li> it strengthened  and thickened my hair on the first usage.</li>
            <li> WELL, VERY TINGLY!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the scalp treatment some of the spray landed on my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is filled with natural elements and tingles as it conditions your hair.  </li>
            <li> I think the perceived thickening effect is more likely users wanting to believe it is doing something extra for them, considering they shelled out more money.</li>
            <li> I wish I had more to say about the actual product and how it works, all I can say is that I have high hopes still, although this starter-kit is about through...</li>
            <li> My hair certainly didn&#x27;t seem thicker at all.</li>
            <li> It really makes a positive difference for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine hair and it definitely feels thicker since using it.     </li>
            <li> Really doubting it at this point though.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t bother me so much.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I used the whole system strictly according to the instructions but didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all in my hair.</li>
            <li> this system really worked for me</li>
            <li> He said the conditioner ran out too fast and that after he had used the whole system he didn&#x27;t see any improvement in his thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I notice dulled hair and others not so much.</li>
            <li> I would recommened this product to someone who is really concerned about thinning hair.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t know if it works or not</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a year and would recommend it to anyone who is having hair loss or your hair is not growing as fast as it  should .</li>
            <li> Really does make my hair feel fuller.  </li>
            <li> This system really showed promise, although I just stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does seem to reduce the gray hairs falling into the sink when I brush.  </li>
            <li> my hair is very fine and started to fall out-since using these products have lost less hair-not thicker yet</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to remedy thinning hair, but I also want to say that patience is required to see significant results.</li>
            <li> Makes it feel like it my head is extra clean.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine and limp, but when I noticed the part on top of my head getting wider, I decided to try one of the products on the market made especially for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I am in my early fifties and my fine hair is starting to get thinner and recede.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell if it&#x27;s really doing anything.     </li>
            <li> The minty component in this product causes tingling and makes my scalp even more of a flaky mess.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> May be a high priced gimmick, or placebo.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with thinning hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the shampoo and conditioner, though.  </li>
            <li> It is not a cheap treatment product, but I feel better after using it.  </li>
            <li> at least it did for me, kind of made it drier feeling.</li>
            <li> I figured that my condition (postpartum hairloss) wasn&#x27;t significant enough to cause any major side effects.</li>
            <li> The price was less exorbitant than many products on the market that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read that increased blood flow helps with new hair growth, so</li>
            <li> This product came as advertised and was brand new in the box.</li>
            <li> Tough to review the effectiveness as I&#x27;m also using other products and taking supplements, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with Nioxin.  </li>
            <li> and I lost a considerable amount of it from using Wen shampoo (I must be allergic to something in it sadly, because it is a GREAT hair product).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the shampoo/conditioner, but the daily application treatment (specifically the bottle with the spraying cap--see picture) has a great mild styling effect as if I&#x27;d used a small amount of gel.</li>
            <li> My mother is a balding 40 year old and the lights shine on my grandmothers exposed scalp!</li>
            <li> I have used this hair care line in the past, and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I had used Nioxin years ago before switching to Wen so my first reaction was to go back to the Nioxin.  </li>
            <li> I broke out in large red itchy welts anywhere except my scalp</li>
            <li> A week after beginning to use this, my hair certainly feels stronger and I would definitely say it has the appearance of being thicker.  </li>
            <li> I had recently had my hair cut and have had fine hair all my life, which became even finer following a diagnosis of a medical condition.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin or allergies.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using this on sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> As far as helping regrow hair?  </li>
            <li> fall completely</li>
            <li> However, I was plesantly surprised that this product has worked as well as it does.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think much of it till a minute later when the burning and itching started on my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> That seems to be the only way this product is real.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and shinning.</li>
            <li> She also follows the old advice, brush your hair 100 times a day.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to show off my new curly perm that had finally laid down.</li>
            <li> Once your skin becomes acustomed, then it&#x27;s fine and will not occur again usually.  </li>
            <li> When I recieved the items I read through the ingredients and noticed that one of their main ingredients (SLS) actually contributes to some types of hairloss.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;hot scalp\\&quot; feeling of the spray is a bit annoying, but all in all, I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I am seeing new baby hair starting to grow in the places</li>
            <li> You only live once</li>
            <li> and about 2 weeks later, my hair was falling out so fast that it was clogging the drain DAILY!</li>
            <li> My head suddenly felt... alive!</li>
            <li> Salons usually have a significant markup.  </li>
            <li> The serum (step 3) can redden your scalp a little at first if you have sensitive skin such as myself, but I really could not tell and it does go away shortly afterward.  </li>
            <li> Kind of expensive</li>
            <li> as it used to be, I see new hair starting to grow, and I could swear that even though my hair is mostly white</li>
            <li> The product is a bit odd at first to get used to.  </li>
            <li> The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner was thick and rich and increased</li>
            <li> We have really hard water where I live and after one use, my hair felt so soft and felt so much healthier.</li>
            <li> The scalp treatment spray made my head itch a little bit after the first use, but after that I didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was just me and my body chemistry, but I went back to an all natural shampoo with biotin and niacin, haven&#x27;t seen as much hairloss after using a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> i have spent so much money on different products, and i have finally found what works.</li>
            <li> There is a tingling sensation the first few times when the shampoo and then the scalp treatment are used.  </li>
            <li> I now have feeling much nicer and fuller, just after a week and a half of use.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it for anyone with fine or thin hair.  </li>
            <li> As having not only fine hair but thin</li>
            <li> The shampoo is gentle and you only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> She left it on too long (almost double the amount of time!)</li>
            <li> Using all three products as directed I have noticed some growth of very light \\&quot;baby hair\\&quot; where formerly my hair was looking a little thin.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m not sure of, is is this was a REAL product.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very early I was suprised, they even included a little suprise gift for me.</li>
            <li> my hair was completely dry, I definitely noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> Prior to using Nioxin, I have had dry scalp problems.  </li>
            <li> I finally bought the product and I have only been using it for the past 7 days so far</li>
            <li> The conditioner is much, much smaller than the shampoo, but as a long as you only condition every few days you should have both lasting around the same time.</li>
            <li> so will go a long ways.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not expecting miracle hair growth, the product does work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner, but found the scalp treatment redundant and a pain to do consistently, so I found that part a waste.  </li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyway, other reviews say it takes several months, so I&#x27;ll update if it does.</li>
            <li> i only use it every other day, and i have to look for hair that has fallen out.</li>
            <li> so I could dry it like I like.  </li>
            <li> my hair dry, frizzy, and there was no shine!&lt;br /&gt;NEVER</li>
            <li> Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico.  </li>
            <li> that there was overspray (ie my left arm and a couple of drips down my chest).  </li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t mind the minty scent &amp; the slight tingly feeling</li>
            <li> After 2  weeks of using it not only did I  see less hair falling out</li>
            <li> I have seen slight growth, but not in the back of my head where I need it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just noticed the back getting a little thinner</li>
            <li> I noticed if a drop gets on my neck or face, the area is red for a few hours before going away.  </li>
            <li> but I expected that it could be changed with a product like this</li>
            <li> No real results.</li>
            <li> the product was as expected except</li>
            <li> My hair looks a lot way better and softer , although I still see it and feel it  thin, I&#x27;ve always had it thin</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and started to notice my hair thinning through the past year and a half.</li>
            <li> Only have used this 2 days hard to say what the long term will be.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I use this product for my thinning hair due to health.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks, so am not sure how long it takes to restore any hair loss.  </li>
            <li> It has helped with some other hair problems I have</li>
            <li> You will feel a coolness and tingle when using the shampoo and conditioner, and where these two products touch your skin it will temporarily turn pinkish-red due to the ingredient&#x27;s cleansing effects.</li>
            <li> soon to be mother in law made a comment the other day regarding the men in my family and baldness.</li>
            <li> And, I&#x27;m not convinced that this growth is due to the Nioxin.  </li>
            <li> The scalp treatment seemed silly and over-drive at first, but it settled my hair down</li>
            <li> A HUGE, UGLY BALD SPOT extending throughout the ring of my crown area.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I would have noticed before I washed, as I hate to say it like most people I have an attachment to my hair.</li>
            <li> Thankfully there are now fewer hairs on my pillow in the morning and not a lot of them disappearing down the drain.</li>
            <li> The price that I bought it for was about half of the store price.  </li>
            <li> and I have less hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a little over a month</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend whose hair is starting to thin at 30.</li>
            <li> In not Tony savalles yet, but I think this stuff slow down my baldness.</li>
            <li> and I was a little skeptical and in denial about the thought of my hair actually starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> too-have to use very little of this product</li>
            <li> and once I got out of the shower I actually noticed a small bald spot!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if my hair has grown</li>
            <li> The scalp treatment, I&#x27;m not sure this is something I&#x27;d recommend to someone in chemotherapy and experiencing hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Even as a child, when my hair grew past my shoulders, it would start breaking and splitting.</li>
            <li> NO MORE BALD</li>
            <li> NO MORE BALD</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try this product as I have heard that this line specializes in hairloss.</li>
            <li> but my hair has been bleached in the past</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month of use I have noticed no more hair loss, and in fact lots of hair growing in in areas that were just scalp.</li>
            <li> so some times its hard to find.  </li>
            <li> but I figured I would try it at least once</li>
            <li> this product works wonders, seriously.</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t use to!  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get it back! &gt;:(</li>
            <li> the cleaner is alot smaller then the shampoo - disappointed with that.  </li>
            <li> And it is rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I tried it anyways.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> Does make your scalp feel weird</li>
            <li> Disappointed I bought on the hope of helping with bumpson my scalp and very disappointed in product  a waste of 28 dollars</li>
            <li> I had a bad hair fall before using this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> Now, knowing that I had these genetics, I did a stupid thing and allowed a friend to put a perm in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out awfully</li>
            <li> I hated it!</li>

            <li> Nice kit to start. Tried it and liked it. The bottles are not small enough to fly with, but just traveling around works just fine. Will order again.</li>
            <li> my hair is very fine and started to fall out-since using these products have lost less hair-not thicker yet but product states this takes time-makes my scalp tingle and feels good-smells great too-have to use very little of this product so will go a long ways. highly recommend</li>
            <li> I use this product for my thinning hair due to health.  I have been using it for 10+ years and it still seems to work well.  Not fond of the smell but I can handle it.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit on the recommendation of a friend who also has very fine hair.  She hasn&#x27;t used the Scalp Activating Treatment.  The second time I used the SAT I broke out in large red itchy welts anywhere except my scalp (???huh???) that there was overspray (ie my left arm and a couple of drips down my chest).  I do not have sensitive skin or allergies.  At least I didn&#x27;t use to!  I am going to keep using the shampoo/conditioner for a while but I am calling the manufacturer about my skin reaction.  Hives are not a \\&quot;Temporary Redness\\&quot; as the label warns.  I don&#x27;t care for the minty scent of the shampoo/conditioner either.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased because I noticed hair loss and breakage.  Not sure if my hair has grown but it has stopped breaking and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> Disappointed I bought on the hope of helping with bumpson my scalp and very disappointed in product  a waste of 28 dollars</li>
            <li> The product arrived very early I was suprised, they even included a little suprise gift for me. I would buy from them again.</li>
            <li> it works for me. the appearance of my hair is improveded after couple of times using.like to continue to use.</li>
            <li> I think it cleans my hair.  As for any visiable changes, nothing yet.  May be a high priced gimmick, or placebo. Thought I&#x27;d give it a try anyway, other reviews say it takes several months, so I&#x27;ll update if it does. Really doubting it at this point though.</li>
            <li> Since Procter &amp; Gamble moved production to Mexico, the product doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as good as it used to be.  The Scalp Therapy used to really tingle on my scalp and now it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than just sit there.  Apparently, they closed down the U.S. manufacturing plant and started producing Nioxin in Mexico.  It appears to me they may have also changed the formula.  Either way, I don&#x27;t perceive the same thickening effect it used to have.  This is unfortunate because I used to really love this product line.</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is a very strong mint smell.  I am thankful I started to use this after all my treatments were done and smell didn&#x27;t bother me so much.  The shampoo and conditioner are quite nice, just very strong smelling.  The scalp treatment, I&#x27;m not sure this is something I&#x27;d recommend to someone in chemotherapy and experiencing hair loss.  I noticed if a drop gets on my neck or face, the area is red for a few hours before going away.  I can&#x27;t imagine using this on sensitive scalp.  But it leaves the hair I now have feeling much nicer and fuller, just after a week and a half of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the starter kit for about a month now. I&#x27;ve always had fine hair and it definitely feels thicker since using it.     As far as helping regrow hair?  I really don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s not making me lose anymore so thats always a plus. I&#x27;m not shiny head bald... I&#x27;ve just noticed the back getting a little thinner so it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell if it&#x27;s really doing anything.     I would recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> I had a bad hair fall before using this product. I cant say that this product stopped the hair fall completely but it is working moderate.</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out awfully so I decided to try this product to stop my hair falling out but I was dissapointed because it didn&#x27;t help and I noticed that my hair started even falling out more than before using this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the shampoo/conditioner, but the daily application treatment (specifically the bottle with the spraying cap--see picture) has a great mild styling effect as if I&#x27;d used a small amount of gel. Using all three products as directed I have noticed some growth of very light \\&quot;baby hair\\&quot; where formerly my hair was looking a little thin. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but do expect some improvement.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair while using this product.  And it is rather expensive.  My hair certainly didn&#x27;t seem thicker at all.</li>
            <li> I just got this product after a recommendation from a friend and so far I love it. We have really hard water where I live and after one use, my hair felt so soft and felt so much healthier. The scalp treatment spray made my head itch a little bit after the first use, but after that I didn&#x27;t have any issues. I actually don&#x27;t mind the minty scent &amp; the slight tingly feeling that the conditioner causes (once you rinse it out it goes away). After a week, my hair was noticeably healthier. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Tough to review the effectiveness as I&#x27;m also using other products and taking supplements, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with Nioxin.  A week after beginning to use this, my hair certainly feels stronger and I would definitely say it has the appearance of being thicker.  I like the tingling/menthol like affect in the morning to wake me up.  I&#x27;ve also read that increased blood flow helps with new hair growth, so I would imagine this could only help in that area.  I like the treatment spray as I can comb it in after I shower and not have to rinse it out or anything.  I don&#x27;t use any type of gel or anything to style my hair, and this doesn&#x27;t feel like i have anything in it after it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thinning hair. Even as a child, when my hair grew past my shoulders, it would start breaking and splitting. I hated it! My mother is a balding 40 year old and the lights shine on my grandmothers exposed scalp! Now, knowing that I had these genetics, I did a stupid thing and allowed a friend to put a perm in my hair. She left it on too long (almost double the amount of time!) and about 2 weeks later, my hair was falling out so fast that it was clogging the drain DAILY! I was horrified. Not only had my genetics screwed me, the perm made my hair fall out AND I was in the sun constantly so my hair took the brunt of the damage.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to Christmas last year. I was so excited to show off my new curly perm that had finally laid down. Everyone was nice and no one mentioned what was painfully obvious in the pictures I viewed afterwards. A HUGE, UGLY BALD SPOT extending throughout the ring of my crown area. I was so embarassed that I resorted to constantly pulling my hair into a ponytail. WHen the hair on the side of my head started thinning, I thought there was no hope left.&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to Chrystal!&lt;br /&gt;Chrystal, a close friend and cancer survivor had the most beautiful luxourious hair even though two years ago she went through chemo and lost it all. I decided to ask her what I should do and she told me about Nioxin!&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the price tag. Kind of expensive but I figured I would try it at least once and if it didn&#x27;t work then I wouldn&#x27;t buy any more.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the bottle, I enjoyed the peppermint smell and then came the washing! My head suddenly felt... alive! Cool and tingly, unlike anything I had ever noticed before! The conditioner was thick and rich and increased the tingles!&lt;br /&gt;After towel drying my hair, I used the leave in spray and again, I was amazed at the cool, refreshing tingle.&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair was completely dry, I definitely noticed a difference! My hair felt thicker, stronger and after a week of use, LONGER!&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#x27;s been 2 months and I use the shampoo and conditioner (and leave in spray) every time I shower. When I comb my hair out immediately after my shower, I never see more than one strand in the brush and my hair feels thick and full and the best part? NO MORE BALD SPOT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and if I could, I would hug the inventor!!eek of use, LONGER!&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#x27;s been 2 months and I use the shampoo and conditioner (and leave in spray) every time I shower. When I comb my hair out immediately after my shower, I never see more than one strand in the brush and my hair feels thick and full and the best part? NO MORE BALD SPOT!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and if I could, I would hug the inventor!!</li>
            <li> Its helped my hair grow tremendously!</li>
            <li> I heard many goo things about this product.  The price that I bought it for was about half of the store price.  Works well. I like the tingling feeling it leaves. Makes it feel like it my head is extra clean.</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and started to notice my hair thinning through the past year and a half. Someone referred nioxin to me a while back and I was a little skeptical and in denial about the thought of my hair actually starting to disappear. I finally bought the product and I have only been using it for the past 7 days so far and it is wonderful. I am seeing new baby hair starting to grow in the places it was thinning. The smell is not that great. Its a wintery smell, but the cool menthol effect on my head feels pretty good. This product is really making me happy. So for me I can say this product is working as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try this product as I have heard that this line specializes in hairloss. When I recieved the items I read through the ingredients and noticed that one of their main ingredients (SLS) actually contributes to some types of hairloss. Needless to say, I tried it anyways. I figured that my condition (postpartum hairloss) wasn&#x27;t significant enough to cause any major side effects. Well...let me tell you...it irritated my scalp once I applied the product. You ever hear, if it tingles, its working? Yeah...more like its tingling and my head is on fire. I didn&#x27;t continue with the conditioner and once I got out of the shower I actually noticed a small bald spot!!! Trust me, I would have noticed before I washed, as I hate to say it like most people I have an attachment to my hair. I am not sure if it was just me and my body chemistry, but I went back to an all natural shampoo with biotin and niacin, haven&#x27;t seen as much hairloss after using a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m seeing some improvement , I need more time to see full results, my hair is still falling out a lot , but pretty good, just be careful because the third step spray can give you a rash and irritate your scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> Stimulator burned my scalp.</li>
            <li> I had recently had my hair cut and have had fine hair all my life, which became even finer following a diagnosis of a medical condition.  For years I have been trying all types of products to get volumizing results, most costing more than I was used to spending on shampoos and conditioners, few with recognizable or consistent results.  However, I was plesantly surprised that this product has worked as well as it does.  My hair is noticeably thicker and lighter, wtih more bounce and usually stays that way most of the day.  The product is a bit odd at first to get used to.  There is a tingling sensation the first few times when the shampoo and then the scalp treatment are used.  The serum (step 3) can redden your scalp a little at first if you have sensitive skin such as myself, but I really could not tell and it does go away shortly afterward.  Once your skin becomes acustomed, then it&#x27;s fine and will not occur again usually.  This is actually explained on the bottle instructions.  Overall, I would recommend this product to someone who has very fine hair.  I cannot say if it works for hair growth, but I feel that it likely does as I have been worried I have been losing hair rather than it thinning, but not anymore! Very happy with this line.</li>
            <li> I loved it but my hair has been bleached in the past so I had to order Nioxin 3. Plus I use Nioxin because I have 3 WENS in my scalp, so I am hoping this product can get rid of them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wendy Bigham</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not expecting miracle hair growth, the product does work as advertised.  I&#x27;ve been using these products for about six weeks, and I have noticed that my normally very fine hair looks and feels thicker.  The \\&quot;hot scalp\\&quot; feeling of the spray is a bit annoying, but all in all, I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This did nothing to reduce my daily hair loss.  Plus the smell is not too pleasant.  I will no be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it is suppose to do and more. Great product. I will definitely buy again. You cant go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> I am a returning user of Nioxin.  Just a note: Nioxin does not grow hair, it does not thicken hair, it just make the hair appear thicker.  Saying that, I like Nioxin better than Ivanti.</li>
            <li> I used the whole system strictly according to the instructions but didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all in my hair. The only good thing about this product is that I liked the smell. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair care line in the past, and absolutely love it.  The price is great for what you get, and it makes my hair and scalp feel fantastic!</li>
            <li> this system really worked for me it strengthened  and thickened my hair on the first usage. I am seeing amazing results this is a staple in my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> JUST STARTED USING THIS FOR MY THINNING HAIR, SEEMS TO BE WORKING WELL, VERY TINGLY!  GREAT SIZE FOR A STARTER, TO SEE IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t produce fuller looking or feeling hair.  I was disappointed.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and still loosing the same amount of hair as I did when I wasn&#x27;t using it.</li>
            <li> well its ok as fae as shampoos go but cant tell any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> As having not only fine hair but thin as well I actually feel volume no hair on the brush. Yes it smells like medicine but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for a month. I have noticed an improvement in shine, thickness and I have less hair loss. I have only used the cleanser and scalp therapy for a month. The first time I used the scalp treatment some of the spray landed on my neck and shoulders. Didn&#x27;t think much of it till a minute later when the burning and itching started on my neck and shoulders. After an hour and a dose of benadryl the rashes disappeared. I&#x27;m guessing it was from one of the leaf oils that was in it. I do have allergies to grasses and trees. So as far as the shampoo and conditioner go so far I&#x27;m happy with it. I would of given it 5 stars but I&#x27;m not big on the mint smell it has.</li>
            <li> My hair looks a lot way better and softer , although I still see it and feel it  thin, I&#x27;ve always had it thin but I expected that it could be changed with a product like this</li>
            <li> OK but not impressed, will not reorder</li>
            <li> I am in my early fifties and my fine hair is starting to get thinner and recede.  The Philippine lady who cuts my hair also noticed pimples on the upper back of my neck.  She recommended this product and it works.  The shampoo is gentle and you only need a little bit.  The conditioner is filled with natural elements and tingles as it conditions your hair.  After it is rinsed out, you can still feel the tingling sensation.  The scalp treatment seemed silly and over-drive at first, but it settled my hair down so I could dry it like I like.  There are no unnatural or petroleum-based ingredients.  Between these products, my scalp and hair is healthier looking and feeling.  It is not a cheap treatment product, but I feel better after using it.  You only live once and it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  Think about putting a water filter in your showerhead.  Chemicals and chlorine can damage your scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> seems to help my hair look fuller and hides my scalp which is great.  would recommend this product to anyone with thinning hair</li>
            <li> I used this product and didn&#x27;t purchase again for the following reasons:    1. I didn&#x27;t notice a significant thickness to my hair. However, it wasn&#x27;t thinner either.     2. It doesn&#x27;t smell that great.    3. It took the nice curl out of my hair and I can&#x27;t get it back! &gt;:(</li>
            <li> This product came as advertised and was brand new in the box. the savings was substantial in comparison to the store price.</li>
            <li> I tried this for 4 months, but to no avail. The price is better than anywhere else. My sister and aunt tried it too, but it did not work for them. We all have fine hair that thins on the top front.</li>
            <li> I love the cool tingling feeling on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, has body, and has more body.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks, so am not sure how long it takes to restore any hair loss.  My hair is very fine, and using all three parts of the kit, help give it body and fullness.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I have actually had people tell me that my hair is growing back without me even saying anything about it.</li>
            <li> Definitely felt like it was working... Felt. No real results. I&#x27;d like my money back</li>
            <li> This was for my dad.  He said the conditioner ran out too fast and that after he had used the whole system he didn&#x27;t see any improvement in his thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so convinced to product works as efficiently. Sometimes I notice dulled hair and others not so much. I just wish it would be more consistent.</li>
            <li> Good price for this product. I have only used it for 3 weeks. It feels like it is working. It has helped with some other hair problems I have so I don&#x27;t have to buy two different types of shampoo anymore.</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction to this product, would not recommend it to people who have fair sun sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair dry, frizzy, and there was no shine!&lt;br /&gt;NEVER purchasing this product again.&lt;br /&gt;Wish Bumble and Bumble would start making their version of this product again, it really worked!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month since I started using this product and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. My scalp is not itchy anymore as it used to be, I see new hair starting to grow, and I could swear that even though my hair is mostly white I am seeing some color creeping back in. You will feel a coolness and tingle when using the shampoo and conditioner, and where these two products touch your skin it will temporarily turn pinkish-red due to the ingredient&#x27;s cleansing effects. The price was less exorbitant than many products on the market that don&#x27;t work nearly as well. Happy customer here!</li>
            <li> this is  a great product, my hair is growing back and looks fabulous! I highly recommend this for anyone with thinning hair</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine and limp, but when I noticed the part on top of my head getting wider, I decided to try one of the products on the market made especially for thinning hair. I chose Nioxin because it is a professional-looking product that doesn&#x27;t make any sensational claims about curing baldness. Whether or not this product stimulates new hair growth, my hair is shinier and more manageable, and my scalp healthier than ever before. A little goes a long way and it is definitely worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> I still balding but I do notice, if I don&#x27;t use it, i will lose more hair. In not Tony savalles yet, but I think this stuff slow down my baldness.</li>
            <li> the best product at the best price.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair but give it a tiny bit of volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nioxin for years -the system 1 shampoo and conditioner.  thought I&#x27;d try the leave in serum. now i have what looks like a sun burn or poison ivy in my hair, my face, neck and any where else it landed as i tried to wash it off.  not a rash per say- a burn.&lt;br /&gt;not sure what is in the stuff- but it doesn&#x27;t like me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I have thinning hair.  I do not use it on a regular basis, I dont care for the scent.  It is minty and cool.  I would recommened this product to someone who is really concerned about thinning hair.</li>
            <li> this product works wonders, seriously. i have spent so much money on different products, and i have finally found what works. i only use it every other day, and i have to look for hair that has fallen out. before i would have a whole hand full. now im lucky to find three hairs@ its amazing</li>
            <li> Stopped my balding an is helping regrow hair my fiance and all my friends are all amazed. This is a really great buy I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month and I so not see an improvement at all. I am still using it and hoping it will eventually start working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m indifferent at the moment. I bought this product for my boyfriend whose hair is starting to thin at 30. This product was recommended to him by his hair stylist, and so we trusted it. What I&#x27;m not sure of, is is this was a REAL product. (No offense to the seller) According to things I&#x27;m researching online, Nioxin themselves have not authorized any online dealers to sell their product, so perhaps this seller is a salon owner? That seems to be the only way this product is real. Either way, I have not been able to tell since I purchased this July 11th if his hair has gotten thicker or not, I will say that it has been extremely soft and feels healthy. I wish I had more to say about the actual product and how it works, all I can say is that I have high hopes still, although this starter-kit is about through...</li>
            <li> Use it every day.  Love it!  Would recommend it for anyone with fine or thin hair.  Does make your scalp feel weird but you get used to that.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and I lost a considerable amount of it from using Wen shampoo (I must be allergic to something in it sadly, because it is a GREAT hair product).  I had used Nioxin years ago before switching to Wen so my first reaction was to go back to the Nioxin.  Thankfully there are now fewer hairs on my pillow in the morning and not a lot of them disappearing down the drain.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my barber, this Nioxin seems to cleanse hair just fine. It smells nice, as does the conditioner. The leave-in conditional kind of reeks, but the minty scent of the shampoo and conditioner seems to cancel it out. I saw no benefit in terms of a thickening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: the official copy for this product states that such-and-such percentage of users &amp;#34;perceive&amp;#34; a thickening effect. It&#x27;s not there. It&#x27;s just basically a more expensive way to wash and condition your hair. I think the perceived thickening effect is more likely users wanting to believe it is doing something extra for them, considering they shelled out more money. It does change the texture of one&#x27;s hair a bit - at least it did for me, kind of made it drier feeling.</li>
            <li> My beautician always use these products in her salon so in between visits I wash and condition my hair with them.  I have problems with thinning hair and I try to use the best products I can find.  Not all stores carry Nioxin so some times its hard to find.  It really makes a positive difference for my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I just started using it and I really don&#x27;t know if it works or not but I do feel that cleans and leaves my hair as stated inside the product label. I hope it works!!! but I do like the mint feeling ..</li>
            <li> My husband likes it and has re-ordered.  The price was MUCH better than in a salon.l</li>
            <li> the product was as expected except the cleaner is alot smaller then the shampoo - disappointed with that.  But the product is good.</li>
            <li> I am only 24 and already have signs of balding. The hairline by my temples is receding faster than my widow&#x27;s peak area which would leave me an \\&quot;island\\&quot; of hair on top of my head. Both sides of my family have bald men, so I am doomed! My barber recommended this product line to keep the hair I have, and possibly see some come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of use I have noticed no more hair loss, and in fact lots of hair growing in in areas that were just scalp. It is not a lot of hair, but I assume the more I use this the more I may start to see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from keeping hair, this is a great shampoo/conditioner/treatment line that leave your hair feeling full and soft. The conditioner is much, much smaller than the shampoo, but as a long as you only condition every few days you should have both lasting around the same time. Also, the treatment is almost like a hairspray in its consistency. It comes out in a little squirt which I found best to apply straight to the scalp, rather than squirting it in my hands first. It has the slightest of holds (as it is not a hairspray to do styling with.) If you do not want it to hold at all you just need to brush your hair and you will not see a sign that you have anything extra in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will re-buy this product line forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 4/29/2013*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My soon to be mother in law made a comment the other day regarding the men in my family and baldness. She had noticed before that I was loosing my hair, but asked how the family hair looks, as I noticeably had more hair in the front than before! This stuff works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I used the product for a full 60 days after two separate orders and followed all directions. I didn&#x27;t see any of the suggested results as advertised and would definitely not suggest anyone wasting their money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I was having a lot of hair loss every time I would brush my hair or wash it I would have hands  full of hair falling out. After 2  weeks of using it not only did I  see less hair falling out but the condition of my hair wash great. I could see my hair change for the better in just 2 weeks . I have been using it for a year and would recommend it to anyone who is having hair loss or your hair is not growing as fast as it  should . Its  minty smelling, very refreshing to your scalp.</li>
            <li> Really does make my hair feel fuller.  I use the shampoo and conditioner, but found the scalp treatment redundant and a pain to do consistently, so I found that part a waste.  Highly recommend the shampoo and conditioner, though.  And, someone recently said they thought my hair was &amp;#34;very shiny&amp;#34;...nice bonus.</li>
            <li> Only have used this 2 days hard to say what the long term will be.</li>
            <li> This system really showed promise, although I just stopped using it. Someone who keeps up with it would definitely see results, I would say!</li>
            <li> Love the tingly mint smell and feel of this great shampoo. Hair is soft and shinning. Switching to it permanently!</li>
            <li> This product fulfills its claims.  My hair is healthier and thicker because I&#x27;ve been using this product faithfully for the last 4-5 months, and I don&#x27;t even use it as often as the instructions say because I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day.  I saved money ordering the product online.  Salons usually have a significant markup.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to remedy thinning hair, but I also want to say that patience is required to see significant results.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> I have been using it a little over a month and I was hoping to see better results, I still feel like I&#x27;m losing a lot of hair, but I won&#x27;t give up on it yet, maybe it just needs more time to work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to re-grow parts of my hair that have thinned out over the years.  Prior to using Nioxin, I have had dry scalp problems.  The minty component in this product causes tingling and makes my scalp even more of a flaky mess.  I have seen slight growth, but not in the back of my head where I need it.  And, I&#x27;m not convinced that this growth is due to the Nioxin.  I would not recommend this product for folks with scalp issues or those looking for quick, noticeable growth.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with thinning hair and have tried MANY shampoos and treatments and none have worked.  The Nioxin 3 step program is fantastic.  Thank you for stocking it.</li>
            <li> very nice product thanks again!</li>
            <li> I was turned onto this product b a friend, am so glad I listened and will be ordering more very soon.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does seem to reduce the gray hairs falling into the sink when I brush.  My hair dresser the only thing is, you have to keep using it or whatever is causing hair loss will return.  She also follows the old advice, brush your hair 100 times a day.  The things we do to keep beautiful</li>
