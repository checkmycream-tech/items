    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>As advertised, GREAT!</li>
            <li>Perfect.... get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Combs are of very good quality.  </li>
            <li>Go to Sally&#x27;s or something and get a bunch of Unbreakables (the &amp;#34;Originals&amp;#34; and not crappy knockoffs) for a buck each and be happy.</li>
            <li>Great pocket combs.</li>
            <li>Awesome loved them need to buy more.</li>
            <li>They are good quality combs.</li>
            <li>good travel comb, but</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not factored into my review since it&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li>Really nice and definitely CHEAP combs!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s good because it will fit in most pockets.</li>
            <li>Great small pocket combs, my son and husband use them with the pomade and dont complain, so they must be great!</li>
            <li>These combs are perfect and I have enough</li>
            <li>More like a mustache comb.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, if you lose one you have 3 more</li>
            <li>I love their pomade but not their comb.</li>
            <li>These work just fine as cheap pocket combs.</li>
            <li>Why: Wanted a comb that could fit in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Well, I missed in the description the combs were only 5 inches, lol.</li>
            <li>Overall a good strong buy</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>Your hand will cover half the comb as you hold it, but this is a good option to stick in your pocket.</li>
            <li>love how these look, but I have only used them literally a handful of times during the months 2-3 months I&#x27;ve had them.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought my mistake other than that the work great</li>
            <li>Probably good for short and straight hair only.</li>
            <li>I really like Suavecito for my pomp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really well.</li>
            <li>Its just a name on a comb, your better off with other brands, this one is over priced and underperforms.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in your pocket nice and comfy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  just not digging these combs, as cool as they look, especially with their engraved gold writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Everything about them are thinner and dare I say flimsier feeling than a classic Unbreakable.</li>
            <li>I ordered them, I figured they would be the size of your classic Unbreakable comb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although this shorter length means you have barely any bristles to work with due to your hand covering up most of them when you hold it.</li>
            <li>combs really seem like they would be better suited for simply combing long hair out or something, not for styling, especially not for pompadours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought these as a gift, so far no complaints.</li>
            <li>The comb tends to &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; strands of hair while combing, causing the pomp to look messy and thus requiring more time than necessary to get it looking tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> saw the  other reviews saying that they are tiny, but I just figured these people must be used to bigger combs or something.</li>
            <li> I have thicker hair, and these combs just fail to cleanly comb through.</li>
            <li> So small completely unusable</li>
            <li> : Hurts when you comb your hair, feels sharp as you glide the comb.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:</li>
            <li> The teeth are really sharp</li>
            <li> the teeth were too sharp??</li>
            <li> I have big hands and these are hard to use</li>
            <li> This means that although I have yet to break one, they are a pain to use because they bend and flex so much, especially when combing through thick layers of pomade or wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very small and basic.</li>
            <li> came in and they are about a half inch shorter in length than an Unbreakable (which I could make do with).</li>
            <li> Length I wish was slightly longer.</li>
            <li> not sure how that other guy got the idea</li>
            <li> And my hands are not huge or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> They are really small</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re scraping your scalp hardcore or you got a weak skin layer</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even use them :(</li>

            <li> Bought these as a gift, so far no complaints. They are good quality combs.</li>
            <li> I really like Suavecito for my pomp.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m  just not digging these combs, as cool as they look, especially with their engraved gold writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the  other reviews saying that they are tiny, but I just figured these people must be used to bigger combs or something. But these are truly miniature combs. Everything about them are thinner and dare I say flimsier feeling than a classic Unbreakable. This means that although I have yet to break one, they are a pain to use because they bend and flex so much, especially when combing through thick layers of pomade or wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered them, I figured they would be the size of your classic Unbreakable comb.&lt;br /&gt;They came in and they are about a half inch shorter in length than an Unbreakable (which I could make do with). Although this shorter length means you have barely any bristles to work with due to your hand covering up most of them when you hold it. And my hands are not huge or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But man the problem arises with the length of the bristles themselves. I have thicker hair, and these combs just fail to cleanly comb through. The comb tends to &amp;#34;lose&amp;#34; strands of hair while combing, causing the pomp to look messy and thus requiring more time than necessary to get it looking tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These combs really seem like they would be better suited for simply combing long hair out or something, not for styling, especially not for pompadours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how these look, but I have only used them literally a handful of times during the months 2-3 months I&#x27;ve had them. I always go back to my Unbreakables. Go to Sally&#x27;s or something and get a bunch of Unbreakables (the &amp;#34;Originals&amp;#34; and not crappy knockoffs) for a buck each and be happy.</li>
            <li> LOW QUALITY BABY COMBS. AN OVER PRICED.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so tiny. Can&#x27;t even use them :(</li>
            <li> Great small pocket combs, my son and husband use them with the pomade and dont complain, so they must be great!</li>
            <li> They are really small I have big hands and these are hard to use</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought my mistake other than that the work great</li>
            <li> These combs are perfect and I have enough so I don&#x27;t worry about losing them.</li>
            <li> More like a mustache comb. So small completely unusable</li>
            <li> Sturdy. Length I wish was slightly longer. Overall a good strong buy</li>
            <li> good travel comb, but i like the barber flattop comb for styling at home.</li>
            <li> They are very small and basic. Probably good for short and straight hair only.</li>
            <li> Why: Wanted a comb that could fit in my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: colors.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Hurts when you comb your hair, feels sharp as you glide the comb.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Its just a name on a comb, your better off with other brands, this one is over priced and underperforms.</li>
            <li> Really nice and definitely CHEAP combs! They are pretty small, maybe like 4 inches? but that&#x27;s good because it will fit in most pockets. It&#x27;s definitely a pack of combs you should buy.</li>
            <li> Way smaller than I was expecting but they do comb hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome loved them need to buy more.</li>
            <li> These work just fine as cheap pocket combs. They are a short comb made to carry, with the teeth  measuring 4+5/8 inches end to end. Your hand will cover half the comb as you hold it, but this is a good option to stick in your pocket.</li>
            <li> As advertised, GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great pocket combs. I always keep one on me. Can&#x27;t beat the price, if you lose one you have 3 more</li>
            <li> They comb. Really well.</li>
            <li> I love their pomade but not their comb. The teeth are really sharp</li>
            <li> Perfect.... get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Well, I missed in the description the combs were only 5 inches, lol. Overall though beyond my overlooking the size of the combs they&#x27;re alright. Small enough to fit in your pocket nice and comfy. Plus I like having different colors - it&#x27;s cool. I didn&#x27;t feel like testing whether or not the combs were &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ll take their word for it. They&#x27;re combs and they comb quite well...not sure how that other guy got the idea the teeth were too sharp?? Unless you&#x27;re scraping your scalp hardcore or you got a weak skin layer then I don&#x27;t see what the sharpness is all about. I just wish I saw they were only 5 inches as I was looking for something slightly bigger but that&#x27;s not factored into my review since it&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li> Combs are of very good quality.  Unbreakable which I needed.</li>
