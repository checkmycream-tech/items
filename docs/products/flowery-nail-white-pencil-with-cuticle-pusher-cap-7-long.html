            <li>BUT the product has changed and not for the better.</li>

            <li>ITS BETTER QUALITY THAN SALLY HANSEN PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>A COUPLE  MORE</li>
            <li>so glad I found this here after they stopped carrying these in the store.</li>
            <li>This was quite the bargain for sure.</li>
            <li>Glad I did, as this one is also better.</li>
            <li>I loved the product so much that I just ordered 3 sets of 3.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on easily</li>
            <li>When I first ordered these pencils back in 2014 they were awesome.</li>
            <li>My apprehension was justified.</li>
            <li>This arrived WAY faster than I was expecting, and it works great under nails to give a clean, French tip look.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this item.  </li>
            <li>Clean up where it shows on your skin, and go.</li>
            <li>Put on a top coat of clear polish, or use a pale pastel shade, and the look is very nice and nicely tailored.</li>
            <li>This is true with any nail whitening pencil.</li>

            <li>So glad this company offers this product today.</li>
            <li>the people who say it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;re doing it right...</li>
            <li>The pencils sharpened to a very nice long point and not only made my nails look clean and manicured but also longer.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, my nails were longer</li>
            <li>My nails are not stained and I do have a pretty whitish tip already</li>
            <li>I read one review that mentioned that the white pencil washes off easily.</li>
            <li>First of all the item pictured is the older version with a &#x27;see thru&#x27; cap.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried wetting the tip as another person suggested, and really, there was no difference in the appearance of the tip of my nail, except for the goopy mes I had to remove from my finger tips.</li>
            <li>I particularly love this one because the pencil is thin, therefore, the tip fits easily under nails.</li>
            <li>but I expected a really nice white tip with this pencil and it didn&#x27;t deliver at all.</li>
            <li>Other than the expected price increases over the years the pencil has never changed.. always good and reliable.</li>
            <li>Most people are not familiar with these</li>
            <li>If anyone out there finds a new one</li>
            <li>This new packaging also contains a new pencil.</li>
            <li>The new one has a rounded finished bottom and who knows what it is made of.</li>
            <li>But I have sharpened both and the new one is horrid.</li>
            <li>A lot cheaper than a French manicure, and much easier to achieve.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t sharpen and the lead is too soft so it continually breaks as you sharpen them.  </li>
            <li>wash your hand first, or get your nail tips wet, then put the nail pencil under your nail.</li>
            <li>I am now on the the search for a new White Pencil.</li>
            <li>Anyone who would use a sharp piece of plastic on their cuticles doesn&#x27;t know the first thing about manicures.</li>
            <li>WORKS FINE, THESE ARE HARD TO FIND.  </li>
            <li>Go back to the clear lid the cuticle pushers are a joke.</li>
            <li>The old pencil has an opened end on it so you can see the white.</li>
            <li>not good - tip breaks easily</li>
            <li>I want the old Flowery nail white pencil back.</li>
            <li>However when I recently went to buy a new pencil (April 2015) and saw that they had changed the packaging by including a new cuticle pusher cap I became a little suspicious.</li>
            <li>I was left with a large rounded tip that would never fit under my nails.</li>
            <li>I wet the tip of the pencil and apply the color, wipe the excess off my skin, then finish the manicure by using a coat of clear nail polish under the nails to seal in the color.</li>

            <li> So although I was disappointed the first time I tried it, I decided, to be fair, to try it a few times before writing my review  </li>

            <li> Coating with a little clear nail polish will make it last a lot longer.</li>

            <li> As someone who doesn&#x27;t like nail polish, I&#x27;ll probably take the time to use this even on my short nails before holiday parties; it&#x27;ll just take a bit longer so I can be careful.</li>

            <li> pencil down to 3&amp;#34; without even being used.</li>
            <li> Now you just get a crumbled mess.</li>
            <li> No good for french manicure or anything for that matter… Is uneven and doesn&#x27;t last…</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> a washcloth or Q-Tip will get the white off your skin without disturbing what&#x27;s under your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Flowery nail pencil for the past 20+ years, probably longer than that.</li>
            <li> again, hard to find in stores.</li>

            <li> useless purchase.</li>
            <li> However, after trying a few times, I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> A real lousy one at that.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product...again, hard to find in stores. Only AMAZON would probably have it.</li>
            <li> Nice pencil but awkward to use because of length.</li>
            <li> This pencil made almost NO difference in the color of my nails. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I can never find these and I love them - so thank you!  My grandmother uses these and I love mine!</li>
            <li> not good - tip breaks easily</li>
            <li> When I first ordered these pencils back in 2014 they were awesome. The pencils sharpened to a very nice long point and not only made my nails look clean and manicured but also longer. I always had a white pencil with me, never went anywhere without it. I loved the product so much that I just ordered 3 sets of 3. BUT the product has changed and not for the better. Now you just get a crumbled mess.I am so disappointed. I am now on the the search for a new White Pencil. Wish they would have left it alone it was perfect the way it was. Go back to the clear lid the cuticle pushers are a joke. If anyone out there finds a new one please, please let us know.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on easily and, when I was trying to sharpen it, it kept breaking, so I trashed it.</li>
            <li> My mom used to use a nail whitening pencil, so when I stumbled across this on Amazon I decided to give it a try. When it first arrived, my nails were longer and I had no problem using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: You need to angle the tip so it&#x27;s pointing at the underside of your nail, and not rubbing on your skin. If you still get some on your skin, a quick buff with a washcloth or Q-Tip will get the white off your skin without disturbing what&#x27;s under your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week or two of use, I decided to cut my nails short since I&#x27;ll be doing a LOT of baking for the holidays. This doesn&#x27;t work as well on very short nails, so I&#x27;ve tucked it into a drawer for now. As someone who doesn&#x27;t like nail polish, I&#x27;ll probably take the time to use this even on my short nails before holiday parties; it&#x27;ll just take a bit longer so I can be careful.</li>
            <li> Works O K.  Have to work to make the white stay on the nail but I use it just to keep underneath my nails cleaned out when they get dirt under them.</li>
            <li> seems to be okay but the color doesn&#x27;t last long.  You use it and then if you wash your hands it&#x27;s all gone</li>
            <li> I read one review that mentioned that the white pencil washes off easily. This is true with any nail whitening pencil. I found a solution to the problem. I wet the tip of the pencil and apply the color, wipe the excess off my skin, then finish the manicure by using a coat of clear nail polish under the nails to seal in the color. I particularly love this one because the pencil is thin, therefore, the tip fits easily under nails.</li>
            <li> I have used Flowery nail pencil for the past 20+ years, probably longer than that. Other than the expected price increases over the years the pencil has never changed.. always good and reliable. However when I recently went to buy a new pencil (April 2015) and saw that they had changed the packaging by including a new cuticle pusher cap I became a little suspicious. My apprehension was justified. This new packaging also contains a new pencil. A real lousy one at that. When I went to sharpen it the white just crumbled. I was left with a large rounded tip that would never fit under my nails. I kept sharpening it and it went from a 7&amp;#34; pencil down to 3&amp;#34; without even being used. The old pencil has an opened end on it so you can see the white. The new one has a rounded finished bottom and who knows what it is made of. But I have sharpened both and the new one is horrid. And the cuticle pusher they give you !!! don&#x27;t make me laugh. Anyone who would use a sharp piece of plastic on their cuticles doesn&#x27;t know the first thing about manicures.Their idea of new and improved is to offer a horrible cheap product for the same money. Please tell your retailer or Amazon if your findings are like mine. I want the old Flowery nail white pencil back.</li>
            <li> No good for french manicure or anything for that matter… Is uneven and doesn&#x27;t last… Maybe is good more little kids playing as if they are in the salon or something…</li>
            <li> Most people are not familiar with these but I am a fan.  They whiten the nail tips by coated the underside.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Difficult to find in stores. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Nail white pencils are an endangered species, and if you are younger than 50 you might never have heard of them. My grandmother taught me about them, and she always gave herself beautiful manicures, so there you go. You moisten the tip of one of these and carefully run it along the undersides of your nails. Put on a top coat of clear polish, or use a pale pastel shade, and the look is very nice and nicely tailored. A lot cheaper than a French manicure, and much easier to achieve.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used white nail pencil products for fifty years.  So glad this company offers this product today. Thanks</li>
            <li> WORKS FINE, THESE ARE HARD TO FIND.  ITS BETTER QUALITY THAN SALLY HANSEN PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> IT  IS  GREAT BUT  I NEED TO  ORDER A COUPLE  MORE</li>
            <li> This arrived WAY faster than I was expecting, and it works great under nails to give a clean, French tip look.&lt;br /&gt;For the people who say it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;re doing it right... wash your hand first, or get your nail tips wet, then put the nail pencil under your nail. Clean up where it shows on your skin, and go. Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found this here after they stopped carrying these in the store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like giving negative reviews.  So although I was disappointed the first time I tried it, I decided, to be fair, to try it a few times before writing my review  I was so excited about this item.  However, after trying a few times, I was very disappointed.  I&#x27;ve tried wetting the tip as another person suggested, and really, there was no difference in the appearance of the tip of my nail, except for the goopy mes I had to remove from my finger tips. My nails are not stained and I do have a pretty whitish tip already but I expected a really nice white tip with this pencil and it didn&#x27;t deliver at all. To the trash it goes.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and then some. This should last me awhile. I&#x27;ve searched all over for this pencil. Which drugstores actually carry them for the same price if not more and they are your average size. This was quite the bargain for sure.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything it claims to do. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Revlon no longer makes their nail pencil, so I went shopping. Glad I did, as this one is also better.</li>
            <li> useless purchase. dont bother</li>
            <li> I like the smaller point on this, making it easier to use and not get all over fingertips.  Coating with a little clear nail polish will make it last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> First of all the item pictured is the older version with a &#x27;see thru&#x27; cap.  They worked well and sharpened to a nice point.  The item sent is a newer version with a milk white cap.  These are awful!  They don&#x27;t sharpen and the lead is too soft so it continually breaks as you sharpen them.  Am returning the second order as well.</li>
