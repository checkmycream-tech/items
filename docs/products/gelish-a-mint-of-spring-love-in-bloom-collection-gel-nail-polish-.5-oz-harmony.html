            <li>I bought this thinking this would be a nice minty color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did not buy it there.</li>
            <li>And they have a better range of colors than CND.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>/&gt;It matches most of my clothes</li>
            <li>my FAVORITE color.  </li>
            <li>perfect minty green.  </li>
            <li>After curing it under the UV light, it rippled unlike anything I&#x27;d ever seen.</li>
            <li>If you like unique colors, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty colour, lovely to go into summer.  </li>
            <li>Make sure that you really like the color that you order because there are no returns on nail color.</li>
            <li>A little watery , it is not so easy to apply but looks great.</li>
            <li>but still very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Picture shows exact color!</li>
            <li>honestly it&#x27;s so close to mint and at the same time</li>
            <li>(i am so inlove with that right now)</li>
            <li>This one is much bigger bottle at a better price.</li>
            <li>but regardless it&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty</li>
            <li>The quality is consistent with CND Shellac.  </li>
            <li>I always Google the colors first.</li>
            <li>After doing my research I knew this color would be exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>great confidence booster - get at least 1 compliment every time i wear it.</li>
            <li>its rich and cool tones at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The is a beautiful color, a cross between green &amp; turq.  </li>
            <li>Some GREAT advice I think is when you are looking at some colors, type the name of the nail polish into Google Images and see the different pictures that people posted with the actual nail polish on their nails since that can often come out looking a bit different.</li>
            <li>It went on &#x27;goopey&#x27; when I applied it, no matter how much I tried to spread it out.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the color.</li>
            <li>this is more like a green.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because it&#x27;s a bit darker than the light green</li>
            <li>The color of this polish was so pretty, but other than that it was a nightmare.</li>
            <li>Color was exactly what I had expected it to be!</li>
            <li>and apparently you cannot do that because it is considered a cosmetic.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s expired or something but really unfortunate since the color is a really great Kelly green.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mint green but unlike the other colors I have (about 15) you have to paint and let sit BEFORE putting under the light</li>

            <li> I warned my nail lady of the other reviews and that it would probably take many thin coats.</li>

            <li> since I didn&#x27;t have anything green, but would need to find another one for mint.</li>
            <li> It is almost identical to Seafoam green.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the formula for this color</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not - so hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this polish, from different stores as well and both times the polish has shrunk and gone on terribly.</li>
            <li> but the color IS NOT bright like shown.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find any other gel colors like it :(</li>
            <li> Something&#x27;s definitely wrong with this line.</li>

            <li> I had seen this color at Sally&#x27;s but a much smaller size and I&#x27;m glad I did not buy it there. This one is much bigger bottle at a better price. Love love!!! the color it is slightly darker than the color you see online but still very pretty. I would highly recommend the color.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because it&#x27;s a bit darker than the light green I thought it would be. It was a bit darker than it shows! I feel like maybe they got the colors mixed up?</li>
            <li> honestly it&#x27;s so close to mint and at the same time it&#x27;s not - so hard to describe.  but regardless it&#x27;s a pretty color - wish it was a legit mint color (i am so inlove with that right now) but it&#x27;s still pretty</li>
            <li> Make sure that you really like the color that you order because there are no returns on nail color. I wanted to exchange it for a deeper green color and apparently you cannot do that because it is considered a cosmetic.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this polish, from different stores as well and both times the polish has shrunk and gone on terribly. Not sure if it&#x27;s the formula for this color or it&#x27;s expired or something but really unfortunate since the color is a really great Kelly green. Can&#x27;t seem to find any other gel colors like it :(</li>
            <li> The color of this polish was so pretty, but other than that it was a nightmare. I warned my nail lady of the other reviews and that it would probably take many thin coats. Every coat she put on shrunk on my nail. It ended up very bumpy and uneven.  Pass this one up.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking this would be a nice minty color.&lt;br /&gt;But this is more like a green. I still like it- since I didn&#x27;t have anything green, but would need to find another one for mint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mint green but unlike the other colors I have (about 15) you have to paint and let sit BEFORE putting under the light otherwise you get this ripple effect.</li>
            <li> The is a beautiful color, a cross between green &amp; turq.  Gelish is a great gel nail polish.  The quality is consistent with CND Shellac.  And they have a better range of colors than CND.  If you like unique colors, this is worth a try!</li>
            <li> Such a hearty mint, like ice cream. I love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Love this color</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. Works well with sephoras opi led  kit, top and base coat as well. I would buy more colors from this brand!</li>
            <li> Goes on great. Great color. I always Google the colors first.</li>
            <li> Color was exactly what I had expected it to be! The only thing is that I did a bit of research before actually buying the several Gelish nail polishes that I ordered. Sometimes the picture from the bottle does not do the color any justice. Some GREAT advice I think is when you are looking at some colors, type the name of the nail polish into Google Images and see the different pictures that people posted with the actual nail polish on their nails since that can often come out looking a bit different. After doing my research I knew this color would be exactly what I wanted and it was. Gelish brand does not disappoint and it pays for itself after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> color great, and quality like always, gelish is a good gel polish brand</li>
            <li> This is a pretty colour, lovely to go into summer.  It is similar to Seafoam but a little darker and brighter</li>
            <li> I love this color!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;It matches most of my clothes and I receive lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> my FAVORITE color.  perfect minty green.  its rich and cool tones at the same time.  wear this color all the time during spring and summer - matches a wardrobe of brights, jewel tones and blacks/browns. great confidence booster - get at least 1 compliment every time i wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my nails at home with Gelish products for over two years now, and I&#x27;ve never had a polish act like this one did. It went on &#x27;goopey&#x27; when I applied it, no matter how much I tried to spread it out. After curing it under the UV light, it rippled unlike anything I&#x27;d ever seen. I had to remove it from every single nail. Something&#x27;s definitely wrong with this line.</li>
            <li> The color goes on well but the color IS NOT bright like shown. It is almost identical to Seafoam green.  If looking for a bright teal or aqua I would not go with this color.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t the same as the picture</li>
            <li> A little watery , it is not so easy to apply but looks great. Picture shows exact color! Great for spring.</li>
