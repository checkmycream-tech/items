            <li>My friend from Pakistan has some henna that looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>PLEASE CONTACT SELLER BEFORE BUYING to make sure you are buying from a good dealer, they dont reply to emails</li>
            <li>The directions addressed this: they start out orange and fade to a nice brown color within 48 hours.</li>
            <li>This particular brand and kit are the best henna I have ever used</li>
            <li>They lasted quite awhile, and were very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I could have Tattoo with very easy way.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first impression was that the package itself smelled so good!</li>
            <li>Works good and stays on for like a couple weeks... but a bit runny so it doesn&#x27;t stay in fine lines..</li>
            <li>We enjoyed creating our own designs and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>And very easy to use for free hand art as well!</li>
            <li>My daughter has been doing the neighbor kids since age 13 and they still come to the door all summer wanting more.</li>
            <li>Just wish there were more stencils.</li>
            <li>Love the henna tattoo kit.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>We have purchased several henna kits and this one was the best.  </li>
            <li>Everything its ok, just if you haven&#x27;t notice its the henna</li>
            <li>We had leftovers and were able to do 15 tatoos.</li>
            <li>I still love this stuff though.</li>
            <li>need more henna</li>
            <li>This Henna kit is reasonably priced and will be a great starter kit for anyone.  </li>
            <li>The Henna Tattoo Kit was okay.</li>
            <li>Love the application kit.</li>
            <li>I have used Henna many times and never have had issues.</li>
            <li>if it works we will order more...</li>
            <li>but I chalk this up more to inexperience than product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend just buying the henna alone and looking for a more interesting stencil collection.  </li>
            <li>The great thing about this kit is that you do not have to be able to draw a straight line to draw the designs, the transfers make everything really easy.</li>
            <li>But as far as ease of use and good quality ingredients, I am VERY pleased and will order this kit again.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Very easy to use for someone using for the first time!!</li>
            <li>The stencils are very cool and this product comes with everything it says it does.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not black, however still looks great</li>
            <li>Easy to mix and use.  </li>
            <li>The directions were easy to follow, the applicater worked well and it stayed on for 2 weeks (On my foot).</li>
            <li>The kit comes with 0.18oz of eucalyptus oil, 0.5oz of earth henna solution, 0.3oz of henna paste and Q-tips and tooth picks for mixing and easy touch up work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never done henna before, but this kit was extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>These designs have something for everyone, but you can always make your own design with the henna, which is pretty easy to do with the metal applicator.  </li>
            <li>Nice all in one kit for someone like me trying it out of the first time.</li>
            <li>The included stencils worked nicely and were also easy to use, they had a couple cool patterns I had fun with.</li>
            <li>This product worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Very fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This kit comes with wonderful, easy-to-use stencils that include feminine, flowery armbands, tribal symbols, little butterflies and circular symbolic suns.</li>
            <li>This henna kit is really great, it gives you very specific instructions</li>
            <li>It had great instructions, easy to use, and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>Quick decal templates, and a easy to use storage bag.</li>
            <li>Definately worth it!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with henna, and I am really enjoying</li>
            <li>and it was delivered right on time!</li>
            <li>It comes with enough to do about 10 elaborate designs and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It smells so sweet</li>
            <li>Overall good product though.</li>
            <li>It is not a bad starter kit, but it is WAY over priced.</li>
            <li>Application and instructions were pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was great</li>
            <li>I followed the directions carefully and was able to get a nice stain on my hand where it was applied.</li>
            <li>Brought back my love of creating art :)</li>
            <li>I ordered this to try out henna as I&#x27;ve always found it interesting and this a cheap alternative to a professionally done one.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>The only portion of it worth mentioning in a good way is the metal applicator.</li>
            <li>Other than that i enjoyed it a lot!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough but my henna tattoos came out more orange than the beautiful brown that shows up from the ones I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>I had tried other Henna \\&quot;Kits\\&quot;, but this one was by far the best!</li>
            <li>It looks light at first, but darkens.</li>
            <li>It comes with PLENTY of henna, I did 3 full backs, 3 full arms, 6 hands and still had some left over which keeps nicely in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>so cool and fun.</li>
            <li>The instructions are simple and clear, everything worked as described, and I got clean, even lines for my designs that stayed on and darkened to a good color very quickly.</li>
            <li>It has much more depth than that, plus you&#x27;ll be dissapointed if you&#x27;re a fan of the bright, trashy biker tattoos you see at bars - because the ink here is a traditional brownish red.</li>
            <li>over all this was worth the money.</li>
            <li>I had so much fun.</li>
            <li>We have found the right maker.</li>
            <li>I just ordered this kit a few days ago and it is a great kit for a first time henna artists.</li>
            <li>you can easily cover up, because when it starts getting lighter it can look from far away like you have some sort of rare skin disease or something.  </li>
            <li>The product can be a hassle (and the oil has a very pungent smell, not necessarily a bad smell, however).</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear &amp; easy to follow, all you have to do is mix the stuff</li>
            <li>The directions were clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>The directions were clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit recently and was surprised at the good quality of the materials.</li>
            <li>It is very easy, sort of a long process and a bit over priced.</li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s mixed well before putting in your applicator</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used Henneh and been sucsessful</li>
            <li>I was so pretty for the week that I had it.</li>
            <li>This was my first henna kit, and not was it affordable</li>
            <li>Only issue was the applialcator bottle and top were messed up and it kept clogging up when I was trying to apply it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The instructions were clear and detailed.</li>
            <li>I only wish I had better planned and read the directions first as it has to sit an hour after mixing before use.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if they sold smaller packages in a bundle I would like it more.</li>
            <li>There were only a couple I found appealing.  </li>
            <li>I even left it in the fridge for hours and hours hoping it would solidify more but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>doesnt stay very long.&lt;br /&gt;used to be perfect easy kit to mix, but past 3 orders of Earth Henna has had less powder.&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li>On hands in washes away more quickly, but still lasted a lot longer than other ones.</li>
            <li>It comes with a few really good designs that transfer really well on to your skin.</li>
            <li>ours are lighter but still very visible 2 weeks later :).</li>
            <li>Earth Henna also has their own website to order other kits and supplies if you really like this type of kit.</li>
            <li>But, other than that very easy to make just add the Earth and Eucalyptus oil to the bag and mix it a bit then let sit.</li>
            <li>But when it arrived last Christmas I used it for months and was real henna that lasted forever and was a great art hobby to do in my down time on both myself and gf</li>
            <li>A little smaller than i hoped it would be but over all it is a great product.</li>
            <li>but really 15$ is overpriced?</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, but I lost too much that way.</li>
            <li>Acutally I was really hesitant on this kit.</li>
            <li>Got these for my son who is dying for a real tatto</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the stain I achieved using the kit only turned a washed-out medium brown, not the rich brown</li>
            <li>[if you have a steady hand haha].</li>
            <li>I usually practice with cones but really liked the bottle type applicator that comes in this kit as well.  </li>
            <li>love this product but it seems like there is less henna powder in bag, so mixture is off.  </li>
            <li>Mine did just this.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped to me earlier than expected, so that was a nice surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The henna kit was mailed quickly and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>highly recommended starter kit f</li>
            <li>My product was ordered Feb. 2nd and due to no fault of their own my item got lost in the mail.</li>
            <li>Make sure to leave it on as long as possible.</li>
            <li>it, other things are fine.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that the LONGER you let the Henna design dry on your skin, the DARKER it will turn out, and that removing it too early will result in a light orangeish color.</li>
            <li>The henna itself has to be mixed, but everything is very simple and easy to do.</li>
            <li>and they wont be me a new one..</li>
            <li>Other than that the directions were clear and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this for every one interested in the product and practically can be used by all ages from ten and up</li>
            <li>The color is bland but it turns out fantastic if you know what your doing.</li>
            <li>After several uses 21 full size designs later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other at-home henna tattoo kits, and I&#x27;ve even gotten tattoos done by artists at local craft fairs and such, and I&#x27;ve never had such a good experience as I had with this kit.</li>
            <li>Also, the designs showed up clearly on the skin and lasted the two weeks that the kit promises.</li>
            <li>100% Natural Henna Leaves]]was bought as a gift</li>
            <li>I put mine on a week ago and it has already almost completely faded off.  </li>
            <li>Complete instructions with step by step instrucions.</li>
            <li>The only think I found was that the henna came off much quicker than it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>This kit looks the same when going on, but it turned out much much lighter and faded than the Pakistan stuff.</li>
            <li>My old henna kit was out of date</li>
            <li>I have purchased Henna tattoo paste from an Indian friend who gets it made and shipped to them directly from India.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t mess anything up, and it comes with a handy little squeeze bottle for easier application.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and stays dark and fresh looking (at least 3 weeks).</li>
            <li>I contacted them and they were very fast and cooperative to send me a new one which arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I think the trick with henna is to make sure to keep in on as long as possible before wiping the dried henna off, which I did with oil.</li>
            <li>My only minor complaint is that it really should have been mixed better by me before putting into the bottle applicator.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not very dark</li>
            <li>My only complain is that it&#x27;s very hard to squeeze the henna out of the bag in to the bottle without it getting too backed up and spewing up out the top around the sides.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, and did read previous reviews that there wasn&#x27;t much henna in the kit, but I was surprised to see that there was only 5 gms of henna.  </li>
            <li>The color stays dark and fresh for a long time .</li>
            <li>happy  :(</li>
            <li>At first I thought that it was little, but it lasted me 3 months!</li>

            <li> need more henna</li>
            <li> This Henna kit is reasonably priced and will be a great starter kit for anyone.  </li>
            <li> The Henna Tattoo Kit was okay.</li>
            <li> Love the application kit.</li>
            <li> I have used Henna many times and never have had issues.</li>
            <li> if it works we will order more...</li>
            <li> but I chalk this up more to inexperience than product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend just buying the henna alone and looking for a more interesting stencil collection.  </li>
            <li> The great thing about this kit is that you do not have to be able to draw a straight line to draw the designs, the transfers make everything really easy.</li>
            <li> But as far as ease of use and good quality ingredients, I am VERY pleased and will order this kit again.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Very easy to use for someone using for the first time!!</li>
            <li> The stencils are very cool and this product comes with everything it says it does.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not black, however still looks great</li>
            <li> Easy to mix and use.  </li>
            <li> The directions were easy to follow, the applicater worked well and it stayed on for 2 weeks (On my foot).</li>
            <li> The kit comes with 0.18oz of eucalyptus oil, 0.5oz of earth henna solution, 0.3oz of henna paste and Q-tips and tooth picks for mixing and easy touch up work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done henna before, but this kit was extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> These designs have something for everyone, but you can always make your own design with the henna, which is pretty easy to do with the metal applicator.  </li>
            <li> Nice all in one kit for someone like me trying it out of the first time.</li>
            <li> The included stencils worked nicely and were also easy to use, they had a couple cool patterns I had fun with.</li>
            <li> This product worked fine for me.  </li>
            <li> and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Very fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This kit comes with wonderful, easy-to-use stencils that include feminine, flowery armbands, tribal symbols, little butterflies and circular symbolic suns.</li>
            <li> This henna kit is really great, it gives you very specific instructions</li>
            <li> It had great instructions, easy to use, and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> Quick decal templates, and a easy to use storage bag.</li>
            <li> Definately worth it!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with henna, and I am really enjoying</li>
            <li> and it was delivered right on time!</li>
            <li> It comes with enough to do about 10 elaborate designs and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It smells so sweet</li>
            <li> Overall good product though.</li>
            <li> It is not a bad starter kit, but it is WAY over priced.</li>
            <li> Application and instructions were pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was great</li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully and was able to get a nice stain on my hand where it was applied.</li>
            <li> Brought back my love of creating art :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try out henna as I&#x27;ve always found it interesting and this a cheap alternative to a professionally done one.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> The only portion of it worth mentioning in a good way is the metal applicator.</li>
            <li> Other than that i enjoyed it a lot!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough but my henna tattoos came out more orange than the beautiful brown that shows up from the ones I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I had tried other Henna \\&quot;Kits\\&quot;, but this one was by far the best!</li>
            <li> It looks light at first, but darkens.</li>
            <li> It comes with PLENTY of henna, I did 3 full backs, 3 full arms, 6 hands and still had some left over which keeps nicely in the fridge for up to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> so cool and fun.</li>
            <li> The instructions are simple and clear, everything worked as described, and I got clean, even lines for my designs that stayed on and darkened to a good color very quickly.</li>
            <li> It has much more depth than that, plus you&#x27;ll be dissapointed if you&#x27;re a fan of the bright, trashy biker tattoos you see at bars - because the ink here is a traditional brownish red.</li>
            <li> over all this was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had so much fun.</li>
            <li> We have found the right maker.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this kit a few days ago and it is a great kit for a first time henna artists.</li>
            <li> you can easily cover up, because when it starts getting lighter it can look from far away like you have some sort of rare skin disease or something.  </li>
            <li> The product can be a hassle (and the oil has a very pungent smell, not necessarily a bad smell, however).</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear &amp; easy to follow, all you have to do is mix the stuff</li>
            <li> The directions were clear and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> The directions were clear and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit recently and was surprised at the good quality of the materials.</li>
            <li> It is very easy, sort of a long process and a bit over priced.</li>
            <li> Just make sure it&#x27;s mixed well before putting in your applicator</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Henneh and been sucsessful</li>
            <li> I was so pretty for the week that I had it.</li>
            <li> This was my first henna kit, and not was it affordable</li>
            <li> Only issue was the applialcator bottle and top were messed up and it kept clogging up when I was trying to apply it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The instructions were clear and detailed.</li>
            <li> I only wish I had better planned and read the directions first as it has to sit an hour after mixing before use.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if they sold smaller packages in a bundle I would like it more.</li>
            <li> There were only a couple I found appealing.  </li>
            <li> I even left it in the fridge for hours and hours hoping it would solidify more but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> doesnt stay very long.&lt;br /&gt;used to be perfect easy kit to mix, but past 3 orders of Earth Henna has had less powder.&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> On hands in washes away more quickly, but still lasted a lot longer than other ones.</li>
            <li> It comes with a few really good designs that transfer really well on to your skin.</li>
            <li> ours are lighter but still very visible 2 weeks later :).</li>
            <li> Earth Henna also has their own website to order other kits and supplies if you really like this type of kit.</li>
            <li> But, other than that very easy to make just add the Earth and Eucalyptus oil to the bag and mix it a bit then let sit.</li>
            <li> But when it arrived last Christmas I used it for months and was real henna that lasted forever and was a great art hobby to do in my down time on both myself and gf</li>
            <li> A little smaller than i hoped it would be but over all it is a great product.</li>
            <li> but really 15$ is overpriced?</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, but I lost too much that way.</li>
            <li> Acutally I was really hesitant on this kit.</li>
            <li> Got these for my son who is dying for a real tatto</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the stain I achieved using the kit only turned a washed-out medium brown, not the rich brown</li>
            <li> [if you have a steady hand haha].</li>
            <li> I usually practice with cones but really liked the bottle type applicator that comes in this kit as well.  </li>
            <li> love this product but it seems like there is less henna powder in bag, so mixture is off.  </li>
            <li> Mine did just this.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped to me earlier than expected, so that was a nice surprise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The henna kit was mailed quickly and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> highly recommended starter kit f</li>
            <li> My product was ordered Feb. 2nd and due to no fault of their own my item got lost in the mail.</li>
            <li> Make sure to leave it on as long as possible.</li>
            <li> it, other things are fine.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that the LONGER you let the Henna design dry on your skin, the DARKER it will turn out, and that removing it too early will result in a light orangeish color.</li>
            <li> The henna itself has to be mixed, but everything is very simple and easy to do.</li>
            <li> and they wont be me a new one..</li>
            <li> Other than that the directions were clear and easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this for every one interested in the product and practically can be used by all ages from ten and up</li>
            <li> The color is bland but it turns out fantastic if you know what your doing.</li>
            <li> After several uses 21 full size designs later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other at-home henna tattoo kits, and I&#x27;ve even gotten tattoos done by artists at local craft fairs and such, and I&#x27;ve never had such a good experience as I had with this kit.</li>
            <li> Also, the designs showed up clearly on the skin and lasted the two weeks that the kit promises.</li>
            <li> 100% Natural Henna Leaves]]was bought as a gift</li>
            <li> I put mine on a week ago and it has already almost completely faded off.  </li>
            <li> Complete instructions with step by step instrucions.</li>
            <li> The only think I found was that the henna came off much quicker than it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> This kit looks the same when going on, but it turned out much much lighter and faded than the Pakistan stuff.</li>
            <li> My old henna kit was out of date</li>
            <li> I have purchased Henna tattoo paste from an Indian friend who gets it made and shipped to them directly from India.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t mess anything up, and it comes with a handy little squeeze bottle for easier application.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and stays dark and fresh looking (at least 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> I contacted them and they were very fast and cooperative to send me a new one which arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I think the trick with henna is to make sure to keep in on as long as possible before wiping the dried henna off, which I did with oil.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is that it really should have been mixed better by me before putting into the bottle applicator.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not very dark</li>
            <li> My only complain is that it&#x27;s very hard to squeeze the henna out of the bag in to the bottle without it getting too backed up and spewing up out the top around the sides.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, and did read previous reviews that there wasn&#x27;t much henna in the kit, but I was surprised to see that there was only 5 gms of henna.  </li>
            <li> The color stays dark and fresh for a long time .</li>
            <li> happy  :(</li>
            <li> At first I thought that it was little, but it lasted me 3 months!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the kit includes only enough henna powder for one large design or two medium ones, and instead of mehndi oil, there was a bottle of pre-packaged solution which was intended to be used entirely in the first mix.</li>
            <li> The Coloring became very rich and dark in less than a few hours...easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> Henna stays on for weeks, even when left to dry for only 3-4 hours.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to at least make it to my due date and have it there for my special day.  </li>
            <li> I imagine if I used the henna on a part of the body I&#x27;m not frequently washing, it would last longer.</li>
            <li> I put this on about a week ago and did not leave it on as long as I should (not even close to long enough) and it still shows up.    </li>
            <li> On the other hand, my friend only left his on for about 3 hours and his faded in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this kit to anyone that is wanting to do henna but is not a professional artist.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not really that big of a deal, because I just eyeballed the stencils and free-handed my drawings anyway.</li>
            <li> The length it stays on depends on how long you keep the henna ink on before rubbing the crusty pebbles off.</li>
            <li> I was expected it to already be mixed so that I could use it whenever.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t waited long enough to see how long the designs will last - I will update this in a few weeks to report on durability.</li>
            <li> henna lasted very long, though it did fade eventually.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as with most henna products, the henna dried up before I had the chance to use it all up, despite my efforts to preserve it.</li>
            <li> Im a black american.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that I found that the Henna came out too liquid even though the instructions said to add all the liquid in the tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> It works, but it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Henna ink was thick and too congealed to apply (probably old).</li>
            <li> i thought it would dry up and be black.</li>
            <li> Now I have to find more henna somewhere else :(</li>
            <li> its very messy to put into the bottle which is not that big of a deal</li>
            <li> Worked as expected, though faded from my hand in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, I expected black color, but it is brown.&lt;br /&gt;Except</li>
            <li> At the very least, I expected it would include a small bottle of mehndi oil and enough henna powder for three or four applications if I judiciously used only part of each.</li>
            <li> No way to get a refund - only thick gunk left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this product would last at least 4-6 weeks and after a week and a half it was rubbing off after I showered.</li>
            <li> The averae design has lasted without fading up to 4 WEEKS slightly less if exposed to sunlight</li>
            <li> a little less than half is gone.</li>
            <li> once i get it but not to mess up the star count</li>
            <li> then wait a few hours</li>
            <li> Expect to get a brown color if your skin is pale like mine.</li>
            <li> The application wasn&#x27;t too difficult but you should prepare to have some time on your hands as it takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;there was hardly color on my skin, I threw it away</li>
            <li> Made the solution at least 1 hour before...</li>
            <li> this kit sucks  </li>
            <li> : The instructions say to wait at least 1 hour after mixing before you put the henna paste on your skin - I think I let the mixture sit for 3 hours in the plastic bag before I applied it.</li>
            <li> Most were boring and uninspired.  </li>
            <li> The secret is to follow the directions; after finishing applying, to press it and close it, leaving no air inside, and to put it in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this before</li>
            <li> ill 5 star it</li>
            <li> ill go 4 here</li>
            <li> and they said it was cause we read the wrong...</li>
            <li> The kit is very expensive for what it has to offer.</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> I am just disappointed in the time that it stayed on my skin.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was terribly disappointed with this kit.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works good and stays on for like a couple weeks... but a bit runny so it doesn&#x27;t stay in fine lines.. And it&#x27;s not very dark</li>
            <li> This particular brand and kit are the best henna I have ever used/seen.  It is easy to use and stays dark and fresh looking (at least 3 weeks). Longer than some that I have had done at festivals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The is also a wonderful starter kit for anyone.  My daughter has been doing the neighbor kids since age 13 and they still come to the door all summer wanting more.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to try out Henna tatooing. They lasted quite awhile, and were very easy to use. Just wish there were more stencils.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I thought and the directions are on the back of the packaging. It is not a bad starter kit, but it is WAY over priced.</li>
            <li> This henna kit is really great, it gives you very specific instructions so you don&#x27;t mess anything up, and it comes with a handy little squeeze bottle for easier application. It comes with PLENTY of henna, I did 3 full backs, 3 full arms, 6 hands and still had some left over which keeps nicely in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> My product was ordered Feb. 2nd and due to no fault of their own my item got lost in the mail. I contacted them and they were very fast and cooperative to send me a new one which arrived in just a few days. I am VERY impressed with the services they have provided for me to set things right. I will be purchasing from them again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product worked fine for me.  I followed the directions carefully and was able to get a nice stain on my hand where it was applied. My only minor complaint is that it really should have been mixed better by me before putting into the bottle applicator. Some of the henna was a bit looser than the rest and your henna will gradually spread a bit while laying on the skin before drying.  Just make sure it&#x27;s mixed well before putting in your applicator and you should be fine. Other than that the directions were clear and easy to follow.  I usually practice with cones but really liked the bottle type applicator that comes in this kit as well.  Earth Henna also has their own website to order other kits and supplies if you really like this type of kit. Good Luck!~</li>
            <li> Love the henna tattoo kit. Very fun and easy to use. Brought back my love of creating art :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Henneh and been sucsessful and I loved loved loved it... the product worked great. I only had to mix one bottle into another and that was that. i was provided with plenty of supplies too..</li>
            <li> It [[ASIN:B000ZPLZTU Henna Tattoo Kit + Over 70 Designs! 100% Natural Henna Leaves]]was bought as a gift and I have not heard back from the recipient</li>
            <li> 1st off. the product is orange. i thought it would dry up and be black. it looks like an orange sharpie on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;2nd. its very messy to put into the bottle which is not that big of a deal but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;3rd. the price for it is kinda overpriced</li>
            <li> I thought this product would last at least 4-6 weeks and after a week and a half it was rubbing off after I showered. I left it on for 6+ hours to cure and rubbed my belly with the lemon and water as it asked me to. Made the solution at least 1 hour before... I was so pretty for the week that I had it. I am just disappointed in the time that it stayed on my skin. I was hoping to at least make it to my due date and have it there for my special day.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who is using this on your belly for a Mother Blessing Ceremony.</li>
            <li> Easy to mix and use.  Henna stays on for weeks, even when left to dry for only 3-4 hours.  A great introduction to henna art.</li>
            <li> Simple instructions to follow.  Worked as expected, though faded from my hand in less than a week.  I imagine if I used the henna on a part of the body I&#x27;m not frequently washing, it would last longer.</li>
            <li> It is very easy, sort of a long process and a bit over priced. But, other than that very easy to make just add the Earth and Eucalyptus oil to the bag and mix it a bit then let sit. I like the color is good and lasts a pretty fair amount of time !</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try out henna as I&#x27;ve always found it interesting and this a cheap alternative to a professionally done one. The product can be a hassle (and the oil has a very pungent smell, not necessarily a bad smell, however). The application wasn&#x27;t too difficult but you should prepare to have some time on your hands as it takes a while to dry. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough but my henna tattoos came out more orange than the beautiful brown that shows up from the ones I&#x27;ve seen. Overall it was a \\&quot;once in a lifetime\\&quot; experience for me.</li>
            <li> I love it. It smells so sweet and it was delivered right on time! I love the color it turned out to be, and the applicator bottle works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> It was awesome! This was my first henna kit, and not was it affordable it had everything included and very good instructions... now if only it came in multi colors ...</li>
            <li> I recently received this kit as a gift and let me tell you- it&#x27;s great! The instructions are clear &amp; easy to follow, all you have to do is mix the stuff then wait a few hours (I let it sit for 6 hours) and then you&#x27;re all set to draw! Plus, if you&#x27;re not the greatest artist in the world, this kit comes with cool designs that you can trace onto yourself. Keep in mind that the LONGER you let the Henna design dry on your skin, the DARKER it will turn out, and that removing it too early will result in a light orangeish color. This is the perfect first-time Henna kit.</li>
            <li> this was a good purchace.  the stencils were a not what i expepcted but i didnt plan to use them.  over all this was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this kit a few days ago and it is a great kit for a first time henna artists. It comes with a few really good designs that transfer really well on to your skin. The henna itself has to be mixed, but everything is very simple and easy to do. The great thing about this kit is that you do not have to be able to draw a straight line to draw the designs, the transfers make everything really easy. I would recommend this kit to anyone that is wanting to do henna but is not a professional artist.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased it yet but really 15$ is overpriced? mine is in the mail.! ill 5 star it once i get it but not to mess up the star count ill go 4 here but i think it well worth it :D</li>
            <li> I put mine on a week ago and it has already almost completely faded off.  And yes, I left it on for over 6 hours.</li>
            <li> We have purchased several henna kits and this one was the best.  It had great instructions, easy to use, and lasted a long time.  I will be purchasing this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> Everything its ok, just if you haven&#x27;t notice its the henna it&#x27;s not black, however still looks great</li>
            <li> Product worked as described. Quality was very good. We enjoyed creating our own designs and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this on December, 2010. At first I thought that it was little, but it lasted me 3 months! As soon as the tatoo faded away, I did another one. The secret is to follow the directions; after finishing applying, to press it and close it, leaving no air inside, and to put it in the refrigerator. This henna kit is awesome, it&#x27;s worth every cent that you spend on it.</li>
            <li> Im a black american. I was worried it wouldnt show up it did and lasts for about two weeks. Ive had the ink for three weeks now had three designs and have plenty left. When its kept in the fridge it lasts way longer! The only thing i didnt like was there wasnt enough designs that came with it. Other than that i enjoyed it a lot!!</li>
            <li> I had tried other Henna \\&quot;Kits\\&quot;, but this one was by far the best! The directions were easy to follow, the applicater worked well and it stayed on for 2 weeks (On my foot). On hands in washes away more quickly, but still lasted a lot longer than other ones.I think the trick with henna is to make sure to keep in on as long as possible before wiping the dried henna off, which I did with oil. It looks light at first, but darkens. Definately worth it!</li>
            <li> Nice all in one kit for someone like me trying it out of the first time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product,my daugthers really enjoying the tattoo&#x27;s,plus they are not permanant.Thank you.</li>
            <li> Way easier to use than the larger Earth Henna kit. Applicator is easier to use than the larger kit. thank you 5 stars</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful kit that comes with everythin you&#x27;ll need. The kit comes with 0.18oz of eucalyptus oil, 0.5oz of earth henna solution, 0.3oz of henna paste and Q-tips and tooth picks for mixing and easy touch up work. Complete instructions with step by step instrucions. Quick decal templates, and a easy to use storage bag. Thats everything you will need. PLEASE CONTACT SELLER BEFORE BUYING to make sure you are buying from a good dealer, they dont reply to emails walk on to another seller. After several uses 21 full size designs later. We have found the right maker. The averae design has lasted without fading up to 4 WEEKS slightly less if exposed to sunlight</li>
            <li> The henna kit was mailed quickly and exactly what I expected. I have yet to use it, but I don&#x27;t foresee any problems</li>
            <li> My first impression was that the package itself smelled so good! I assume because of the Eucalyptus? The directions were clear and easy to understand. I put this on about a week ago and did not leave it on as long as I should (not even close to long enough) and it still shows up.    My only complain is that it&#x27;s very hard to squeeze the henna out of the bag in to the bottle without it getting too backed up and spewing up out the top around the sides. I followed the directions, but I lost too much that way. It&#x27;s possible that I made the hole too big in the bottom of the bag, though, causing this?</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for someone who is just beginning with Henna. It comes with enough to do about 10 elaborate designs and is very easy to use. It has everything you need packed in to it. The only think I found was that the henna came off much quicker than it was supposed to. I did everything I was supposed to in preparation and left it on for probably about 4 hrs.. and it still didn&#x27;t last any longer than about a week. The one thing i didn&#x27;t do was wipe my skin with the lemon-water solution. That may have some effect on it. Overall good product though.</li>
            <li> This kit its self was wonderful. The color stays dark and fresh for a long time . Only issue was the applialcator bottle and top were messed up and it kept clogging up when I was trying to apply it. Other than that it was great</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with henna, and I am really enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were clear and detailed. Even the tips and do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was the listing said it came with 15 stencils, and it had 5 but that&#x27;s not really that big of a deal, because I just eyeballed the stencils and free-handed my drawings anyway.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. Very easy to use for someone using for the first time!! Stencils transfer great! And very easy to use for free hand art as well!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, and did read previous reviews that there wasn&#x27;t much henna in the kit, but I was surprised to see that there was only 5 gms of henna.  It seems suspicious to me that they don&#x27;t list the amount in the product description.  It says it&#x27;s enough for 10-15 designs, but I think that&#x27;s stretching it a bit.  I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough to do two hands front and back.  Now I have to find more henna somewhere else :(</li>
            <li> They suggest you practice by filling the plastic bottle with toothpaste.  Bad idea. It takes forever to get the toothpaste washed out again. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs of this for my daughters 10th birthday party.  We had leftovers and were able to do 15 tatoos. I only wish I had better planned and read the directions first as it has to sit an hour after mixing before use.  Her birthday party was June 15th and it&#x27;s June 27th ours are lighter but still very visible 2 weeks later :). Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The directions were clear and easy to follow. The included stencils worked nicely and were also easy to use, they had a couple cool patterns I had fun with. Came with a nice amount of henna, and I used it all up within a week! Others said they had problems with their tattoos coming out bright orange. The directions addressed this: they start out orange and fade to a nice brown color within 48 hours. Mine did just this.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped to me earlier than expected, so that was a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with the purchase and the experience with the seller. For free shipping, it was a great buy. I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> My friend from Pakistan has some henna that looks amazing. This kit looks the same when going on, but it turned out much much lighter and faded than the Pakistan stuff. Make sure to leave it on as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Expect to get a brown color if your skin is pale like mine. I used this to make a spiral tatoo on my hand, and it lasted for about 2 weeks. Unfortunately, as with most henna products, the henna dried up before I had the chance to use it all up, despite my efforts to preserve it. Maybe if they sold smaller packages in a bundle I would like it more. I still love this stuff though.</li>
            <li> I used this of course as a temporary tattoo. The tattoo stayed visible for about 5 days. The length it stays on depends on how long you keep the henna ink on before rubbing the crusty pebbles off. I had the tattoo on my chest and slept on my back with my shirt of for a night. On the other hand, my friend only left his on for about 3 hours and his faded in about 3 days. Anyways, this product came with all the things I needed for the tattoo. The shipping was quick. Application and instructions were pretty easy. I would buy this product again if I needed too.</li>
            <li> so cool and fun. need more henna but i got alot out of this one. highly recommended starter kit f</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like this product, the concept is good but it did not work&lt;br /&gt;there was hardly color on my skin, I threw it away</li>
            <li> love this product but it seems like there is less henna powder in bag, so mixture is off.  runny and stain doesnt stay very long.&lt;br /&gt;used to be perfect easy kit to mix, but past 3 orders of Earth Henna has had less powder.&lt;br /&gt;not happy  :(</li>
            <li> This Henna kit is reasonably priced and will be a great starter kit for anyone.  My step daughter loves it</li>
            <li> This product is terrific. I bought it for me ant my friends and it works fantastic!! The color is bland but it turns out fantastic if you know what your doing. The stencils are very cool and this product comes with everything it says it does. I recommend this for every one interested in the product and practically can be used by all ages from ten and up [if you have a steady hand haha]. GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> The Henna Tattoo Kit was okay. It works, but it was not what I expected. Once you put the mixture together, it only lasts for two weeks. I was expected it to already be mixed so that I could use it whenever. I guess that&#x27;s my fault for not doing my research.</li>
            <li> This is bar none the best henna kit I have ever used.  It works so well my wife begs me for tattoos and my sister was so impressed she bought her own.</li>
            <li> Acutally I was really hesitant on this kit. But when it arrived last Christmas I used it for months and was real henna that lasted forever and was a great art hobby to do in my down time on both myself and gf</li>
            <li> this kit sucks  we opened it up and went all over the floor when we were mixing it in the bag and they said it was cause we read the wrong... no we didnt we did what we were asposte to do!!!  and they wont be me a new one.. they suck and only lasted a week on the skin!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. I could have Tattoo with very easy way.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I expected black color, but it is brown.&lt;br /&gt;Except it, other things are fine.</li>
            <li> Got these for my son who is dying for a real tatto but I won&#x27;t let him get one quite yet. We have had a great time with this kit. Will order again!</li>
            <li> This kit comes with wonderful, easy-to-use stencils that include feminine, flowery armbands, tribal symbols, little butterflies and circular symbolic suns. These designs have something for everyone, but you can always make your own design with the henna, which is pretty easy to do with the metal applicator.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My henna lasted very long, though it did fade eventually. My reccomendation would be to put your henna somewhere you can easily cover up, because when it starts getting lighter it can look from far away like you have some sort of rare skin disease or something.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Make sure you do research about what henna is, because if you think this is just a temporary tattoo kit, you&#x27;re wrong. It has much more depth than that, plus you&#x27;ll be dissapointed if you&#x27;re a fan of the bright, trashy biker tattoos you see at bars - because the ink here is a traditional brownish red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done henna before, but this kit was extremely easy to use. I had so much fun. I had one of my designs last for a month before it finally faded away. I&#x27;d do it again.</li>
            <li> My old henna kit was out of date and I&#x27;d used up the plastic \\&quot;cake-decorating\\&quot; applicators, so I thought I&#x27;d kill two birds with one stone by purchasing this kit. At the very least, I expected it would include a small bottle of mehndi oil and enough henna powder for three or four applications if I judiciously used only part of each. Unfortunately, the kit includes only enough henna powder for one large design or two medium ones, and instead of mehndi oil, there was a bottle of pre-packaged solution which was intended to be used entirely in the first mix. The bottle the solution comes in becomes the applicator and must be used to hold the henna paste since the applicator tip only fits that bottle. Furthermore, the stain I achieved using the kit only turned a washed-out medium brown, not the rich brown I&#x27;ve created using the traditional formula of powder and mehndi oil. For the price, I was terribly disappointed with this kit. The only portion of it worth mentioning in a good way is the metal applicator.</li>
            <li> The Coloring became very rich and dark in less than a few hours...easy to follow instructions. Love the application kit.</li>
            <li> I have used Henna many times and never have had issues. I always follow the directions perfectly. This time I found the tip of the bottle does not work. It kept getting clogged and when I would squeeze it to try and unclog it, it would come flooding out. I thought it was maybe from the henna clumping, but come to find out after cleaning it all out it was actually the bottle tip. It was dented on the inside of the tip (and NOT from me). I have never experienced this before so I am thinking I just got the 1 out of 100 that had a flaw. I still recommend it though!</li>
            <li> This is the best henna tattoo kit I have ever used. I absolutely love it, a little goes a long way. I have successfully done 5 tattoos and a little less than half is gone. I recommend this product. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other at-home henna tattoo kits, and I&#x27;ve even gotten tattoos done by artists at local craft fairs and such, and I&#x27;ve never had such a good experience as I had with this kit. The instructions are simple and clear, everything worked as described, and I got clean, even lines for my designs that stayed on and darkened to a good color very quickly. I haven&#x27;t waited long enough to see how long the designs will last - I will update this in a few weeks to report on durability. But as far as ease of use and good quality ingredients, I am VERY pleased and will order this kit again.&lt;br /&gt;Note: The instructions say to wait at least 1 hour after mixing before you put the henna paste on your skin - I think I let the mixture sit for 3 hours in the plastic bag before I applied it. Don&#x27;t know if that helped but I know it worked well!</li>
            <li> Bought this kit and had it express-shjipped so we could use it while we were still on vacation. Followed the instructions to the letter. Henna ink was thick and too congealed to apply (probably old). Nobody should have to pay for junk like this. No way to get a refund - only thick gunk left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STRONGLY RECOMMEND that nobody buy this kit!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas- she hasn&#x27;t tried it yet...it looks good, though...if it works we will order more...</li>
            <li> The henna mix in this kit was terrific.  It did tend to get clogged in the applicator and I would get blobs on my skin from time to time, but I chalk this up more to inexperience than product.  It was the stencils I was so disappointed in.  There were only a couple I found appealing.  Most were boring and uninspired.  I&#x27;d recommend just buying the henna alone and looking for a more interesting stencil collection.  I also agree with \\&quot;Okay\\&quot;s review.  The kit is very expensive for what it has to offer.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than i hoped it would be but over all it is a great product. kinda recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Henna tattoo paste from an Indian friend who gets it made and shipped to them directly from India. I purchased this kit recently and was surprised at the good quality of the materials. The consistency of the paste is very similar to that of my friend&#x27;s paste. Also, the designs showed up clearly on the skin and lasted the two weeks that the kit promises. Good quality product.</li>
            <li> The kit is excellent for beginners like me. The only complaint is that I found that the Henna came out too liquid even though the instructions said to add all the liquid in the tiny bottle. I even left it in the fridge for hours and hours hoping it would solidify more but it didn&#x27;t. A word of advice is to not use the entire liquid in the bottle, leave about an 1/8th in it.</li>
