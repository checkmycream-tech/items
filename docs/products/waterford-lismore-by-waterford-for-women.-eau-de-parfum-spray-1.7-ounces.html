            <li>I had a whiff of it a few years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it, so when I saw it on Amazon</li>
            <li>so you know you are getting a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>I knew it was not Lismore perfume although the pkg was exactly the same...</li>

            <li>This fragrance is soft and feminine, with a powdery drydown.  </li>

            <li> It confused me because I think some of the reviews are about another bottle of this same perfume that comes with a ring to let you use it as a vase when you&#x27;re out of perfume.  anyway, this didn&#x27;t have it, so make sure you know that.  the perfume smells nice enough.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The fragrance is light and beautiful. I would buy it evem if it wasn&#x27;t in Waterford crystal. The Waterford crystal vase is a lovely bonus. I got this for less than half price on Amazon. I was so pleased I reordered three more for gifts. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The bottle is wonderful.  Very sophisticated and classy.  What&#x27;s inside is made for a queen and since I am one I figured I made the right purchase.  Hah!!  This perfume smells so good you want to take a bath in it.  Its very fresh smelling and is definitely different from the rest.  Take a chance.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Long ago when FTD had a Valentine&#x27;s bouquet they gave a small bottle of perfume with the flowers.  This perfume was wonderful.  I managed to get an additional bottle because I loved it so much. After I finished it, I could not find any more.  So, 30 years later I tried Lismore and wow!  This is so similar to the FTD one I flipped.  The fragrance is heavenly and long lasting.  I sincerely hope that this one doesn&#x27;t disappear.  This fresh, flowery scent is one to definitely buy.  After trying many, many perfumes I have found the one!  Thanks Waterford!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of turning the perfume bottle into a tiny vase when I use up the perfume.  This item comes with a metal ring to put on top for the conversion.  The scent is a more old fashioned than I prefer.</li>
            <li> I love that the bottle becomes a mini vase after the fact, however, the fragrance is too strong for me. A little goes a VERY long way.  If you need a perfume that is going to last from sun up to sun down, this would do the trick.  The scent is mostly floral but it reminds me of my aunts&#x27; perfumes back in the day and not the more modern florals that I love.  It is reminiscent of Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Red Door perfume.  I&#x27;ll use it sparingly every now and then until I can justify pouring the rest down the drain to keep the vase, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing Lismore.  My favorite perfumes remain Dior Pure Poison, Chanel No. 5, Sarah Jessica Parker&#x27;s Lovely (it&#x27;s surprisingly lovely and great for everyday wear and very affordable - very fresh floral/soapy clean scent - I always get at least one compliment whenever I wear this one) and Donna Karan Cashmere Mist.</li>
            <li> This cologne/perfume smells nice and very clean. Great for daily wear.</li>
            <li> A very light scent.  And of course it comes in a pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so fresh , so soft, so clean,.  I ordered a bottle in June from eBay, ( looked like a good deal for the larger size.. As soon as I opened it I knew it was not Lismore perfume although the pkg was exactly the same... I contacted the seller and they said they never had any complaints and had sold 50 bottles. The scent was like a mans after shave and I promptly sent back... Obviously the people buying have no idea what the original really smells like , so if it sounds to good to be true it is&lt;br /&gt;. But actually I&lt;br /&gt;Purchased two of the 1.7 oz bottles and it is cheaper then eBay and &amp;#34;oh yeah&amp;#34; it&#x27;s real.. This is a great seller, and very fast delivery... Hope they continue to sell it , I will be ordering again.,,</li>
            <li> Got as gift for someone, didn&#x27;t have any problem getting it and received in a timley manner. are you kidding</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottle and nice soft fragrance plus it&#x27;s Waterford.</li>
            <li> After a second call to Amazon, the broken Waterford Lismore Eau de Perfume was replaced.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is beautiful.  I had a whiff of it a few years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it, so when I saw it on Amazon I bought it right away.  The fragrance is light, summery but very classic.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and bought it for a GREAT price. I will go to AMAZON.com before I buy perfume @ a Department store</li>
            <li> This fragrance is soft and feminine, with a powdery drydown.  It is a light floral scent and on me it doesn&#x27;t last too long, but I don&#x27;t mind because I prefer something that is not heavy or overwhelming.  I would describe this as a gentle, ladylike fragrance, suitable for any age, and not one that is overly strong or overpowering like some are.  Although the box it comes in is not wrapped in cellophane, it is factory sealed at both ends so you know you are getting a new bottle.  There is an insert inside which describes the fragrance and also mentions that when the perfume is gone you can use the bottle as a bud vase.  This bottle is so beautiful and classic.  Even the top has a pretty crystalline design on it.  When I look at it, I visualize it sitting on a crocheted doily on a vanity or dresser, with pearls beside it.  I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged and lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Will be returning product. Fragrance is not the same as original purchased from Waterford. Was not advertised as an imitation to the original. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy frangrances over the internet.Thought i would take a chance with this one since it was Waterford and I love their crystal and I&#x27;m glad I did. It smells very nice and I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> What a delightful surprise to find I love the smell of the perfume as much as the lovely container.</li>
            <li> The box was not sealed in plastic and so the box has many smudges. Hard to give as a new present.</li>
