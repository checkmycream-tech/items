            <li> Goes on like a creamy, thick foundation but soon dries to a soft powdery finish.</li>
            <li> If I try to use something different I usually end up with breakouts and patches of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I get MAYBE ONE zit per year which is usually stress related!</li>
            <li> I love it, my complection is difficult, I am very pale with rosy cheeks, its hard to find a foundation to even me out</li>
            <li> I like to keep a few colors on hand - darker for the summer months, in-between for spring/fall and lighter for winter.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I did NOT give this 5 stars is because $5 for shipping is RIDICULOUS!!!!</li>

            <li> Mary kay products are great.  My skin feels and stays smooth and clear.  If I try to use something different I usually end up with breakouts and patches of dry skin.  The product from this seller arrived within just a few days, much quicker than I expected and it was in perfect condition  and it was exactly what I ordered!  I will order from htis seller again.</li>
            <li> Return customer of this great product.</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay crème to powder for over 20 years. I just love it. I would recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> This product and color are what I always use.</li>
            <li> just a little darker  but great</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay cosmetics for over 20 years now. I was a consultant for quite a while. I LOVE IT. It does not clog your pours. I have slept in it, worked in it. I get MAYBE ONE zit per year which is usually stress related! The ONLY reason I did NOT give this 5 stars is because $5 for shipping is RIDICULOUS!!!!</li>
            <li> Provides a matte coverage. Long lasting.  I apply with a Shiseido Perfect Foundation Brush for even coverage. Purchased in Beige 1. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Lighter than Beige 2 should be…it actually did say Beige 1 on it.</li>
            <li> it is to cheep of a product to work this great! it cover perfectly, and was shipped very fast! I would highly recommend trying this product</li>
            <li> As expected...it&#x27;s really the only make up that works for me</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product works very well for me and cost less than other brands :) ..</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MK&#x27;s Crème to Powder for several years, and although I&#x27;ll occasionally TRY another product, I keep coming back to it.  I&#x27;m lucky to have good skin, but I do have rosacea.  Nothing covers the redness like this product.  Goes on like a creamy, thick foundation but soon dries to a soft powdery finish.</li>
            <li> In an effort to continue reviewing my 100 top products used either for personal care, as household products, food my family consumes or other items vital to my comfort and the streamlining of the care of my home, today I am super pleased to review the Mary Kay Creme to Powder Foundation which has been among my make-up products of choice for approximately 18 years.

            <li> I love the color and the feel of this Mary kay  creme to powder make up. Shipped right away and was packed accurately.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT THIS PRODUCT I USE ALL THE TIME AND NOTHING CAN TAKE ITS PLACE ITS JUST GREAT!!  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and I will continue using it.  It is very easy to apply and goes on smooth.  It covers all my blemishes and evens out my skin.  I wasn&#x27;t able to find a mary kay rep in my area so I decided to look for it on amazon.  I was pleased to see that I could buy this product for a cheaper price and that it came to me in perfectly new condition.</li>
            <li> I love it, my complection is difficult, I am very pale with rosy cheeks, its hard to find a foundation to even me out and this works great, complete coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, thankfully it hasn&#x27;t changed or been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Foundation blends so well with my complexion.</li>
            <li> Was not compatible with beige 1 press powder. Color not dark enough</li>
