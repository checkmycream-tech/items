            <li> When I saw this product online, it was advertised in a 6 oz. bottle form and so I ordered it.  When I got it, it turned out to be the 4.75 oz tube you see here.  I was disappointed because it felt like a bait and switch.  I said so in my comments and the company subsequently issued a 5.00 credit.  Thank you to them for trying to make it right and putting up the tube in this review.</li>
