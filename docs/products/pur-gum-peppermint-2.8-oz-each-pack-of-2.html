            <li>This gum tastes great.</li>
            <li>Great gum</li>
            <li>The gum tastes great and the minty flavor and smell linger forever.</li>
            <li>This is a great 2 pack.  </li>
            <li>These packages are also great.  </li>
            <li>This gum has great a great taste</li>
            <li>Good alternative to the chemical ridden store gums.</li>
            <li>Tastes good, but flavor lasts for about 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>Flavor of mint is good.</li>
            <li>Very good and not bad for you</li>
            <li>My favorite &amp;#34;sugarless&amp;#34; gum!</li>
            <li>Nice to find gum without aspartame.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok by me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really enjoying it.</li>
            <li>My favorite xylitol gums</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good sugar free - aspartame free gum.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s aspartame free.</li>
            <li>The gum had excellent flavor but the flavor only lasts about 5 min great price and very fresh but the flavor just didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>The packaging is easy to tuck away in the car, beside my lounger or in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Strong peppermint flavor.  </li>
            <li>The flavor lasts, refreshes, and is MUCH safer to chew than gum with chemicals in it!!!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try a non-aspartame gum, but this is severly lacking in staying power and malleability.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your breath minty fresh without ingesting BHT and aspartame.  </li>
            <li>Much healthier for children than what is at checkout counters in stores.</li>
            <li>I just wished it just did not cost as much.</li>
            <li>Most likely more people would buy it and the manufacture would be helping the human race especially for the kids</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Pur gum...</li>
            <li>My digestion normally hates any sugar alcohol...</li>
            <li>One other important thing to note is the xylitol.  </li>
            <li>The price is a bit steep but probably worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>Knowing it&#x27;s derived from natural source is comforting.</li>
            <li>It was soft and the flavor lasted.  </li>
            <li>Loses it&#x27;s flavor after about 10 minutes, but my main reason for buying this gum was to have Aspertame free, Vegan gum to carry around, so it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>The flavor is gone in about 2 minutes and the gum gets kind of tough and well, gross.  </li>
            <li>I love to chew gum...at least in private.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big gum chewer and I will probably purchase again simply because the ingredients are a much healthier option then the rest of the gum on the market.</li>
            <li>I really like that this gum does not have harmful additives like every single pack of gum at the stores around NE Ohio.</li>
            <li>But this gum gets stiff quickly.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay soft for long chewing.</li>
            <li>but I rated it a 3 because it loses flavor quickly.</li>

            <li> Nice to find gum without aspartame. But this gum gets stiff quickly. Doesn&#x27;t stay soft for long chewing.</li>
            <li> Great tasting gum. Good alternative to the chemical ridden store gums. Sugars taste don&#x27;t last long but it&#x27;s ok by me. Knowing it&#x27;s derived from natural source is comforting.</li>
            <li> Only gum I&#x27;ve found that contains no aspartame, but it is expensive.  I&#x27;ve switched us to Pur because we both have been diagnosed with neuropathy and there is evidence that aspartame aggravates neuropathy</li>
            <li> I love PUR gum because it is the least artificial of all gums on the market.  This gum does not stick to my dental work either!</li>
            <li> This gum tastes great. Chews like any other gum just without the Aspartame.  You won&#x27;t notice a difference.  I have bought this several times now and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like that this gum does not have harmful additives like every single pack of gum at the stores around NE Ohio. The price is a bit steep but probably worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, but flavor lasts for about 15 seconds.</li>

            <li> Very good and not bad for you</li>
            <li> Great gum I wish regular stores carried it. Much healthier for children than what is at checkout counters in stores. They &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; have aspartame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this gum for a while now and I&#x27;m really enjoying it. The biggest plus for me was the no aspartame. The gum tastes great and the minty flavor and smell linger forever.</li>
            <li> My favorite &amp;#34;sugarless&amp;#34; gum!</li>
            <li> My favorite xylitol gums</li>
            <li> I am addicted to pur gum.  The taste is long lasting and favorable.  This is a great 2 pack.  My only complaint is the packaging.  I like the smaller boxes of gum to carry it then this larger package.</li>
            <li> GREAT GUM!!!  The flavor lasts, refreshes, and is MUCH safer to chew than gum with chemicals in it!!!</li>
            <li> I love to chew gum...at least in private. Aspartame is one thing I wanted to avoid.  That is hard to do!  It is even in regular &amp;#34;sugar&amp;#34; gum. At first, I didn&#x27;t care for the Pur gum (I tried all of the flavors), because during the first few minutes of chewing it was a little tough.  After that is was wonderful.  It was soft and the flavor lasted.  This applies to all of the flavors. One other important thing to note is the xylitol.  My digestion normally hates any sugar alcohol...gives me gas! But not so with xylitol. These packages are also great.  I usually take two pieces as my &amp;#34;serving&amp;#34;.  The packaging is easy to tuck away in the car, beside my lounger or in my purse.  I highly recommend Pur gum...all flavors.</li>
            <li> The gum had excellent flavor but the flavor only lasts about 5 min great price and very fresh but the flavor just didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> flavor lasts longer then the fruit flavored one. But still doesn&#x27;t last very long. 4 stars because it&#x27;s an alternative to aspartame gum</li>
            <li> Strong peppermint flavor.  Love that it&#x27;s aspartame free.</li>
            <li> Excellent taste and no &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sugar free - aspartame free gum. It does lose it&#x27;s flavor within 5 mins though.</li>
            <li> Delicious and the flavor lasts.  And it&#x27;s good to get away from aspartame!</li>
            <li> This gum has great a great taste but I rated it a 3 because it loses flavor quickly. I&#x27;m not a big gum chewer and I will probably purchase again simply because the ingredients are a much healthier option then the rest of the gum on the market.</li>
            <li> Keeps your breath minty fresh without ingesting BHT and aspartame.  My daughter loves it. I just wished it just did not cost as much. I wish it was at the same price as other gum. Most likely more people would buy it and the manufacture would be helping the human race especially for the kids</li>
