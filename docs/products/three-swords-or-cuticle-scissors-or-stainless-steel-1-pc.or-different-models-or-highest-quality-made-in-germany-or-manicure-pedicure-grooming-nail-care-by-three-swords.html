            <li>I am going to order a couple of more.</li>
            <li>I found these - the price was still OK</li>
            <li>I have a fair amount of surgical equipment and these are as good as my miltex surgical scissors which is a big compliment.  </li>
            <li>these really, the really good pair?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they are really sharp and the blades meet perfectly.</li>
            <li>the handles easily bend to the paint where the blades no longer close all the way.</li>
            <li>Having received this product on time exactly as promised, was nice.</li>
            <li>I thought these scissors were great... until the tip of one blade broke off the 3rd time I used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon says they&#x27;re no longer available.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Well made, smooth operation.  </li>
            <li>After going though a couple of cheap pairs that were a nightmare to use</li>
            <li>far superior to those that I&#x27;ve bought at a drugstore.</li>
            <li>These are it; they preform just as well as non-serrated professional scissors, feel just as good in your hand, but are simultaneously affordable.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT, these are hard to find at a local store and they are great scissors.</li>
            <li>The brushed metal surface looks good too.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about these scissors.</li>
            <li>Great scissors, very sharp and precise.</li>

            <li>Totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It is so worth the investment to have the quality tool.</li>
            <li>I could cut my right hand, however (I&#x27;m right handed dominant. )</li>
            <li>Excellent for cutting my baby and toddlers&#x27; nails because I can quickly and accurately get the job done.</li>
            <li>Best small scissors ever, sharp, precise, and very pointy!!!</li>
            <li>Pay just a little more and get the Tweezerman&#x27;s - they are much, much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re a darn good replacement and half the price.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re reading this because you have essentially  two options, buy the cheap pair in an actual store, or shell out five extra bucks for the really good pair that come with free prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Excellent product - as described - really sharp &amp; cuts well - be CAREFUL !!</li>
            <li>Really thin, light and work really good.</li>
            <li>I was worried about purchasing cuticle scissors over the internet because certain models have not lived up to my expectations</li>

            <li>Very quality pair of scissors for nail grooming.</li>
            <li>perhaps you&#x27;ve decided on the free shipping option and now your only question is, &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li>These are the scissors you really want.</li>
            <li>These sissors work very well.  </li>
            <li>used to work in research, and the microsurgical scissors we had were the absolute best for cutting my nails.</li>
            <li>When I left the lab, though, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $80 on my own pair, so I set out to buy something similar but without the fuss or markup.</li>
            <li>Incredibly sharp, I look forward to tying many a flies with these.</li>
            <li>Wanted that scissors will be more sharply.</li>
            <li>They are made of a higher quality than other cheap ones I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Nice and small</li>
            <li>One word they are SHARP, I think I was used to my old (maybe 15+yrs) scissors but these are sharp and feel great in your hand.</li>
            <li>With less-than-straight toe-nails, I was looking for high precision scissors.</li>
            <li>Love the precision of this little cuticle scissors.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, and strong.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth paying a couple extra dollars for the quality.</li>
            <li>Sharp and accurate.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These do a great job on nails, and are thin enough to cut hairs flush with the skin.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Although the blades are nice a sharp as other&#x27;s have commended.</li>
            <li>The blades are sturdy and thin so super precise.</li>
            <li>These cuticle scissors do a great job cutting cuticles.</li>
            <li>The steel in the handles is soft and malleable.</li>
            <li>It seems like many cuticle scissors have thick blades, not so with these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how bad a simple pair of scissors can be, ones that can&#x27;t cleanly cut a fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are sharp, heavy and strong and will cut Jamberry wraps without bending them.</li>
            <li>While superficially a qulity product, it was not sharp enough to cut my wife&#x27;s cuticles and hangnails.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Brushed stainless steel, smooth cutting action, and just obvious quality</li>
            <li>It is able to trim those little sections of hard cuticle that develop at the sides of the nail.</li>
            <li>The thin blades make it easy to reach everywhere and follow the natural shape of the nail, and they are sturdy and sharp.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through two pair in the last year and just by holding these in my hand I can tell the craftsmanship far exceeds that of your average $5 pair of Trim scissors</li>
            <li> Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> the blade is pretty thick</li>
            <li> They are small, sharp and the slight curve allows me to cut arcs easily.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, all the common store brand scissors are garbage compared to this one.</li>
            <li> Dry them off after use because they will rust.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and they cut my left hand with ease.</li>
            <li> Spend a little extra money.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about them is the tips are slightly rounded whereas the Henckels have a sharp point which make it easier to slide under the cuticle.</li>
            <li> I use them to trim nail wraps and have recommended them to a few people for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and I will have them for a long time</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with them is when spreading the blades, they are a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> They are not sharp and thin enough for me</li>
            <li> sharp, sturdy, i use these scissors for trimming my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I will keep them for other things.</li>
            <li> Stays sharp longer than any other pair.</li>
            <li> This guy is a sharp, precision surgical tool (so it seems).</li>
            <li> These are extremely sharp and trim cuticles with ease.</li>
            <li> Heavy-duty and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get these if you intend to use them for anything other then cuticles.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> If you try to cut anything harder then dead skin(like a toe nail as in my case)</li>
            <li> Great...and very sharp, as advertised.</li>
            <li> These bad boys are sharp and super well made.</li>
            <li> (I have not been a fan of some of the typical drugstore models because they are too dull and the screw comes loose).</li>
            <li> (I have not been a fan of some of the typical drugstore models because they are too dull and the screw comes loose).</li>
            <li> The blades are a little bit thicker than the Henckels as well.  </li>
            <li> , I need something a little stronger for that.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Very sharp!  </li>
            <li> I use the scissors on pesky hangnails and it cuts sharply without having to worry about cutting your finger and without having to saw back and forth.</li>
            <li> Blades just a little too thick for what I needed.</li>
            <li> These are heavy duty and cut through thick toe nails.  </li>
            <li> I was so tired of paying just a couple of dollars less for manicure scissors purchased in local stores (and all made in China) and finding them to be very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Blades are thin and very sharp - just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who has thick nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails are quite thick</li>

            <li> Quality and arrived on time</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, these are hard to find at a local store and they are great scissors. One word they are SHARP, I think I was used to my old (maybe 15+yrs) scissors but these are sharp and feel great in your hand.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, great quality.</li>
            <li> One of the best scissors I&#x27;ve purchased.  Well worth the price and far superior to those that I&#x27;ve bought at a drugstore.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for. I had also bought a cheaper pair to compare. It is definitely worth paying a couple extra dollars for the quality.</li>
            <li> These are terrific. The blades are sturdy and thin so super precise. I use them to trim nail wraps and have recommended them to a few people for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> These siccors are so great.  They are made of a higher quality than other cheap ones I have purchased.  They are very sharp and I will have them for a long time</li>
            <li> These cuticle scissors are great! I was worried about purchasing cuticle scissors over the internet because certain models have not lived up to my expectations (I have not been a fan of some of the typical drugstore models because they are too dull and the screw comes loose). I also wanted a pair of scissors that was affordable without compromising the quality. This pair fits that criteria! I use the scissors on pesky hangnails and it cuts sharply without having to worry about cutting your finger and without having to saw back and forth. Great purchase and I would recommend this model!</li>
            <li> Very quality pair of scissors for nail grooming. Sturdy and heavy. Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I got these to replace a pair of Henckels cuticle scissors I thought I&#x27;d lost (then later found). I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re a darn good replacement and half the price. The only thing I dislike about them is the tips are slightly rounded whereas the Henckels have a sharp point which make it easier to slide under the cuticle. The blades are a little bit thicker than the Henckels as well.  Edit: downgraded 1 star. Whatever steel they&#x27;re made of, it&#x27;s not the best quality. I washed mine and let them air dry, and they rusted. :(</li>
            <li> Incredibly sharp, I look forward to tying many a flies with these.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and they cut my left hand with ease. I could cut my right hand, however (I&#x27;m right handed dominant. )</li>
            <li> Perfect manicure scissors. Nice and small so I can maneuver smaller areas.</li>
            <li> These cuticle scissors do a great job cutting cuticles. The only problem I have with them is when spreading the blades, they are a bit stiff. I almost feel that they need to be lubricated. Aside from that, they are great!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Best small scissors ever, sharp, precise, and very pointy!!!</li>
            <li> Very good.  I liked it a lot</li>
            <li> A quality pair of cuticle scissors. Best pair I have ever owned. Buy it.</li>
            <li> While this may seem too expensive for nail scissors, trust me, this is what you should get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to work in research, and the microsurgical scissors we had were the absolute best for cutting my nails. When I left the lab, though, I didn&#x27;t want to spend $80 on my own pair, so I set out to buy something similar but without the fuss or markup. These are it; they preform just as well as non-serrated professional scissors, feel just as good in your hand, but are simultaneously affordable.</li>
            <li> There is metal debris between the blades. Be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Modified on 8/7/2015&lt;br /&gt;They send me a new one, which is better now.</li>
            <li> Very sharp!  Cuts well.</li>
            <li> PROS: sharp, sturdy, i use these scissors for trimming my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: none i can think of!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: i will be purchasing a back-up pair</li>
            <li> These are heavy duty and cut through thick toe nails.  I recommend this for anyone who has thick nails.  Great</li>
            <li> For the &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; price, these scissors are great.  It seems like many cuticle scissors have thick blades, not so with these. I am buying another pair.</li>
            <li> These bad boys are sharp and super well made.</li>
            <li> works well, good choice</li>
            <li> These scissors are just what I need for my scrap booking. They are small, sharp and the slight curve allows me to cut arcs easily.</li>
            <li> Just awesome, truly the best cuticle scissors I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Well made and sturdy. Good price. Blades just a little too thick for what I needed.They dont trim facial hair as well but I will keep them for other things.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how bad a simple pair of scissors can be, ones that can&#x27;t cleanly cut a fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do a great job on nails, and are thin enough to cut hairs flush with the skin.  They have the feel that they&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
            <li> Nice scissors with no slop in the cutting actions. Dry them off after use because they will rust.</li>
            <li> Sharp and accurate.  The brushed metal surface looks good too.  Just what I needed. Nice quality for the price !</li>
            <li> It is able to trim those little sections of hard cuticle that develop at the sides of the nail. So far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re reading this because you have essentially  two options, buy the cheap pair in an actual store, or shell out five extra bucks for the really good pair that come with free prime shipping. Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or perhaps you&#x27;ve decided on the free shipping option and now your only question is, &amp;#34;are these really, the really good pair?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same question I asked, and the answer is yes. These are the really good pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through two pair in the last year and just by holding these in my hand I can tell the craftsmanship far exceeds that of your average $5 pair of Trim scissors you&#x27;re likely to find at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushed stainless steel, smooth cutting action, and just obvious quality all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead, pull the trigger. These are the scissors you really want.</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD QUALITY,  THE SCISSOR BROKE AFTER TWO DAYS!</li>
            <li> As Advertised As Advertised As Advertised As Advertised As Advertised As Advertised As Advertised As Advertised As Advertised</li>
            <li> Stays sharp longer than any other pair. Takes to sharpening with a whet stone nicely. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Pay just a little more and get the Tweezerman&#x27;s - they are much, much better. I returned these.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about these scissors. I have a fair amount of surgical equipment and these are as good as my miltex surgical scissors which is a big compliment.  Obviously, not using them for surgery here but they are really sharp and the blades meet perfectly.</li>
            <li> These cuticle scissors are great! I was worried about purchasing cuticle scissors over the internet because certain models have not lived up to my expectations (I have not been a fan of some of the typical drugstore models because they are too dull and the screw comes loose).</li>
            <li> Excellent product - as described - really sharp &amp; cuts well - be CAREFUL !!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  High quality and cuts my Jamberry nail wraps perfectly.</li>
            <li> They are not sharp and thin enough for me and I&#x27;m afraid that soon they will go blunt. Not worth it</li>
            <li> Wanted that scissors will be more sharply.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy this sooner?  Love the precision of this little cuticle scissors.</li>
            <li> Great...and very sharp, as advertised.</li>
            <li> I thought these scissors were great... until the tip of one blade broke off the 3rd time I used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was cutting a cuticle, not a piece of sheet metal. One tip broke off, leaving the scissors useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Amazon says they&#x27;re no longer available.</li>
            <li> Really thin, light and work really good.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good quality.  I go through a lot of these that are lesser quality</li>
            <li> These are quality scissors and do what I wanted them for. Expect to have them for years to come.</li>
            <li> While superficially a qulity product, it was not sharp enough to cut my wife&#x27;s cuticles and hangnails.  Use of it left her fingers sore for several days.</li>
            <li> great scissors for the price--sharp, tight blades can cut close to the skin.</li>
            <li> Wow! This guy is a sharp, precision surgical tool (so it seems). Very nice pair of scissors! Very high quality at a very nice price!</li>
            <li> Best nail scissors I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve owned a few, including some expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut like it is supposed to.  The end or tips do not even match up so it does not cut.  Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Well made, smooth operation.  Totally worth the price.  I was so tired of paying just a couple of dollars less for manicure scissors purchased in local stores (and all made in China) and finding them to be very poor quality.  So very happy with this purchase by comparison.</li>
            <li> These are extremely sharp and trim cuticles with ease.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money</li>
            <li> Having received this product on time exactly as promised, was nice. Seeing that it&#x27;s a quality product was great. I am going to order a couple of more. I paid over 30 dollars for a similar German Product in Hungary years ago, at 11 dollars I think it&#x27;s a great bargain.</li>
            <li> These do the trick but they are not Hoffritz.</li>
            <li> the blade is pretty thick</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase.  Heavy-duty and sharp.  What more could a person want with cuticle scissors!</li>
            <li> These are great nail scissors for cuticles and hang nails.  My nails are quite thick so I wouldnt use these to cut my nails, I need something a little stronger for that.</li>
            <li> Blades are thin and very sharp - just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> With less-than-straight toe-nails, I was looking for high precision scissors. After going though a couple of cheap pairs that were a nightmare to use I found these - the price was still OK and they do an excellent job. The thin blades make it easy to reach everywhere and follow the natural shape of the nail, and they are sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li> These scissors are great! They cut my jamberrys and nails perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good quality of cuticle scissors, love them!</li>
            <li> These sissors work very well.  They are sharp, and strong.  Spend a little extra money.  With these, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are sharp, heavy and strong and will cut Jamberry wraps without bending them. It is so worth the investment to have the quality tool.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, all the common store brand scissors are garbage compared to this one. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Although the blades are nice a sharp as other&#x27;s have commended. The steel in the handles is soft and malleable. If you try to cut anything harder then dead skin(like a toe nail as in my case) the handles easily bend to the paint where the blades no longer close all the way. Don&#x27;t get these if you intend to use them for anything other then cuticles.</li>
            <li> Great scissors, very sharp and precise. Excellent for cutting my baby and toddlers&#x27; nails because I can quickly and accurately get the job done.</li>
