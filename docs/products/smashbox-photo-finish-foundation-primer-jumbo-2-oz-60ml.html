            <li>Extremely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>Does help make foundation more stable and even.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I am 68 and it gives me a much better smooth complexion, does even out lines</li>

            <li>When I do wear foundation I will mix a bit of this with my foundation for easy application.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best primer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My pores look almost invisible, as do my fine lines.</li>
            <li>on smoothly, and you can use it alone for those \\&quot;off\\&quot; non-makeup days.</li>
            <li>The finish on it is so smooth that you can put your makeup on immediately after using</li>
            <li>I bought this product to try instead of the smashbox primer light.  </li>
            <li>And I must say, this product is really one of the BEST buys in my long line of makeups</li>
            <li>This product really makes your foundation look dewy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old and my skin looks better than it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>My makeup lasts longer looking fresh and not melting off.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, this will go a long way in making sure that your makeup stays put!  </li>
            <li>(smaller pores, smoother, more dewy)</li>
            <li>I never fail to get compliments on my make up when I use this as a primer.</li>
            <li>This is the first foundation primer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>But it is EXACTLY like Monistat anti-rubbing gel, which you can buy for 1/10th the price.</li>
            <li>Give me a smooth professional finish.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>If it sounds to good to be true it usually is!</li>

            <li>Keeps my makeup on my face all day long and helps smooth out my skin!</li>
            <li>I am 47 and it totally helps to fill in the fine lines.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and tend to have to blot a lot throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>and it really broke out my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few products out there worth the money and the hype!!!</li>
            <li>When I called Amazon they quickly offered to send me a second tube or refund me 50% of my cost.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know whether my skin is particular in that regard.  </li>
            <li>However, I bought this primer mainly to help keep my foundation in place all day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Smashbox Photo Primer.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth without leaving it sticky or too wet.  </li>
            <li>I normally buy this at Sephoria but couldnt pass up this deal.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it as I love the results and a little thoroughly cleansing never hurt anyone!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s anti-chafing gel that is literally the EXACT same thing as this except</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin, and this does NOT break me out, nor does it make my skin earlier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and perhaps that was the problem.</li>
            <li>The product was open and is not the same constancy as the real Smashbox Primer.</li>
            <li>I have used the Bare Minerals primer before this, but that product was bo</li>
            <li>and I use this almost every day...if you want a primer that is not heavy and does what it is intended for, look no further.</li>
            <li>I have 37 yo sensitive dry skin and have had no issues with adverse reactions.  </li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Other sellers do have the 2.0 oz size and for a lower price.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m so glad they now sell it in the tube, because the old packaging was terrible (could never get all the product out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have had small scars from acne for a while now, and Smashbox Foundation Primer has been instrumental for smoothing the skin, along with using concealer, micro-finishing powder and a foundation, I can say that I have the confidence to face the world..</li>
            <li> Then I tried some of the expensive dept store ones.</li>
            <li> I was already hooked before I looked into how expensive it is...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have only been using this stuff for one week, and am amazed by the difference it has made in my skin, even without makeup. I have used the Bare Minerals primer before this, but that product was bo no means the miracle product that this has turned out to be. I&#x27;m 36 years old and my skin looks better than it did when I was in my 20&#x27;s. The texture of this product is wonderful----lightweight and silky. My pores look almost invisible, as do my fine lines. Plus my skin looks shiny. I put this on this morning and chose to forgo foundation. I highly recommend Smashbox Photo Primer. It&#x27;s one of the few products out there worth the money and the hype!!!</li>
            <li> I am 68 and it gives me a much better smooth complexion, does even out lines and  also like a moisturizer. I get compliments on  my skin when I wear it. I have tried all the drugstore primers, hoping to save money but threw them out. Then I tried some of the expensive dept store ones. This works the best. I have dry skin, with lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have had small scars from acne for a while now, and Smashbox Foundation Primer has been instrumental for smoothing the skin, along with using concealer, micro-finishing powder and a foundation, I can say that I have the confidence to face the world..Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Great for giving your face a smooth palette upon which to apply foundation.  Been using it for a long time and won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this primer since like 4 years ago, when I read an online review that raved about it. And I must say, this product is really one of the BEST buys in my long line of makeups purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glides on smoothly, and you can use it alone for those \\&quot;off\\&quot; non-makeup days. Cos it effectively helps to smoothen out the skin, even out skintone and hides unsightly pores.</li>
            <li> I love this primer. And you get a lot for the price. Ive had this for several months now and it&#x27;s still going strong. Keeps my makeup on my face all day long and helps smooth out my skin!</li>
            <li> This primer is lovely.  It feels wonderfully silky going on and my skin looks better (smaller pores, smoother, more dewy) even when I wear this without anything else.  When I do wear foundation I will mix a bit of this with my foundation for easy application.  I have 37 yo sensitive dry skin and have had no issues with adverse reactions.  A little goes a long way.  Oh, my one and only complaint is when I ordered this product I was lead to believe that there were 2 x 2oz tubes coming, but only 1 arrived in the package.  When I called Amazon they quickly offered to send me a second tube or refund me 50% of my cost.  Got to love Amazon and their customer service.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best primer I have ever used. Also, I&#x27;m so glad they now sell it in the tube, because the old packaging was terrible (could never get all the product out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some highlights:&lt;br /&gt;- Smooths out the complexion for even coating of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;- Works great with liquid AND powder foundations (as well as mineral).&lt;br /&gt;- I have sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin, and this does NOT break me out, nor does it make my skin earlier.&lt;br /&gt;- The finish on it is so smooth that you can put your makeup on immediately after using it.&lt;br /&gt;- You can&#x27;t feel it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product lasts a long time...I only have to replace a couple of times per year and I use this almost every day...if you want a primer that is not heavy and does what it is intended for, look no further.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, this will go a long way in making sure that your makeup stays put!  I find that it will break me out over time unless I use my Clarisonic scrubber, but that&#x27;s just me. . . don&#x27;t know whether my skin is particular in that regard.  It doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it as I love the results and a little thoroughly cleansing never hurt anyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try instead of the smashbox primer light.  This definitely goes on a lot silkier and smoother.  I did notice that my foundation looked a lot smoother and more flawless when I used this primer.  However, I bought this primer mainly to help keep my foundation in place all day.  I didn&#x27;t feel this product lived up to that hype.  My foundation still wore off (maybe a little less quickly?)  as the day went on.  Granted I have very oily skin and tend to have to blot a lot throughout the day.  However, this product was supposed to help keep the oiliness at bay somewhat which I didn&#x27;t feel it did.  I would recommend it if you want to help create a more polished and flawless looking appearance to your foundation.  Your foundation literally glides over the top of this foundation and it does help smooth out and diminish the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> There was no packaging. It just came in a plastic zip lock back. The product was open and is not the same constancy as the real Smashbox Primer. The smell is different as well. This is a scam</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with this product.  Feels great on my face and makes the makeup look smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this before and it is great.</li>
            <li> This product really makes your foundation look dewy and smooth.  It minimizes pores and gives a finished look without looking heavy or &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this primer!  I have tried all the latest and greatest primers (Mally, Laura Geller, etc.) trying to find one that I truly liked.  I have found it!!  I was already hooked before I looked into how expensive it is...but it&#x27;s worth it.  My makeup lasts longer looking fresh and not melting off.  It makes my skin so smooth without leaving it sticky or too wet.  My problem with Mally&#x27;s was it rolled up on my skin and Laura Geller&#x27;s left my face too wet and I had to dry my hair while my face dried enough to put on my makeup.  This doesn&#x27;t have any of those problems and I&#x27;m hooked for life.  My mom is 47 and loves this product as well, if that helps you get off the fence.  She feels it doesn&#x27;t settle in her wrinkles and smooths out her skin.</li>
            <li> I normally buy this at Sephoria but couldnt pass up this deal. You can tell right away it isn&#x27;t the real thing. Beware and pass this buy. If it sounds to good to be true it usually is!</li>
            <li> I never fail to get compliments on my make up when I use this as a primer. It truly keeps your make up in place. It goes on silky and you only need a little. I am 47 and it totally helps to fill in the fine lines.</li>
            <li> This is the first foundation primer I have ever tried. It is very smooth and easy to apply. Does help make foundation more stable and even. Does not feel greasy or sticky. Like it.</li>
            <li> Ugh.  ..I read the reviews and I thought this would be so perfect. But it is EXACTLY like Monistat anti-rubbing gel, which you can buy for 1/10th the price. I know what you&#x27;re thinking .. why would I put yeast infection medicine on my face?! But it&#x27;s not yeast infection medicine. It&#x27;s anti-chafing gel that is literally the EXACT same thing as this except it&#x27;s like $3/tube instead of $30. Look into it ladies. . you&#x27;re wasting your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based upon the positive reviews it received.  I tried it for two weeks and it really broke out my face.  I have never had a problem with acne and bought this to minimize my pores. Not for me.  I have sensitive skin and perhaps that was the problem.</li>
            <li> The heading advertises this as the 2.0 oz / 60 mL jumbo size.  But if you enlarge the image you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s the 1.7 oz / 50 mL size.  Wish I&#x27;d noticed this before buying.  Other sellers do have the 2.0 oz size and for a lower price.</li>
            <li> great primer before applying my make up.  Give me a smooth professional finish.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping Great product.  I will order again thank you Joanann</li>
