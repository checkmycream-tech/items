            <li>I use it right after showering.  </li>
            <li>Do you know which soaps to stay away from right BEFORE wrapping?</li>
            <li>I go to the gym 5 days a week  and eat right.</li>
            <li>You use moisturizer every day, right?  </li>
            <li>However if you exercise and eat right, it takes time to get rid of unwanted fat.  </li>
            <li>Also having a decent diet is important.  </li>

            <li>The prices they are asking for their products are more than what you&#x27;d pay going through the actual company and being a loyal customer.</li>

            <li>I saw/felt a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>

            <li>Best to use with the wraps or on areas that are harder to wrap, such as the upper arms and butt.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was more careful with those</li>

            <li>ItWorks global haa a policy against selling on Amazon to make sure you aren&#x27;t getting old product.</li>
            <li>but wow!!!</li>
            <li>The loyal customer program is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my tattoos it brought the color back to life, far more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to keep using this product to see my final results</li>
            <li>It is fine with me if you squeeze out 6 oz first and do whatever you want with it, but I want those other 4.1 oz</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing but not worth the $$$$$</li>
            <li>I am a DT and as a loyal customer you can get this product and other items much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>It is only $45 for loyal customers.</li>
            <li>You can get these a lot cheaper just 45 if you become a loyal customer which is just buying one discounted item a month for 3 short months at and</li>
            <li>DID YOU KNOW it is highly recommended you take BEFORE</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li>I have about 3 deep scars on my stomach but after using the cream, those scars went down to looking smooth and all my stretch marks have faded drastically!!</li>
            <li>I just need some help with toning up a little more.</li>
            <li>I normally go to th3n3wy0u.com and get it cheaper</li>
            <li>please try those few things I suggested, I was told to do that by a friend of mine who sells these, and you will see better</li>
            <li>If you want to be sure of what you are getting, order directly from an independent distributor who follows the compliance terms with It Works Global.</li>
            <li>Works for so many different things.. Stretch marks, cellulite, tattoos, scars, pregnancy spots, dry skin, toning and firming skin.</li>
            <li>This ensures you are receiving the highest quality product and it also gives you a live person to refer to for directions, expectations, concerns, and questions.</li>
            <li>My friend a distributor gave me a sample tube for free and within a week of applying it daily morning/night I was finally getting compliments from people on my weightloss,</li>
            <li>They are only available through independent distributors.  </li>
            <li>If at all possible, the first time, I will wrap the client myself</li>
            <li>You can jog for 30 minutes for three days, diet for three days, view yourself in the mirror first thing in the morning, and you will actually get results; but you won&#x27;t get results with this.</li>
            <li>Dear seller, if you want this taken down you should send me another bottle for free or immediately revise your listing.</li>
            <li>Made my skin very smooth but only slightly lightened my varicose veins.</li>
            <li>In addition, due to the natural makeup of the ingredients, these products need to be stored in cool (not refrigerated) temperature.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am hooked and soo happy to have purchased this big tube!</li>
            <li>One thing I would recommend is to buy it directly from a distributor&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>Adem&amp;aacute;s, debido a la distribuci&amp;oacute;n natural de los ingredientes, estos productos necesitan ser almacenados en un lugar fresco (no refrigerado) de temperatura.</li>
            <li>I am 47yrs old and have been a marathon runner since I was 25.  </li>
            <li>but when I use this gel it really keeps me toned up especially in my abdomen area.</li>
            <li>These products are botanically based, meaning they are made from naturally occuring botanicals in our environment and that gives them a shelf life.</li>
            <li>directly from the company.</li>
            <li>These are a decade old stretch marks and striae.</li>
            <li>I tried the entire package and didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>My skin has completely changed after using our skin care line.</li>
            <li>i sometimes forget or to busy</li>
            <li>With only one application and plastic wrap for a couple of hours I noticed my waist line much thinner.</li>
            <li>but it is so much money because it actually works.</li>
            <li>Seemed to have worked so far.</li>
            <li>These products are botanically based, meaning they are made from naturally occurring botanicals in our environment and that gives them a shelf life.</li>
            <li>, this is all natural and DOES expire.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and I plan to start using it on my face next!!!</li>
            <li>the spot has went from a dark purple to a very light pink.</li>
            <li>Half your body weight in ounces is the right amount.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the wrap long enough to see large results but I have seen results with the gel already and so have some of my friends</li>
            <li>Ultimate BodyApplicator is made with ALL NATURAL ingredients and has a shelf life.</li>
            <li>as well I can barely notice them Now.</li>
            <li>This company seems to have enlisted an extreme number of low income people that are willing to scam their friends for money.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel tight and more firm.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>Seemed to be working the first few applications.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much a waste of money.</li>

            <li> Also having a decent diet is important.  </li>

            <li> The prices they are asking for their products are more than what you&#x27;d pay going through the actual company and being a loyal customer.</li>

            <li> It is something that you need to use consistently and with diet and exercise to maximize results.  </li>
            <li> : I rated the Ultimate Body Applicator 5 STARS because IT IS a 5 STAR product regardless of it being sold against company policies :)</li>

            <li> I slathered it on my mid section, wrapped it in Saran Wrap and an ace bandage to make sure it stayed in place and slept with it through the night.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I saw/felt a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It was a good moisturizer, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my stretchmarks, cellulite or vericose veins and I used it everyday twice a day.</li>

            <li> The first time I used the wraps and this gel, I felt my whole body change.  </li>
            <li> Best to use with the wraps or on areas that are harder to wrap, such as the upper arms and butt.</li>

            <li> I really like the way it tones my jowly chin area...</li>

            <li> When I wants to cancel they told me it would cost me $50 because I had not completed the 3 months.</li>
            <li> It tightens and tones and really works.</li>
            <li> Yes this product really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> guess you have to buy the whole kit for it to work.</li>
            <li> I also used the food supplements and that helped with digestion so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was more careful with those</li>
            <li> You would see results when you don&#x27;t drink much of them.  </li>
            <li> really does what it claims to do</li>
            <li> It will come straight from</li>
            <li> It Works products so much I became a distributor.</li>
            <li> It costs way to much money to offer nothing in return.</li>
            <li> I cant believe people buy it for this much on here</li>
            <li> tried it based on the directions and was very diligent in my application of it.</li>
            <li> All I can says is it really works.</li>
            <li> ItWorks global haa a policy against selling on Amazon to make sure you aren&#x27;t getting old product.</li>
            <li> but wow!!!</li>
            <li> The loyal customer program is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my tattoos it brought the color back to life, far more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to keep using this product to see my final results</li>
            <li> It is fine with me if you squeeze out 6 oz first and do whatever you want with it, but I want those other 4.1 oz</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing but not worth the $$$$$</li>
            <li> I am a DT and as a loyal customer you can get this product and other items much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> It is only $45 for loyal customers.</li>
            <li> You can get these a lot cheaper just 45 if you become a loyal customer which is just buying one discounted item a month for 3 short months at and</li>
            <li> DID YOU KNOW it is highly recommended you take BEFORE</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> I have about 3 deep scars on my stomach but after using the cream, those scars went down to looking smooth and all my stretch marks have faded drastically!!</li>
            <li> I just need some help with toning up a little more.</li>
            <li> I normally go to th3n3wy0u.com and get it cheaper</li>
            <li> please try those few things I suggested, I was told to do that by a friend of mine who sells these, and you will see better</li>
            <li> If you want to be sure of what you are getting, order directly from an independent distributor who follows the compliance terms with It Works Global.</li>
            <li> Works for so many different things.. Stretch marks, cellulite, tattoos, scars, pregnancy spots, dry skin, toning and firming skin.</li>
            <li> This ensures you are receiving the highest quality product and it also gives you a live person to refer to for directions, expectations, concerns, and questions.</li>
            <li> My friend a distributor gave me a sample tube for free and within a week of applying it daily morning/night I was finally getting compliments from people on my weightloss,</li>
            <li> They are only available through independent distributors.  </li>
            <li> If at all possible, the first time, I will wrap the client myself</li>
            <li> You can jog for 30 minutes for three days, diet for three days, view yourself in the mirror first thing in the morning, and you will actually get results; but you won&#x27;t get results with this.</li>
            <li> Dear seller, if you want this taken down you should send me another bottle for free or immediately revise your listing.</li>
            <li> Made my skin very smooth but only slightly lightened my varicose veins.</li>
            <li> In addition, due to the natural makeup of the ingredients, these products need to be stored in cool (not refrigerated) temperature.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am hooked and soo happy to have purchased this big tube!</li>
            <li> One thing I would recommend is to buy it directly from a distributor&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> Adem&amp;aacute;s, debido a la distribuci&amp;oacute;n natural de los ingredientes, estos productos necesitan ser almacenados en un lugar fresco (no refrigerado) de temperatura.</li>
            <li> I am 47yrs old and have been a marathon runner since I was 25.  </li>
            <li> but when I use this gel it really keeps me toned up especially in my abdomen area.</li>
            <li> These products are botanically based, meaning they are made from naturally occuring botanicals in our environment and that gives them a shelf life.</li>
            <li> directly from the company.</li>
            <li> These are a decade old stretch marks and striae.</li>
            <li> I tried the entire package and didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> My skin has completely changed after using our skin care line.</li>
            <li> i sometimes forget or to busy</li>
            <li> With only one application and plastic wrap for a couple of hours I noticed my waist line much thinner.</li>
            <li> but it is so much money because it actually works.</li>
            <li> Seemed to have worked so far.</li>
            <li> These products are botanically based, meaning they are made from naturally occurring botanicals in our environment and that gives them a shelf life.</li>
            <li> , this is all natural and DOES expire.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and I plan to start using it on my face next!!!</li>
            <li> the spot has went from a dark purple to a very light pink.</li>
            <li> Half your body weight in ounces is the right amount.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the wrap long enough to see large results but I have seen results with the gel already and so have some of my friends</li>
            <li> Ultimate BodyApplicator is made with ALL NATURAL ingredients and has a shelf life.</li>
            <li> as well I can barely notice them Now.</li>
            <li> This company seems to have enlisted an extreme number of low income people that are willing to scam their friends for money.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel tight and more firm.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> Seemed to be working the first few applications.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m a REAL customer and a skeptical one at that.  </li>
            <li> Yes at first I was a but skeptical with the much blubber I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years</li>
            <li> It is giving me back confidence in myself that I lost for so long giving me hope that I didn&#x27;t have before</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have a flat stomach (it sticks out some)</li>
            <li> It Works Global, the company that created and markets the Ultimate BodyApplicator, SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS distributors from selling their products on Amazon, Ebay, Craigslist as well as other places such as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest this to help someone kick start a new diet or to drop a few pounds just so they can get where they want to be.  </li>
            <li> It makes my ink look like it was just done when they are a few years old.</li>
            <li> I spent over $500.00 on this entire treatment system; or should I say, threw away $500.00 with this treatment system.  </li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything at all for me, and the smell of the gel is a little odd.</li>
            <li> MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> I have tried other ‚Äútightening‚Äù products from local drug stores and NOTHING compares to this!</li>
            <li> Absolutely no change at all complete waste of money</li>
            <li> even just the random guy at the gas station commented on my weightloss saying WOW I REALLY SEE IT IN YOUR NECK...</li>
            <li> only a few but enough to bother me</li>
            <li> I had used multiple wraps with no success.</li>
            <li> But like everyone else is saying you need to support the small businesses and buy direct from a distributor.</li>
            <li> Overall I did see results about two and a half weeks in</li>
            <li> I was bound to get stretch marks and loose skin!</li>
            <li> Works has a lot of amazing products that are plant base.</li>
            <li> Be CAREFUL buying ITWORKS products on here.  </li>
            <li> I never really noticed a difference with this product.</li>
            <li> product came in a crushed pkg, boxed item was crushed but no damage to the product itself.</li>
            <li> I especially have trouble with cellulite on my thighs..</li>
            <li> You only need a LITTLE!  </li>
            <li> The only thing that this firming gel does is dry and get hard on your skin, giving you a sensation of tighter skin; however, it does not reduce the appearance of inches at all.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is from wearing the girdle daily at night for a couple of hours or because of the gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but it truly does provide results.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it made your skin freezing cold!</li>
            <li> It is cheaper through a distributor and there is no quality control when you purchase any other way.</li>
            <li> This product may work, but the advertisement is extremely misleading.</li>
            <li> Weight loss and other things</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my tattoo or other parts of my skin that I used this product on 2x/day until the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> You can cut a wrap in half and use it to target one spot and save the other half in a zip lock bag so it won&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any changes for at least a week, but by then I noticed my legs felt incredibly soft and the smaller stretch marks on my stomach from pregnancy were very hard to distinguish.</li>
            <li> Was definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used it on this dark spot on my chest Which I&#x27;ve had for years</li>
            <li> only because I heard that after a certain period of time it goes bad.</li>
            <li> Noticed less redness in stretch marks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all a hyped up lotion that does less than the bottle of jergens</li>
            <li> This gel has firmed my skin so the cellulite is less noticeable.</li>
            <li> it takes a little while to show any change been using it for about 4 to 5 weeks and can tell the difference</li>
            <li> The retail product is a little pricey, but when you purchase from a distributor and enroll with auto-shipment</li>
            <li> I see a little difference</li>
            <li> Was just looking for a little definition skin firming before a vacation.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day everyday for almost two months, guess what?</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I think its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> you do those few things, you should see results.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks ,, we will see of it</li>
            <li> that makes it feel some what firm.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> ,I&#x27;d rather spend a few hundred bucks on this product than a few thousand on surgery anyday!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re usually are past the expiration date and c)</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my belly which is not cute after having babies.</li>
            <li> , that I didn&#x27;t notice when it began to destroy my skin!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Believe in yourself and dont feel like you need to waste money on a gimmick!</li>
            <li> it does not work and is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes but has a very bad odor!</li>
            <li> you want to change about your body is done by hard work, and maybe some cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> My fear is that this substance would be bad for any skin, my skin is just so sensitive that it immediately shows reactions.  </li>
            <li> and I work out at least 3x a week</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these wraps and other</li>
            <li> Helps firm skin &amp; reduced cellulite!!</li>
            <li> I felt ridiculous even using it.</li>
            <li> If you feel hungry take a green tea tablet or drink tea, if you feel bored and want to eat go out and walk for a bit.</li>
            <li> I know at least 10 people try it &amp; no results!</li>
            <li> and they literally disappeared in a few days!!!  </li>
            <li> Very expensive and not worth one penny.</li>
            <li> Which I am not happy about.</li>
            <li> WOW this product is so overpriced on here its insane !!!</li>
            <li> This product is being sold illegally.</li>
            <li> This is extremely expensive though.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so damn expensive</li>
            <li> I think I got a fake product.</li>
            <li> As I tell everyone, if you are skeptical, look up the ingredients.</li>
            <li> via Amazon is illegal.</li>
            <li> This product is being sold illegally.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I tried the wraps 3 times and there was no difference</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Just cutting out sodas will help you.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about these ItWorks!</li>
            <li> but it has decreased the appearance of my stretch marks as well!!</li>
            <li> Just some very expensive lotion.</li>
            <li> dont wanna say anything bad it does not work for me</li>
            <li> The herbal wraps are just as bad.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all. I felt ridiculous even using it. Very expensive and not worth one penny.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products.  I use it right after showering.  I put it on my stomach, thighs, arms and even my face(my favorite). When you apply it, at first it has kind of a stick feeling to it, but after it is absorbed it leaves your skin feeling soft and somewhat tighter.  It is something that you need to use consistently and with diet and exercise to maximize results.  With out a proper diet and exercise, your results will not last but that is the same with any toning product.  It also minimize the appearance of stretchmarks.  One thing I would recommend is to buy it directly from a distributor&#x27;s website.  The reason being. if you don&#x27;t like the product, you can return it.  I also recommend trying the wraps (1 wrap every 72 hours and drink lots of water) and using the gel in between each wrap if you want to see substantial results quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am not a distributor.  I am however a loyal customer and have been using ItWorks products for almost 2 years now.  I haven&#x27;t tried one of their products that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I am a it works distributor. I have got a lot of complains from clients that have bought it works products on here and they have been expired. These products do expire. If you would like to buy some up to datE AND safe to use go to marthabetancourt.myitworks.com you have also get the products a lot cheaper. And you can also sign up as a distributor and make money. You can contact me or go to my web page</li>
            <li> not so sure that all these items are fresh, they do have a shelf life.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!  Makes my skin feel tight and more firm.  Most amazing thing is how fast and how well it made my bruises go away.  I had two huge bruises on my thigh and they literally disappeared in a few days!!!  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Traducido al espa&amp;ntilde;ol abajo) It Works Global, the company that created and markets the Ultimate BodyApplicator, SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS distributors from selling their products on Amazon, Ebay, Craigslist as well as other places such as these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultimate BodyApplicator is made with ALL NATURAL ingredients and has a shelf life. When items are ordered through these venues, by sellers who are violating company policies, there is no guarantee as to the purchase or expiration date(s) of the product. In addition, due to the natural makeup of the ingredients, these products need to be stored in cool (not refrigerated) temperature. There is no guarantee as to where the seller obtained the items or how they were stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, is that our company is designed to provide ongoing support. We are a team - a FAMILY. When someone purchases through me, I guide them EVERY step of the way. If at all possible, the first time, I will wrap the client myself (I&#x27;ve done it on the phone and via text as well). I will explain the ingredients, the way the product is supposed to be applied, the way the product is designed to work, the way the product may affect the body, what to expect from the Ultimate Body Applicator after 1st application (1/4 of a FULL treatment) and what they need to do to have the GREATEST success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR INSTANCE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DID YOU KNOW that one wrap is actually ¬º of a FULL treatment? A full treatment is a box of FOUR (4) wraps. DID YOU KNOW that the wrap continues to work for 72 hours after you put it on? DID YOU KNOW that you need to drink LOTS of water while wearing it, (preferably) before wearing the wrap and during the 72 hours it continues to work? Half your body weight in ounces is the right amount. DID YOU KNOW that you are supposed to measure in 3 places before, after and then in 72 hours after applying the wrap to track your results better? DID YOU KNOW it is highly recommended you take BEFORE and AFTER pictures because they help track your progress? DID YOU KNOW that you cannot have any lotions on before wrapping? Do you know which soaps to stay away from right BEFORE wrapping? ALL these things AND MORE I address with my clients BEFORE, DURING and AFTER wrapping them because I follow the company&#x27;s policies and my clients have tremendous success!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE don&#x27;t let the practices of someone violating company policies STOP you from becoming HEALTHY and having the body of your dreams in the process.

            <li> First, I&#x27;m a REAL customer and a skeptical one at that.  Two of my friends swear by itworks products so I thought is try the gel.  I love the result so much that I&#x27;m on my second tube!  It truly does drastically  improve the appearance of your skin (bumps and lumps).  It does not increase the size, though. I use it on my thighs and will continue to do so. I highly recommend this item and I did our base it through amazon.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work.  I am 47yrs old and have been a marathon runner since I was 25.  Despite the miles logged from running, my stomach would pouch out the moment I ate something.  I used this gel with a tight wrap (girdle with velcro) and hoped for the best, all the while feeling very skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;However, I did notice that my abs felt tighter.  I am not sure if this is from wearing the girdle daily at night for a couple of hours or because of the gel.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaper to buy this gel and wrap yourself than to purchase the pre-made gel wraps so for that purpose, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to use in between when I use the body wraps. I don&#x27;t wrap as often as I should (recommended every 72hrs) but when I use this gel it really keeps me toned up especially in my abdomen area. I can&#x27;t say this works alone because I do try to eat right more often then less, drink over a gallon of water a day and I work out at least 3x a week so it&#x27;s an aide in my weight loss journey. I will definitely order more of this product.</li>
            <li> This product is being sold illegally. It Works Distributors are prohibited from selling products or advertising on Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, etc. If you purchase an It Works product from this site you are not guaranteeing the product. These products are botanically based, meaning they are made from naturally occuring botanicals in our environment and that gives them a shelf life. You have no idea if these are any good and ordering from a distributor allows you to gain product credit points, customer service, and you save money. The prices they are asking for their products are more than what you&#x27;d pay going through the actual company and being a loyal customer. I rated the item 5 stars because it is a 5 star item if purchased through an It Works Independent Distributor.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and  neck...works awesome. No double chin and bye fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> third tube of this.  I really like the way it tones my jowly chin area... (although I hate to admit that I have it)</li>
            <li> LOVE ITit!  I purchased it to get wedding ready 1 year ago and I still use it daily! However, I did some research and found an It Works Distributor through Instagram (kmstarks.itworks.com) and shipped to my door.. I only pay $45 instead of $70!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is liquid gold!! Can use it for so many things! I use it on my eczema when it flares up and it takes the itch and burning away! I use it on my spider veins and it lessens the appearance. I&#x27;v used it for sunburns, abrasions and burns. It works great. I use it twice a day as a full body lotion and it tightens the skin everywhere i use it. I also use it to vitalize my tattoos. It makes my ink look like it was just done when they are a few years old. I&#x27;v also used it on my daughter when she got poison ivy. It minimized the itching! It&#x27;s awesome but i got it way cheaper ( $49)  directly from the company. Go to [...]! for more info.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  It works initially, but then your stuck buying it. when u stop using, results are gone. its a temporary thing. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product I have been using it for months. I was skeptical at first but it truly does provide results. I find it to be a lot more pricy  on here. I normally go to th3n3wy0u.com and get it cheaper plus they always perks that come with it too</li>
            <li> If you have stretch marks this is your new best friend. I used it on my arms and saw full results in a week</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the product itself! I love Defining Gel but you should only ever buy  It Works products from Independent It Works Distributor! REMEMBER everything has expiration dates! I am an  independent It Works Distributor and you can get Defining Gel from us for $45/bottle!!! Email me to get your It Works products at A HUGE discount ldanbert@comcast.net or simply visit  to shop all of the products! Also for more product details and full ingredients list , visit my website!! http://healthylivingwithlisa.myitworks.com Thanks Lisa!</li>
            <li> it takes a little while to show any change been using it for about 4 to 5 weeks and can tell the difference</li>
            <li> Seemed to be working the first few applications.  After that, nothing.  Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes but has a very bad odor!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It has multiple uses from tightening and toning. Reduces the appearance of cellulite and stretch marks. Good for eczema, psoriasis, and rashes. its also great for sunburns. Although it&#x27;s very pricey and you can buy it a lot cheaper. Also this product may be expired which won&#x27;t have the same effect. Check out how much cheaper www.yourwrapgirlamanda.myitworks.com as a loyal customer. You save 40% off of all retail prices as well as earn cash back on every purchase. They have many great products to choose from so it&#x27;s definitely worth it.Shop around before spending too much</li>
            <li> I had used multiple wraps with no success. After my sister started selling ItWorks, I bought a bottle to help her out. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day everyday for almost two months, guess what? My belly AND stretch marks look THEEXACT SAME! I go to the gym 5 days a week  and eat right. Wanna know why? LOTION CREAMS AND GELS DO NOT TIGHTEN OR TONE!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from the distributor and it works fantastic. My stretch marks have faded significantly. These are a decade old stretch marks and striae. The product is definitely cheaper from the actual distributor. I don&#x27;t think it actually tones, but the fading of scars makes it an invaluable product.</li>
            <li> I love this gel it&#x27;s work</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference from the gel or the wraps. I applied as instructed and no change. Disappointed in product</li>
            <li> This really DOES work.....temporary fix?  You use moisturizer every day, right?  Conditioner on your hair every day?  This is one of those products you can use EVERY day!  You only need a LITTLE!  I use it on my face too!  Tightens up all those fine lines around my eyes....chin...and you can get this from me for only $43!  wrapitupthin.myitworks.com winslowteach@gmail,com.  Be CAREFUL buying ITWORKS products on here.  IT&#x27;s against company rules because you a) have no one to explain how to use them properly and b) they&#x27;re usually are past the expiration date and c) MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> I bought this and followed the directions. Used all of it- not any results at all. I do exercise and watch my weight. I just need some help with toning up a little more.</li>
            <li> I never really noticed a difference with this product. On top of that, it made your skin freezing cold! I couldn&#x27;t use it in the winter time....</li>
            <li> Order these on tpersails.itworks.com and you will only pay $45 . Big savings!</li>
            <li> I love the defining gel (: it smells good and it makes my skin super soft(: oh also you can get this product for $45 through a it works distributor and can get free products!&lt;br /&gt;Contact me&lt;br /&gt;www.andrealynndahl.com&lt;br /&gt;dahlandrea7@gmail.com</li>
            <li> This is a pretty neat product. But like everyone else is saying you need to support the small businesses and buy direct from a distributor. The loyal customer program is pretty simple. Basically, how it works is you sign up and get a great price but you have to sign up for an auto ship of product for 3 months, after the 3 months you can stop the auto ship and still be a customer and order when ever you want for the discount price. Much cheaper that way. You can get the same bottle for $45&lt;br /&gt;Try this distributors site.&lt;br /&gt;brittcanwrap.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> Absolutely no change at all complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I am a distributor, if you would like more information email me from my web site lococoitworks.com&lt;br /&gt;It Works has a lot of amazing products that are plant base.

You can also email me at blococo7804@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Barb</li>
            <li> Not only does it NOT work...it&#x27;s very sticky.  My clothes literally sticks to my skin...not just until it dries but all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Was definitely not worth the money. This gel did NOTHING for me. It works did not work for me. I used it twice daily</li>
            <li> I used this with the 4 pack body wraps. It seems to help. Noticed less redness in stretch marks. Feels nice on skin. Drys really fast so you can get dressed right away. Other than that I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for over two month period and didn&#x27;t see any progress at all. It took two people to help get it applied.</li>
            <li> I tried the entire package and didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the high price.</li>
            <li> I use this daily! It&#x27;s awesome firming lotion, great for even people with sensitive skin. And it takes care of so many skin issues from cellulite to acne. You can also get it cheaper from a distributor. Jessicamcnaspy11.myitworks.com</li>

            <li> I am obsessed with these wraps and other It Works products! Nothing would tighten my skin after having my daughter, but I am bikini ready after just 1 wrap!

            <li> I started using defining gel and absolutely love it! It really does work exactly as it says it does! Of course most people are going to be skeptical and not want to spend money when they are not 100% certain it will be effective however,  I can promise you that this product is AMAZING.

            <li> i dislike how it didn&#x27;t make a difference on my skin, but love the &amp;#34;Vicks&amp;#34; smell to it, hehehe! ... Not to mention the sticky goop feeling and look it has.</li>
            <li> good stuff just have to keep on using it. i sometimes forget or to busy but it does help when i do use it</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!  I know at least 10 people try it &amp; no results! It feels refreshing but not worth the $$$$$</li>
            <li> For the people who are saying it doesnt work its probably because they are buying expired product. As a distributor and customer of it works you know that since the products are botanically based they will expire, therefore results probably will not happen. If anyone is interested in trying fresh products contact an It Works distributor!</li>
            <li> Hello Ladies! This stuff is like liquid gold gel. Works for so many different things.. Stretch marks, cellulite, tattoos, scars, pregnancy spots, dry skin, toning and firming skin. If you would like more info and about my personal results. Email me at Myriam.Perez713@gmail.com</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for so many different things! Helps firm skin &amp; reduced cellulite!! I&#x27;m loving it on my thighs so far! You can order it cheaper here though!! Www.thecrazybodywrapthing.com</li>
            <li> This stuff works!! It tightened the skin on my thighs around my knees that were sagging.  I wish I would of taken a picture but I didn&#x27;t really think it would work. but wow!!! it did and shrinks the varicose veins as well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, saw no results!  So disappointing.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money. Not only did it not work it actually made me look bloated. then your try calling the company and there was no return of my money. After 2 months I changed to a different product and that did work. When I wants to cancel they told me it would cost me $50 because I had not completed the 3 months. Yes i understand i signed on for 3 months but when the product doesnt work you should get your money back. I guess that is what I get for actually thinking this would help me lose inches.</li>
            <li> i work at beauty shop. i saw my boss wrap her customer,itworks, iwrap for me, lost 2 inches first time,i sign up distributor.[...]. i feel light &amp; healthy.thanks itworks</li>
            <li> I recently lost 50+ lbs and discovered that with it came the heartache of my skin keeping up with the weight loss, specifically my neck. I was skeptical about these ItWorks! products and refused to spend a dime on them. My friend a distributor gave me a sample tube for free and within a week of applying it daily morning/night I was finally getting compliments from people on my weightloss, even just the random guy at the gas station commented on my weightloss saying WOW I REALLY SEE IT IN YOUR NECK... Needless to say I am hooked and soo happy to have purchased this big tube! Next... the arms :)</li>
            <li> With only one application and plastic wrap for a couple of hours I noticed my waist line much thinner. Thank you this product really works!</li>
            <li> I was a distributor for it works for almost a year.  I had so many complaints from my customers and I have to admit I never saw results either. I think its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> product came in a crushed pkg, boxed item was crushed but no damage to the product itself. for the price i cant complain. love the product</li>
            <li> I wish I had never encountered this substance.  I was so excited initially by how smooth it made my skin, that I didn&#x27;t notice when it began to destroy my skin! I have an autoimmune skin condition and it exacerbated it greatly, leaving my skin much worse than it originally was.  My fear is that this substance would be bad for any skin, my skin is just so sensitive that it immediately shows reactions.  Please warn anyone who is considering using this.</li>
            <li> The defining gel is amazing!! It&#x27;s great for both women and men. This is extremely expensive though. You can get it a lot cheaper www.annandamanda.myitworks.com by becoming a loyal customer as well as earn cash back on every purchase (perk points) Check around before spending too much.</li>
            <li> A decrease in the amount of cellulite was visible. The price of the product is what will keep me from purchasing again. Overall I did see results about two and a half weeks in</li>
            <li> It is not compliant for these products to be sold through this site.  They are only available through independent distributors.  It is cheaper through a distributor and there is no quality control when you purchase any other way. They can be expired or even tampered with. Find an independent distributor.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so damn expensive but it is so much money because it actually works. It tightens and tones and really works.</li>
            <li> It Works products are amazing but is against compliance to be sold online. Purchase from www.premowrapper.com, these could be expired, etc! Contact me there for questions or help also.</li>
            <li> This really didn&#x27;t do anything at all for me, and the smell of the gel is a little odd. Pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is liquid gold!!! Love it!! It can be used on everything! Diaper rash, rashes, eczema,acne,sunburn, varicose veins, and so much more!!! You can get an awesome deal check my website out. www.ambermlayton.myitworks.com; you can email me at alayton@hotmail.com</li>
            <li> Seemed to have worked so far. I see a little difference</li>
            <li> This product may work, but the advertisement is extremely misleading. In the &amp;#34;Product Details&amp;#34; section it states that the weight is 10.1 oz and the product image is blurry so you can not see the oz size in the picture utilized. I bought this because for this price I thought I was purchasing 10.1 oz of a product (which is probably going to be bunk &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34; in the end) and only got 6 oz. While this is listed under &amp;#34;shipping weight&amp;#34; and the plastic of the bottle may actually weigh 4.1 oz so this seller has not technically lied, the way it is portrayed on here is intentionally misleading and even if this product does work, I wish that every customer would point this out and give this seller 1 star until they revise this because I feel like I just got conned. Dear seller, if you want this taken down you should send me another bottle for free or immediately revise your listing. It is fine with me if you squeeze out 6 oz first and do whatever you want with it, but I want those other 4.1 oz your description made me assume I was getting.</li>
            <li> Yes this product really works. Get this product from an official distributor for authenticity. It is only $45 for loyal customers. Visit WrapsByRe.com for more info and to see our other great naturally based products. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I think I got a fake product. Would like to get a refund.</li>
            <li> dont wanna say anything bad it does not work for me guess you have to buy the whole kit for it to work.</li>
            <li> I am about to try the application.  But did not like the fact  in order to use rhe wrap you need to get this gel&lt;br /&gt;I thing this is something worth mentioning when buying a product. So now there is a delay. Which I am not happy about. It would be informative to let customers jnow this.</li>
            <li> If you use ANY type of these products or the competitors, you need to not drink any alcohol, any sugary snacks, have anything caffeinated and I believe smoke for 48 hours before and afterwards.  It is recommended to drink LOTS of water when you use any of these products from It Works or anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you do those few things, you should see results.  The first time I used the wraps and this gel, I felt my whole body change.  I could feel my body digest my food better and I felt better.  I also was able to go to the toilet better as well.  I also used the food supplements and that helped with digestion so much I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two downfalls with these products.  #1 the price and #2 it takes time to see results.  However if you exercise and eat right, it takes time to get rid of unwanted fat.  But this is a healthy way to help yourself.  I find the price troubling however it is worth to be healthy and help your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this to help someone kick start a new diet or to drop a few pounds just so they can get where they want to be.  The key is to watch the amount of sugary snacks, alcohol--which produces sugar, and caffeine intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was more careful with those when I do a body wrap, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d see better results.  You can cut a wrap in half and use it to target one spot and save the other half in a zip lock bag so it won&#x27;t dry out.  I do that often and end up with 8 instead of 4 from one box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t forget to research what you need to do to get the best results!  Also having a decent diet is important.  Drink more water instead of juices and sodas.  You would see results when you don&#x27;t drink much of them.  Just cutting out sodas will help you.  I have a co-worker who did that, quit drinking sodas, her husband is doing it too, and they both have dropped weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you all out there and please try those few things I suggested, I was told to do that by a friend of mine who sells these, and you will see better results!f mine who sells these, and you will see better results!</li>
            <li> As a distributor I originally signed up because I loved the body wraps, but it took me a while to warm up to the other products. The Defining Gel is the same formula as the wraps, but a lower potency for daily use. You are not going to lose weight using this gel (the wraps aren&#x27;t a weight loss tool either, they are a contouring tool). It is to help tighten the surface of the skin and reduce the appearance of cellulite. I found that when I started using it daily I didn&#x27;t see any changes for at least a week, but by then I noticed my legs felt incredibly soft and the smaller stretch marks on my stomach from pregnancy were very hard to distinguish. As I tell everyone, if you are skeptical, look up the ingredients. They are proven in the holistic community and aren&#x27;t anything new, just a combination made into a gel to deliver great results. Best to use with the wraps or on areas that are harder to wrap, such as the upper arms and butt. You can also get this for a lower price as a loyal customer with our free wholesale program. Loyal customers earn free shipping after their 3rd month, 10% perks points they can redeem after their 4th month, a $50 credit at six months, and a $150 credit at 12 months. It is so worth it~ Learn more at my website: [...]</li>
            <li> The Defining Gel is an awesome product. Itvs great for dey skin, exzema, sun burns, smooth skin and reduce cellulite and many more.  However, Selling It Works! via Amazon is illegal. Products should only be purchased from a actual Distributor for It Works! Global.  Plus you get better pricing, perks and your product will never be expired. Wrapslimandtight at gmail</li>
            <li> Made my skin very smooth but only slightly lightened my varicose veins. May try another bottle to see if longer use helps.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks ,, we will see of it really does what it claims to do</li>
            <li> You can get this product cheaper from a distributor! Please see www.body2soulwraps.myitworks.com! We have amazing products that really work. It will come straight from It Works so you will know that you are actually getting this product!</li>
            <li> I love the Defining Gel, BUT you must purchase It Works! products from an authorized distributor.  It Works! Global products are not allowed to be sold through Amazon per company directive.  Ask me how to purchase them, or simply visit SlenderwrapsUSA.</li>
            <li> Oh yes...this product is absolutely amazing.Yes at first I was a but skeptical with the much blubber I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years but my oh my it is making a difference in appearance.not too sure if I&#x27;ve lost weight but it&#x27;s in inches I can say I have...</li>
            <li> Waste of money! Did nothing! I used the entire box and did not notice anything. I am in good shape and work out 4-5 days a week. Was just looking for a little definition skin firming before a vacation. I did not notice anything. Save your cash$$$</li>
            <li> Love It Works products so much I became a distributor. This product is great for EVERYTHING. HOWEVER, retail is $45. Sign up is free, earn perk points for free products, and get free shipping after 3 months. Sign up at amandabringus.myitwork s .c om</li>
            <li> How many fl. Oz is this it doesn&#x27;t say????</li>
            <li> Okay I got the skinny pack on Monday November 4 (today being the fifth) I have used one wrap and the gel 4 times (1 Monday morning 1 Monday night 1 this morning and once more tonight) I haven&#x27;t used the wrap long enough to see large results but I have seen results with the gel already and so have some of my friends I just rub it on and it works like one of the places is below my chin and I can already see my face shaping better even after just 2 days I&#x27;m so excited to keep using this product to see my final results</li>
            <li> Selling these wraps on this website is forbidden and goes against company compliance.  Buyer beware of expired items.  If you want to be sure of what you are getting, order directly from an independent distributor who follows the compliance terms with It Works Global.</li>
            <li> This does not work as said.&lt;br /&gt;No result!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gel.  It smooths out my skin and tightens as well.  This works so much better than using regular lotion plus it has added benefits.  This is probably the only product in the It Works line that I use and love.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> The only thing that this firming gel does is dry and get hard on your skin, giving you a sensation of tighter skin; however, it does not reduce the appearance of inches at all.  You can by skin tightening creams at Wal-Mart that do the same thing for a cheaper price.  The herbal wraps are just as bad.  I spent over $500.00 on this entire treatment system; or should I say, threw away $500.00 with this treatment system.  You can jog for 30 minutes for three days, diet for three days, view yourself in the mirror first thing in the morning, and you will actually get results; but you won&#x27;t get results with this.</li>
            <li> It Works Defining Gel Is Amazing!! I have tried other ‚Äútightening‚Äù products from local drug stores and NOTHING compares to this! After having 4kiddos. I was bound to get stretch marks and loose skin! Not only have I lost inches with the it works defining gel but it has decreased the appearance of my stretch marks as well!! Amazing I love it!  GET IT FROM A DISTRIBUTOR!  LOYAL CUSTOMER PRICES ARE $45 ITS WORTH IT I USE IT EVERY DAY ! get your here @ https://thatcrazywrapthingitworkz.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing it most likely is to good to be true, and It is... It costs way to much money to offer nothing in return. No matter who you buy this from a rep for It works or just some seller here it&#x27;s all a hyped up lotion that does less than the bottle of jergens i paid $7.00 for at Walmart. Your skin wont get tighter the feeling you&#x27;re feeling is the Alcohol in it that makes it feel some what firm. Weight loss and other things you want to change about your body is done by hard work, and maybe some cocoa butter. Believe in yourself and dont feel like you need to waste money on a gimmick! If you feel hungry take a green tea tablet or drink tea, if you feel bored and want to eat go out and walk for a bit. If you feel like your skin is flabby tone up! This lotion is a scam that shouldn&#x27;t even cost $10.00 let alone $50.00. Good luck on your weight loss dreams, or your skin firming quest I just hope ive saved someone money they could use for some healthy foods!</li>

            <li> it works...this is why its good to get the wraps and the gel so that when you are not using the wrap you keep using the gel</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the gel and using the wraps and It Is working,Its no miraculous overnight thing but IT WORKS Really Works if you keep at it!!!! Before using this product I had no hope in fixing my post baby belly without  tummy tuck surgery but gave this a try and I am glad I did :) It is giving me back confidence in myself that I lost for so long giving me hope that I didn&#x27;t have before and that makes the price more than worth it,I&#x27;d rather spend a few hundred bucks on this product than a few thousand on surgery anyday!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing a must have!!!!! :) using together with the it works body wrap you see a difference tightens and tones as your working out having a healthy diet plan love love love try it or use this product with saran wrap also good as your working out you feel the burn anywhere u choose to place it.....</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work waste of money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite products to use. Cheaper at www.wrap-with-it.com Only 45$&lt;br /&gt;Works as described if it isn&#x27;t expired... ItWorks global haa a policy against selling on Amazon to make sure you aren&#x27;t getting old product.</li>
            <li> did not work!! tried it based on the directions and was very diligent in my application of it. I love products and am very blunt hopefully this review saves you some money.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work.... not even with the wraps. Best bet is just to work harder at the gym and not mess with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is being sold illegally. It Works Distributors are prohibited from selling products or advertising on Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, etc. If you purchase an It Works product from this site you are not guaranteeing the product. These products are botanically based, meaning they are made from naturally occurring botanicals in our environment and that gives them a shelf life. You have no idea if these are any good and ordering from a distributor allows you to gain product credit points, customer service, and you save money, or make money for yourself as a distributor! The prices they are asking for their products are more than what you&#x27;d pay going through the actual company and being a loyal customer or distributor. I rated the item 5 stars because it is a 5 star item if purchased through an It Works Independent Distributor. If you want more information, please visit my link, [...] :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for a few weeks. I am pleased with my results. As with anything.. If you want results... You have to use the product. I apply this every evening after my shower.. My skin feels tighter, is hydrated and has a smoother texture. I love this stuff. I will continue to use it. I especially have trouble with cellulite on my thighs.. This gel has firmed my skin so the cellulite is less noticeable. However I have found it cheaper at http://wrappingforward.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> If you are interested in this product contact an &amp;#34;It Works&amp;#34; Distributor in your area. As the name says...It works great but you can get it a lot cheaper and be assured you are getting a fresh product if you buy it through the appropriate channels, this is all natural and DOES expire. I am a huge amazon shopper which is why I happened upon this, but in this case I would be scared to order this product.</li>
            <li> All I can says is it really works.</li>
            <li> These products rock!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying from the same lady for a while and she rocks and is beyond helpful.&lt;br /&gt;You should only buy these items from an actual It Works distributor.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know one,  my girls site and info is at Prettylittlewraps.com</li>
            <li> it does not work and is a waste of money! I used as directed and NO RESULTS! do not buy</li>
            <li> Well my friend sells it works. one thing did not know can use the Defining Gel as a wrap. YES a Wrap on defining gel on belly then apply plastic wrap around it. Wear up 45 minutes and longer . way more cheaper then wrap gives great results in two dys i lost 3 inches of my waist. Hopefully works on yall. just give it a try.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to use product consistently to get honest results on how well it works. I like the It Works! wraps though.</li>
            <li> These are awesome products! The wraps really help to tighten and tone any every area of your body! Sign up as a loyal customer and you can get this for $45!  Www.healthylivingwithkc.com</li>
            <li> Used for 3 weeks morning and night. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference on eyebrow tattoo.</li>
            <li> BIG!!!!! Waste of my money. This don&#x27;t work at all. If you want the perfect skin after having a baby. This will not fix it. Didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Lose inches, no. But hydrate your skin and have your skin feel and look better, yes.  I slathered it on my mid section, wrapped it in Saran Wrap and an ace bandage to make sure it stayed in place and slept with it through the night.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money.  Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this gel. I saw/felt a difference after the first use. I use it every night &amp; wrap the area with saram wrap. This is a life saver!!!! Highly Recommend! :)</li>
            <li> Great $ for this product. Only thing is once you start using it you have to keep using it to keep the results you get.</li>
            <li> It is against compliance for It Works products to be sold anywhere but through a distributor. This ensures you are receiving the highest quality product and it also gives you a live person to refer to for directions, expectations, concerns, and questions. Plus, when you purchase through a distributor you earn free product and free shipping (my dad just earned $100 in free product after being a customer for 7 months). Check out my website...I&#x27;d love to help you purchase this It Works product and many more! www.stlwrap.com 618-744-9993</li>
            <li> It was a good moisturizer, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my stretchmarks, cellulite or vericose veins and I used it everyday twice a day. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a temporary fix but great product though</li>
            <li> Make sure you continue to use this product to get the best results but you will see a difference wherever you use it!!</li>
            <li> These are great to use in between wraps! Or simply use it for varicose veins, cellulite  and scars anywhere on the body. But please, contact a distributor for these products ! These could be expired! If you sign up with a distributor you can get these 45% - 55% off.&lt;br /&gt;Rachaelg.myitworks.com</li>
            <li> I received the product very quickly!  It is exactly what I was looking for.  I love it and will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product along with the wraps in hopes of looking nicer. I am 5&#x27; 4&#x27;&#x27; and weigh around 113 but I don&#x27;t have a flat stomach (it sticks out some) and I have stretch marks. Unfortunately, I tried the wraps 3 times and there was no difference but I was using the gel on and off for a month before I realized looking back at pictures it really works!! My belly button has two scars above it from being pierced and then becoming pregnant. I have about 3 deep scars on my stomach but after using the cream, those scars went down to looking smooth and all my stretch marks have faded drastically!! After that happened, I started rubbing the cream on my breast to minimize the stretch marks and to my dismay it actually lifted my areolas and faded my stretch marks. I&#x27;m not even exaggerating. And it might be a little TMI but isn&#x27;t this what all girls would love to happen after having children??!! My husband even noticed it. Now I use this product on my whole body and love the results!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this defining gel for about 1 week now. This gel has been absolutely amazing. I have used it on this dark spot on my chest Which I&#x27;ve had for years the spot has went from a dark purple to a very light pink. I am incredibly pleased with the results so far and will continue to use it. I also use it on my tattoos it brought the color back to life, far more vibrant. I have just a couple stretchmarks from pregnancy only a few but enough to bother me and I have noticed a significant difference in them as well I can barely notice them Now. Once again this has only been about a week. This stuff really works and I plan to start using it on my face next!!! I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase off Amazon or not though... only because I heard that after a certain period of time it goes bad. Highly recommended product though!!!!</li>
            <li> This company seems to have enlisted an extreme number of low income people that are willing to scam their friends for money. All of the five star reviews are people who were hired to as salesman. Its like Mary Kay for product that don&#x27;t do what they say they do. But I suppose it&#x27;s true that marketing is all that you need to sell a product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my tattoo or other parts of my skin that I used this product on 2x/day until the bottle was gone. Just some very expensive lotion.</li>
            <li> If you are loving this product, find a distributor to ensure that your product is fresh, and try some of the other amazing products. check out the website [...]</li>
            <li> This is a great product I did not notice anything until after 2 weeks or so but i have noticed its firmed my skin i apply it on my stomach, breasts, and legs and its amazing its even made scars fade away. I love it and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the Defining Gel...it works wonders...you can order it at Tracyoh.myitworks.com!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love the IT WORKS PRODUCTS!! They really do work!!</li>
