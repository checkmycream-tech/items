            <li> I was replacing the Rubis that I have had for12 years and loved.  This one is made just like the one I had,but it is not good.  The tweezer blades do not line up, they are not even,and they are hard to squeeze to make them pull any hair out.&lt;br /&gt;To say the least I am very disapointed with the purchase.  I have not sent the tweezers back because it will be shipping a cost&lt;br /&gt;and I feel I have wasted enough money/.</li>
            <li> Good price and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> These are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I work with lumber and these will get out the smallest of splinters. They are worth the money and will last a life time.</li>
            <li> Weren&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Perfect for splinters or other &amp;#34;hard to grip in tight spaces&amp;#34; jobs.  Workmanship and materials were top drawer.  It would be nice to have a sturdier case for it, other than the plastic &amp;#34;bubble pack&amp;#34; it came in.</li>
            <li> Rubis manufacturers the best tweezers in the world.  Thin, sharp, precise and exact.  They do not rust, chip or blunt.  They last forever, and I only have to replace them when I lose them!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift and I have decided to purchase another one for myself.  The best tweezers ever!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best pair of tweezers I have ever bought!  They will grab the tiniest hair ever and are good for crafts.</li>
            <li> Best tweezer I have found, ever!  You can definitely target fine hair &amp; also the more difficult ones with this tool.  This purchase serves as back up so I can send the one I&#x27;ve been using for 2 years (identical to this) back to Rubis for sharpening.  I use it every day.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a good pair of tweezers.  3 stars because out of 5 pair, only 3 good ones.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best tweezers I have ever owned. Extra pointy tip is great for getting the one stubborn hair without accidentally pulling out half your eyebrow, They also work really well extracting in-grown hairs.</li>

            <li> These tweezers would have to be the best I have ever owned. They are made of quality steel and the craftsmanship is visibly perfect. I would definitely recommend these for those curly ingrown/s. I love them!</li>
            <li> When you buy these tweezers you sometimes get one that works great, just like you want but then there is other times you buy them and you get one that don&#x27;t get the little hairs. This is one that did not get the little hairs.</li>
            <li> Very good, easy to pinpoint the hair, great grabbing, very sharp edges and point. Just needs enough pressure to work properly. The best tweezer I have found yet! Great for splinters too!</li>
            <li> I always buy this brand of tweezers and always highly recommend them. I just picked the wrong type for what I was looking for. These are great for precision. I&#x27;m not sure what for in particular, perhaps slivers? In any case, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brand, just make sure you pick the right tips. I ordered another pair of slanted tip (not twin tip).</li>
