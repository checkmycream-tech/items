            <li>Very good and caring customer service.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>but I was happy to save a lot of money by buying this brand.</li>
            <li>Definitely a GREAT buy</li>
            <li>It has a great smell.</li>
            <li>and my skin is doing great.  </li>
            <li>The benefits of this oil are really great and can be used on almost all skin conditions to help balance and restore the skin&#x27;s acid mantle.</li>
            <li>I put the rosehip oil in my skin cream and argon oil in conditioners and skin cream, both with great results.</li>
            <li>Both work great.</li>
            <li>As for the bonus they’re offering, everybody knows that argan oil is a great moisturizer for face</li>
            <li>In one word, just “GREAT”</li>
            <li>The argon oil is a great &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product...</li>
            <li>Since Roseship is also beneficial for acne, its a win win situation.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s feeling happy since she is using it</li>
            <li>I use this with my shampoo with great results</li>
            <li>just had to review and Rave about how great</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>It smells great and feels great going on.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great products but bottles are plastic, not glass.</li>
            <li>but I would imagine it would be great after swimming too.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for frizzy hair or any kind of hair</li>
            <li>This Organic Rosehip Oil and Argon Oil is PHENOMENAL!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these oils!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very effective....</li>
            <li>Very nice stuff, but wish the oil came with a dropper instead of a push pump.</li>
            <li>The argan oil is so amazing for quenching thirsty hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil every night before I go to bed and the difference is amazing!</li>

            <li>Nice bonus!</li>
            <li>This stuff works nicely to even out my skin tone!</li>

            <li>The Argan oil is a nice bonus!</li>
            <li>I am loving this!</li>
            <li>Great to get two fantastic oils (Rosehip Oil and Argan Oil) that I have found to be perfect for moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>, it has a very pleasant light scent, and makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li>I have a beautiful rose hip bush but was wondering how I was going to make oil out of it.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent that doesn&#x27;t compete with my shampoo scent and absorbs wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good value...</li>
            <li>I also loved the bonus bottle of Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I like this, smells good, and can&#x27;t wait to see results in months to come.  </li>
            <li>I especially love that it came with a bottle of argan oil for free</li>
            <li>The moisturizer I used was good</li>
            <li>but now I don’t feel like using something else than my beloved rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>and I almost forgot loved that I got a bottle of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>it is a must for gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li>Now I have good evidence to be patient and see what else this oil will do for me.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>The oil inside though seems to be of a good quality though.</li>
            <li>This Rose Hip Oil does a great job of moisturizing, without causing my face to become greasy looking.  </li>
            <li>i can get good use of argan oil since it is still winter.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering and it works beautifully :)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really great since most moisturizers haven&#x27;t worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very light and non-greasy!</li>
            <li>The very nice feeling offered is also combined with a great moisturizing feeling – it is a really great moisturizer – and with 2 – 3 drops for every part of your body, you will feel NEW!  </li>
            <li>It is awesome that you get both of these great natural oils in one package.</li>

            <li>in all just loving the combo and one of the best and worth oil combo in a long time, worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I also absolutely love the argan oil as it has been awesome to tame my mid-summer hair frizzies.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of cosmetic products and oils as well but most of them were full of ingredients that I have never heard of and had nothing to do with repairing the damaged skin or acne and rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have done some research on benefits of the oil and have found most all of them to be true with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the big bottle that this rose oil comes in, and the pump!</li>
            <li>my face is fine.</li>
            <li>Makes it even better and safer for me to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li>They are also nice to have on hand to make homemade beauty and bath products (I recently made lovely shea butter bath melts that included Rosehip and Argan oil!).</li>
            <li>No unpleasant smell from either one!  </li>
            <li>and this made it feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s important you exfoliate weekly to help move any build-up.</li>
            <li>I am using it primarily on my stretch marks and a scar.</li>
            <li>The Rosehip oil is light and smooth- does not leave an oily residue at all.</li>
            <li>The next day the size of  the burn was greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>This oil has been great for my skin, and I can see a visible difference even after using it for a short time.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>love this product well worth the money its a must try</li>
            <li>The bonus Argon oil was great too, and I used a tiny bit as a hair smoother.  </li>
            <li>I apply the leftovers to my hands and nails and sometimes smooth the ends of my hair with it.</li>
            <li>Above all this is a great oil for me.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face, hands, elbows and heels and can definitely see great results.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell great, and you do not need much at all - it really is doing wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>I was glad for the good price plus the extra gift, Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>coming to icing on top, the argan oil, you get a whole 1oz for free!</li>
            <li>It is plain and simply awesome and the Argan oil is a bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this is right for me.</li>
            <li>The great natural and organic ingredients were the reason I have bought this oil at first</li>
            <li>Very light fragrance, which I also love, and it leaves my skin silky and soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reason for 2 stars is just that first, the Rosehip oil pump top hasn&#x27;t worked since it arrived...</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>So excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>As a woman in her final trimester of pregnancy, I am loving this Organic Rosehip oil!</li>
            <li>I have had no issues, and my skin has only gotten better and better!</li>
            <li>I love that there are no fillers and no scent, so you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited about these.</li>
            <li>One thing is for sure: it is really organic and it is a miracle for your body!</li>
            <li>The free bonus of 1 ounce Pure Argan Oil has always been a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so versatile, and I love that it&#x27;s a healthy, natural product.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been pleased and will look for more of this BeautyBe brand.</li>
            <li>This has been great for my dry skin areas.</li>
            <li>Now, I have one more evidence to add, my husband had some kind of skin problem on his left ear.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found organic rosehip oil in a large amount.  </li>
            <li>So pleased that the Rosehip Oil is 100% pure, unrefined and comes in a generous 4 ounce bottle with a pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li>This oil is great for very dry skin, and can be used anywhere.</li>
            <li>The fine lines and wrinkles seem to be disappearing right before my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Skin in all areas are nice and soft and I feel the look of the areas are improving.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something all natural, without a million ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li>With my sensitive skin I had like really lots of problems with this kind of products for skin and face, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for.a natural method to taking care of my skin, and I read about the moisturizing and anti-aging effects of rose hip oil, so</li>
            <li>The Argan oil is a bit more oily, so I&#x27;d recommend it if you need intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated being able to compare both the Rosehip and Argan Oil side by side.</li>
            <li>The rosehip oil is so light and absorbed immediately into my skin without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>It arrived fast and I even had follow up emails making sure I was taking care of.</li>
            <li>stuff is great, little to no smell, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I started noticing a significant reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes within the first month.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve never used Rose Hip Oil before, you should know there is a slight scent, it kind of reminds me of a squash like smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a pure and effective product to help users get glowing skin and many more other benefits.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It has little smell which is great for me as I am very sensitive to smells and wount be able to put on my face if there was a strong odor.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The oils go into the skin quickly and skin feels re-moisturized immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have been rubbing it into my hands and nails and they have thanked me tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I even felt that I had a mild allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I had a mild redness and itchiness on my face</li>
            <li>sure if that&#x27;s normal but won&#x27;t order this brand from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed skin esthetician and I cannot tell you enough how much I love this product!</li>
            <li>States\\&quot; \\&quot;We are very excited to introduce our new product &#x60;Organic Rosehip Oil&#x27; for customers across the globe.</li>
            <li>I have noticed not only is it helping with my EXTREMELY dry skin , but my hair feels great!  </li>
            <li>My bottle leaked a little in shipment and that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars, but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li>This would actually be an amazing oil for a neck or back massage.</li>
            <li>It soaks in great and never feels greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I use a few drops of this oil after washing my face and feel great the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neither oil has a scent which is nice because it will not overpower any of the essential oils I use in my lotions.</li>
            <li>I love using organic products and this oil is completely organic.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many things that never seem to completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and makes the foundation apply better.</li>
            <li>but so far I am enjoying how it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>I used this argan oil for my curly hair and it left it so shiny and manageable, The rose hip seed oil</li>
            <li>I have never used rose hip oil until now , but I will definitely be continuing with the use of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a product like this that leaves my skin so soft and my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li>I love how much it has helped my normally dry/brittle hair!</li>
            <li>is right up there with the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am heading back to buy more of both right now!</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night, it is not greasy or oily on my skin, it absorbs right in.</li>
            <li>I use this right after I wash and brush my hair.  </li>
            <li>Of all the treatments I&#x27;ve tried for my dry winter chapped skin, this is my FAVORITE!</li>
            <li>It is a great value as far as the large bottle plus the smaller &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; one.  </li>
            <li>I also take a few more drops and run it through my hair and it really smooths my hair out nicely.</li>
            <li>Great organic products with no overwhelming scent and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>What an amazing Product, I have been using this on my Stretch marks, a my Scars for an auto accident , I do have to say my Skin looks so much smoother and Feels baby Soft, even my Dry hands are feels and healing I absolutely Love this Product, and smell Fresh &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  This product was received for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review</li>
            <li>, the argan oil was a HUGE bonus because I was out of it and cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>I like that this also comes with a bonus of argan oil (isn&#x27;t argan oil so hot right now?).  </li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t want to look younger, feel younger and feel great...</li>
            <li>There is marked improvement and he appreciates the lack of a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Can be used on dry patches on skin too, but i am totally loving it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is 100% pure, no artificial ingredients,</li>
            <li>The four ounce bottle of Rosehip oil is a good value as a little goes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy oil and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I get that relatively frequently, but the surprise on their faces was more than I normally get.</li>
            <li>I have used many brands and this one is not the proper color, smell or texture.</li>
            <li>skin feels smooth, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Will post more later.</li>
            <li>It seems counter intuitive to put oil on an oily face, but it is looking so much nicer!</li>
            <li>I love how my skin simply soaks up the oil</li>
            <li>My hair REALLY loves it!</li>
            <li>It does feel greasy at first but as soon as it dries the greasiness is gone.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin simply soaks up the oil</li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin feels the next morning.</li>
            <li>First this product is affordable and came with argan oil that I have heard a lot about as well.</li>
            <li>that i know exactly what i am putting on my body.</li>
            <li>is my first experience with RoseHip oil  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied it on my face</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I used to get rosehip oils from others, and it is my first buy from this seller.  </li>
            <li>First, the pump was not working at all.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product with a wide variety of uses!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about natural remedies and natural ways to keep my skin looking refreshed and healthy</li>
            <li>Just make sure to let it dry out first if you are going to use the oil on your feet.</li>
            <li>Light yellow color, smells and tastes just like my favorite olive oil sending back.</li>
            <li>but I am happy with how soft my skin and hair have gotten in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>It smells nice (not overwhealming), makes dry hands and feet very soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried other argan oils and they all have a very strong perfume that turned me off..</li>
            <li>Love this oil, I use it to help combat the dry patches of skin I tend to get during the winter months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have super sensitive skin, and I can use almost nothing on the market these days.</li>
            <li>large oil stains on the box.</li>
            <li>My pump does not work and I do not believe that this is pure rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is 100% PURE USDA Certified Organic, no parabens, fragrances, colorants, alcohol, preservatives and animal ingredients.</li>
            <li>Organic, pure, and cold-pressed.  </li>
            <li>This Rosehip Seed Oil is 100% pure USDA Certified Organic and in case you don&#x27;t already know (like you&#x27;ve been living under a rock or something)</li>
            <li>The bottle is a good size bottle, and I think it is going to last a long time!  </li>
            <li>This is a decent size bottle and is exactly as promised in the review.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge, I feel like it will last forever.</li>
            <li>This one is very liquid.</li>
            <li>I put on the ends of my hair - it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>It being organic and cold pressed makes it the best option for myself.</li>
            <li>This works on the cellular level and really absorbs well into my skin.</li>
            <li>Her breakouts are not 100% gone, but drastically reduced and the skin around the breakouts looks SO much nicer and is so much nicer to the touch.  </li>
            <li>While oily, congested skin will really benefit from using rosehip oil (the vitamin A helps aid cell turnover)</li>
            <li>Think I will start getting my legs ready for Spring and use it on them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Really like this duo.</li>
            <li>But the real star of the show is the Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>The real test, however, were surgical scars from five months ago that still looked nastier than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at the difference.  </li>
            <li>was having a real problem with cracking drying nails.</li>
            <li>I bought rosehip oil before from Whole Foods and this is no where close to that product in color nor consistency.</li>
            <li>This makes for a quality product that you can be comfortable applying daily!</li>
            <li>The oil is lightweight but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have also mixed it with my hair moisturizer and it keeps my hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to use it for</li>
            <li>Very greasy, caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>Item arrived as describe with fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Smelled fabulous I would definitely</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>but nothing really works.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t dispense too much at a time</li>
            <li>Two stars for the fast delivery and additional Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>I really like the design of the bottle</li>
            <li>I loved the bottle of Organic Rosehip Oil, it was much larger than I had expected.</li>
            <li>I used my regular amount of shampoo and I was able to completely skip the conditioner when used in my hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE how soft it makes my face feel and after just a week of use daily</li>
            <li>I have a few blemishes on my face that I was told rose hip oil will work for.</li>
            <li>However, it does not last long and the effects of the oil are amazing.</li>
            <li>The 30 ml argan oil given as a bonus is really great for face and neck and is also small enough to take it with you when you’re away from home.</li>
            <li>Very little is needed, which is nice for longevity.</li>
            <li>It soothes extremely dry skin, absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling super hydrated, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>It has also left my skin looking younger and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>It is a much bigger bottle than most on the market for the same price.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product that could handle the changing texture and oil producing in my skin as I am getting older.</li>
            <li>You can use this product in so many ways that you can actually skip buying extra moisturizer and hand creams.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really hard not to love this Organic Rosehip Seed Oil by BeautyBe!  </li>
            <li>Risk free to try as there is a full refund if not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I did not give it a high marking is because the pump that comes with the Rosehip oil does not work.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>then I highly recommend you use this oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>I intend to continue using this and highly recommend to anyone wanting healthier looking skin.  </li>
            <li>WOW this is my first time trying Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, and I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Then he mentioned Rose Hip Oil is just as good and less expensive.</li>
            <li>Just a little goes a long way, also good for hair.</li>
            <li>I use this on my hair and it really helps to leave it feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far</li>
            <li>This was the first product she tried that she was willing to use on a regular basis because it didn&#x27;t hurt her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I put it on my arms every day, under my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li>Couldn’t believe that ROSEHIP will change my skin from damaged to normal, but I said let’s try this also.</li>
            <li>I haven’t noticed much change for the first two times, but now I am starting to feel my skin smoother.</li>
            <li>Then I apply my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>had a slight difficulty using the pump on the bottle of Argan Oil at first, but just be sure to turn the lid to the left, so that it screws on all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so when I wake up in the morning my skin feels nourished, super soft and that feeling lasts well into the next day.  </li>
            <li>like to use my Rosehip Seed Oil by BeautyBe as an all over moisturizer right when I get out of the shower, especially at night</li>
            <li>Following Dr. Oz &#x27;s tip, I apply Rosehip oil right after my shower while my skin is still moist.  </li>
            <li>The added benefit of that is the cold oil feels really good!</li>
            <li>This is a new go to product for me.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to have taken on a new life as well with the rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>, I have been putting that oil on my cuticles several times a day and it has made such a huge difference in the appearance of my cuticles &amp; nails.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is fantastic and I would recommend adding it to your daily beauty regime!</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin</li>
            <li>used this on stretch marks and even though I haven&#x27;t used it long enough it has left them very moisturized and am sure i will see a difference soon</li>
            <li>Organic rosehip leaves your skin very soft</li>
            <li>These oils are truly organic and can be used even on very sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin feeling very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Argan oil on my hair, which makes it feel very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My daughter LOVES the Argan oil for her newly forming stretch marks (she is in her second trimester of her first pregnancy).</li>
            <li>I’ve tried the rosehip oil for only two weeks and the first impression was that it didn’t affect my very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My skin and hair is so soft and touchable!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I use this on my face, less fine lines.</li>
            <li>And I got the exact color from my first buy through other seller.  </li>
            <li>My dark spots are fading a bit, and I expect that it will only get better.</li>
            <li>This particular oil I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients.</li>
            <li>The oil feels a little strange on your face at first, but when you wake up your face feels normal and smooth.</li>
            <li>At first I thought my pump was broken as it took a few tries to get it primed and working, but it has been perfect since then.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>For an organic product, the price is fantastic and it is cold pressed which makes it that much better quality.  </li>
            <li>the bottle is clear plastic...</li>
            <li>Just yesterday, I had two people on separate occasions be completely baffled by my age.</li>
            <li>And since I am sensitive to scents this makes it nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually thought the Aragon oil was much smoother and silkier on my skin.</li>
            <li>Which I was surprised about since I know nothing about that</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it on my face and hair so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so moisturized and so soft.</li>
            <li>I am a essential oil user and I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day, and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>This rosehip serum makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>If you would like an all natural product to help with anti-aging, sun damaged skin and help with scars</li>
            <li>I gave this oil to my breakout prone 11 year old.  </li>
            <li>and she found a marked difference in her skin as well.  </li>
            <li>Also, no harsh scents.</li>
            <li>This product is not messy at all.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my hands in an effort to keep them looking young.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a NATURAL product to help people with skin problems.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so soft in the mornings when I wake up.</li>
            <li>it makes it so shiny and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>it made my skin silky soft but not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>I would not reorder this unless this was fixed.</li>
            <li>Trying this on an old scar and have noticed some improvement.  </li>
            <li>After just a few days my skin is no longer red and it feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>I will update my review later after I&#x27;ve been using this for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Only had these a few days but can say I love them.</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied with my results after using this product for only a few days.  </li>
            <li>I had not bought argan oil in sometime because it is expensive but this deal was too good..</li>
            <li>I already have dry skin and winter&#x27;s crisp windy air does not help my situation.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY reasons I&#x27;d not purchase again is due to the a smell and my preference to Argan Oil (which is FABULOUS).</li>
            <li>It has a pump so no mess at all.</li>
            <li>the loose part of the pump got lost in the rosehip bottle upon first use.</li>
            <li>The jar is a decent size (4oz) and should last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in the amount of sun spots, scars (of which I have a few after my 50 years on this planet!), and skin tone on my arms.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer after because my skin is healthier and not as dry.  </li>
            <li>but you can barely see them!</li>
            <li>The rosehip oil is like no other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used before...</li>
            <li>Absolutely no smell and its pure and organic.</li>
            <li>or it is something else because rosehip oil is supposed to be a deep rich, amber color or a dark yellow.</li>
            <li>The argan oil is a little heavier but still absorbed immediately into my skin with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a very generous size,and will last me a really long time.</li>
            <li>Almost clear color on the white paper test.  </li>
            <li>I personally use it on my hand and it makes them feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I did give the seller 5 stars, but the truth is the pumps apparently are defective that they are putting their product in.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a safe, natural, and effective product to use on my horrible stretch marks since giving birth to twins.  </li>
            <li>Yet Rose oil is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li>The Argan oil kid was loose and leaked all over making a huge mess.</li>
            <li>I normally have dry lips all my life.</li>
            <li>If you read up on both of them, you will find out how much these natural oils can help in everyday life.  </li>
            <li>When I first put this on I was a little concerned because it felt oily.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re now turning white and becoming less and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>My face is raw from meds right now</li>
            <li>I started using the rosehip oil, and argon oil on my trouble spots (my heels and finger tips) at first</li>
            <li>I have previously used Argon once before and did not care for it too much.</li>
            <li>It has helped my dry, scaly skin become soft again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much softer and much less frizzy.</li>
            <li>The oil makes my face feel so soft and gets rid of that itchy dry feeling.  </li>
            <li>I find that it absorbs really well and is great to use as a base for other essential oils in a roll-on bottle.  </li>
            <li>This feels much less greasy then some other natural oils so for having combination skin it really works well for me.</li>

            <li> Argan oil is also a wonderful way to moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s great news!</li>
            <li> and I can see wonderful results, but every reshape oil I buy would be of 1oz</li>

            <li> Very good and caring customer service.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible.</li>
            <li> but it smells good!</li>
            <li> However, this Argan had a beautiful aromatic scent to it.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> but I was happy to save a lot of money by buying this brand.</li>
            <li> Definitely a GREAT buy</li>
            <li> It has a great smell.</li>
            <li> and my skin is doing great.  </li>
            <li> The benefits of this oil are really great and can be used on almost all skin conditions to help balance and restore the skin&#x27;s acid mantle.</li>
            <li> I put the rosehip oil in my skin cream and argon oil in conditioners and skin cream, both with great results.</li>
            <li> Both work great.</li>
            <li> As for the bonus they’re offering, everybody knows that argan oil is a great moisturizer for face</li>
            <li> In one word, just “GREAT”</li>
            <li> The argon oil is a great &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product...</li>
            <li> Since Roseship is also beneficial for acne, its a win win situation.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s feeling happy since she is using it</li>
            <li> I use this with my shampoo with great results</li>
            <li> just had to review and Rave about how great</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It smells great and feels great going on.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Great products but bottles are plastic, not glass.</li>
            <li> but I would imagine it would be great after swimming too.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for frizzy hair or any kind of hair</li>
            <li> This Organic Rosehip Oil and Argon Oil is PHENOMENAL!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these oils!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very effective....</li>
            <li> Very nice stuff, but wish the oil came with a dropper instead of a push pump.</li>
            <li> The argan oil is so amazing for quenching thirsty hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil every night before I go to bed and the difference is amazing!</li>
            <li> These oils are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> Nice bonus!</li>
            <li> This stuff works nicely to even out my skin tone!</li>
            <li> So nice to get the bonus Argan Oil as well!</li>
            <li> The Argan oil is a nice bonus!</li>
            <li> I am loving this!</li>
            <li> Great to get two fantastic oils (Rosehip Oil and Argan Oil) that I have found to be perfect for moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li> , it has a very pleasant light scent, and makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> I have a beautiful rose hip bush but was wondering how I was going to make oil out of it.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent that doesn&#x27;t compete with my shampoo scent and absorbs wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good value...</li>
            <li> I also loved the bonus bottle of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I like this, smells good, and can&#x27;t wait to see results in months to come.  </li>
            <li> I especially love that it came with a bottle of argan oil for free</li>
            <li> The moisturizer I used was good</li>
            <li> but now I don’t feel like using something else than my beloved rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> and I almost forgot loved that I got a bottle of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> it is a must for gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li> Now I have good evidence to be patient and see what else this oil will do for me.</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> The oil inside though seems to be of a good quality though.</li>
            <li> This Rose Hip Oil does a great job of moisturizing, without causing my face to become greasy looking.  </li>
            <li> i can get good use of argan oil since it is still winter.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering and it works beautifully :)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really great since most moisturizers haven&#x27;t worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very light and non-greasy!</li>
            <li> The very nice feeling offered is also combined with a great moisturizing feeling – it is a really great moisturizer – and with 2 – 3 drops for every part of your body, you will feel NEW!  </li>
            <li> It is awesome that you get both of these great natural oils in one package.</li>
            <li> What an INCREDIBLE value for two such completely wonderful products!</li>

            <li> My skin is really good to begin with, but now I am noticing that it is appearing even younger, and more supple!</li>
            <li> Easy to use pump rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> The pump works well and makes application easy.</li>
            <li> This works great on my hair, I actually like it better than conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> , there is an easy to use eye dropper</li>
            <li> The benefits of rosehip oil is exceptional and this is really doing wonders to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I apply this at knight and morning good stuff will highly recommended to friends and family and buyers to use this product</li>
            <li> in all just loving the combo and one of the best and worth oil combo in a long time, worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I also absolutely love the argan oil as it has been awesome to tame my mid-summer hair frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of cosmetic products and oils as well but most of them were full of ingredients that I have never heard of and had nothing to do with repairing the damaged skin or acne and rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have done some research on benefits of the oil and have found most all of them to be true with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the big bottle that this rose oil comes in, and the pump!</li>
            <li> my face is fine.</li>
            <li> Makes it even better and safer for me to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li> They are also nice to have on hand to make homemade beauty and bath products (I recently made lovely shea butter bath melts that included Rosehip and Argan oil!).</li>
            <li> No unpleasant smell from either one!  </li>
            <li> and this made it feel comfortable.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s important you exfoliate weekly to help move any build-up.</li>
            <li> I am using it primarily on my stretch marks and a scar.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil is light and smooth- does not leave an oily residue at all.</li>
            <li> The next day the size of  the burn was greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> This oil has been great for my skin, and I can see a visible difference even after using it for a short time.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> love this product well worth the money its a must try</li>
            <li> The bonus Argon oil was great too, and I used a tiny bit as a hair smoother.  </li>
            <li> I apply the leftovers to my hands and nails and sometimes smooth the ends of my hair with it.</li>
            <li> Above all this is a great oil for me.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my face, hands, elbows and heels and can definitely see great results.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell great, and you do not need much at all - it really is doing wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was glad for the good price plus the extra gift, Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> coming to icing on top, the argan oil, you get a whole 1oz for free!</li>
            <li> It is plain and simply awesome and the Argan oil is a bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this is right for me.</li>
            <li> The great natural and organic ingredients were the reason I have bought this oil at first</li>
            <li> Very light fragrance, which I also love, and it leaves my skin silky and soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reason for 2 stars is just that first, the Rosehip oil pump top hasn&#x27;t worked since it arrived...</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> So excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> As a woman in her final trimester of pregnancy, I am loving this Organic Rosehip oil!</li>
            <li> I have had no issues, and my skin has only gotten better and better!</li>
            <li> I love that there are no fillers and no scent, so you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited about these.</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure: it is really organic and it is a miracle for your body!</li>
            <li> The free bonus of 1 ounce Pure Argan Oil has always been a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so versatile, and I love that it&#x27;s a healthy, natural product.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been pleased and will look for more of this BeautyBe brand.</li>
            <li> This has been great for my dry skin areas.</li>
            <li> Now, I have one more evidence to add, my husband had some kind of skin problem on his left ear.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found organic rosehip oil in a large amount.  </li>
            <li> So pleased that the Rosehip Oil is 100% pure, unrefined and comes in a generous 4 ounce bottle with a pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li> This oil is great for very dry skin, and can be used anywhere.</li>
            <li> The fine lines and wrinkles seem to be disappearing right before my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Skin in all areas are nice and soft and I feel the look of the areas are improving.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have something all natural, without a million ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin I had like really lots of problems with this kind of products for skin and face, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for.a natural method to taking care of my skin, and I read about the moisturizing and anti-aging effects of rose hip oil, so</li>
            <li> The Argan oil is a bit more oily, so I&#x27;d recommend it if you need intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated being able to compare both the Rosehip and Argan Oil side by side.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil is so light and absorbed immediately into my skin without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> It arrived fast and I even had follow up emails making sure I was taking care of.</li>
            <li> stuff is great, little to no smell, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I started noticing a significant reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes within the first month.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve never used Rose Hip Oil before, you should know there is a slight scent, it kind of reminds me of a squash like smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a pure and effective product to help users get glowing skin and many more other benefits.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It has little smell which is great for me as I am very sensitive to smells and wount be able to put on my face if there was a strong odor.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The oils go into the skin quickly and skin feels re-moisturized immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have been rubbing it into my hands and nails and they have thanked me tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I even felt that I had a mild allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I had a mild redness and itchiness on my face</li>
            <li> sure if that&#x27;s normal but won&#x27;t order this brand from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed skin esthetician and I cannot tell you enough how much I love this product!</li>
            <li> States\\&quot; \\&quot;We are very excited to introduce our new product &#x60;Organic Rosehip Oil&#x27; for customers across the globe.</li>
            <li> I have noticed not only is it helping with my EXTREMELY dry skin , but my hair feels great!  </li>
            <li> My bottle leaked a little in shipment and that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars, but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> This would actually be an amazing oil for a neck or back massage.</li>
            <li> It soaks in great and never feels greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this oil after washing my face and feel great the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neither oil has a scent which is nice because it will not overpower any of the essential oils I use in my lotions.</li>
            <li> I love using organic products and this oil is completely organic.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things that never seem to completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and makes the foundation apply better.</li>
            <li> but so far I am enjoying how it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> I used this argan oil for my curly hair and it left it so shiny and manageable, The rose hip seed oil</li>
            <li> I have never used rose hip oil until now , but I will definitely be continuing with the use of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a product like this that leaves my skin so soft and my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li> I love how much it has helped my normally dry/brittle hair!</li>
            <li> is right up there with the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am heading back to buy more of both right now!</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night, it is not greasy or oily on my skin, it absorbs right in.</li>
            <li> I use this right after I wash and brush my hair.  </li>
            <li> Of all the treatments I&#x27;ve tried for my dry winter chapped skin, this is my FAVORITE!</li>
            <li> It is a great value as far as the large bottle plus the smaller &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; one.  </li>
            <li> I also take a few more drops and run it through my hair and it really smooths my hair out nicely.</li>
            <li> Great organic products with no overwhelming scent and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> What an amazing Product, I have been using this on my Stretch marks, a my Scars for an auto accident , I do have to say my Skin looks so much smoother and Feels baby Soft, even my Dry hands are feels and healing I absolutely Love this Product, and smell Fresh &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  This product was received for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review</li>
            <li> , the argan oil was a HUGE bonus because I was out of it and cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li> I like that this also comes with a bonus of argan oil (isn&#x27;t argan oil so hot right now?).  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to look younger, feel younger and feel great...</li>
            <li> There is marked improvement and he appreciates the lack of a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Can be used on dry patches on skin too, but i am totally loving it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is 100% pure, no artificial ingredients,</li>
            <li> The four ounce bottle of Rosehip oil is a good value as a little goes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy oil and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I get that relatively frequently, but the surprise on their faces was more than I normally get.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands and this one is not the proper color, smell or texture.</li>
            <li> skin feels smooth, soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Will post more later.</li>
            <li> It seems counter intuitive to put oil on an oily face, but it is looking so much nicer!</li>
            <li> I love how my skin simply soaks up the oil</li>
            <li> My hair REALLY loves it!</li>
            <li> It does feel greasy at first but as soon as it dries the greasiness is gone.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin simply soaks up the oil</li>
            <li> and I love the way my skin feels the next morning.</li>
            <li> First this product is affordable and came with argan oil that I have heard a lot about as well.</li>
            <li> that i know exactly what i am putting on my body.</li>
            <li> is my first experience with RoseHip oil  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied it on my face</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I used to get rosehip oils from others, and it is my first buy from this seller.  </li>
            <li> First, the pump was not working at all.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product with a wide variety of uses!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about natural remedies and natural ways to keep my skin looking refreshed and healthy</li>
            <li> Just make sure to let it dry out first if you are going to use the oil on your feet.</li>
            <li> Light yellow color, smells and tastes just like my favorite olive oil sending back.</li>
            <li> but I am happy with how soft my skin and hair have gotten in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> It smells nice (not overwhealming), makes dry hands and feet very soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried other argan oils and they all have a very strong perfume that turned me off..</li>
            <li> Love this oil, I use it to help combat the dry patches of skin I tend to get during the winter months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have super sensitive skin, and I can use almost nothing on the market these days.</li>
            <li> large oil stains on the box.</li>
            <li> My pump does not work and I do not believe that this is pure rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is 100% PURE USDA Certified Organic, no parabens, fragrances, colorants, alcohol, preservatives and animal ingredients.</li>
            <li> Organic, pure, and cold-pressed.  </li>
            <li> This Rosehip Seed Oil is 100% pure USDA Certified Organic and in case you don&#x27;t already know (like you&#x27;ve been living under a rock or something)</li>
            <li> The bottle is a good size bottle, and I think it is going to last a long time!  </li>
            <li> This is a decent size bottle and is exactly as promised in the review.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge, I feel like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> This one is very liquid.</li>
            <li> I put on the ends of my hair - it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> It being organic and cold pressed makes it the best option for myself.</li>
            <li> This works on the cellular level and really absorbs well into my skin.</li>
            <li> Her breakouts are not 100% gone, but drastically reduced and the skin around the breakouts looks SO much nicer and is so much nicer to the touch.  </li>
            <li> While oily, congested skin will really benefit from using rosehip oil (the vitamin A helps aid cell turnover)</li>
            <li> Think I will start getting my legs ready for Spring and use it on them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Really like this duo.</li>
            <li> But the real star of the show is the Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> The real test, however, were surgical scars from five months ago that still looked nastier than I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at the difference.  </li>
            <li> was having a real problem with cracking drying nails.</li>
            <li> I bought rosehip oil before from Whole Foods and this is no where close to that product in color nor consistency.</li>
            <li> This makes for a quality product that you can be comfortable applying daily!</li>
            <li> The oil is lightweight but very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have also mixed it with my hair moisturizer and it keeps my hair smooth all day.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to use it for</li>
            <li> Very greasy, caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as describe with fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Smelled fabulous I would definitely</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> but nothing really works.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dispense too much at a time</li>
            <li> Two stars for the fast delivery and additional Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I really like the design of the bottle</li>
            <li> I loved the bottle of Organic Rosehip Oil, it was much larger than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I used my regular amount of shampoo and I was able to completely skip the conditioner when used in my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how soft it makes my face feel and after just a week of use daily</li>
            <li> I have a few blemishes on my face that I was told rose hip oil will work for.</li>
            <li> However, it does not last long and the effects of the oil are amazing.</li>
            <li> The 30 ml argan oil given as a bonus is really great for face and neck and is also small enough to take it with you when you’re away from home.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed, which is nice for longevity.</li>
            <li> It soothes extremely dry skin, absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling super hydrated, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> It has also left my skin looking younger and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> It is a much bigger bottle than most on the market for the same price.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that could handle the changing texture and oil producing in my skin as I am getting older.</li>
            <li> You can use this product in so many ways that you can actually skip buying extra moisturizer and hand creams.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really hard not to love this Organic Rosehip Seed Oil by BeautyBe!  </li>
            <li> Risk free to try as there is a full refund if not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I did not give it a high marking is because the pump that comes with the Rosehip oil does not work.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> then I highly recommend you use this oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> I intend to continue using this and highly recommend to anyone wanting healthier looking skin.  </li>
            <li> WOW this is my first time trying Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, and I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Then he mentioned Rose Hip Oil is just as good and less expensive.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way, also good for hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and it really helps to leave it feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far</li>
            <li> This was the first product she tried that she was willing to use on a regular basis because it didn&#x27;t hurt her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I put it on my arms every day, under my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li> Couldn’t believe that ROSEHIP will change my skin from damaged to normal, but I said let’s try this also.</li>
            <li> I haven’t noticed much change for the first two times, but now I am starting to feel my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> Then I apply my normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> had a slight difficulty using the pump on the bottle of Argan Oil at first, but just be sure to turn the lid to the left, so that it screws on all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so when I wake up in the morning my skin feels nourished, super soft and that feeling lasts well into the next day.  </li>
            <li> like to use my Rosehip Seed Oil by BeautyBe as an all over moisturizer right when I get out of the shower, especially at night</li>
            <li> Following Dr. Oz &#x27;s tip, I apply Rosehip oil right after my shower while my skin is still moist.  </li>
            <li> The added benefit of that is the cold oil feels really good!</li>
            <li> This is a new go to product for me.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to have taken on a new life as well with the rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> , I have been putting that oil on my cuticles several times a day and it has made such a huge difference in the appearance of my cuticles &amp; nails.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is fantastic and I would recommend adding it to your daily beauty regime!</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin</li>
            <li> used this on stretch marks and even though I haven&#x27;t used it long enough it has left them very moisturized and am sure i will see a difference soon</li>
            <li> Organic rosehip leaves your skin very soft</li>
            <li> These oils are truly organic and can be used even on very sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin feeling very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Argan oil on my hair, which makes it feel very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES the Argan oil for her newly forming stretch marks (she is in her second trimester of her first pregnancy).</li>
            <li> I’ve tried the rosehip oil for only two weeks and the first impression was that it didn’t affect my very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> My skin and hair is so soft and touchable!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, less fine lines.</li>
            <li> And I got the exact color from my first buy through other seller.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots are fading a bit, and I expect that it will only get better.</li>
            <li> This particular oil I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients.</li>
            <li> The oil feels a little strange on your face at first, but when you wake up your face feels normal and smooth.</li>
            <li> At first I thought my pump was broken as it took a few tries to get it primed and working, but it has been perfect since then.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> For an organic product, the price is fantastic and it is cold pressed which makes it that much better quality.  </li>
            <li> the bottle is clear plastic...</li>
            <li> Just yesterday, I had two people on separate occasions be completely baffled by my age.</li>
            <li> And since I am sensitive to scents this makes it nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually thought the Aragon oil was much smoother and silkier on my skin.</li>
            <li> Which I was surprised about since I know nothing about that</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it on my face and hair so far.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so moisturized and so soft.</li>
            <li> I am a essential oil user and I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day, and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> This rosehip serum makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> If you would like an all natural product to help with anti-aging, sun damaged skin and help with scars</li>
            <li> I gave this oil to my breakout prone 11 year old.  </li>
            <li> and she found a marked difference in her skin as well.  </li>
            <li> Also, no harsh scents.</li>
            <li> This product is not messy at all.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my hands in an effort to keep them looking young.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a NATURAL product to help people with skin problems.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so soft in the mornings when I wake up.</li>
            <li> it makes it so shiny and feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> it made my skin silky soft but not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> I would not reorder this unless this was fixed.</li>
            <li> Trying this on an old scar and have noticed some improvement.  </li>
            <li> After just a few days my skin is no longer red and it feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> I will update my review later after I&#x27;ve been using this for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Only had these a few days but can say I love them.</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with my results after using this product for only a few days.  </li>
            <li> I had not bought argan oil in sometime because it is expensive but this deal was too good..</li>
            <li> I already have dry skin and winter&#x27;s crisp windy air does not help my situation.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY reasons I&#x27;d not purchase again is due to the a smell and my preference to Argan Oil (which is FABULOUS).</li>
            <li> It has a pump so no mess at all.</li>
            <li> the loose part of the pump got lost in the rosehip bottle upon first use.</li>
            <li> The jar is a decent size (4oz) and should last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in the amount of sun spots, scars (of which I have a few after my 50 years on this planet!), and skin tone on my arms.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer after because my skin is healthier and not as dry.  </li>
            <li> but you can barely see them!</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil is like no other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used before...</li>
            <li> Absolutely no smell and its pure and organic.</li>
            <li> or it is something else because rosehip oil is supposed to be a deep rich, amber color or a dark yellow.</li>
            <li> The argan oil is a little heavier but still absorbed immediately into my skin with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a very generous size,and will last me a really long time.</li>
            <li> Almost clear color on the white paper test.  </li>
            <li> I personally use it on my hand and it makes them feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I did give the seller 5 stars, but the truth is the pumps apparently are defective that they are putting their product in.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a safe, natural, and effective product to use on my horrible stretch marks since giving birth to twins.  </li>
            <li> Yet Rose oil is extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> The Argan oil kid was loose and leaked all over making a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I normally have dry lips all my life.</li>
            <li> If you read up on both of them, you will find out how much these natural oils can help in everyday life.  </li>
            <li> When I first put this on I was a little concerned because it felt oily.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re now turning white and becoming less and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My face is raw from meds right now</li>
            <li> I started using the rosehip oil, and argon oil on my trouble spots (my heels and finger tips) at first</li>
            <li> I have previously used Argon once before and did not care for it too much.</li>
            <li> It has helped my dry, scaly skin become soft again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much softer and much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> The oil makes my face feel so soft and gets rid of that itchy dry feeling.  </li>
            <li> I find that it absorbs really well and is great to use as a base for other essential oils in a roll-on bottle.  </li>
            <li> This feels much less greasy then some other natural oils so for having combination skin it really works well for me.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to get results.</li>
            <li> The oil I received doesn&#x27;t look nor smell like any other rosehip oil I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered the second bottle from the first seller, and the second one&#x27;s color was not that thick amber.  </li>
            <li> The amount you get is generous and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to report on that.  </li>
            <li> this is a little early for a review because  I have only had it long enough to use for about  a week.</li>
            <li> Just add a little Rosehip Seed Oil to the ends and brush through for soft, silky and shiny hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have only tried this on my face, though it might work well on other parts of your body that you might have problems such as acne or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Cold pressed means it is unaltered and contains more nutrients.</li>
            <li> I have horrid dark under eye circles and they were actually lighter by the following morning.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review from Beautybe.</li>
            <li> As anyone who has seen my other reviews would know, I am  a big fan of oils and serums.</li>
            <li> I am not left feeling greasy or sticky like some other products I tried.</li>
            <li> And even tried them on my daughters dry</li>
            <li> It does appear that it is helping my daughters dry skin.</li>
            <li> Stopped using my steroid creme on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it all over my stomach to keep from getting that dry and itchy feeling.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s saying a lot and winter and med dry skin is harsh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used the argon oil on the tips of my hair to deal with dry split ends and the Rosehip oil on my hands to help with my eczema.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued all my life with terribly dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry patches where I used to have oily ones and vice versa.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife she use the oil for dry skin</li>
            <li> Got dry hair?  </li>
            <li> The outer layer of skin becomes dry and flaky and peels away in large/small pieces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not normal and I never had it before.</li>
            <li> It also last a really long time since you need every little to do the trick with each application.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I expect this to last for a while.</li>
            <li> Looking back on the 1st use with mild allergic reactions that happened I think that, in retrospect, I was wrong to mix the Rosehip oil with raw yellow shea butter and put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I love that the oil is moisturizing my tough dry skin, this time of year my skin is scaly and horrible but now its looking much better even those dreaded rough elbows...</li>
            <li> I also use a little on my elbows and heels, and whatever is left on my hands</li>
            <li> So after bilstex I covered with different things (not altogether at once) which I have and previously used all the time including petroleum jelly, lip balms, burt&#x27;s bees lip balm, raw yellow shea butter.</li>
            <li> Now a few weeks later I am using it all over, and my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> Thank you and delivery carriers world wide for ALL you do.</li>
            <li> and I really do not like lotion as it seems greasy and never seems to soak in</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a few days</li>
            <li> Few weeks prior to buying this Rosehip oil</li>
            <li> The next morning there was no more skin peeling from my lips and my lips become soft and no more dryness like before.</li>
            <li> I really do not know how to review this item, because the pump on the bottle does not work.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my dry, cracked feet at night and it is healing my heels!!  </li>
            <li> This item is either not pure rosehip oil</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly, because I don&#x27;t like to put oil on my face, but I do have some dark spots and some dry zones.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps her tame it.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, shiny but not oily looking, and had very few tangles!</li>
            <li> I see other quality rosehip oils selling for double the price for way less than half the product</li>
            <li> Now that I stop using that raw yellow shea butter</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I already used other brands....</li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t putting pesticides or other undesired by-products on your skin.</li>
            <li> For the past week I’ve been putting the oil on after my shower in the morning on my belly and upper thighs and then again at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I  am a bit of a make up products junkie, and have tried out one of their other products.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a different brand of rosehip seed oil in the past and it was a funky color in comparison to this product.</li>
            <li> The next day I put it on my face again and no more allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a LONG way!</li>
            <li> I have a few scars I am going to try this out on and hope those get softer like my dry hands and</li>
            <li> But I just bought one of those little empty travel containers and put some in there.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was not thrilled by the initial smell of the Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> The pump allows me to dispense just a few drops as only a small amount is needed.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more annoying than a product that comes and is not fully functioning.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the rosehip oil on his extremely dry hands for the past two weeks.  </li>
            <li> i have been using it for a few days on my heels and stomach due to some scaring.  </li>
            <li> and I cant drink because its slightly perfumed.  </li>
            <li> The argan oil works as well as any I have previously tried.</li>
            <li> softer and stretch marks are less visible.</li>
            <li> thick long hair.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cant return because it took 2 weeks for me to get because I don&#x27;t live in the States.&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>
            <li> My stretch marks weren&#x27;t colored to begin with, they were the white ones that just looks like rips in the skin which now can hardly even be seen!</li>
            <li> I like to work a little to the ends of my hair before blow drying to keep flyaways tamed.</li>
            <li> When I am in the shower, I put a little in my hands and rub it into my scalp after I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> The harsh antibacterial scrub reeked havoc on my already brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> I have been applying the rosehip to my hands a few times a day and before I go to bed</li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few products for that too).  </li>
            <li> but I just wasted $20.</li>
            <li> and when they go away my lips get dried again.</li>
            <li> I did that a few times a day but every morning I would see my skin peel off my lip.</li>
            <li> A few days ago I just didn&#x27;t know what to do</li>
            <li> I also found my curly hair to be less frizzy and uncontrollable (which is hard to manage</li>
            <li> My skin and hair tend to dry up around this time of year and that can be irritating.  </li>
            <li> not sure if its argan or rosehip.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> I add a small drop of oil to my foundation each application.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil now for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magical potion, I still have stretch marks</li>
            <li> This is NOT Authentic oil.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if it was angular cheilitis, but it&#x27;s not severe.</li>
            <li> a bonus, a small 1 oz jar of Argan Oil is included.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it will work in the summer when my skin is oilier</li>
            <li> You would not be disappointed in trying either of these products..not to mention the amount used this will last me a long time...</li>
            <li> I was finishing up the rest of another brand first and now it&#x27;s too late to return it :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> By this point in the year my heels are usually cracked, and painful, but so far so</li>
            <li> It is hard scent to explain.</li>
            <li> It hardly has any scent at all which I like.  </li>
            <li> Was annoyed the little pump didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing abilities of the Rosehip are hard to beat, especially during these cold winter months.</li>
            <li> cannot speak to its effect yet but packaging is shoddy.</li>
            <li> at least put some tape around the lid.</li>
            <li> When heated it loses some nutrients.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that there is no fragrance added since fragrances are often chemicals that have negative affects on health.</li>
            <li> No more cracking, splitting and peeling!</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair the argan oil really helps to plump it up like crazy!</li>
            <li> It was next to impossible for me to get one or two drops out at a time, instead a glob would shoot out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about organic beauty products lately, and this one is it!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when receiving the second bottle and the pump still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> a very little as I have very thin hair but needs something that will help keep it in line...</li>
            <li> Both of these oils are thin and absorb well.</li>
            <li> I guess the spring is broken.</li>
            <li> I am just addicted ..</li>
            <li> sells this as cold pressed at an inexpensive price because it is usually too pricey when cold pressed.</li>
            <li> You can go wrong with a cold pressed oil - it&#x27;s not damaged or altered by heat treating methods.</li>
            <li> I was sorry to think bad about the oil, now this oil will be on my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; list.</li>
            <li> It is inconvenient to use the product, unless you find another bottle with a working pump.</li>
            <li> even with cold weather coming.  </li>
            <li> It recommends refrigeration to extend the life of the oil, but that&#x27;s inconvenient for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered their oil because it was advertised as 100%pure cold pressed rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> According to my research through online, the unrefined cold pressed one should be amber with orange hue.  </li>
            <li> but I will start using to prevent the bad things that could happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased from BeautyBe before and have never been disappointed</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I chose the worst one</li>
            <li> I had my son for years ago and still have horrible stretch marks.</li>

            <li> I´ve used a more dense rose hip oil. This one is very liquid.</li>
            <li> WOW! This Organic Rosehip Oil and Argon Oil is PHENOMENAL!! I am totally in love with both products! The rosehip oil is so wonderful, I just can&#x27;t stop using it! That is a super good thing in a product like this. I love the dispenser, as it makes it very easy to use. I just keep it handy and use it every day. My skin is really good to begin with, but now I am noticing that it is appearing even younger, and more supple! Just yesterday, I had two people on separate occasions be completely baffled by my age. I get that relatively frequently, but the surprise on their faces was more than I normally get. I love it. I am using the argon oil on my hair, and my nails, and noting improvement on them as well! What an INCREDIBLE value for two such completely wonderful products! Highly recommend this great duo to anyone wanting a nice, easy way to add to their beauty regime, with simply STUNNING results! I HAVE ONLY just started using and I am in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller!! Super fast shipping, got mine in TWO DAYS with Prime!! Thank you!! :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Absorbs quickly. I can see a difference in my skin already! I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> cannot speak to its effect yet but packaging is shoddy. large oil stains on the box. not sure if its argan or rosehip. at least put some tape around the lid. the loose part of the pump got lost in the rosehip bottle upon first use. probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Got this Rosehip oil with bonus Argan oil set from seller &#x27;Vimas&#x27; for $19.95. I thought it was a good value...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason for 2 stars is just that first, the Rosehip oil pump top hasn&#x27;t worked since it arrived... And second, it recommends it being refrigerated, but upon putting it in the fridge, it became lumpy and curdled-like...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if that&#x27;s normal but won&#x27;t order this brand from this seller again. Hope this is helpful to someone.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it daily on my stretch marks from pregnancy and it&#x27;s fading them away. It&#x27;s not a heavy oil and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This is a nice organic Rosehip oil and that it came with a bonus 1 ounce Argan oil is even better! I find these two oils are both amazing for hair, nails and skin. They are also nice to have on hand to make homemade beauty and bath products (I recently made lovely shea butter bath melts that included Rosehip and Argan oil!). Both of these oils are thin and absorb well. I don&#x27;t find them greasy at all when the absorb. Both also contain vitamins and nutrients the skin loves. The four ounce bottle of Rosehip oil is a good value as a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review from Beautybe. As anyone who has seen my other reviews would know, I am  a big fan of oils and serums. I recently discovered Rosehip as a oil that also works a s a serum and expect it to remain in my routine.</li>
            <li> The pump of the bottle (rosehip oil) doesn&#x27;t even work. It is inconvenient to use the product, unless you find another bottle with a working pump.</li>
            <li> What a deal!  I&#x27;ve been using both oils on my skin and hair but I was happy to save a lot of money by buying this brand.</li>
            <li> OMGOODNESS!!!! This Organic Rosehip Oil with the free bonus Argan Oil is AMAZING!  After receiving these products I did a google search on the uses and was amazed there were so many!  My hair, skin and nails have improved dramatically since I started using them. The fine lines and wrinkles seem to be disappearing right before my eyes.  Being a nurse, I wash my hands countless times and also help perform surgeries. The harsh antibacterial scrub reeked havoc on my already brittle nails.  I have been applying the rosehip to my hands a few times a day and before I go to bed and my nails are in awesome shape!  No more cracking, splitting and peeling!</li>
            <li> I already have dry skin and winter&#x27;s crisp windy air does not help my situation.  I am so glad I received to review, because my skin has NEVER felt as moisturized without that greasy feeling. I will definitely be purchasing this duo in the future.  The argan oil is so amazing for quenching thirsty hair! I put a few drops in my hair while it&#x27;s still wet. My skin and hair is so soft and touchable!</li>
            <li> used this on stretch marks and even though I haven&#x27;t used it long enough it has left them very moisturized and am sure i will see a difference soon</li>
            <li> I got this product because I want to use the Rosehip oil in some of my balms and lotions. But I did try both oils as soon as I got them. And even tried them on my daughters dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither oil has a scent which is nice because it will not overpower any of the essential oils I use in my lotions. And since I am sensitive to scents this makes it nice.&lt;br /&gt; I actually thought the Aragon oil was much smoother and silkier on my skin. Which I was surprised about since I know nothing about that oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Rosehip oil It does appear that it is helping my daughters dry skin. Only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this is certified organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I did not give it a high marking is because the pump that comes with the Rosehip oil does not work. There is nothing more annoying than a product that comes and is not fully functioning.</li>
            <li> I loved the bottle of Organic Rosehip Oil, it was much larger than I had expected. I have to say I was not thrilled by the initial smell of the Rosehip oil. It is hard scent to explain. However, it does not last long and the effects of the oil are amazing. I personally use it on my hand and it makes them feel so soft. The moisturizing abilities of the Rosehip are hard to beat, especially during these cold winter months. This would actually be an amazing oil for a neck or back massage. One comment I do have to mention about the Rosehip oil, is I had a time with the pump bottle. It was next to impossible for me to get one or two drops out at a time, instead a glob would shoot out. However, that had no affect on my rating of the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also loved the bonus bottle of Argan oil. I have previously used Argon once before and did not care for it too much. However, this Argan had a beautiful aromatic scent to it. I use this on my hair and it really helps to leave it feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li> Love this oil, I use it to help combat the dry patches of skin I tend to get during the winter months. Not overpowering and it works beautifully :)</li>
            <li> This Rosehip seed oil is really nice. I have been using it for awhile now and I&#x27;ve used it on my face and hair so far. Just a few drops on my face works well and really moisturizes. I also take a few more drops and run it through my hair and it really smooths my hair out nicely.</li>
            <li> My pump does not work and I do not believe that this is pure rosehip oil. I have used many brands and this one is not the proper color, smell or texture. Returning!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Use on my face as a moisturizer every day. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> love it! skin feels smooth, soft and moisturized. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! It is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy at all, I don&#x27;t feel like my pores are clogging up with use. I use this on my hands and used it on my face, focusing on my under eye area. I have horrid dark under eye circles and they were actually lighter by the following morning. I used my regular amount of shampoo and I was able to completely skip the conditioner when used in my hair. My hair was soft, shiny but not oily looking, and had very few tangles! I also use this on my hands and cuticles as well to keep moisture on them this time of year.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a safe, natural, and effective product to use on my horrible stretch marks since giving birth to twins.  This rose hip oil has a lovely light scent and has done a great job of lightening the marks on my tummy.  It has also left my skin looking younger and more vibrant.  I have used the Argon Oil on my cuticles and it has worked wonders conditioning them and making them more supple and healthy.</li>
            <li> I am liking this oil. It does not take a lot so it should last a while. It doesn&#x27;t seem to greasy. Was annoyed the little pump didn&#x27;t work. I guess the spring is broken. But I just bought one of those little empty travel containers and put some in there.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my skin.</li>
            <li> I Love the Rose Hip Oil.It makes my skin so soft without leaving a greasy feeling. I use it everyday and a little goes a long way. I also use it in homemade body butters. It is plain and simply awesome and the Argan oil is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;It is 100% PURE USDA Certified Organic, no parabens, fragrances, colorants, alcohol, preservatives and animal ingredients. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I really love dis oil....it&#x27;s very effective....I already used other brands....dis is also gng to be one of my favorite. ...I daily use it for my face and skin . it&#x27;s really safe and easily goes all over .</li>
            <li> Organic rosehip leaves your skin very soft I apply this at knight and morning good stuff will highly recommended to friends and family and buyers to use this product</li>
            <li> I love these oils. I use Rosehill mostly Boniface at night. I use the Argan on my face in the morning and I put it in my hair too (on the ends) . I LOVE the smell of the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I like this, smells good, and can&#x27;t wait to see results in months to come.  Will post more later.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY! Product diluted. Watery. It seems like I bought 2 bottles of water for $20 and I cant drink because its slightly perfumed.  Unfortunately I cant return because it took 2 weeks for me to get because I don&#x27;t live in the States.&lt;br /&gt;Feel like I was scammed. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! If I could rate it a zero I would. DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this plastic bottle. The cork uncertain, oil was leaked when I received.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to look younger, feel younger and feel great... When I was offered this product to try for my honest review I thought sure what the heck... WELL... I love it... I love that the oil is moisturizing my tough dry skin, this time of year my skin is scaly and horrible but now its looking much better even those dreaded rough elbows... I am using the Argan freebie for my hair... a very little as I have very thin hair but needs something that will help keep it in line... You would not be disappointed in trying either of these products..not to mention the amount used this will last me a long time...</li>
            <li> I love using organic products and this oil is completely organic.  I have been using it on my dry, cracked feet at night and it is healing my heels!!  That&#x27;s really great since most moisturizers haven&#x27;t worked for me.  I&#x27;m glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil every night before I go to bed and the difference is amazing! My skin is so soft and hydrated! I just love the changes in my face. I also use a little on my elbows and heels, and whatever is left on my hands I put on the ends of my hair - it really makes a difference. You can go wrong with a cold pressed oil - it&#x27;s not damaged or altered by heat treating methods. Not to mention that it&#x27;s ORGANIC so you aren&#x27;t putting pesticides or other undesired by-products on your skin. This is an amazing product - and the bonus Argan oil is a huge plus, too!</li>
            <li> I love this so much! The bottle is huge, I feel like it will last forever. It makes my skin so moisturized and so soft. I love that there is no fragrance, nothing to irritate my sinuses. I love that it is organic. I especially love that it came with a bottle of argan oil for free, I have been putting that oil on my cuticles several times a day and it has made such a huge difference in the appearance of my cuticles &amp; nails. They look 110% better.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this rosehip oil! I&#x27;m all about organic beauty products lately, and this one is it! I have been using it on my face before bed. The oil feels a little strange on your face at first, but when you wake up your face feels normal and smooth. It lets you know that all the oil has soaked into your skin and is working miracles. :) I struggle with fine lines under my eyes and have already seen an improvement! The added bonus of the argan oil is just excellent. I use argan oil in my hair before straightening and LOVE the smell and the way it leaves my hair feeling. Definitely a GREAT buy that&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> The product is nice and as are the bottles. It has a great smell. The only downfall which is not their fault is one of the bottles leaked during transit.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil! After just having a baby i&#x27;m using it all over to help with the texture of my skin and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the Rosehib oil. It smells nice (not overwhealming), makes dry hands and feet very soft. A few drops go a LONG way! It is a much bigger bottle than most on the market for the same price. It being organic and cold pressed makes it the best option for myself. I have a few scars I am going to try this out on and hope those get softer like my dry hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am a essential oil user and I really like this oil.  I am so glad to have found organic rosehip oil in a large amount.  I have been using the rosehip and the argan oil together and my skin is doing great.  The oils go into the skin quickly and skin feels re-moisturized immediately.  Looking forward to longer use results to diminish my sun spots and age spots.  Also using on scars, nails, and hair.  You are going to love this.</li>
            <li> So excited to try this.  Started using the argan oil.  Two drops in the morning and evening.  Not as greasy like you&#x27;d expect from an oil and I wipe the extra through my hair after I put on my face.  My skin feels smooth and I&#x27;m hoping to see the darker spots lighten and maybe even disapper!</li>
            <li> When I first put this on I was a little concerned because it felt oily. Once it absorbs though, this feels awesome. It lasts all day, and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> My eczema on my hands is clearing up with the rosehip oil  and I love the Argan oil on my face..Love it!</li>
            <li> Wanted to wait a couple of weeks to see how this product worked out. I couldn&#x27;t wait my nails are not tearing or breaking. Stopped using my steroid creme on my dry skin. This stuff is incredible. I love it. A little goes a long way. Thank you</li>
            <li> This rosehip serum makes my skin feel so soft. I apply it after I wash my face in the morning under my moisturizer. It plumps up my pores and gives my face a glow. This product smells nice and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I recommend this product,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed skin esthetician and I cannot tell you enough how much I love this product! I&#x27;ve known for many years how beneficial rosehip oil is and I am always recommending this to all my friends. Rosehip oil has been used for centuries by the Indians of the Chilean Andes to treat burned and damaged skin. The benefits of this oil are really great and can be used on almost all skin conditions to help balance and restore the skin&#x27;s acid mantle. This particular oil I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients. There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin. If you would like an all natural product to help with anti-aging, sun damaged skin and help with scars then I highly recommend you use this oil. Your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> As a woman in her final trimester of pregnancy, I am loving this Organic Rosehip oil! I have been using it all over my stomach to keep from getting that dry and itchy feeling. I put it on after a shower and it absorbs quite nicely. I am not left feeling greasy or sticky like some other products I tried. I will definitely continue to use this after delivery to help keep stretch marks to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I had heard about rosehip oil benefits for skin. So, I bought this for my wife. She I mixes 2 drops of the oil in with moisturizer and apply to her face and neck. She is using it for a about week and already love this product. She is saying her skin feels great and makeup goes on so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, less fine lines.</li>
            <li> Used the oil on my face. It soaked in immediately. My face is raw from meds right now and this made it feel comfortable. That&#x27;s saying a lot and winter and med dry skin is harsh.&lt;br /&gt;I used the A oil on my daughters hair. She hates frizz. This eliminated that. She has gorgeous hair already, however the oil helps it lay flat and creates a beautiful healthy glow.</li>
            <li> This is a new go to product for me. I&#x27;m all about natural remedies and natural ways to keep my skin looking refreshed and healthy and this is a key part of it! This works on the cellular level and really absorbs well into my skin. I like the BeautyBe sells this as cold pressed at an inexpensive price because it is usually too pricey when cold pressed. Cold pressed means it is unaltered and contains more nutrients. When heated it loses some nutrients. This feels much less greasy then some other natural oils so for having combination skin it really works well for me. It is also an anti inflammatory so you can get medicinal uses out of this. I feel like everyone should have this product in their household! Love the product and seller, I will continue to get their quality products.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for very dry skin, and can be used anywhere. Very little is needed, which is nice for longevity. I love that argon oil was included! I use a couple drops on the ends of my hair. I assume there are more uses for argon oil, but that&#x27;s what I use it for!</li>
            <li> This seems to be working on my skin.  I love the additional argan oil with it!  My bottle leaked a little in shipment and that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars, but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> I put the rosehip oil in my skin cream and argon oil in conditioners and skin cream, both with great results.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using the rosehip oil on his extremely dry hands for the past two weeks.  There is marked improvement and he appreciates the lack of a strong fragrance.  The argan oil works as well as any I have previously tried.</li>
            <li> I gave this oil to my breakout prone 11 year old.  It seems counter intuitive to put oil on an oily face, but it is looking so much nicer! Her breakouts are not 100% gone, but drastically reduced and the skin around the breakouts looks SO much nicer and is so much nicer to the touch.  She always refused to use moisturizer because she said that they all sting.  This was the first product she tried that she was willing to use on a regular basis because it didn&#x27;t hurt her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have never tried rosehip seed oil before but I heard it is super good for your skin so I bought some.  I&#x27;ve purchased from BeautyBe before and have never been disappointed so I purchased this set, the argan oil was a HUGE bonus because I was out of it and cannot live without it.  And, it is great!  I love argan oil and this oil is right up there with the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BeautyBe rosehip oil has everything you should look for when purchasing rosehip oil.  Organic, pure, and cold-pressed.  I put it on my arms every day, under my normal moisturizer and I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in the amount of sun spots, scars (of which I have a few after my 50 years on this planet!), and skin tone on my arms.  I feel like after seeing the amount of healing rosehip oil has done, I probably should pay more attention to sunscreen.  I use it on my face once a week.  The amount you get is generous and will last a long time.  I see other quality rosehip oils selling for double the price for way less than half the product AND you get the aragan oil!  The BeautyBe is the best bargain out there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip which I learned from a friend and will do:  Remember to exfoliate. While oily, congested skin will really benefit from using rosehip oil (the vitamin A helps aid cell turnover), it&#x27;s important you exfoliate weekly to help move any build-up. If your skin is irritated, try a chemical exfoliate.  My skin LOVES this stuff but I didn&#x27;t realize the cell turnover thing and will be exfoliating on a regular basis.  Think I will start getting my legs ready for Spring and use it on them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I love these. It is awesome that you get both of these great natural oils in one package. I used the argon oil on the tips of my hair to deal with dry split ends and the Rosehip oil on my hands to help with my eczema. Both work great. It also last a really long time since you need every little to do the trick with each application. There are many more uses for these oils. If you read up on both of them, you will find out how much these natural oils can help in everyday life.  The bonus....they are also Organic.</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly and the argan oil was a nice added free item that came with it.  i have been using it for a few days on my heels and stomach due to some scaring.  Skin in all areas are nice and soft and I feel the look of the areas are improving.  Im confident that this will work on some areas of my face and cant wait to see the results.  It has little smell which is great for me as I am very sensitive to smells and wount be able to put on my face if there was a strong odor.</li>
            <li> Loves the way it makes my skin feel and no nasty residue after!&lt;br /&gt;Will update in a couple weeks</li>
            <li> So I have tried a couple different oils.  I like this one the best.  The pump works great and doesn&#x27;t shoot it across the room for one!  It is a great value as far as the large bottle plus the smaller &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; one.  I have found that after a week, my stretch marks have lightened and my skin is without a doubt softer...even with cold weather coming.  I also found my curly hair to be less frizzy and uncontrollable (which is hard to manage and I have tried quite a few products for that too).  I gave it to a friend who has eczema and she found a marked difference in her skin as well.  Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
            <li> Just tried this product. I was finishing up the rest of another brand first and now it&#x27;s too late to return it :(&lt;br /&gt;The oil smells rancid. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued all my life with terribly dry skin. My feet and hands crack in the winter time, and this makes it excruciating to do even simple things, like walk, and type. I started using the rosehip oil, and argon oil on my trouble spots (my heels and finger tips) at first and i noticed an immediate change. Now a few weeks later I am using it all over, and my skin has never been softer. By this point in the year my heels are usually cracked, and painful, but so far so good!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super sensitive skin, and I can use almost nothing on the market these days. These oils are truly organic and can be used even on very sensitive skin like mine. I have had no issues, and my skin has only gotten better and better!</li>
            <li> I stopped using facial moisturizer years ago because they left my face feeling like there was a lot of product on it and also would break out from it. I tried this Organic Rosehip Oil and I use it on a daily basis now. I LOVE how soft it makes my face feel and after just a week of use daily I noticed my face was clearer and the scars and blemishes appeared to be lessened. I have also been using it on my stretch marks from pregnancy and it seems to be improving them as well. Overall this product is fantastic and I would recommend adding it to your daily beauty regime!</li>
            <li> Neither of these oils had any fragrance at all and I would venture to say this is not Rosehip Oil nor Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is fabulous! I bought it to treat the patches of eczema on my upper arms. I&#x27;ve tried so many things that never seem to completely get rid of it. This oil has been working great! After just a few days my skin is no longer red and it feels so smooth! I will keep using it so my arms will look nice when the weather gets warmer again.</li>
            <li> I like the bigger bottle because I use it in my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of cosmetic products and oils as well but most of them were full of ingredients that I have never heard of and had nothing to do with repairing the damaged skin or acne and rosacea. I have this problems and I needed a product that works. I will be honest and tell you that I have tried more than 100 serums and oils and nothing made my skin look better. Couldn’t believe that ROSEHIP will change my skin from damaged to normal, but I said let’s try this also. I have excellent results and I started using this oil also for my extremities. Just make sure to let it dry out first if you are going to use the oil on your feet. The moisturizer I used was good but now I don’t feel like using something else than my beloved rosehip oil. As for the bonus they’re offering, everybody knows that argan oil is a great moisturizer for face and it also helps with more glowing hair. Haven’t got problems with my hair till now but I will start using to prevent the bad things that could happen. In one word, just “GREAT”</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Rosehip Oil for about a week now. It does an excellent job of moisturizing and hydrating my skin. I am using it primarily on my stretch marks and a scar. There is no odor and the oil does not leave any greasiness afterwards. A little goes a long way, so I expect this to last for a while. It recommends refrigeration to extend the life of the oil, but that&#x27;s inconvenient for me. I tend to use it in the morning after I shower &amp; again before bed and if it was kept in the refrigerator, I would never remember to use it. I will update my review later after I&#x27;ve been using this for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil is light and smooth- does not leave an oily residue at all. The Argan oil is doing wonders for my hair- love it  I have a surgical scar on my foot and I have been applying the Rosehip oil now since I got it in- twice a day and the difference is visible! I am very happy with this stuff- I now have a nightly regimen with it and the family got so jealous- I have to do it for hubby and daughter too! This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> I am using this on my belly from my c-section and stretch marks. I am already seeing the skin start to appear smoother. The marks are already seeming to fade as well. The argon oil is a great &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; moisturizer as well. I am very happy with this!</li>
            <li> I am loving dis product...I use rosehip oil for my face and hands ..it&#x27;s a great product...I use argan oil for my hair..</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I love that the Rosehip has a pump! Very light fragrance, which I also love, and it leaves my skin silky and soft!</li>
            <li> Excellent work guys! Never heard about Rosehip oil before, but I saw on Dr Oz that its good for dry skin and it greatly helps removing stretch marks. I heard that for many models, this is the solution for radiant glowing skin and that they keep using the rosehip and argan oil for years. The 30 ml argan oil given as a bonus is really great for face and neck and is also small enough to take it with you when you’re away from home. It worked for me and I truly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Only had these a few days but can say I love them. Used the rosehip oil the day I got it on a burn I got earlier that day. The next day the size of  the burn was greatly reduced. Not making a medical claim, just sayin&#x27;. Love the argan oil on my hair.</li>
            <li> This oil has been great for my skin, and I can see a visible difference even after using it for a short time.  I love that there are no fillers and no scent, so you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting and you minimize the chances of reactions. At first I thought my pump was broken as it took a few tries to get it primed and working, but it has been perfect since then.  The argan oil is also a great product!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin feeling very soft and silky. Just a little goes a long way, also good for hair. The argon oil is great for cuticles, with the convenient applicator!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff use it on my hair, elbows and skin after I shave it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> WOW this is my first time trying Organic Rosehip Seed Oil, and I am pleasantly surprised! This stuff is awesome and high quality!!</li>
            <li> Really like this duo. I add a small drop of oil to my foundation each application. Keeps my skin soft and makes the foundation apply better. Since Roseship is also beneficial for acne, its a win win situation. Also, no harsh scents. Will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Argan oil on my hair, which makes it feel very soft and manageable.  But the real star of the show is the Rosehip oil.  I&#x27;ve used it on the wrinkles on my neck and noticed an improvement.  The real test, however, were surgical scars from five months ago that still looked nastier than I wanted.  I chose the worst one so I could compare it with the other scars and WOW!  I am absolutely amazed at the difference.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> For the past week I’ve been putting the oil on after my shower in the morning on my belly and upper thighs and then again at night before bed. I have stretch marks that have trying to get rid of or diminish and when I use this on the area, it helps to make my skin appear softer and stretch marks are less visible. I love how my skin simply soaks up the oil and I don&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil now for the past two weeks. I LOVE it! It goes on easily, feels great, it has a very pleasant light scent, and makes my skin glow! I have been looking for a product that could handle the changing texture and oil producing in my skin as I am getting older. I have dry patches where I used to have oily ones and vice versa. This oil is already correcting the problem! I love how my skin feels once it absorbs. It takes about 5 minutes or so, so don&#x27;t go putting on your powder immediately.. whoops! I love that this is organic and they recommend that you keep it in the fridge to prolong the life and benefits of the oil. The added benefit of that is the cold oil feels really good! The extra bonus they give you I absolutely love! My hair REALLY loves it! I have tried other argan oils and they all have a very strong perfume that turned me off.. This one is wonderful! It has a very mild scent that doesn&#x27;t compete with my shampoo scent and absorbs wonderfully! I will be purchasing this in a larger size!</li>
            <li> What an amazing Product, I have been using this on my Stretch marks, a my Scars for an auto accident , I do have to say my Skin looks so much smoother and Feels baby Soft, even my Dry hands are feels and healing I absolutely Love this Product, and smell Fresh &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;  This product was received for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review</li>
            <li> I love good quality oils and I&#x27;m excited about these.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife she use the oil for dry skin and she&#x27;s feeling happy since she is using it</li>
            <li> I love the big bottle that this rose oil comes in, and the pump! it make sit easy to get the amount that I need, and it looks great on my counter. Using this in conjunction with the argon oil has done wonders for my skin. It has provided moisture, and evened out my skin tone. This is a great value!  I received this for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All thoughts and opinions are of my own.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. I am experimenting with creating my own moisturizers and lotions so I KNOW what I am putting on my body. Rosehip oil is so great for face moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product for a couple of weeks before leaving a review. I chose to use this oil on my belly area on the stretch marks caused by two pregnancies. It&#x27;s not a magical potion, I still have stretch marks but you can barely see them! My stretch marks weren&#x27;t colored to begin with, they were the white ones that just looks like rips in the skin which now can hardly even be seen! This product is not messy at all. It does feel greasy at first but as soon as it dries the greasiness is gone. No need to worry about your clothes sticking to your skin or any itchiness after putting it on. Will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I used these oils in a lotion recipe and it turned out great! Very light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I use this with my shampoo with great results</li>
            <li> Nice bonus! Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this BeautyBe Organic rose hip oil every night for 10 days now on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I just had to review and Rave about how great my nails look.&lt;br /&gt;I was having a real problem with cracking drying nails. Thank goodness I found a solution.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great, little to no smell, easy to apply. My order came with an additional BeautyBe bonus&lt;br /&gt;100% organic Argan oil. I gave this product to my granddaughter for her thick long hair.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it, she told me her hair is more manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for increased skin hydration. I use it sparingly, because I don&#x27;t like to put oil on my face, but I do have some dark spots and some dry zones. I have found that my skin feels more balanced after two weeks use, and my tone is more even. My dark spots are fading a bit, and I expect that it will only get better. To my surprise, there is no greasy feel or oily residue when using this on your face. I also use this on my hands in an effort to keep them looking young. I love this product is organic. There are enough additives and chemicals in beauty products. It&#x27;s nice to have something all natural, without a million ingredients that I can&#x27;t pronounce. The bottle is a very generous size,and will last me a really long time. A little goes a long way, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to get results.</li>
            <li> This item is either not pure rosehip oil or it is something else because rosehip oil is supposed to be a deep rich, amber color or a dark yellow. I bought rosehip oil before from Whole Foods and this is no where close to that product in color nor consistency. I bought this item because it was cheaper than buying it in store but I just wasted $20. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Hey! I’ve tried the rosehip oil for only two weeks and the first impression was that it didn’t affect my very very sensitive skin. I haven’t noticed much change for the first two times, but now I am starting to feel my skin smoother. The great natural and organic ingredients were the reason I have bought this oil at first but now I know that is the solution for me and I will recommend it further to my friends. The very nice feeling offered is also combined with a great moisturizing feeling – it is a really great moisturizer – and with 2 – 3 drops for every part of your body, you will feel NEW!  With my sensitive skin I had like really lots of problems with this kind of products for skin and face, but this one is my favorite. One thing is for sure: it is really organic and it is a miracle for your body!</li>
            <li> love this product well worth the money its a must try</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these oils!!  I use the Rosehip after the shower every night and I have noticed a difference in my skin tone.  I love how my skin simply soaks up the oil and I don&#x27;t feel oily afterwards.  I have been rubbing it into my hands and nails and they have thanked me tremendously.  The Argan Oil was a pleasant surprise to have and I use it on my stretch marks!  I love that there appearance seems to be finer.  One of my favorite things about this oil, is that it is Organic, Unrefined, and Cold-pressed.  This makes for a quality product that you can be comfortable applying daily!</li>
            <li> These two are great!  My daughter LOVES the Argan oil for her newly forming stretch marks (she is in her second trimester of her first pregnancy). My skin seems to have taken on a new life as well with the rosehip oil.  I find that it absorbs really well and is great to use as a base for other essential oils in a roll-on bottle.  No unpleasant smell from either one!  Highly recommend it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product with a wide variety of uses!  I love this lightweight oil for hands, body, and face.  It&#x27;s so versatile, and I love that it&#x27;s a healthy, natural product.  It hardly has any scent at all which I like.  You can use this product in so many ways that you can actually skip buying extra moisturizer and hand creams.  Plus, it&#x27;s safe on my face and did not make me break out.  The bonus Argon oil was great too, and I used a tiny bit as a hair smoother.  I  am a bit of a make up products junkie, and have tried out one of their other products.  So far, I&#x27;ve been pleased and will look for more of this BeautyBe brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff works nicely to even out my skin tone!</li>
            <li> Light yellow color, smells and tastes just like my favorite olive oil sending back. Sorry...never saw rosehip oil this color....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from company announcement: Google: BeautyBe&#x27; Launches Organic Rosehip Oil Offering 60 Percent Off Launch Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company States\\&quot; \\&quot;We are very excited to introduce our new product &#x60;Organic Rosehip Oil&#x27; for customers across the globe. It is a pure and effective product to help users get glowing skin and many more other benefits.\\&quot; He further added, \\&quot;We have ADDED organic healing ingredients in it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price just dropped 2 dollars since my review</li>
            <li> Delicious smell and organic. Makes it even better and safer for me to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It is incredibly moisturizing and leaves my skin very soft. I&#x27;ve been looking for.a natural method to taking care of my skin, and I read about the moisturizing and anti-aging effects of rose hip oil, so I decided to give it a try. For an organic product, the price is fantastic and it is cold pressed which makes it that much better quality.  A tiny bit goes a long way too. I started noticing a significant reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles in my forehead and around my eyes within the first month.  I&#x27;m very excited about this, and it has a very nice, natural scent to it. So nice to get the bonus Argan Oil as well!</li>
            <li> Awesome on my hair.  Great product!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> This absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  The pump top is amazing to have!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my daughter recommended it. this is a little early for a review because  I have only had it long enough to use for about  a week. I only put it on at night because it is oily. It soaks in within a couple of hours and I love the way my skin feels the next morning. so far so good.</li>
            <li> The Argan oil kid was loose and leaked all over making a huge mess. Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Of all the treatments I&#x27;ve tried for my dry winter chapped skin, this is my FAVORITE! The oil is lightweight but very moisturizing. Also, it has no scent added to it, so I don&#x27;t have to go around smelling like potpourri all day. This stuff also works nicely as a hair smoother/serum. I like to work a little to the ends of my hair before blow drying to keep flyaways tamed. The Argan oil is a nice bonus! I got a nice sized 1 oz bottle with the rosehip oil. The Argan oil is a bit more oily, so I&#x27;d recommend it if you need intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this before bed, after my shower. My face is noticeably softer and more youthful looking. I am loving this!</li>
            <li> This is a decent size bottle and is exactly as promised in the review. I have purchased a different brand of rosehip seed oil in the past and it was a funky color in comparison to this product. I make my own essential oil perfumes and this works perfectly as a carrier oil. The argon oil that came with it has been a miracle for my split ends. I am heading back to buy more of both right now!</li>
            <li> I admit I am a fan of Dr. Oz. I had been watching his show when he was talking about the benefits of rose oil. Yet Rose oil is extremely expensive. Then he mentioned Rose Hip Oil is just as good and less expensive. I have a beautiful rose hip bush but was wondering how I was going to make oil out of it. Then this product came about and I jumped on it. I have a few blemishes on my face that I was told rose hip oil will work for. So of course I am going to give it a try. First this product is affordable and came with argan oil that I have heard a lot about as well. It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and a little bit goes a long way. I have only been using it for a week now but so far I am enjoying how it leaves my skin feeling. I apply the leftovers to my hands and nails and sometimes smooth the ends of my hair with it. I am impressed and can&#x27;t wait to report my results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this rosehip seed oil, I use it on my face after I wash my face and then use moisturizer over it. I use it morning and night, it is not greasy or oily on my skin, it absorbs right in. It makes your skin look so healthy and I have not had a breakout since I started using this. I have only tried this on my face, though it might work well on other parts of your body that you might have problems such as acne or dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t smell great, and you do not need much at all - it really is doing wonders for my skin. I highly recommend this oil. Ohhhh and I almost forgot loved that I got a bottle of Argan oil.  I am just addicted .. it is a must for gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li> Works at moisturizing, but it smells like cooking oil. Yuck!  Thus, only 4 stars. The ONLY reasons I&#x27;d not purchase again is due to the a smell and my preference to Argan Oil (which is FABULOUS).</li>
            <li> Easy to use pump rosehip oil. I have been using this to keep my scalp moisturized. I really like it so far and it is not greasy. I have also mixed it with my hair moisturizer and it keeps my hair smooth all day. I have also used it on my face. It absorbs fast. I will use it on my scars too.</li>
            <li> I ordered their oil because it was advertised as 100%pure cold pressed rosehip oil. The oil I received doesn&#x27;t look nor smell like any other rosehip oil I have used so far. It looks and feels rather a mixture of grape/sesame oil. I called my credit company and sending it back.</li>
            <li> Just got it but surprise me....the bottle is clear plastic...look very cheap....don&#x27;t have any result yet</li>
            <li> I used this argan oil for my curly hair and it left it so shiny and manageable, The rose hip seed oil I didn&#x27;t really know what to use it for but it smells good!</li>
            <li> I love just about anything Organic and any beauty product that is a multi-tasker so it&#x27;s really hard not to love this Organic Rosehip Seed Oil by BeautyBe!  This Rosehip Seed Oil is 100% pure USDA Certified Organic and in case you don&#x27;t already know (like you&#x27;ve been living under a rock or something) Rosehip Seed Oil can be used for just about everything.  It soothes extremely dry skin, absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling super hydrated, soft and silky.  It can also heal troublesome skin issues like eczema or psoriasis and it can even diminish scars and stretch marks!  Got dry hair?  Just add a little Rosehip Seed Oil to the ends and brush through for soft, silky and shiny hair!&lt;br /&gt;I like to use my Rosehip Seed Oil by BeautyBe as an all over moisturizer right when I get out of the shower, especially at night so when I wake up in the morning my skin feels nourished, super soft and that feeling lasts well into the next day.  Perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> Very greasy, caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> I love the Rosehip Oil! It helps to make my skin glow. I have noticed that my skin is smoother and I love the smell. My daughter loves the Argan oil. It works amazingly on her frizzy hair. It definitely helps her tame it. I would recommend both of these products to others.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as describe with fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil its soothing to the skin. Thank you for a NATURAL product to help people with skin problems. Thank you and delivery carriers world wide for ALL you do.</li>
            <li> Very good and caring customer service.</li>
            <li> Smelled fabulous I would definitely but this again! Very good texture oil not too watery!</li>
            <li> What is not to love about this product? A little goes a long way so i know that it will last me awhile even though I lather it all over my body.  It has helped my dry, scaly skin become soft again.  It smells great and feels great going on.  The fact that it&#x27;s organic makes me feel better that i know exactly what i am putting on my body.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing stuff.  I have never used rose hip oil until now , but I will definitely be continuing with the use of it.  I have done some research on benefits of the oil and have found most all of them to be true with this product. I have super dry skin and I really do not like lotion as it seems greasy and never seems to soak in so I now use this oil after every shower to rub onto all of my skin including my face. It soaks in great and never feels greasy or heavy.  I actually love it on my face it has not clogged my pores at all and my skin feels so soft in the mornings when I wake up. I only use it on my face at night as it takes a bit to soak in before putting makeup on but it works perfectly.  I also love to use it on my hair it makes it so shiny and feels so soft.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and the bonus argan oil is awesome!</li>
            <li> Great all around moisturizer! I really appreciated being able to compare both the Rosehip and Argan Oil side by side. Great bonus! I&#x27;ve been experimenting with them and after the last week I think I like the Argan oil for my face and the Rosehip for my hair. I can&#x27;t wait to try out different uses but I am happy with how soft my skin and hair have gotten in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Rosehip Oil for about a week.  When I am in the shower, I put a little in my hands and rub it into my scalp after I wash my hair.  I then finish showering, and rinse my hair out again,  When I am done with my shower I put a couple drops into my hands and rub it on my legs and stomach area (where I have stretch marks).  I have noticed not only is it helping with my EXTREMELY dry skin , but my hair feels great!  I am hoping that it helps with the dandruff  O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with RoseHip oil  I am very impressed!  The bottle is a good size bottle, and I think it is going to last a long time!  Plus you get the free bottle of Argan Oil!!  I received this for free and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a few days but I&#x27;ve been really impressed so far.  The rosehip oil is like no other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used before... it made my skin silky soft but not at all greasy.  I&#x27;m hoping it will help lighten a surgery scar but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to report on that.  I also absolutely love the argan oil as it has been awesome to tame my mid-summer hair frizzies.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have been satisfied with my results after using this product for only a few days.  This has been great for my dry skin areas.</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil is so light and absorbed immediately into my skin without any irritation.  The argan oil is a little heavier but still absorbed immediately into my skin with no irritation.  Great organic products with no overwhelming scent and no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Great products but bottles are plastic, not glass.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Mix the rosehip with facial moisturizer and has done wonders for my face.  If you have thin hair the argan oil really helps to plump it up like crazy!</li>
            <li> These oils are absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve never found a product like this that leaves my skin so soft and my hair so smooth! I would definitely refer this product to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery time was as stated!</li>
            <li> This is NOT Authentic oil. Smells just like it. Do not buy ths product. I just throw it away</li>
            <li> This is my 1st Rosehip oil ever and I just started using this product about a week ago. The first time I applied it on my face I didn&#x27;t really like it. I even felt that I had a mild allergic reaction to it. I had a mild redness and itchiness on my face so I stopped using it 1 day and the symptoms went away. The next day I put it on my face again and no more allergic reaction. However, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this is right for me. I was kind of regret buying the 4 oz instead of 1 oz. I normally have dry lips all my life. I&#x27;ve been using my different things to moisturize my lips but nothing really works. They stay and cover the lips and when they go away my lips get dried again. Few weeks prior to buying this Rosehip oil I had problem on my lower lip and the corner of lips as well. I was not sure if it was angular cheilitis, but it&#x27;s not severe. I used medicated blistex and the irritation seemed to subside but not the skin problem. So after bilstex I covered with different things (not altogether at once) which I have and previously used all the time including petroleum jelly, lip balms, burt&#x27;s bees lip balm, raw yellow shea butter. I did that a few times a day but every morning I would see my skin peel off my lip. It&#x27;s not normal and I never had it before. A few days ago I just didn&#x27;t know what to do and so I looked at the Rosehip oil and told myself, &amp;#34;Why not? whatever happens.&amp;#34; Guess what!!!! The next morning there was no more skin peeling from my lips and my lips become soft and no more dryness like before. This is amazing. I was sorry to think bad about the oil, now this oil will be on my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; list. Now I have good evidence to be patient and see what else this oil will do for me. Thank you Rosehip oil, the seller and amazon.  Looking back on the 1st use with mild allergic reactions that happened I think that, in retrospect, I was wrong to mix the Rosehip oil with raw yellow shea butter and put it on my face. Now that I stop using that raw yellow shea butter my face is fine. I also felt like my pores become smaller but it may be too soon to say. Will wait and see more results. Above all this is a great oil for me.  Now, I have one more evidence to add, my husband had some kind of skin problem on his left ear. The outer layer of skin becomes dry and flaky and peels away in large/small pieces. So I applied Rosehip oil over the affected area and the symptom went away after 4-5 application.</li>
            <li> I love the free bonus Argan Oil and have been using both together. I have been using them to help get rid of stretch marks on my stomach and thighs. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks, but it has made a noticeable difference already. I also use it for moisturizing my face and hair. I love how much it has helped my normally dry/brittle hair! It&#x27;s so much softer and much less frizzy. I love that it is organic and has no parabens or fillers. I also appreciate that there is no fragrance added since fragrances are often chemicals that have negative affects on health. The pump works well and makes application easy. It also doesn&#x27;t dispense too much at a time so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m overusing it or wasting anything.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have tried.  My skin feels much more silky after having used it for about a week (the rosehip oil).  I use it immediately after a shower or after washing my face, and I let it soak in.  Then I apply my normal moisturizer.  I also am going to start applying it to some stretch marks courtesy of my daughter and I&#x27;m hoping it will help diminish the look of them.  I like that this also comes with a bonus of argan oil (isn&#x27;t argan oil so hot right now?).  Argan oil is also a wonderful way to moisturize your skin.  I like using that on my &amp;#34;grandma hands.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve also found that with using this rosehip oil I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer after because my skin is healthier and not as dry.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I had my son for years ago and still have horrible stretch marks. I got this oil to help with that. I have noticed a decrease in just a couple weeks so that&#x27;s great news! It arrived fast and I even had follow up emails making sure I was taking care of. Really good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to help diminish my scars that I have from having skin cancer removed.  I have a one inch scar on my fore arm that I&#x27;ve been using the oil on for 2 weeks now twice a day.  It has started to lose it&#x27;s pinkish color and is becoming more of a skin color.  I&#x27;m also using it on my stretch marks on my stomach.  They&#x27;re now turning white and becoming less and less noticeable.  I&#x27;ve bought tons of creams and oils to help my scars but this is the only oil that lives up to it&#x27;s claim.  I can&#x27;t wait to see my scars and stretch marks after a month or two months of use.  Thank you for such a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I really do not know how to review this item, because the pump on the bottle does not work. I was sent a second one and that pump didn&#x27;t work either. It&#x27;s quite disappointing. The oil inside though seems to be of a good quality though. Because I haven&#x27;t a pump that will work, I can&#x27;t rate this well. I did give the seller 5 stars, but the truth is the pumps apparently are defective that they are putting their product in. I would not reorder this unless this was fixed. If the pump worked, then this would be a better rating. I was so disappointed when receiving the second bottle and the pump still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Two stars for the fast delivery and additional Argan oil.  However, you will get what you paid for.  I used to get rosehip oils from others, and it is my first buy from this seller.  Today I got it and tried to check the quality.  First, the pump was not working at all.  So I had to open the bottle to check the color.  It is very light yellowish.  Almost clear color on the white paper test.  According to my research through online, the unrefined cold pressed one should be amber with orange hue.  And I got the exact color from my first buy through other seller.  I ordered the second bottle from the first seller, and the second one&#x27;s color was not that thick amber.  So I searched again found this seller.  I was glad for the good price plus the extra gift, Argan oil.  I cannot give more than two stars.  I will return this.</li>
            <li> Very light and non-greasy! Looking forward to watching my skin get healthier!</li>
            <li> My skin and hair tend to dry up around this time of year and that can be irritating.  Normally I shy away from moisturizers, because they can make my face greasy or break out more.  This Rose Hip Oil does a great job of moisturizing, without causing my face to become greasy looking.  The oil makes my face feel so soft and gets rid of that itchy dry feeling.  The jar is a decent size (4oz) and should last me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 100% pure, no artificial ingredients, no Parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used Rose Hip Oil before, you should know there is a slight scent, it kind of reminds me of a squash like smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, a small 1 oz jar of Argan Oil is included.  This works great on my hair, I actually like it better than conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy.  I use this right after I wash and brush my hair.  I really like the design of the bottle, there is an easy to use eye dropper attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a slight difficulty using the pump on the bottle of Argan Oil at first, but just be sure to turn the lid to the left, so that it screws on all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item in return for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and I love it too!</li>
            <li> Great to get two fantastic oils (Rosehip Oil and Argan Oil) that I have found to be perfect for moisturizing my skin.  So pleased that the Rosehip Oil is 100% pure, unrefined and comes in a generous 4 ounce bottle with a pump dispenser.  The pump allows me to dispense just a few drops as only a small amount is needed.  Following Dr. Oz &#x27;s tip, I apply Rosehip oil right after my shower while my skin is still moist.  The free bonus of 1 ounce Pure Argan Oil has always been a favorite of mine.  I like to combine the two oils (Rosehip and Argan) and I am so pleased with how my skin feels.  I use this on my face, hands, elbows and heels and can definitely see great results.  Trying this on an old scar and have noticed some improvement.  I intend to continue using this and highly recommend to anyone wanting healthier looking skin.  Risk free to try as there is a full refund if not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very nice stuff, but wish the oil came with a dropper instead of a push pump.</li>
            <li> I love this Rosehip Oil! Since keeping it in the fridge it&#x27;s become one of my favorite refreshing morning routines.  This winter has been especially drying for my skin and even using my regular moisturizer wasn&#x27;t making a difference.  I use a few drops of this oil after washing my face and feel great the rest of the day. Not sure how it will work in the summer when my skin is oilier but I would imagine it would be great after swimming too.</li>
            <li> I already use rosehip oil in my night time routine and I can see wonderful results, but every reshape oil I buy would be of 1oz and this BeautyBe reshape oil is 4oz that itself is a big plus. It has a pump so no mess at all. Absolutely no smell and its pure and organic. Have been using this oil for couple of days and I can see the nourishment it is giving my skin. My face feels hydrated and supple when I wake up in morning. The benefits of rosehip oil is exceptional and this is really doing wonders to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now coming to icing on top, the argan oil, you get a whole 1oz for free! This is wonderful for frizzy hair or any kind of hair I just can&#x27;t stop using this. I had not bought argan oil in sometime because it is expensive but this deal was too good..i can get good use of argan oil since it is still winter. Can be used on dry patches on skin too, but i am totally loving it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;All in all just loving the combo and one of the best and worth oil combo in a long time, worth the investment.</li>
