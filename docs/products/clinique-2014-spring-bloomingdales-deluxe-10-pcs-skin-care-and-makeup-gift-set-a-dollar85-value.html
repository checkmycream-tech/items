            <li>Exceptional transaction.</li>
            <li>Clinique is a wonderful makeup and skincare product and one can usually never go wrong with purchasing their products.  </li>
            <li>LOVE,LOVE ,LOVE, NOTHING MORE TO SAY-GREAT BUY, GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li>I would have liked the option of being able to choose between the two color palettes.</li>
            <li>the bag is so cute.</li>
            <li>soap is great,the case is cute and the make up is nice,for 20 bucks what do I expect...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than paying full price for something that won&#x27;t work!..</li>
            <li>everything that came in it was fresh and packed nicely.</li>
            <li>Love this! came really fast!</li>
            <li>I purchased this one and the colors were fantastic and would buy more of them as they become available</li>
            <li>the products are more like travel size rather than a full size kit</li>
            <li>after 24 yrs ive found an amazingly, smooth, absorbing,fragrance free moisturizer  in my collection.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good deal for genuine Clinique products.</li>
            <li>so thanks for saving me 50 bucks in products,lol...!!</li>
            <li>Great little kit for travel.</li>

            <li>Have Fun...</li>
            <li>It is a pink color, and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Amazon, also offers other name brand &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; that are also great to purchase if you have a certain favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other then the fingernail polish color debacle, all other products are great.  </li>
            <li>: try not to buy from years that are 1.5 to 2 years or older - the products change with age...</li>
            <li>when I opened the package- the liquid soap tube had split wide open &amp; pretty much ruined everything!!  </li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that Amazon.com sells Clinique and other &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; that are usually only available if you purchase at least $40.00 to whatever</li>

            <li> Great deal but the products are more like travel size rather than a full size kit</li>
            <li> Set did not contain items as described.</li>
            <li> Good bargain for the money</li>
            <li> This gift set was terrible- when I opened the package- the liquid soap tube had split wide open &amp; pretty much ruined everything!!  And the color of lipstick---- horrid - I do NOT recommend this gift set to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> Great little kit for travel. Loved it!</li>

            <li> I love the fact that Amazon.com sells Clinique and other &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; that are usually only available if you purchase at least $40.00 to whatever and then you get the &amp;#34;Free Gift&amp;#34;. I purchased this one and the colors were fantastic and would buy more of them as they become available (I do have a couple in my Wish List for next payday).&lt;br /&gt;I do purchase from Clinique and have for 25+ years. Amazon, also offers other name brand &amp;#34;gifts&amp;#34; that are also great to purchase if you have a certain favorite.&lt;br /&gt;My tip: try not to buy from years that are 1.5 to 2 years or older - the products change with age...Have Fun...&lt;br /&gt;PAJ</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the products that were shipped and felt that it was a great value for the money. I bought a second one as a gift to my Aunt.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Set because I wanted to try the cream that came with it.The cream made me break out in less than 24 hours and made my skin feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;The soap is great,the case is cute and the make up is nice,for 20 bucks what do I expect...It&#x27;s better than paying full price for something that won&#x27;t work!..so thanks for saving me 50 bucks in products,lol...!!</li>
            <li> All of the products were delivered as advertised. The colors unfortunately are not appropriate for my complexion. I would have liked the option of being able to choose between the two color palettes. Overall it was a good deal for genuine Clinique products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like any of the colors and everything was very small.  Not what I expected, waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a gift exchange and the recipient loved it!</li>
            <li> Great. Arrived early.</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars based on the hideous color of fingernail polish.  It is a color, that in my opinion, no one would wear.  It is a pink color, and not in a good way.  Other then the fingernail polish color debacle, all other products are great.  Contents of the overall product are what is described on Amazon.  It is a great way to try trial products without spending a fortune.  Clinique is a wonderful makeup and skincare product and one can usually never go wrong with purchasing their products.  The only issue stopping me from buying this product again, is the polish color.</li>
            <li> great product...quick delivery</li>
            <li> Love this! came really fast! Nothing damage at all!</li>
            <li> purchased this item as a gift. everything that came in it was fresh and packed nicely.</li>
