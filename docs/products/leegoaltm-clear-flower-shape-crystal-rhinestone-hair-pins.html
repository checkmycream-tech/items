            <li>Also, I was glad as all get out that it wasn&#x27;t as sparkly as some of these reviews made it out to be.  </li>
            <li>But I love it</li>
            <li>I love these combs</li>

            <li>this was a gift for my good friend who has really beautiful thick hair, we both have horses and live on acreage</li>
            <li>Looks just like the picture, but is kind if heavy and long so best to use it in a bun as shown.</li>

            <li>also it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>

            <li>It is very large, and almost fills my hand.</li>
            <li>It is both useful and pretty.</li>
            <li>Yes, like many others, I too am wary of anything seemingly too cheap, &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; and not Made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous hair pin, but much large than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It is large but it&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li>I just wish vendor just get it right the first time.  </li>
            <li>No complaints at all, except that it can slide out if you dont secure it with hair pins, as it is kind of heavy.</li>
            <li>thank you so much for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I like this hair piece a lot, but the white pearl looking things appear very cheap.</li>
            <li>I will be looking to buy more in other styles if they are available around the holidays for friends and family members.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be equally alluring in a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Trust me, I ordered 4 and was only able to use 1.</li>
            <li>the mothers of the bride and groom love this because they are wearing the same thing as the bride to be.</li>
            <li>This is sturdy and really pretty, but I do have one problem with it.</li>
            <li>It loks pretty</li>
            <li>The design is pretty</li>
            <li>Pretty is the word to describe it.</li>
            <li>I was able to glue it back on.  </li>
            <li>I nailed this one on the first try.  </li>
            <li>These pins though are most definitely not!</li>
            <li>so I am returning the favor here with a higher star rating.  </li>
            <li>it would definitely increase the chances for a more peaceful atmosphere.</li>
            <li>These look exactly like the picture and are&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
            <li>Even though the hair is thrown up in seconds I still think it looks quite fancy and elegant enough to use on a date or a night out!</li>
            <li>This is really pretty.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more along the lines of slightly larger than a bobby pin</li>
            <li>But so so pretty.</li>
            <li>its very pretty &amp; fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>This is completely beautiful, exactly as pictured but very hard to use.  </li>
            <li>Wish it came in other colors, made of nice metes but does noy snag hair.</li>
            <li>for elegant updos on medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>This looks very sparkly and will be a pretty accent for my hair.</li>
            <li>Beautiful but a little big for my wife.</li>
            <li>The crystal hairpin is lovely but the &#x27;legs&#x27; are very long.</li>
            <li>It was easily glued back.</li>
            <li>I got two of these for my daughter, who has long dark blond hair, and it looks absolutely beautiful in an updo.  </li>
            <li>the stick is too long, if it was a smaller stick i would have loved it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind, but it makes the clip almost purely ornamental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While none of these hair pins and barrettes from China are subdued, like the black clip, this one is definitely able to be formal as well as glamorous and fun.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I am not very skilled at doing my own hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t gripe to much though it was cheap enough.</li>
            <li>This vintage hair clip will trick people into thinking you spent more time doing your hair than you did getting ready, or that you had your hair done at a hair salon.</li>
            <li>At only $2.50 each (w/ free shipping), I felt they were a steal.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>However, it is so much prettier in person.</li>
            <li>It really needs that rubberized stuff on the ends of bobby pins.</li>
            <li>but, I don&#x27;t really know how to use it.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay in very well</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using it in my brother&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for my $2.</li>
            <li>Much heavier than anticipated</li>
            <li>This looks cheap and the flower part broke off after the second time I used it.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, holds really well and looks quite dressy.</li>
            <li>and so haven&#x27;t worn it very often.</li>
            <li>having issues getting my straight slippery hair to be stable with this....</li>
            <li>Really heavy/falls out of hair.</li>
            <li>The clip is well made and the jewels are attached to the rod very securely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very well made product.</li>
            <li>I love the idea but the metal is sharp.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend and definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li>It looks elegant on your hair when you make a bun or any other updos.  </li>
            <li>but I think just doing a messy twist looks pretty sexy.</li>
            <li>Very cute and much bigger than what was expected</li>
            <li>Perfect for medium hair length not super thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, arrived intact, but the rhinestone part isn&#x27;t near as shiny or diamond appearing in person.</li>
            <li>This comb far surpassed my expectations of what I was ordering, I am going to use it for each of my daughter&#x27;s when they get married and am making it a family heirloom.</li>
            <li>I do have to work at it to make sure I get the &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; both in and hidden by my hair.</li>
            <li>Now i have to go buy super glue or something to stick it back.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several of these hair clips and they are inexpensive and very pretty.  </li>
            <li>it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful accessory but just a little too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that I like to put up in many different styles.</li>
            <li>The jewels really pop out against the hair and showcase how pretty the clip actually is.</li>
            <li>Very sweet and delicate looking but strong enough to keep my think hair in place.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super busy to send it back.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift, hopeing it would live up to the photo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, but shipping took a very long time, also there was a pearl already broken out of it when I got it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and after sending them a picture (at first they wanted me to send it to back, I wasn&#x27;t about to pay for shipping)</li>
            <li>If you want a pretty clip that will actually hold your hair, keep looking.</li>
            <li>this is a fantastic item for the price wich I stated previously.</li>
            <li>One of the little hearts fell off right out of the package but it was easily fixed with a dab of hot glue.  </li>
            <li>I do find them a bit heavy and more suitable for my thick long hair.</li>
            <li>, order early if you want it for an event or something like that.</li>
            <li>This hairpin always adds a classy element to my up-do.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but order early if this is for an event or gift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and just like the picture, yet not like a weird halo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very heavy and sturdy (the heavy is an issue for my super fine hair) but I will find a way to make this work!</li>
            <li>On the downside, it does take a few weeks for the item to arrive, but well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I ordered two because I was not sure it would stay in my hair as my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crystal, jeweled and the white is vibrant.</li>
            <li>However, I simply could NOT find any formal hairpins or clips that were decently priced (read that as below $40.00) and so decided to try this piece.  </li>
            <li>It is very beautiful and heavy and looks classy, however, because of the way it was shipped via small slightly padded envelope through the regular USPS mail as soon as I took it out of the packaging, a pearl stone fell off.</li>
            <li>The piece is heavier than expected and is not a clip, it&#x27;s exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I enjoy throwing my hair up in a messy twist and sticking the clip through the hair for an up-do that takes only seconds to do!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to style in fine hair</li>
            <li>Seem to be hard to put in your hair if it is fine, and they don&#x27;t want to stay in.</li>
            <li>Most other hair pins fall after a few minutes, but this pin holds my hair in place for hours.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far larger than that.  </li>
            <li>It is very pretty, but it is a little bigger and heavier</li>
            <li>but they are super big &amp; heavy.</li>
            <li>then i expected, Looked a little cheap.</li>
            <li>I like that the wire part is thicker than some of the other hair sticks I have so that the ends don&#x27;t poke as much.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but very heavy.</li>
            <li>it sticks out too far on the other side, even for having as thick hair as I do, it falls out way too easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at least as good of quality as the $20 hairpieces you could pick up at Walmart, and for such a small fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li>i have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I do need to warn you though that if you have fine or thin hair it will not stay.</li>

            <li> Beautiful and high quality!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> The ends stick out a bit when I put my hair up, but maybe for thicker hair it would work better.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Pleased.</li>
            <li> No way can you have more than 1 in your head at a time.</li>
            <li> love thisbits so charming and looks to be worth more than it is b</li>
            <li> I am not insulting them, but history tells me beware of things made in China.</li>
            <li> Also, I was glad as all get out that it wasn&#x27;t as sparkly as some of these reviews made it out to be.  </li>
            <li> But I love it</li>
            <li> I love these combs</li>
            <li> but I really love the design and</li>
            <li> Love...</li>
            <li> Love the hair pin....</li>
            <li> that said it&#x27;s a lovely piece</li>
            <li> This hair piece looks lovely in your hair.</li>
            <li> I wish I had more of them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure she will use it, again</li>
            <li> Was going to wear to wedding but glad it didn&#x27;t fall out then.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m able ot use it for my wedding now</li>
            <li> but its so much more versatile than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Its more of a hair comb as it just slides in without clips or pins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this more than once</li>
            <li> so maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
            <li> I receive loads of compliments on this - Leegoal Lovely Vintage Jewelry Crystal Hair Clips</li>

            <li> I was so glad at how surprised and happy this gift turned out to be.</li>

            <li> great  hair accessories, look very pretty, wore to a wedding, everyone comment how pretty they were.</li>
            <li> The prongs are long and sturdy to ensure a secure hold, and the combination of crystals and pearly hearts is very dainty.</li>
            <li> now all i need is an out fit to wear it with .. :)</li>
            <li> If you have hair that is not thin, it would be gorgeous.</li>

            <li> Really, really pretty and well made, love it!</li>
            <li> The pearls were all off when the packaged arrived and the others were so easy to come off.</li>
            <li> This looks great tucked into the top of a French twist &amp; when I twist braids into a bun&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get it to stay in my hair easily.  </li>
            <li> if you are thinking of them for gifts, they are super nice in that the jewels are good quality and well set suitable for long hair.</li>
            <li> Such Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> and so far have not been successful.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful pin.</li>
            <li> I still got it to work by using Bobbie pins and they worked fine .</li>
            <li> I see this pin as working just fine.  </li>
            <li> It is super cute.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous, larger than expected but very beautiful.</li>
            <li> ENJOY</li>
            <li> Need to pin it to hold securely.</li>
            <li> OK, worth it.</li>
            <li> The fork part is smooth &amp; won&#x27;t stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> but it does look cheap..</li>
            <li> So cheaply made no point asking for a replacement</li>
            <li> Broke when I was putting n hair &amp; looks cheap.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> ---is great enough bought</li>
            <li> great price for such beauty.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought, but thats even better.&lt;br /&gt;Looks great in my hair</li>
            <li> beautiful one but for long hair</li>
            <li> These hair clips are super nice and seem to be made very well.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, it is very sturdy and solid and both the ends have a good solid kink to be able to hold your hair up.</li>
            <li> these are lovely and look exactly as they do on line.  </li>
            <li> worked great for long hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth even twice what I paid!</li>
            <li> Although it took about a month to get here, and not in time for my daughter&#x27;s Prom, the hair clip is of fine quality and very pretty.</li>
            <li> very beautiful and kinda heavy but worth the price..thank you for that</li>
            <li> More white with any accent color would be nice.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful, so are the other&#x27;s that I ordered.</li>
            <li> Maybe for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I am saving it for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> It stays in v. pretty to wear, it does not look cheap but was cheap to buy.</li>
            <li> It is a lil larger than I thought but still gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It is still very sparkly, noticeable, and elegant.</li>
            <li> It is made very well, sparkles and looks lovely.</li>
            <li> It would be excellent for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> The metal and decorations all appear to be of good quality and have not shown any wear after several uses.</li>
            <li> While the jewels are not Tiffany&#x27;s by any stretch, it makes a beautiful pop in dark blonde/brunette/chocolate hairstyles.  </li>
            <li> this was a gift for my good friend who has really beautiful thick hair, we both have horses and live on acreage</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture, but is kind if heavy and long so best to use it in a bun as shown.</li>
            <li> This hair piece came quick.</li>
            <li> also it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> so when we go to town its fun to add a special something.  </li>
            <li> This item was very nice and delicate, the metal is strong and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap once it is in the hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty hair pin.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> The clip is pretty - the faux pearls and rhinestones are well placed and secure.  </li>
            <li> It looks very pretty in both hair styles.</li>
            <li> The design is very pretty.</li>
            <li> the shimmer very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought it would to receive.</li>
            <li> It is very classy and stylish for day or night wear.</li>
            <li> And came with no instructions so first I have to figure out how to wear it in my hair!</li>
            <li> this hair pin is so pretty!</li>
            <li> It looks pretty with outfits of any color!  </li>
            <li> Very Pretty and just the right size.</li>
            <li> very pretty, kind of heavy and sturdy, great to hold up a big bun if you have lots of hair</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and very pretty!</li>
            <li> Honestly it looks okay with the missing pearls, although I prefer to superglue them on before wearing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, This is not lightweight and cheap.</li>
            <li> Be sure to secure it properly.</li>
            <li> Just have fun with it.</li>
            <li> It took a while to get it, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already worn it twice, again it took some to get it, but it was well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the wait for the 3-4 week shipping.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> for me it was worth the wait as I was not in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of the wow factor from the pics.</li>
            <li> It is a fun to piece.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised; this pin is precious.  </li>
            <li> I spent more time on a hairstyle and used this clip it would look better</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Broke right out of package</li>
            <li> Im going to my cart to order another right now</li>
            <li> the price is right</li>
            <li> Also if you are going to order this as a gift do it right away.</li>
            <li> It is very large, and almost fills my hand.</li>
            <li> It is both useful and pretty.</li>
            <li> Yes, like many others, I too am wary of anything seemingly too cheap, &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; and not Made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous hair pin, but much large than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It is large but it&#x27;s very pretty</li>
            <li> I just wish vendor just get it right the first time.  </li>
            <li> No complaints at all, except that it can slide out if you dont secure it with hair pins, as it is kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I like this hair piece a lot, but the white pearl looking things appear very cheap.</li>
            <li> I will be looking to buy more in other styles if they are available around the holidays for friends and family members.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be equally alluring in a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Trust me, I ordered 4 and was only able to use 1.</li>
            <li> the mothers of the bride and groom love this because they are wearing the same thing as the bride to be.</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and really pretty, but I do have one problem with it.</li>
            <li> It loks pretty</li>
            <li> The design is pretty</li>
            <li> Pretty is the word to describe it.</li>
            <li> I was able to glue it back on.  </li>
            <li> I nailed this one on the first try.  </li>
            <li> These pins though are most definitely not!</li>
            <li> so I am returning the favor here with a higher star rating.  </li>
            <li> it would definitely increase the chances for a more peaceful atmosphere.</li>
            <li> These look exactly like the picture and are&lt;br /&gt;excellent</li>
            <li> Even though the hair is thrown up in seconds I still think it looks quite fancy and elegant enough to use on a date or a night out!</li>
            <li> This is really pretty.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be more along the lines of slightly larger than a bobby pin</li>
            <li> But so so pretty.</li>
            <li> its very pretty &amp; fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> This is completely beautiful, exactly as pictured but very hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Wish it came in other colors, made of nice metes but does noy snag hair.</li>
            <li> for elegant updos on medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> This looks very sparkly and will be a pretty accent for my hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but a little big for my wife.</li>
            <li> The crystal hairpin is lovely but the &#x27;legs&#x27; are very long.</li>
            <li> It was easily glued back.</li>
            <li> I got two of these for my daughter, who has long dark blond hair, and it looks absolutely beautiful in an updo.  </li>
            <li> the stick is too long, if it was a smaller stick i would have loved it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind, but it makes the clip almost purely ornamental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While none of these hair pins and barrettes from China are subdued, like the black clip, this one is definitely able to be formal as well as glamorous and fun.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I am not very skilled at doing my own hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t gripe to much though it was cheap enough.</li>
            <li> This vintage hair clip will trick people into thinking you spent more time doing your hair than you did getting ready, or that you had your hair done at a hair salon.</li>
            <li> At only $2.50 each (w/ free shipping), I felt they were a steal.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> However, it is so much prettier in person.</li>
            <li> It really needs that rubberized stuff on the ends of bobby pins.</li>
            <li> but, I don&#x27;t really know how to use it.  </li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay in very well</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using it in my brother&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for my $2.</li>
            <li> Much heavier than anticipated</li>
            <li> This looks cheap and the flower part broke off after the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, holds really well and looks quite dressy.</li>
            <li> and so haven&#x27;t worn it very often.</li>
            <li> having issues getting my straight slippery hair to be stable with this....</li>
            <li> Really heavy/falls out of hair.</li>
            <li> The clip is well made and the jewels are attached to the rod very securely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very well made product.</li>
            <li> I love the idea but the metal is sharp.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend and definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li> It looks elegant on your hair when you make a bun or any other updos.  </li>
            <li> but I think just doing a messy twist looks pretty sexy.</li>
            <li> Very cute and much bigger than what was expected</li>
            <li> Perfect for medium hair length not super thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, arrived intact, but the rhinestone part isn&#x27;t near as shiny or diamond appearing in person.</li>
            <li> This comb far surpassed my expectations of what I was ordering, I am going to use it for each of my daughter&#x27;s when they get married and am making it a family heirloom.</li>
            <li> I do have to work at it to make sure I get the &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; both in and hidden by my hair.</li>
            <li> Now i have to go buy super glue or something to stick it back.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several of these hair clips and they are inexpensive and very pretty.  </li>
            <li> it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful accessory but just a little too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I like to put up in many different styles.</li>
            <li> The jewels really pop out against the hair and showcase how pretty the clip actually is.</li>
            <li> Very sweet and delicate looking but strong enough to keep my think hair in place.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super busy to send it back.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, hopeing it would live up to the photo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, but shipping took a very long time, also there was a pearl already broken out of it when I got it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and after sending them a picture (at first they wanted me to send it to back, I wasn&#x27;t about to pay for shipping)</li>
            <li> If you want a pretty clip that will actually hold your hair, keep looking.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic item for the price wich I stated previously.</li>
            <li> One of the little hearts fell off right out of the package but it was easily fixed with a dab of hot glue.  </li>
            <li> I do find them a bit heavy and more suitable for my thick long hair.</li>
            <li> , order early if you want it for an event or something like that.</li>
            <li> This hairpin always adds a classy element to my up-do.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but order early if this is for an event or gift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous and just like the picture, yet not like a weird halo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and sturdy (the heavy is an issue for my super fine hair) but I will find a way to make this work!</li>
            <li> On the downside, it does take a few weeks for the item to arrive, but well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I ordered two because I was not sure it would stay in my hair as my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crystal, jeweled and the white is vibrant.</li>
            <li> However, I simply could NOT find any formal hairpins or clips that were decently priced (read that as below $40.00) and so decided to try this piece.  </li>
            <li> It is very beautiful and heavy and looks classy, however, because of the way it was shipped via small slightly padded envelope through the regular USPS mail as soon as I took it out of the packaging, a pearl stone fell off.</li>
            <li> The piece is heavier than expected and is not a clip, it&#x27;s exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I enjoy throwing my hair up in a messy twist and sticking the clip through the hair for an up-do that takes only seconds to do!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to style in fine hair</li>
            <li> Seem to be hard to put in your hair if it is fine, and they don&#x27;t want to stay in.</li>
            <li> Most other hair pins fall after a few minutes, but this pin holds my hair in place for hours.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far larger than that.  </li>
            <li> It is very pretty, but it is a little bigger and heavier</li>
            <li> but they are super big &amp; heavy.</li>
            <li> then i expected, Looked a little cheap.</li>
            <li> I like that the wire part is thicker than some of the other hair sticks I have so that the ends don&#x27;t poke as much.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but very heavy.</li>
            <li> it sticks out too far on the other side, even for having as thick hair as I do, it falls out way too easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at least as good of quality as the $20 hairpieces you could pick up at Walmart, and for such a small fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li> i have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I do need to warn you though that if you have fine or thin hair it will not stay.</li>
            <li> So pretty but very heavy.</li>
            <li> very pretty, but need thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I have heavy long hair and with this pin I can keep my hair updo for the whole day.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty but a little heavy.</li>
            <li> they are very large and should be used to pin either long or thick hair.  </li>
            <li> So pretty and delicate.</li>
            <li> and quality of material looks like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very long (middle of my butt) hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (past my shoulder blades) and this &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; can&#x27;t really keep my hair in place.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few tries for it to really stick.</li>
            <li> not only is this item tacky and cheap it is manufactured very poorly.</li>
            <li> It took a little while, because it came from so far.</li>
            <li> Probably would have sent it back unless cost for shipping was so high - too hard to use</li>
            <li> The prongs are thick and it was the right length to not stick out on the other end of the hair bun.</li>
            <li> , I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...</li>
            <li> I had it in my long hair in my bun</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone to buy this if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> they arrived two weeks earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> The only thing, it needs careful handling as the stones might fall</li>
            <li> If you can hang on for the verrrrrry long shipping time.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so long.</li>
            <li> they were larger than i expected.</li>
            <li> And I know you get what you paid for, but regardless, even if I waste 50 cents on smtg I don&#x27;t expect it to fall apart right out of the package :/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but the metal part that you have to hide under your hair is much longer and thicker than I expected and very difficult to hide.</li>
            <li> Very pretty though, looks expensive if you can keep it in your hair without it falling out or beads falling off.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty and will make any outfit from casual to fancy a little&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> The metal is very sturdy but it just feels way too hard and heavy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend, I am sure if was in the hair from a distance it wouldn&#x27;t  look bad</li>
            <li> This is definitely not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> than I expected based on the photo.</li>
            <li> and I have to be really careful pushing it through to avoid damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> It came about 1 week before expected.</li>
            <li> It came a lot sooner then expected.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair up unless it was wet.</li>
            <li> Not very functional hair pieces.</li>
            <li> The ends of the prongs are really rough and sharp.</li>
            <li> This piece looks just a bit cheaper than the picture due to plastic petals, and the ends of the pin are blunt and rough.</li>
            <li> I previously rated this a 3 star due to the long wait.</li>
            <li> SOOOO big for anyone&#x27;s hair even if you have thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> Delivery from China takes a little long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but I wanted to use this for my wedding, and It&#x27;s not going to work, plus before I even got it, the fake pearl hearts had already fallen off.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the design is such that you can&#x27;t push the U-pin in past the beginning of the gem design.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, it shipped missing 3!</li>
            <li> Its too long and heavy to be use with the bun style</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and has very long teeth</li>
            <li> Not a single gem was missing!!</li>
            <li> Hair clip was delivered sealed in its packaging, missing 4 of the faux pearls, 1 of which was loose in the packaging.</li>
            <li> Usually the shipping of my other clips took weeks to arrive, but this one didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> The ONLY negative is that</li>
            <li> not worth paying for something I have to fix</li>
            <li> Just not worth ir.</li>
            <li> These are very heavy clips, and the stems are quite long.</li>
            <li> It slips off no matter how I inserted, whether used one or both together, after less than a minute.</li>
            <li> so the spokes attached are well hidden</li>
            <li> This item arrived with half the gems fallen off within the package.</li>
            <li> You may need a bobby pin here or there if you might be very active to lock it in.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and it looks like it was just barely attatched to begin with</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and often wear it up.</li>
            <li> A little heavy.  </li>
            <li> Only for sporadic use and need very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> the prongs on the hair piece are too large and thick, too difficult to put in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also the brooch is heavy</li>
            <li> Heavy, must use bobby pins.  </li>
            <li> so this was just a waste..</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> All the stone and gems were in place and nothing was missing.</li>
            <li> Someone with thin hair that is short might have problems using this.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s quite heavy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too heavy and will hold up throughout the day in a bun.</li>
            <li> and I ordered another one and intend to superglue the missing pearls on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the heavy side and my hair is.</li>
            <li> The comb is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Parts of the decoration were missing.</li>
            <li> This piece is surprisingly heavy.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and stays in well.</li>
            <li> Beads fell out after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I use it in my &amp;#34;buns&amp;#34; to dress up my hair and holds firmly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hair is so thin, it doesn&#x27;t hold it very well.  </li>
            <li> I have very long very thick very heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Last time I had ordered hair pins (not these or from this seller), the prongs broke in half when I took the pin out of the packaging because they&#x27;re so thin and poorly made.</li>
            <li> if not more so than they look in the online photo.</li>
            <li> and so b is the product usually when ii write a review</li>
            <li> (my hair is past my shoulder blades).  </li>
            <li> I have hair past my waist.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and can usually get anything to work</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased with purchase all the pearls were out when it arrived.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very heavy and proportionally small.  </li>
            <li> Its just very heavy to keep in your hair.  </li>
            <li> That is because this design is hard to find (with the teeth farther apart).</li>
            <li> it came to late</li>
            <li> white plastic things attached to the flowers have fallen off in one use :( waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately within about 2 to 3 weeks, after using it just a few times it fell apart.  </li>
            <li> but as they are thick I could see it being an issue for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I order different styles and have never been disappointed with any of them.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I bought pair of these found them to be not only useless but painful.</li>
            <li> you probably can&#x27;t were it if your hair is thin.</li>
            <li> Also - it was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think would stay in thin hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look bad without it, just hoping no more pop out.</li>
            <li> looks expensive.</li>
            <li> Was broken in the package!</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> pearl hearts not perfect except for price</li>
            <li> LOOKS EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> Dress it up or casual wear.</li>
            <li> Very thin.  </li>
            <li> i didnt even touch it, hard to put  in hair:(</li>
            <li> crazy  (seems to be my thing now</li>
            <li> So sad&#x3D;( &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> And going in and staying on, both are painful, as the metal is heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because some of the jewels were off.</li>
            <li> but once they arrive you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It sparkles like crazy!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>
            <li> If it was awful, I wouldn&#x27;t cry over the price.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use if you have thick hair. I received it and 2 pearls fell off in the package. You pay for what you get!</li>
            <li> The picture does this ZERO justice. It is beautiful. The ONLY negative is that the &amp;#34;pearlized&amp;#34; element to it is plastic. However. the bling offsets it &amp; it is gorgeous in a smoothed coif. I&#x27;m sure it would be equally alluring in a &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; look but I was going for the sleek elegance. At this price buy 2-3 so you have a back-up or if you went to have a duality to your do and have a couple for gifts. They are that nice.</li>
            <li> This hair piece came quick. I was disappointed because some of the jewels were off. I can glue them back. Also the brooch is heavy you probably can&#x27;t were it if your hair is thin.Its probably good to stick in like a bun hairdo.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these hair clips and they are inexpensive and very pretty.  Delivery from China takes a little long but once they arrive you will not be disappointed.  Jewelry for your hair, perfect for the holidays.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous.  Took three weeks to arrive</li>
            <li> I got two of these for my daughter, who has long dark blond hair, and it looks absolutely beautiful in an updo.  The prongs are long and sturdy to ensure a secure hold, and the combination of crystals and pearly hearts is very dainty.</li>
            <li> Heavy, must use bobby pins.  Beads fall off.  Only for sporadic use and need very thick hair.  Very pretty though, looks expensive if you can keep it in your hair without it falling out or beads falling off.</li>
            <li> Broke right out of package</li>
            <li> This product arrived in perfect condition, way ahead of the scheduled time. It is a lil larger than I thought but still gorgeous. Love it!</li>
            <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not for everyday wear. It was bigger than I imagined, and a lot heavier. Maybe for special occasions.</li>
            <li> very beautiful and kinda heavy but worth the price..thank you for that and i love it</li>
            <li> Prefect for my wedding!!</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and it looks like it was just barely attatched to begin with so this was just a waste..</li>
            <li> Beautiful Just like the picture</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty hair pin.  Its just very heavy to keep in your hair.  Be sure to secure it properly.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty but a little heavy. I had it in my long hair in my bun and when I bent over, it fell out hit, the floor and one of the pearls broke off.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, larger than expected but very beautiful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, but shipping took a very long time, also there was a pearl already broken out of it when I got it. It was easily glued back. I can&#x27;t gripe to much though it was cheap enough.</li>
            <li> Very elegant hair ornament. It&#x27;s a bit longer than I expected based on the photo. The ends stick out a bit when I put my hair up, but maybe for thicker hair it would work better. It took a while to get here, since it shipped from Asia, but it was worth the wait, and arrived in perfect condition. Not a single gem was missing!! Great product.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and often wear it up. When I saw these hairpins, I figured - what do I have to lose? At only $2.50 each (w/ free shipping), I felt they were a steal. I bought two, and upon receiving them, I was not disappointed! Quite the contrary - they are as beautiful if not more so than they look in the online photo. Every time I wear one of these, I get tons of compliments! None of the beading or crystals have fallen off, which has been an additional pleasant surprise. I will be looking to buy more in other styles if they are available around the holidays for friends and family members. (Great stocking stuffers!!)</li>
            <li> Very pretty but as I took it out of the bag it came in, some of the pearls fell off</li>
            <li> No where in my hair can I wear this pointed piece of metal. Waste of money. Couldn&#x27;t give it away.</li>
            <li> This item is just beautiful. And it feels very solid. It keeps my hair in place and it doesn&#x27;t wiggle around like some pins do. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product came three weeks before the shipping deadline, and i love it! Its just like the picture. No complaints at all, except that it can slide out if you dont secure it with hair pins, as it is kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> Well made and absolutely gorgeous piece! It sparkles like crazy! For the price, this is a steal! I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great for a wedding updo. The piece is heavier than expected and is not a clip, it&#x27;s exactly like the picture. All the stone and gems were in place and nothing was missing.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, hopeing it would live up to the photo. However, it is so much prettier in person. It&#x27;s crystal, jeweled and the white is vibrant. It will work nicely around a bun, twist or pony tail. Just have fun with it. Dress it up or casual wear. Either way it&#x27;s a good addition to anyone&#x27;s hair accessories. ENJOY also it arrived quickly. A plus.</li>
            <li> This is a nice clip, good quality at a remarkable price.  It took a while to get it, but it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty piece and it was perfectly intact when I got it. Great piece great price. Pleased.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t imagine how beautiful it really is until you see it. So very pleased! I get tons of compliments!</li>
            <li> These are very heavy clips, and the stems are quite long. No way can you have more than 1 in your head at a time. Trust me, I ordered 4 and was only able to use 1. I&#x27;ll just give the rest away, they cost nothing. Looked nice in my hair even though it added like a 1/2 pound of weight to my head.</li>
            <li> very pretty, has a nice size on it and has a bit of weight to it so you know it&#x27;s there, would recommend</li>
            <li> Im going to my cart to order another right now love thisbits so charming and looks to be worth more than it is b I am very excited to share this find with others the price is right and so b is the product usually when ii write a review I look for something to complain but I can not find anything if u had to nit pic about something I would say the shipping but it wwas to be exspected 17-28 days</li>
            <li> Beautiful and really well made. I do find them a bit heavy and more suitable for my thick long hair. Someone with thin hair that is short might have problems using this. I bought two of them and can&#x27;t wait to wear them!</li>
            <li> Never used it because it just looks like I got it at a dollar store. Get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my good friend who has really beautiful thick hair, we both have horses and live on acreage so when we go to town its fun to add a special something.  When she opened the package this was in I was so glad at how surprised and happy this gift turned out to be.</li>
            <li> It is very beautiful and heavy and looks classy, however, because of the way it was shipped via small slightly padded envelope through the regular USPS mail as soon as I took it out of the packaging, a pearl stone fell off.</li>
            <li> not only is this item tacky and cheap it is manufactured very poorly. as soon as I took it out of the packaging, a stone fell.</li>
            <li> the mothers of the bride and groom love this because they are wearing the same thing as the bride to be.</li>
            <li> Although it took about a month to get here, and not in time for my daughter&#x27;s Prom, the hair clip is of fine quality and very pretty. Hopefully there will be another occasion she can use it. Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my bridesmaids.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  On the downside, it does take a few weeks for the item to arrive, but well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Gave to friend as a gift.  They absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> faster than said very beautiful</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself and one for a friend, while it&#x27;s gorgeous one of my beads popped out even before wearing it. It doesn&#x27;t look bad without it, just hoping no more pop out. Also, I haven&#x27;t figured out how to wear it, it&#x27;s quite heavy.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but very heavy. Need to pin it to hold securely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but I wanted to use this for my wedding, and It&#x27;s not going to work, plus before I even got it, the fake pearl hearts had already fallen off.</li>
            <li> This tool was much bigger than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> This feels sturdy and looks beautiful. I place it thru my bun for an extra touch of beauty. It&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I like how this pin holds my hair and the way it looks. Most other hair pins fall after a few minutes, but this pin holds my hair in place for hours. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well it is like this, I do not know what it is made of. Like nickel which I am allergic to, because it has no info on the package. It is beautiful, but I am weary of using things made in China. I am not insulting them, but history tells me beware of things made in China. I just put it up, until I find out what metal this is.</li>
            <li> These are gorgeous.  I would highly recommend this and I can&#x27;t say enough, I am trying, almost there.  OK, worth it.</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and really pretty, but I do have one problem with it. The ends of the prongs are really rough and sharp. I can hear it tear my hair as I push it through. It really needs that rubberized stuff on the ends of bobby pins. I still use it, but only on occasion and I have to be really careful pushing it through to avoid damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because it is so beautiful and really it is actually well made.  All 3 that I ordered were intact upon arrival.  That being said, they do not have rubberized prongs.  Also, I was glad as all get out that it wasn&#x27;t as sparkly as some of these reviews made it out to be.  It&#x27;s gorgeous and just like the picture, yet not like a weird halo is going to engulf you the entire time you wear it.</li>
            <li> Based on looks, five stars.  I haven&#x27;t tried it out yet.  My daughter has her prom coming up we plan to try it out then.  I purchased an assortment of these to try.</li>
            <li> The pearls were all off when the packaged arrived and the others were so easy to come off. I contacted the seller and after sending them a picture (at first they wanted me to send it to back, I wasn&#x27;t about to pay for shipping) they refunded me my money (it&#x27;s only been a couple days so I&#x27;m waiting for my money) but it was very cheap.</li>
            <li> I love the idea but the metal is sharp. It gets tangled and pulls out my hair. But I love it</li>
            <li> I wish I knew how to use it.  I like the quality and the look but, I don&#x27;t really know how to use it.  Perhaps my hairdresser will. It comes from China so, order early if you want it for an event or something like that.</li>
            <li> I ordered two because I was not sure it would stay in my hair as my hair is fine. if you take up your hair and lock the two together it will last all day . I love these combs they are very beautiful and a compliment reciever. More white with any accent color would be nice.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I really love the design and the quality is good. Perfect for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I have worn this several occasions and have had many compliments on how beautiful it is and easy to wear....so versatile and beautiful....I am sure those that have liked it will be getting one soon...Keep up the great pieces....Love...Love...Love!</li>
            <li> Very Pretty and just the right size. I used it for my wedding updo. it&#x27;s not too heavy and will hold up throughout the day in a bun.</li>
            <li> Love the hair pin.... it is so beautiful and easy to work with..... I will continue to look for hair pin like this one</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller to let them know that two of the pearls had fallen off. that said it&#x27;s a lovely piece and I ordered another one and intend to superglue the missing pearls on. That is because this design is hard to find (with the teeth farther apart). Honestly it looks okay with the missing pearls, although I prefer to superglue them on before wearing. I am waiting for the second one and will probably remove them all and superglue them all on. If the pearls were properly secured and I did not have to superglue this would definitely be a five star rating. The rest appears of good quality.</li>
            <li> This hair piece looks lovely in your hair. I have long hair that I like to put up in many different styles. This hairpin always adds a classy element to my up-do. I wish I had more of them.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair piece. It&#x27;s on the heavy side and my hair is. Very thin.  I still got it to work by using Bobbie pins and they worked fine .</li>
            <li> It took a little while, because it came from so far. It is very large, and almost fills my hand. The colors are beautiful, it is very sturdy and solid and both the ends have a good solid kink to be able to hold your hair up. Very well made.</li>
            <li> While none of these hair pins and barrettes from China are subdued, like the black clip, this one is definitely able to be formal as well as glamorous and fun.  This one is suitable for even a bridal updo. It is still very sparkly, noticeable, and elegant. Definitely recommend and definitely worth the wait!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay in very well</li>
            <li> I really like this. It stays in v. pretty to wear, it does not look cheap but was cheap to buy.</li>
            <li> This is an amazingly beautiful piece.  I got it for my neighbor for her birthday and she gave it to her daughter.  it is extremely good looking</li>
            <li> My daughter used this in an updo and it was beautiful and everyone commented on, it worth the price and I&#x27;m sure she will use it, again</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Unfortunately my hair is so thin, it doesn&#x27;t hold it very well.  If you have hair that is not thin, it would be gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It was a lot bigger then i expected, Looked a little cheap. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend, I am sure if was in the hair from a distance it wouldn&#x27;t  look bad</li>
            <li> I bought pair of these found them to be not only useless but painful. It slips off no matter how I inserted, whether used one or both together, after less than a minute. And going in and staying on, both are painful, as the metal is heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my clips are in about 10 pieces now as the decorations fell apart. I&#x27;ve attempted to use this several times and trashed it.</li>
            <li> very pretty, kind of heavy and sturdy, great to hold up a big bun if you have lots of hair</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this hair clip for beautiful hair. It is both useful and pretty. I would recommend this to everyone to buy this if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> Loved this at first.  Unfortunately within about 2 to 3 weeks, after using it just a few times it fell apart.  The &amp;#34;pearls and diamonds&amp;#34; fell off from the clip / tong.</li>
            <li> I like the hairpin.  i just don&#x27;t think it will work in my hair.  i have fine thin hair.  It will take time to work with it.</li>
            <li> This item was very nice and delicate, the metal is strong and it doesn&#x27;t look cheap once it is in the hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long very thick very heavy hair.  I see this pin as working just fine.  I put it in my hair as soon as i opened it and it held nicely.  The prongs are thick and it was the right length to not stick out on the other end of the hair bun.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but they are super big &amp; heavy. The fork part is smooth &amp; won&#x27;t stay in your hair. Mine fell out &amp; broke apart when it hit the floor. Was going to wear to wedding but glad it didn&#x27;t fall out then. What a disaster that would have been.</li>
            <li> This product came in today on May 15 instead of the May28-June 13 that it estimated to deliver.  However, when I open it to try on my hair...the pin did NOT hold...it&#x27;s so lose and basically falls off my hair when I had it in a bun.  Also, one of the heart pearl pieces came off when I took it out b/c I saw in in the bag...sigh. Now i have to go buy super glue or something to stick it back.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m able ot use it for my wedding now since I do not what to bother with something that will fall off on me.  It loks pretty but it does look cheap..not worth paying for something I have to fix and I&#x27;m super busy to send it back.  I just wish vendor just get it right the first time.  So sad&#x3D;( &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> The clip is pretty - the faux pearls and rhinestones are well placed and secure.  However, it&#x27;s very heavy and proportionally small.  I have long hair (past my shoulder blades) and this &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; can&#x27;t really keep my hair in place.  Furthermore, the design is such that you can&#x27;t push the U-pin in past the beginning of the gem design.  The design is pretty so I don&#x27;t mind, but it makes the clip almost purely ornamental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a decorative hair pin to stick into an already made bun, get this.  If you want a pretty clip that will actually hold your hair, keep looking.</li>
            <li> great  hair accessories, look very pretty, wore to a wedding, everyone comment how pretty they were. thank you so much for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Far nicer than I expected for the price...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and has very long teeth so it&#x27;s hard to style in fine hair (my hair is past my shoulder blades).  Also - it was broken when I received it. So cheaply made no point asking for a replacement - I don&#x27;t want another one.</li>
            <li> Amazing accessory for the hair! Completed the outfit!</li>
            <li> Finally received the clip. ITs beautiful. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is beautiful!  I do need to warn you though that if you have fine or thin hair it will not stay. The comb is a bit heavy and I don&#x27;t think would stay in thin hair. Also if you are going to order this as a gift do it right away. It took quite a while to reach me.</li>
            <li> Parts of the decoration were missing. I was really looking forward to using it in my brother&#x27;s wedding but it&#x27;s very noticeable. I can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> Hair clip was delivered sealed in its packaging, missing 4 of the faux pearls, 1 of which was loose in the packaging. Obviously, it shipped missing 3!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for my $2. I liked how it looked online but its so much more versatile than I thought it would be. Its more of a hair comb as it just slides in without clips or pins. I have very thick hair so the spokes attached are well hidden but as they are thick I could see it being an issue for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised. I bought this because it was under $2 and it looked like it could be a winner. Glad I jumped! It came about 1 week before expected. This piece is surprisingly heavy. It&#x27;s at least as good of quality as the $20 hairpieces you could pick up at Walmart, and for such a small fraction of the price!  Great product!</li>
            <li> This looks great tucked into the top of a French twist &amp; when I twist braids into a bun&lt;br /&gt; It looks very pretty in both hair styles.</li>
            <li> these are lovely and look exactly as they do on line.  they are very large and should be used to pin either long or thick hair.  they arrived two weeks earlier than expected.  thank you.</li>
            <li> Really, really pretty and well made, love it!</li>
            <li> Much heavier than anticipated</li>
            <li> Broke when I was putting n hair &amp; looks cheap.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty, but it is a little bigger and heavier then I thought! And came with no instructions so first I have to figure out how to wear it in my hair!</li>
            <li> This one is awesome and I&#x27;ve already worn it twice, again it took some to get it, but it was well worth the wait.  Great price!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful accessory but just a little too heavy for my hair. It is made very well, sparkles and looks lovely. I expect it will last for years to come. It would be excellent for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but the metal part that you have to hide under your hair is much longer and thicker than I expected and very difficult to hide. The metal is very sturdy but it just feels way too hard and heavy. I&#x27;ve tried to use this more than once and so far have not been successful. I don&#x27;t think you could use it as pictured because having a bun that low on your head, the metal would definitely be sticking out the bottom. That being said, I am not very skilled at doing my own hair so maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck. The part with the flowers and the leaves is very pretty so if you can get it to work for you, great!</li>
            <li> Nice product for any occasion .  It is very pretty and will make any outfit from casual to fancy a little&lt;br /&gt;More feminine.</li>
            <li> Pretty is the word to describe it. It is sturdy and looks beautiful on the buns. I receive loads of compliments on this - Leegoal Lovely Vintage Jewelry Crystal Hair Clips Hairpins.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This looks cheap and the flower part broke off after the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four star, because one of the heart beads fell off.  I was able to glue it back on.  It is super cute.  I have hair past my waist. I put my hair in a ponytail then twist my hair in a bun.  This is all I need to hold my bun in place.  It works great. It came a lot sooner then expected.  I would order from this company again.  I would recommend buying.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy. And beautiful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for my bridesmaid accessories.  I just got these to see if they would work.  Well the price helped too... they were relatively inexpensive.  Talk about hitting the nail on the head....I nailed this one on the first try.  GET THIS!!! The clip is beautiful&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I like this hair piece a lot, but the white pearl looking things appear very cheap. ... you get what you pay for.  :)...</li>
            <li> This item is prettier than the picture. This item is exceptionally well made for the type of item it is. A wonderful value.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair pin.  I order these all the time for friends etc.  Everybody loves these well made pins.  I order different styles and have never been disappointed with any of them.  Well worth the wait for the 3-4 week shipping.</li>
            <li> The design is very pretty. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought it would to receive.</li>
            <li> Its a beautiful piece and looks lovely on wearing. I was scared to place an order initially but gave it a shot and I am happy I did so. The only thing, it needs careful handling as the stones might fall off(it will happen with any such ornament).The packaging was excellent and came well in time.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these. Last time I had ordered hair pins (not these or from this seller), the prongs broke in half when I took the pin out of the packaging because they&#x27;re so thin and poorly made. These pins though are most definitely not! They&#x27;re very sturdy. Very beautiful. All the stones were intact. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier! I also got these 3 weeks after I ordered them! I honestly didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get them for another couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait. love love love it.  looks expensive. and quality of material looks like it will last a long time. the shine is amazing</li>
            <li> beautiful one but for long hair</li>
            <li> I previously rated this a 3 star due to the long wait. this upset the seller to no end, they did bend over backward to accomodate me and make sure I had a better experience so I am returning the favor here with a higher star rating.  this is a fantastic item for the price wich I stated previously. they are very beautiful and sturdy. If you can hang on for the verrrrrry long shipping time. for me it was worth the wait as I was not in a hurry. if you are thinking of them for gifts, they are super nice in that the jewels are good quality and well set suitable for long hair. but order early if this is for an event or gift. it will take the full 6 weeks to arrive, unless you live next door of course.</li>
            <li> Nice hair clips,&lt;br /&gt;and I got a Christmas card from them, which is so sweat..&lt;br /&gt;I love it, thank you..</li>
            <li> It looks gorgous in my hair.  I bought another for a friend as a Christmas gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Very nice piece, well made. Works great in the hair, hold hair in place and looks nice in there too</li>
            <li> I have never received them. I was told they would arrive on June 6th as my wedding was on June 12th, but they never arrived. I will be checking my credit card statement and if I have been charged I will be disputing it. Otherwise, I expect to not be charged.</li>
            <li> it sticks out too far on the other side, even for having as thick hair as I do, it falls out way too easily.</li>
            <li> Was broken in the package!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. .The white plastic things attached to the flowers have fallen off in one use :( waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This piece looks just a bit cheaper than the picture due to plastic petals, and the ends of the pin are blunt and rough. It would work better if they were sharpened and thinned. Otherwise, holds really well and looks quite dressy.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!! Just as pictured! I love this item.</li>
            <li> The crystal hairpin is lovely but the &#x27;legs&#x27; are very long. I can&#x27;t just slide it in over a bun in my hair b/c they&#x27;re so long. It&#x27;s a lovely piece, but I get distracted by the metal legs sticking out and so haven&#x27;t worn it very often.</li>
            <li> worked great for long hair. i shaered with my grand daughter and sh e loved it to. lov lov lov</li>
            <li> beautiful.  stays in granddaughters hair well.  I have got to stop buying things I need 3 of !!!!!!!  it would definitely increase the chances for a more peaceful atmosphere.</li>
            <li> My jewels came off  i didnt even touch it, hard to put  in hair:(</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and sturdy.  I do enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, arrived intact, but the rhinestone part isn&#x27;t near as shiny or diamond appearing in person. The pearls do pop out though. I was expecting more of the wow factor from the pics. Not too heavy and stays in well. I do have to work at it to make sure I get the &amp;#34;legs&amp;#34; both in and hidden by my hair.</li>
            <li> This item arrived with half the gems fallen off within the package. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was beautiful!  And I know you get what you paid for, but regardless, even if I waste 50 cents on smtg I don&#x27;t expect it to fall apart right out of the package :/</li>
            <li> this is stunning... having issues getting my straight slippery hair to be stable with this.... I&#x27;m sure with more practice i will get it figured out.. it is a great addition to my wardrobe... now all i need is an out fit to wear it with .. :)</li>
            <li> So pretty and delicate. Perfect for my client&#x27;s upcoming wedding.  This would be perfoect for the entourage.</li>
            <li> my daughter-in-law loved them for her bridal shower.</li>
            <li> Needs lots of hair to make this pin work. very pretty, but need thick long hair.</li>
            <li> i bought too. they were larger than i expected. the shimmer very pretty. i recommend it for its simpleness yet elegant look.</li>
            <li> They look great and I plan on using for my bridesmaids in my wedding :) thought they were a clip but they stick into the hair with the bars</li>
            <li> I wish, I would have found this before my vow renewal. It would have complimented my hair.  It is a fun to piece.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would look cheep after she of the reviews, but it didn&#x27;t!  I love it!  Well worth even twice what I paid!</li>
            <li> the stick is too long, if it was a smaller stick i would have loved it.</li>
            <li> This comb far surpassed my expectations of what I was ordering, I am going to use it for each of my daughter&#x27;s when they get married and am making it a family heirloom. It is beautiful, so are the other&#x27;s that I ordered. Very Happy.</li>
            <li> Really heavy/falls out of hair. Beads fell out after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I chose to order two of these at the same time. They arrived quickly and undamaged. The metal and decorations all appear to be of good quality and have not shown any wear after several uses. These look exactly like the picture and are&lt;br /&gt;excellent for elegant updos on medium to long hair. You may need a bobby pin here or there if you might be very active to lock it in.</li>
            <li> Bought this barrett for my wedding its very pretty &amp; fast shipping thanks ☺</li>
            <li> Excellent Very Durable</li>
            <li> This looks very sparkly and will be a pretty accent for my hair. I like that the wire part is thicker than some of the other hair sticks I have so that the ends don&#x27;t poke as much. The pearl accents look a bit more fake in person, but the sparkles distract from that.</li>
            <li> These hair clips are super nice and seem to be made very well. Has some weight to it. Would look nice in a bun or an up-do</li>
            <li> Yes, like many others, I too am wary of anything seemingly too cheap, &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34; and not Made in the USA.  However, I simply could NOT find any formal hairpins or clips that were decently priced (read that as below $40.00) and so decided to try this piece.  If it was awful, I wouldn&#x27;t cry over the price.  I was pleasantly surprised; this pin is precious.  While the jewels are not Tiffany&#x27;s by any stretch, it makes a beautiful pop in dark blonde/brunette/chocolate hairstyles.  I use this pin now in my daily wear sometimes.  **DISCLAIMER: I would not advise using this pin for a super-formal event.  But if you&#x27;re a guest at a wedding or a nice dinner, date night, etc, it is gorgeous.  I hope you enjoy!</li>
            <li> Very nice piece!  A little heavy.  Wish the two ends were rounded off so it would slide in my hair easier.</li>
            <li> Awesome piece, I love hair bling...and doing my hair in general this piece looks beautiful in a variety of styles and even with wigs!</li>
            <li> SOOOO big for anyone&#x27;s hair even if you have thick and long hair. I will use them as decoration in the house since I can&#x27;t use them on my hair.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but a little big for my wife.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and high quality!&lt;br /&gt;This hair piece is made out of durable shiny metal and looks great with almost any outfit.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! I have been buying hair clips like crazy  (seems to be my thing now a days lol) this hair pin is so pretty! For the price you cannot go wrong. Usually the shipping of my other clips took weeks to arrive, but this one didn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> It looks even prettier than in picture. Shines and sparkles brightly , arrived quickly and in great condition . Given the price , it cudnt have been better. You must have one of these.</li>
            <li> perfect for chignon buns pearl hearts not perfect except for price---is great enough bought 1 more think may b great to give for&amp;#34;borrowed wedding item for bride especially for beauty on a budget--quality fine for most and better than expected&#x3D;&#x3D;got &amp;#34;ahhhs&amp;#34; rhinestones good quality too</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL PIECE. IT DOES NOT CLIP AT ALL. IT IS A BAR THAT JUST SLIDES AROUND A PONYTAIL OR BUN. LOOKS EXPENSIVE. JEWELRY FOR YOUR HAIR .PRICE COULD NOT BE BETTER.</li>
            <li> This was even lovelier than what the picture looked like.  It is very classy and stylish for day or night wear.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a gift.  Thought it was very pretty and a good choice.  Don&#x27;t know what quality it is as it came from China and their products a lot of times don&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly! Wish it came in other colors, made of nice metes but does noy snag hair. I may order more as gifts</li>
            <li> Cute just gotta find the perfect time to wear it</li>
            <li> I love this hair clip! I enjoy throwing my hair up in a messy twist and sticking the clip through the hair for an up-do that takes only seconds to do! Even though the hair is thrown up in seconds I still think it looks quite fancy and elegant enough to use on a date or a night out! The clip is well made and the jewels are attached to the rod very securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I spent more time on a hairstyle and used this clip it would look better but I think just doing a messy twist looks pretty sexy. The jewels really pop out against the hair and showcase how pretty the clip actually is. This vintage hair clip will trick people into thinking you spent more time doing your hair than you did getting ready, or that you had your hair done at a hair salon. This hair clip would be perfect for weddings, dates, or a night out on the town. I am so happy I found and purchased this hair clip!</li>
            <li> Great quality; beautiful product. I use it in my &amp;#34;buns&amp;#34; to dress up my hair and holds firmly.</li>
            <li> This item is very nice and attractive to the eye and give me the opportunity to create other designs for my hair and it is good for special occasions, and the materials is resistant as well.</li>
            <li> Pictures do not do this justice. This is absolutely beautiful. I figured it would be like something from Wal-Mart but it is definitely NOT. This is a very well made product. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is really pretty.</li>
            <li> This is completely beautiful, exactly as pictured but very hard to use.  I am a hair stylist and can usually get anything to work but I can&#x27;t get it to stay in my hair easily.  It takes a few tries for it to really stick.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous hair pin, but much large than I expected.  I thought it was going to be more along the lines of slightly larger than a bobby pin but it&#x27;s far larger than that.  One of the little hearts fell off right out of the package but it was easily fixed with a dab of hot glue.  It&#x27;s very heavy and sturdy (the heavy is an issue for my super fine hair) but I will find a way to make this work!</li>
            <li> Very pretty. I loved the design. I have very long (middle of my butt) hair. This wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair up unless it was wet. I used it twice and the flowers and leaves broke off! Just not worth ir. I will not buy it again nor would I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Probably would have sent it back unless cost for shipping was so high - too hard to use</li>
            <li> Very pretty. I am saving it for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> Very sweet and delicate looking but strong enough to keep my think hair in place.  I wear it with a bun and it fits around the side of the bun nicely.  My granddaughter has threatened to &amp;#34;steal&amp;#34; it from me.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> have not used it yet bought it for my daughter prom it came to late so i have not use it yet..</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and very pretty! Looks just like the picture, but is kind if heavy and long so best to use it in a bun as shown. It is not a clip!</li>
            <li> great item. Fast shipping, This is not lightweight and cheap. A bit longer than I thought but love it still. Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful addition to hairstyle.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is so beautiful!  It looks elegant on your hair when you make a bun or any other updos.  The price is unbelievable.  It looks pretty with outfits of any color!  I recommend it to all ladies who have longer hair.  I got several and gave some of them to my friends as gifts.  They love it.</li>
            <li> Love this hair adornment.</li>
            <li> Purchased as an interview encouragement gift. Perfect for medium hair length not super thick. Beautiful</li>
            <li> It is large but it&#x27;s very pretty and I wish I&#x27;d bought a couple more. Worth the price. Thanknu</li>
            <li> Not pleased with purchase all the pearls were out when it arrived.</li>
            <li> so dainty and beautiful.  The only reason it wasn&#x27;t 5 stars is because two pearls were off when I got it.  I have superglued them, but i shouldn&#x27;t have to do that even before wearing it.</li>
            <li> So pretty but very heavy. Don&#x27;t want to stay in hair.  But so so pretty.</li>
            <li> Very cute and much bigger than what was expected</li>
            <li> Even better in person. Can&#x27;t wait to see this in my daughters hair...great price for such beauty.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought, but thats even better.&lt;br /&gt;Looks great in my hair&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece!  Looks great with a side bun!</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful pin. Fits perfectly in my hair and looks awesome. I have heavy long hair and with this pin I can keep my hair updo for the whole day. Very nice quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece of hair pin.</li>
            <li> Not very functional hair pieces. Seem to be hard to put in your hair if it is fine, and they don&#x27;t want to stay in.</li>
            <li> Looks lovely in the picture, but....the prongs on the hair piece are too large and thick, too difficult to put in your hair.  I did not like it at all...</li>
            <li> Its too long and heavy to be use with the bun style</li>
    </ol>
