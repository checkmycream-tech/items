            <li>BEST SHAMPOO ON THE PLANET.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRICE.</li>
            <li>It is really great.  </li>
            <li>All their products are great</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>However, this shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li>and I like to use good product on it.</li>
            <li>so I always use a good quality shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves my hair looking thicker.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo available for the price.  </li>
            <li>It thickens and smells good too..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thickening spray MUST be used for the best \\&quot;full, thick\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for many years and it is just great.  </li>
            <li>I think out of all the many shampoos i&#x27;ve used this is the creme de la creme!  </li>
            <li>I love the stuff but on not paying the price here!</li>
            <li>Though I do think this is overpriced, honestly my hair has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>Great thickening shampoo for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine salt and pepper hair and this shampoo works great.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit light but the product itself is great.</li>
            <li>My hair cutter uses B&amp;B shampoo on my hair when I go to the salon, and when I asked about it, the price was out of sight for shampoo, but I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used the spray b&amp;b for some time and liked it, so when I saw the shampoo I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of minty in the bottle, but I think it smells kind of like Pantene Pro V Shampoo</li>
            <li>MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND LEAVE MINE ALONE</li>
            <li>A nice cleaner that doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it!!</li>
            <li>The Bumble and Bumble thickening shampoo was invented for people who have fine hair and want a good product to help thicken their hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfectly good shampoo, but on my hair it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thinning hair and the Bumble and Bumble shampoo gives me more volume that the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews of how great this product was decided to give it a try...smells like pure aloe vera.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite thickening shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I love the Bumble and Bumble Moisturizing Coco smelling one though, and have been using that for almost 3 years now.</li>
            <li>B&amp;B Thickening Spray for even more volume and the B&amp;B color support line</li>
            <li>so sometimes I get more</li>
            <li>The Korres Juniper and Olive Tree Shampoo is working way better.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use, for sure.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does that and so much more.</li>
            <li>Redken for Men NYC is a much better and cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>compared prices yesterday when I decided it was time to buy more shampoo.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find more products on Amazon.</li>
            <li>So glad I am able to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Note that this is not a review about authentic Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo, which I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $23 and free shipping!</li>
            <li>Not 100% sure it is the shampoo, but it could be.</li>
            <li>will try one more time.</li>
            <li>This is an OK shampoo but doesn&#x27;t thicken fine hair any better than cheaper, drug store shampoos.</li>
            <li>It does a great job on my hair without stripping it completely.</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s available online now</li>
            <li>Plus with a code you get 7 free gifts, which I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>FREE is FREE!</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a smell which is good, I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo helps.</li>
            <li>and I quickly started to love it.</li>
            <li>i have fine hair and this shampoo is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo gives great body and volume, I use it every day and it works terrific over and over.</li>
            <li>Enjoy?</li>
            <li>The shampoo is light, yet somehow it thickens my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to be very gentle with your hair when it&#x27;s wet including when you&#x27;re shampooing.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve had great results with the &#x27;cool blonde&#x27; formula.</li>
            <li>Really does help make my hair thicker looking and the fragrance is very light, refreshing and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>Squeaky clean and fuller look</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s great, out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried before this stuff takes first prize.</li>
            <li>But this shampoo was a bit stickier than what I&#x27;m used to, and the fragrance was much stronger and more perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Any reader of this that knows of a product that is as good or better and costs less please leave a review here.  </li>
            <li>Quick, noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>It smells mildly of grapefruit, which I like.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediate results the very first day that I used it.</li>
            <li>The strange thing is I have stopped having to use the b&amp;b spray, the shampoo is that good.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it thickens my hair--turning it into a completely unmanageable knot of ratty, tangly hair.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>Also did leave hair looking thicker right after wash</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell black licorice, but I do smell an unique, clean product that may be more feminine than masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results</li>
            <li>Hair was easily styled, no residue, normal blow dry resulted in hair suitable for running errands around town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this shampoo to anyone with fine hair who is looking for a way to manage their frizz while maintaining a natural texture.</li>
            <li>You can get bumble and bumble thickening shampoo cheaper,on the bumble and bumble site,why pay more here?It&#x27;s only 25 dollars for a 8oz bottle</li>
            <li>I first tried this in a sample that came with the thickening conditioner</li>
            <li>It was much more watery than my prevous bottle (purchased from my salon) and had a completely different smell.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to last for more than a day.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>In my opinion none of them were worth the high prices.</li>
            <li>Mild perfume but leaves hair feeling clear, even if you use products.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like strong smelling shampoo especially if it&#x27;s a girly smell.</li>
            <li>It is the only one that doesn&#x27;t strip my fine hair of it&#x27;s moisture, nor doe it build up on my hair.</li>
            <li>By using just a little it will work best and last longer, perhaps for several months to spread out its Beverly Hills price tag.    </li>
            <li>Also, 8 oz&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem like alot, but it is very concentrated.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair product.</li>
            <li>In my experience, the shampoo was real.</li>
            <li>My hair is much fuller without getting frizzy.  </li>
            <li>wondering if product is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Beyond thickening my hair, I have noticed more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; and volume in my hair and its also smoother at the ends where my hair is even thinner due to breakage.</li>
            <li>I use other bumble and bumble products, but I only had experience with their other shampoos (not the thickening) at the salon, and I have to say I was never that impressed with their results.</li>
            <li>Love mostly other B &amp; B products but this one didn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with drying and it does give my fine, thin hair more volume.  </li>
            <li>Not a bubblegum or odd fruit scent like most shampoos.</li>
            <li>As I got older it became finer and shorter.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky enough to have a Bumble &amp; Bumble salon in your area, I&#x27;m sure you can find this product for less in store.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product works partly by adding what I would call just a little spring in your hair at the roots giving you more volumne.    </li>
            <li>I wish i would have done a little more research on the price before purchasing on amazon.</li>
            <li>Also I live in a very windy climate, and normally if I brush my hair more than once a day it only makes the frizz worse, so I used to resort to putting my hair up most of the time.</li>
            <li>Work into your hair and hair roots (with you finger tips); fluff with your fingers lightly and style, but don&#x27;t overstyle.  </li>
            <li>Really good for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>I also got a couple other B&amp;B products for fine, limp hair and they aren&#x27;t any better than the shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m all for trying new &amp;#34;luxury shampoos&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t mind spending the money, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the cap didn&#x27;t fit the bottle correctly (when I twist to tighten it \\&quot;pops\\&quot; off) - a problem I&#x27;ve never run into before with this brand - and as such the entire bottle was covered in leaked shampoo.</li>
            <li>First, wash your hair with Bumble and bumble Thickening Shampoo and Thicken Condition and lightly blow dry to about 90 to 95% dry; then, spread a dab (a small dab, less than a dime size) on the palm of one hand and work lightly between both hands like applying a hand lotion for about 10 to 15 seconds; making sure to get on your finger tips.  </li>
            <li>The product i got is definitely the real Bumble and Bumble thickening shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and it has never failed to add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been concerned about this because of some other reviews, but most of those were several years old</li>
            <li>I compared it to my old bottle and knew I&#x27;d been had.  </li>
            <li>It brought out my hair&#x27;s natural wave and curl without encouraging it to become a mountain of frizz.</li>
            <li>Order directly from Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li>a good bit of my expensive shampoo was covering the inside of the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I find that it does come out a little quickly when you squeeze it</li>
            <li>If I were to give it a %,which I really have trouble doing, I would say my hair ils 25% thicker, smoother and very shinny.  </li>
            <li>When used, after a normal blow dry, the spray helps give an OOMPH and looks good enough for casual night out.</li>
            <li>Now when I brush my hair after it dries it is left sleek and bouncy, not limp and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Now I know it is well worth the few extra dollars to purchase Bumble products directly from my salon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dry my hair on high heat either.  </li>
            <li>I would say I use about half as much of this than I would another shampoo (I can&#x27;t say that about their conditioner though).</li>

            <li> Mild perfume but leaves hair feeling clear, even if you use products.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like strong smelling shampoo especially if it&#x27;s a girly smell.</li>
            <li> It is the only one that doesn&#x27;t strip my fine hair of it&#x27;s moisture, nor doe it build up on my hair.</li>
            <li> By using just a little it will work best and last longer, perhaps for several months to spread out its Beverly Hills price tag.    </li>
            <li> Also, 8 oz&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem like alot, but it is very concentrated.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair product.</li>
            <li> In my experience, the shampoo was real.</li>
            <li> My hair is much fuller without getting frizzy.  </li>
            <li> wondering if product is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Beyond thickening my hair, I have noticed more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; and volume in my hair and its also smoother at the ends where my hair is even thinner due to breakage.</li>
            <li> I use other bumble and bumble products, but I only had experience with their other shampoos (not the thickening) at the salon, and I have to say I was never that impressed with their results.</li>
            <li> Love mostly other B &amp; B products but this one didn&#x27;t make the grade.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with drying and it does give my fine, thin hair more volume.  </li>
            <li> Not a bubblegum or odd fruit scent like most shampoos.</li>
            <li> As I got older it became finer and shorter.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky enough to have a Bumble &amp; Bumble salon in your area, I&#x27;m sure you can find this product for less in store.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works partly by adding what I would call just a little spring in your hair at the roots giving you more volumne.    </li>
            <li> I wish i would have done a little more research on the price before purchasing on amazon.</li>
            <li> Also I live in a very windy climate, and normally if I brush my hair more than once a day it only makes the frizz worse, so I used to resort to putting my hair up most of the time.</li>
            <li> Work into your hair and hair roots (with you finger tips); fluff with your fingers lightly and style, but don&#x27;t overstyle.  </li>
            <li> Really good for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I also got a couple other B&amp;B products for fine, limp hair and they aren&#x27;t any better than the shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m all for trying new &amp;#34;luxury shampoos&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t mind spending the money, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the cap didn&#x27;t fit the bottle correctly (when I twist to tighten it \\&quot;pops\\&quot; off) - a problem I&#x27;ve never run into before with this brand - and as such the entire bottle was covered in leaked shampoo.</li>
            <li> First, wash your hair with Bumble and bumble Thickening Shampoo and Thicken Condition and lightly blow dry to about 90 to 95% dry; then, spread a dab (a small dab, less than a dime size) on the palm of one hand and work lightly between both hands like applying a hand lotion for about 10 to 15 seconds; making sure to get on your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> The product i got is definitely the real Bumble and Bumble thickening shampoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and it has never failed to add volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been concerned about this because of some other reviews, but most of those were several years old</li>
            <li> I compared it to my old bottle and knew I&#x27;d been had.  </li>
            <li> It brought out my hair&#x27;s natural wave and curl without encouraging it to become a mountain of frizz.</li>
            <li> Order directly from Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li> a good bit of my expensive shampoo was covering the inside of the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I find that it does come out a little quickly when you squeeze it</li>
            <li> If I were to give it a %,which I really have trouble doing, I would say my hair ils 25% thicker, smoother and very shinny.  </li>
            <li> When used, after a normal blow dry, the spray helps give an OOMPH and looks good enough for casual night out.</li>
            <li> Now when I brush my hair after it dries it is left sleek and bouncy, not limp and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Now I know it is well worth the few extra dollars to purchase Bumble products directly from my salon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dry my hair on high heat either.  </li>
            <li> I would say I use about half as much of this than I would another shampoo (I can&#x27;t say that about their conditioner though).</li>
            <li> Some say that it&#x27;s pricey, but how long does a bottle of shampoo last you?</li>
            <li> And also a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I read most of the other reviews, and several of them stated that they may have received fake Bumble and Bumble...</li>
            <li> still happened to have my last bottle of this shampoo, purchased a few months ago from Bumble and Bumble directly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of shampoos recommended by stylists I&#x27;ve used over the past few years, and I finally went back to this one.</li>
            <li> I have naturally fine, limp, frizzy, wavy hair and have tried for years to find something that would tame the frizz without weighing down my already limp hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that i spent $28 on this product when i could have got it directly from bumbleandbumble.com for $4 cheaper.</li>
            <li> I do agree that this product is expensive, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I read a few other reviews saying that this product is not the actual Bumble &amp; Bumble shampoo.</li>
            <li> A little DOES go a long way.</li>
            <li> I shipped the fake product back to Amazon, but lost money because they only credited me partial money back.  </li>
            <li> You really only need a small dime size for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> This does not happen with any other hair care product that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Also the other bad reviews...about the products not being genuine and/or watered down.  ????  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but this really helps to thicken my hair.</li>
            <li> In other words I don&#x27;t have to wash it quite as often as it doesn&#x27;t go limp.</li>
            <li> You need less than half the amount you would use with off the shelf products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this particular shampoo for about 5 years, so I knew immediately upon opening the package that Amazon had sent me a fake.</li>
            <li> I am \\&quot;old\\&quot;, in my 70&#x27;s and my hair was alway thick and long.  </li>
            <li> I could smell it before I opened the flimsy bubble envelope package... which turned out to be because the cap wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight and</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this faked stuff; don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of $33.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo from Amazon to save a few dollars off the salon price.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have very fragile, thin hair</li>
            <li> Also the directions say to use a small amount as it is supposed to lather up with less . . .</li>
            <li> but by next day very limp and thin looking again.</li>
            <li> , it dried out my hair (look at the ingredients in the thickening serum), and my hair was FLATTER (and limp and dull) than it was before.  </li>
            <li> So I read reviews here and noticed the comments about fake products and that the actual B&amp;B site is cheaper.</li>
            <li> There were subtle but nonetheless apparent differences, including some incorrect grammar on the fake bottle.</li>
            <li> No shampoo will change thin hair into thick hair but this one does leave my hair a little fuller.  </li>
            <li> As you age, your hair gets duller and loses lustre.</li>
            <li> If your budget allows also use the Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner; leaving both on for at least two minutes each.    </li>
            <li> LEAVES YOUR HAIR THICK AND LUXURIOUS .</li>
            <li> what my problem is (seeing as I&#x27;ve never used B&amp;B products before this), but the shampoo, conditioner, and thickening serum made my hair look WORSE than before I used it.  </li>
            <li> For thin, frizzy hair, I have found nothing</li>
            <li> I have thin hear , these products give thicker hair and your hair is easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews that it smells like black licorice, hence, the shampoo smells bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sick that I wasted SIXTY BUCKS on the shampoo, conditioner, and serum.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the wrong consistency.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem expensive at all to me.</li>
            <li> and I think you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> this shampoo was way too expensive for what I got, I would not recommend it at all to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell and consistency of the shampoo was wrong.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY...</li>
            <li> Makes me sick.)  </li>
            <li> If you know what your hair needs, and decide to try Bumble &amp; Bumble, you&#x27;ll not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so hopefully I won&#x27;t be disappointed...</li>
            <li> how much I hated these products (again, maybe I got fakes, but I doubt I got fakes of ALL THREE).  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These thickening products are terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>

            <li> Whatever this goop is, it doesn&#x27;t smell like Bb Thickening Shampoo and it&#x27;s the wrong consistency. I wasted my money on this faked stuff; don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> This is an OK shampoo but doesn&#x27;t thicken fine hair any better than cheaper, drug store shampoos. Also the directions say to use a small amount as it is supposed to lather up with less . . . not so! I also got a couple other B&amp;B products for fine, limp hair and they aren&#x27;t any better than the shampoo. In my opinion none of them were worth the high prices.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite thickening shampoos.  Quick, noticeable results.  Mild perfume but leaves hair feeling clear, even if you use products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy. With thinning hair. I don&#x27;t freak out about it, but I also don&#x27;t want to advertise it. This shampoo is perfect for me. It adds volume, and the addition of the Aloe Vera makes it shine and stay resilient. As you age, your hair gets duller and loses lustre. This shampoo brings it back. It smells mildly of grapefruit, which I like. If you know what your hair needs, and decide to try Bumble &amp; Bumble, you&#x27;ll not be disappointed. Some say that it&#x27;s pricey, but how long does a bottle of shampoo last you? 2 months? That&#x27;s, like, 12 bucks a month for awesome results. Doesn&#x27;t seem expensive at all to me.</li>
            <li> I heard that some volumizing products are actually drying to your hair, so I was concerned about this issue when I purchased Bb&#x27;s Thickening shampoo.  I have not had any problems with drying and it does give my fine, thin hair more volume.  Also, 8 oz&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem like alot, but it is very concentrated.  You need less than half the amount you would use with off the shelf products.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and I like to use good product on it. My hair cutter uses B&amp;B shampoo on my hair when I go to the salon, and when I asked about it, the price was out of sight for shampoo, but I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. It makes your hair feel soft and clean. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is absolutely wonderful. It does a great job on my hair without stripping it completely. The fragrance is a bit light but the product itself is great. Will def buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I have used the spray b&amp;b for some time and liked it, so when I saw the shampoo I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;  It is really great.  I am \\&quot;old\\&quot;, in my 70&#x27;s and my hair was alway thick and long.  As I got older it became finer and shorter.  I have used alot of comercial shampoos that say they will thicken your hair---don&#x27;t, this one does!  If I were to give it a %,which I really have trouble doing, I would say my hair ils 25% thicker, smoother and very shinny.  The strange thing is I have stopped having to use the b&amp;b spray, the shampoo is that good.  I now only use that on occasion.  All their products are great and I think you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any thickening, so I just used it until it was gone and never bought it again.  I love the Bumble and Bumble Moisturizing Coco smelling one though, and have been using that for almost 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Bumble and bumble&#x27;s product line by my hair sylist who also uses the product.      First, wash your hair with Bumble and bumble Thickening Shampoo and Thicken Condition and lightly blow dry to about 90 to 95% dry; then, spread a dab (a small dab, less than a dime size) on the palm of one hand and work lightly between both hands like applying a hand lotion for about 10 to 15 seconds; making sure to get on your finger tips.  Work into your hair and hair roots (with you finger tips); fluff with your fingers lightly and style, but don&#x27;t overstyle.  This product works partly by adding what I would call just a little spring in your hair at the roots giving you more volumne.    By using just a little it will work best and last longer, perhaps for several months to spread out its Beverly Hills price tag.    If your budget allows also use the Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner; leaving both on for at least two minutes each.    Any reader of this that knows of a product that is as good or better and costs less please leave a review here.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now (along with their thickening conditioner and tonic lotion) and I can see a definite improvement in my hair. Beyond thickening my hair, I have noticed more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; and volume in my hair and its also smoother at the ends where my hair is even thinner due to breakage. I do agree that this product is expensive, but its worth it. A little DOES go a long way. I would say I use about half as much of this than I would another shampoo (I can&#x27;t say that about their conditioner though). If you&#x27;re lucky enough to have a Bumble &amp; Bumble salon in your area, I&#x27;m sure you can find this product for less in store. It smells kind of minty in the bottle, but I think it smells kind of like Pantene Pro V Shampoo once I&#x27;m done styling. I would also recommend (and use!) B&amp;B Thickening Spray for even more volume and the B&amp;B color support line - I&#x27;ve had great results with the &#x27;cool blonde&#x27; formula.</li>
            <li> You can get bumble and bumble thickening shampoo cheaper,on the bumble and bumble site,why pay more here?It&#x27;s only 25 dollars for a 8oz bottle</li>
            <li> Great thickening shampoo for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews that it smells like black licorice, hence, the shampoo smells bad. I don&#x27;t smell black licorice, but I do smell an unique, clean product that may be more feminine than masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: When using the shampoo and conditioner, I noticed added volume yet not a \\&quot;thickening\\&quot; effect. Hair was easily styled, no residue, normal blow dry resulted in hair suitable for running errands around town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thickening spray MUST be used for the best \\&quot;full, thick\\&quot; effect. When used, after a normal blow dry, the spray helps give an OOMPH and looks good enough for casual night out.</li>
            <li> USED IT FOR YEARS. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This is a perfectly good shampoo, but on my hair it&#x27;s nothing special. I bought it for thickening and increased volume and it does not perform as advertised. I use the conditioner and serum as recommended. I don&#x27;t use hair spray. Anyway, it&#x27;s not offensive in any way, it just doesn&#x27;t improve anything for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Doesn&#x27;t thicken your hair.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything drugstore shampoo won&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you have sensative skin like me stay away!!!!!!!  This shampoo made me breakout all around my hairline and neck.  What a waste of $33.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m all for trying new &amp;#34;luxury shampoos&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t mind spending the money, but so it from a store that will allow you to return a product that you don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I have fine salt and pepper hair and this shampoo works great.  I also use Stephen Knoll&#x27;s Hydro Repair Mist.  I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s best to be very gentle with your hair when it&#x27;s wet including when you&#x27;re shampooing.  I don&#x27;t dry my hair on high heat either.  The smell is wonderful, too.  Not a bubblegum or odd fruit scent like most shampoos.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Works well thickening without making your hair gunky.  Have used it for years.  Glad it&#x27;s available online now</li>
            <li> I first tried this in a sample that came with the thickening conditioner and I quickly started to love it. The shampoo gives great body and volume, I use it every day and it works terrific over and over. There isn&#x27;t much of a smell which is good, I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t like strong smelling shampoo especially if it&#x27;s a girly smell. I find that it does come out a little quickly when you squeeze it so sometimes I get more then I wanted. You really only need a small dime size for shorter hair. Overall it&#x27;s great, out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried before this stuff takes first prize.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo from Amazon to save a few dollars off the salon price.  BIG MISTAKE!  As soon as I poured the product into my hand I knew something was off.  It was much more watery than my prevous bottle (purchased from my salon) and had a completely different smell.  I compared it to my old bottle and knew I&#x27;d been had.  I then e-mailed Bumble and Bumble to notify them.  I shipped the fake product back to Amazon, but lost money because they only credited me partial money back.  Now I know it is well worth the few extra dollars to purchase Bumble products directly from my salon.</li>
            <li> These thickening products are terrible. I have used the shampoo and conditioner together on and off for months now, so I&#x27;m leaving this review for both products.  Sure, it thickens my hair--turning it into a completely unmanageable knot of ratty, tangly hair. There is NO way to comb through my hair after using these products (without ripping it all out) unless I use yet another twenty dollar Bumble and Bumble product (the Prep spray). And even then, as the day wears on my ends get all ratty and knotty.  This does not happen with any other hair care product that I have ever used. I have very fine, medium length hair.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product i got is definitely the real Bumble and Bumble thickening shampoo! My only complaint is that i spent $28 on this product when i could have got it directly from bumbleandbumble.com for $4 cheaper. I wish i would have done a little more research on the price before purchasing on amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t give any volume to my hair. I was very disappointed. The Korres Juniper and Olive Tree Shampoo is working way better.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker, no doubt.  You could see the skin on my head before and not now.  I will continue to use, for sure.</li>
            <li> No residue is left in hair.  Squeaky clean and fuller look and it seems to last for more than a day.  In other words I don&#x27;t have to wash it quite as often as it doesn&#x27;t go limp. And also a tiny bit goes a long way. I think out of all the many shampoos i&#x27;ve used this is the creme de la creme!  DONNA ---- MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND LEAVE MINE ALONE</li>
            <li> Volumizing with no offensive odor.</li>
            <li> This is my second order. They get the order here quicker than promised. I really like this hair product. Enjoy?</li>
            <li> Bumble And Bumble Thickening Shampoo is excellent. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and it has never failed to add volume to my hair. B&amp;B&#x27;s Thickening Spray is also a must. I use it each time I shampoo! Myra</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel somewhat sticky and although my hair is relatively short, somewhat tangled after I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> My sister has been raving about this shampoo for weeks, so I decided to give it a try. I use other bumble and bumble products, but I only had experience with their other shampoos (not the thickening) at the salon, and I have to say I was never that impressed with their results. However, this shampoo is amazing! I noticed immediate results the very first day that I used it. I have naturally fine, limp, frizzy, wavy hair and have tried for years to find something that would tame the frizz without weighing down my already limp hair. This shampoo does that and so much more. It brought out my hair&#x27;s natural wave and curl without encouraging it to become a mountain of frizz. Also I live in a very windy climate, and normally if I brush my hair more than once a day it only makes the frizz worse, so I used to resort to putting my hair up most of the time. Now when I brush my hair after it dries it is left sleek and bouncy, not limp and frizzy. I recommend this shampoo to anyone with fine hair who is looking for a way to manage their frizz while maintaining a natural texture.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of how great this product was decided to give it a try...smells like pure aloe vera. Also did leave hair looking thicker right after wash but by next day very limp and thin looking again. Redken for Men NYC is a much better and cheaper alternative. And L&#x27;Oreal Pantene gave me the same results at a third of the price. Would not buy again and stick to Redken for Men</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a whole bunch of shampoos recommended by stylists I&#x27;ve used over the past few years, and I finally went back to this one. It is the only one that doesn&#x27;t strip my fine hair of it&#x27;s moisture, nor doe it build up on my hair.</li>
            <li> I read a few other reviews saying that this product is not the actual Bumble &amp; Bumble shampoo. In my experience, the shampoo was real. I could smell it before I opened the flimsy bubble envelope package... which turned out to be because the cap wasn&#x27;t screwed on tight and a good bit of my expensive shampoo was covering the inside of the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared prices yesterday when I decided it was time to buy more shampoo. You can actually get the thickening shampoo and conditioner from the Bumble website and pay $15 for overnight shipping and STILL come out cheaper than getting the shampoo and conditioner using prime.</li>
            <li> I read most of the other reviews, and several of them stated that they may have received fake Bumble and Bumble...I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what my problem is (seeing as I&#x27;ve never used B&amp;B products before this), but the shampoo, conditioner, and thickening serum made my hair look WORSE than before I used it.  Lots of \\&quot;flyaways\\&quot;, it dried out my hair (look at the ingredients in the thickening serum), and my hair was FLATTER (and limp and dull) than it was before.  I&#x27;m just sick that I wasted SIXTY BUCKS on the shampoo, conditioner, and serum.  (Actually, total, it was OVER $60.  Makes me sick.)  I can&#x27;t state strongly enough how much I hated these products (again, maybe I got fakes, but I doubt I got fakes of ALL THREE).  Horrible.  I wish I could return them.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but this really helps to thicken my hair. A nice cleaner that doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp itchy. I wish I could find more products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this shampoo was way too expensive for what I got, I would not recommend it at all to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a film on your hair &amp; feels gummy!</li>
            <li> Product made my hair fuller and shiny. I spray hair with thickening spray before blow drying. Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Love mostly other B &amp; B products but this one didn&#x27;t make the grade. Makes your hair appear thicker by making it frizzy.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase from my salon, but they are not distributing different brands.  For thin, frizzy hair, I have found nothing&lt;br /&gt;better than this shampoo.  So glad I am able to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!! Really does help make my hair thicker looking and the fragrance is very light, refreshing and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> This product thickens my hair without any sticky residue.  The shampoo is light, yet somehow it thickens my hair.  It goes well with the thickening spray.</li>
            <li> Note that this is not a review about authentic Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo, which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this particular shampoo for about 5 years, so I knew immediately upon opening the package that Amazon had sent me a fake. I&#x27;d been concerned about this because of some other reviews, but most of those were several years old and so I (foolishly) thought that the issue had been resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the cap didn&#x27;t fit the bottle correctly (when I twist to tighten it \\&quot;pops\\&quot; off) - a problem I&#x27;ve never run into before with this brand - and as such the entire bottle was covered in leaked shampoo. The smell and consistency of the shampoo was wrong. Like I said, I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. But this shampoo was a bit stickier than what I&#x27;m used to, and the fragrance was much stronger and more perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still happened to have my last bottle of this shampoo, purchased a few months ago from Bumble and Bumble directly. So I lined the two up next to one another to compare the packaging. There were subtle but nonetheless apparent differences, including some incorrect grammar on the fake bottle. I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo to illustrate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and DO NOT but this product from Amazon.com. Order directly from Bumble and Bumble.</li>
            <li> The Bumble and Bumble thickening shampoo was invented for people who have fine hair and want a good product to help thicken their hair.  I recommend it to anyone wanting to thicken their hair.</li>
            <li> I use it about three times a week.  My hair is much fuller without getting frizzy.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very fragile, thin hair so I always use a good quality shampoo.  I find that this one meets that criteria.......it is an excellent quality shampoo.  No shampoo will change thin hair into thick hair but this one does leave my hair a little fuller.  I would recommend to anyone who is prepared to pay the price as an excellent quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> BEST SHAMPOO ON THE PLANET. EXCELLENT PRICE. LEAVES YOUR HAIR THICK AND LUXURIOUS . YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY...WORTH THE PRICE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A PRIME MEMBER</li>
            <li> I like this product and would order it again.  Smells good and leaves my hair looking thicker.</li>
            <li> I have tried similarly priced shampoos of this quality.  Best shampoo available for the price.  It thickens and smells good too..</li>
            <li> So I read reviews here and noticed the comments about fake products and that the actual B&amp;B site is cheaper. I decided to check it out and it IS! It&#x27;s $23 and free shipping! Plus with a code you get 7 free gifts, which I&#x27;m sure are samples but so what! FREE is FREE! I read about the product in Women&#x27;s Health so hopefully I won&#x27;t be disappointed...can&#x27;t wait to try it out!</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s site sells thickening shampoo 8 oz for 24.00. I love the stuff but on not paying the price here! Why would anyone spend 39.00 for 8 oz when you can buy it for $24.00?  Also the other bad reviews...about the products not being genuine and/or watered down.  ????  Something not trustworthy here.</li>
            <li> Though I do think this is overpriced, honestly my hair has never looked better!  Not 100% sure it is the shampoo, but it could be.</li>
            <li> Really good for my thin hair. My wife can&#x27;t stop playing with it.  I think it&#x27;s a psychological problem.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this shampoo helps.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thinning hair and the Bumble and Bumble shampoo gives me more volume that the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> As with the conditioner results not the same as sample.  wondering if product is the real thing. will try one more time.</li>
            <li> i have fine hair and this shampoo is fantastic.  never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for many years and it is just great.  I also use the conditioner.  I have thin hear , these products give thicker hair and your hair is easier to manage. I highly recommend it.</li>
