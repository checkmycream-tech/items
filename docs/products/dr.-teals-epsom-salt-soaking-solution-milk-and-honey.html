            <li>and I love the smell of chamomile</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this after a bath.</li>
            <li>It infuses the entire hallway with the awesome smell of chamomile.</li>
            <li>Excited to try again!</li>
            <li>read up on epsom salts and the magnesium in them actually does help with aches and pains and is best when absorbed through the skin by soaking in the bath.</li>
            <li>Does not smell of a floral scent, not too sweet, not a sickening smell at all, but it is potent</li>
            <li>Salts dissolve easily, while their effects linger.</li>
            <li>She said the scent was too strong for her</li>
            <li>Toooooo strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Smell is way too strong.</li>
            <li>The epsom salts are fine, but the smell is too strong and perfumey.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine</li>
            <li>The chamomile is very calming, and the scent is amazing- all while doing everything</li>
            <li>My whole bathroom smells nice after I use this</li>
            <li>I use this once a week to relieve stress and a mineral bath is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and I felt very calm and relaxed.</li>
            <li>This epsom salt is absolutely the best reward after a long day.</li>
            <li>It is true that the bag doesn&#x27;t seal correctly after opening, but I store it upright, so this is a non-issue to me.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite of all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s salts.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty but really really strong.</li>
            <li>Thought I was purchasing something relaxing for my pregnant wife</li>
            <li>but when my husband came home I had to store them in a separate bag because the whole apartment smell was too strong for him</li>
            <li>Overall nice smell that makes my kids bath super fun</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like perfumed things and thought this would be more natural smelling.  </li>
            <li>I really liked Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soak and this was basically the same.</li>
            <li>It is a nice big bag, and you don&#x27;t need to use too much so it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li>A post-surgery gift that was very appreciated.</li>
            <li>I try to order this often, and even though I do enjoy the other scents, this is my fallback - the one I have to make sure and keep on hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite scent out of all the Dr Teal&#x27;s products!!!&lt;br /&gt;Could not find it in my local store, so had to purchase on line.&lt;br /&gt;trying</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a personal choice on which scent you go with.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety of essential oils these epsom salts come in.</li>
            <li>I used it in the bath and it left my bath smelling lovely.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to run out of this stuff, it&#x27;s essential at my house for sure.</li>
            <li>but it made my skin super soft</li>
            <li>The scent is very relaxing yet strong enough to work.</li>
            <li>Smells heavenly and really does help with aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>, nighttime bathing is a ritual for me and really does help with pain</li>
            <li>Very relaxing scent.</li>
            <li>I recommend all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt products for a very soothing bath.</li>
            <li>Ships fast.</li>
            <li>and it really clung to me after bathing.</li>
            <li>I think they are discontinuing it though, and it is becoming harder to find this particular product.</li>
            <li>Decent price too.</li>
            <li>You just have to use at least 2 cups of it in your bath to get really nice results.</li>
            <li>The wife loves these for a quick relaxation at the end of a long day of work, teaching Pilates or travel.  </li>
            <li>I live in a medium size town and can find it.</li>
            <li>Trying a new scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a very natural fragrance that is quite soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen this product at Walgreen&#x27;s and Walmart but the price here is much better, as it&#x27;s usually and Add-on item.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to using this product, but the smell is so strong and product has a very unnatural chemical smell that I can hardly breathe around it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a little time before bed, this is very soothing and you don&#x27;t need an expensive bubble bath to get a nice smooth skin effect.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and have lots of aches and pains now.</li>
            <li>Soaking in these epsom salts several times a week really does relieve the stiffness.</li>
            <li>and I plan to use this soak in early labor at home, as well.</li>
            <li>It transfers a very calming feeling not only during but after the bath.</li>
            <li>I have found adding the chamomile to my regular epsoms salts really adds to the relaxation.  </li>
            <li>The Epsom salts are very soothing to muscles after a long day out gardening</li>
            <li>It smells a little like the original herbal essence shampoo only much more subtle.  </li>
            <li>I rely on hot epsom salt baths at night and thought it would be nice to have some relaxing scent incorporated...will likely stick to a few drops of essential oil rather than this particular solution as even a small handful of this mixed with about 3 parts regular (unscented) epsom salts is overpowering and lingers in my bathroom for days afterwards.</li>
            <li>Overpowering sweet floral smell...not the least like the natural chamomile</li>

            <li> Smells heavenly and really does help with aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> , nighttime bathing is a ritual for me and really does help with pain</li>
            <li> Very relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> I recommend all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt products for a very soothing bath.</li>
            <li> Ships fast.</li>
            <li> and it really clung to me after bathing.</li>
            <li> I think they are discontinuing it though, and it is becoming harder to find this particular product.</li>
            <li> Decent price too.</li>
            <li> You just have to use at least 2 cups of it in your bath to get really nice results.</li>
            <li> The wife loves these for a quick relaxation at the end of a long day of work, teaching Pilates or travel.  </li>
            <li> I live in a medium size town and can find it.</li>
            <li> Trying a new scent.  </li>
            <li> It is a very natural fragrance that is quite soothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen this product at Walgreen&#x27;s and Walmart but the price here is much better, as it&#x27;s usually and Add-on item.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product, but the smell is so strong and product has a very unnatural chemical smell that I can hardly breathe around it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a little time before bed, this is very soothing and you don&#x27;t need an expensive bubble bath to get a nice smooth skin effect.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and have lots of aches and pains now.</li>
            <li> Soaking in these epsom salts several times a week really does relieve the stiffness.</li>
            <li> and I plan to use this soak in early labor at home, as well.</li>
            <li> It transfers a very calming feeling not only during but after the bath.</li>
            <li> I have found adding the chamomile to my regular epsoms salts really adds to the relaxation.  </li>
            <li> The Epsom salts are very soothing to muscles after a long day out gardening</li>
            <li> It smells a little like the original herbal essence shampoo only much more subtle.  </li>
            <li> I rely on hot epsom salt baths at night and thought it would be nice to have some relaxing scent incorporated...will likely stick to a few drops of essential oil rather than this particular solution as even a small handful of this mixed with about 3 parts regular (unscented) epsom salts is overpowering and lingers in my bathroom for days afterwards.</li>
            <li> Overpowering sweet floral smell...not the least like the natural chamomile</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so soothing and makes my entire bathroom smell long after the bath is gone.</li>
            <li> They smell like cheap daisys and have a weird medical scent to them that was off putting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a career waitress and this product is so soothing after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> i only have a small amount left and hope that amazon restocks this product!!!</li>
            <li> I only use this product and use half the recommended measurement.</li>
            <li> This has some strange fragrance in it other than chamomile</li>
            <li> I mix it (as with all my salts) with a little baking soda and Kosher salt, and sometimes for an extra fizz, some citric acid.</li>
            <li> My body felt limp and totally relaxed!</li>
            <li> It turns out that these salts are extremely overpriced on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Other then the smell</li>
            <li> It has given me a headache within a few minutes and is definitely not natural.</li>
            <li> is one simple thing you can do at least three times a week to help detox, and soothe your bodies adrenal glands.</li>
            <li> but I found this at Target for under 5 dollars a bag so won&#x27;t be buying here until they come down in price.</li>
            <li> Down to one star.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a few other reviews that don&#x27;t like this fragrance.</li>
            <li> your typical epsom salt is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I tried a little in bath water, had to drain it out immediately because it stunk up bathroom.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little slice of  heaven.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy the smell at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a long day in the field or working in the barn, this bath salt helps my tired, achy feet and legs.</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;ve had several broken bones and spinal fusion &amp; don&#x27;t take narcotics , so this is helpful!</li>
            <li> whether it was a stressful day at work or a hard workout at the gym.  </li>
            <li> I have at least five of the Dr. Teal&#x27;s fragrances of bath salts</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what made me addicted to salt baths.</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> My mom was very skeptical when I told her to try one of the salts one day</li>
            <li> and I do not think it is a bad product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed by this lingering,cheap perfume-like fragrance---I don&#x27;t think I could use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Tried using again and ick...</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells awful, unbearable !</li>
            <li> However, the price is outrageous at $16.99 for 3 pounds.  </li>
            <li> and it was disgusting.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite scent out of all the Dr Teal&#x27;s products!!!&lt;br /&gt;Could not find it in my local store, so had to purchase on line.&lt;br /&gt;trying to get my store to care it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and really does help with aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;As an added benefit, it also seems to help somewhat with keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> Amazing salts, and the smell is good and not too strong.</li>
            <li> I always have this on hand for baths.  It makes you feel so much better whether it was a stressful day at work or a hard workout at the gym.  This stuff smells great, it dissovles in the water so you don&#x27;t have that grainy beach feel when you sit in the tub. I like it, but as anything with smells I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a personal choice on which scent you go with.  But the chamomile is pretty good!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents from Dr. Teal&#x27;s. The chamomile is very calming, and the scent is amazing- all while doing everything your typical epsom salt is supposed to do. My mom was very skeptical when I told her to try one of the salts one day when her knee hurt (she recently had a knee replacement). She said the scent was too strong for her but when she laid in the bath for 20 minutes she definitely turned into a believer! It melts away aches &amp; pains like a charm! I will definitely be re-ordering when my supply is done.</li>
            <li> Scent is a bit overpowering in the tub, but smells awesome afterwards for a while. I absolutely love Dr. Teals, so no complaints.</li>
            <li> Smells awful, unbearable ! couldn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> enough said. I put this in the foot bath and i was in heaven. The bag is in my bathroom and it smells so nice in there. Good scent. Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s what made me addicted to salt baths. It goes faster than you think, so next time I&#x27;ll buy a bigger size. Good luck!</li>
            <li> brought this for a sore muscle.. fell in love with the smell!! i only have a small amount left and hope that amazon restocks this product!!! the smell is calming, just like it says! my skin feels softer when i use this product! will buy more than one bag when it is restocked!</li>
            <li> As described, great for foot soaks</li>
            <li> This is an absolutley wonderful product.  However, the price is outrageous at $16.99 for 3 pounds.  At Walmart, 3 pounds is only $4.87.  I was looking on Amazon because this product is so popular at my Walmart that they are always out of it for 3 weeks at a time.  It is soothing, great smelling and really relaxing.  And you can use it in the Watertech whirlpool baths because it isn&#x27;t a bubble bath, just the salts.  I would buy it by the case, but not at $16.99 per bag.</li>
            <li> I especially love this clean scent!! I use them all but this is my favorite w the muscle relief, nighttime bathing is a ritual for me and really does help with pain ( I&#x27;ve had several broken bones and spinal fusion &amp; don&#x27;t take narcotics , so this is helpful!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it soothes my sore muscles but I found this at Target for under 5 dollars a bag so won&#x27;t be buying here until they come down in price. Talk to your local store if they don&#x27;t carry. I live in a medium size town and can find it.</li>
            <li> A post-surgery gift that was very appreciated. Decent price too. Very relaxing scent.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is great.  I recommend all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt products for a very soothing bath.</li>
            <li> Love. Best calming scent ever!</li>
            <li> I used this product to soak in tub during a Disney world vacation.  My husband and I both slept awesome each night we soaked in this product! The scent is very relaxing yet strong enough to work.</li>
            <li> We love this camomile brand I cannot find camomile in any store around here.</li>
            <li> Trying a new scent.  I have used this for my Epson Salts for a number of years and love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I personally loved the smell of this.  I would run my bath upstairs  and my husband could smell it downstairs he always says how great it smells.  I think it&#x27;s realizing and is wonderful to use a  couple times a week to relax my muscles, especially after the gym.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the camomille as I like the mint or spearamint!  It still helps my arthritis though and that is a godsend!</li>
            <li> It turns out that these salts are extremely overpriced on Amazon. After I had already opened them, I discovered them at a local chain stores for only $5. Lame. Love the scent and effects. Dislike feeling over-charged.</li>
            <li> If I could walk around with this under my nose all the time I would be in heaven.  It smells a little like the original herbal essence shampoo only much more subtle.  I wish there was a perfume like this.  Great product and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Overall nice smell that makes my kids bath super fun and they sleep well. Good value for your money. Thanx</li>
            <li> I love the variety of essential oils these epsom salts come in. I require a bath every night before bed in order to relax my muscles, and Dr. Teal&#x27;s salts are all I use now</li>
            <li> This has some strange fragrance in it other than chamomile and it was disgusting.  Wish they could just stick with the basics.</li>
            <li> Achey muscles? Hemroids?&lt;br /&gt;This will definitely ease your pain.&lt;br /&gt;smells good&lt;br /&gt;Fart in the tub all you want with this one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for soaks after gardening.  I ordered from Amazon to get a larger size. It works just fine and I have no complaints.  I did find it cheaper and in a larger size at Walmarts and Costco though.</li>
            <li> Great price. Ships fast. Great for aches and pains.</li>
            <li> This feels so good at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Like how this soaks away aches &amp; pains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I agree with the reviewer who dislikes the smell.  Overpowering sweet floral smell...not the least like the natural chamomile I was expecting (the package claims to contain chamomile essential oil).  I found it unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed by this lingering,cheap perfume-like fragrance---I don&#x27;t think I could use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Tried using again and ick...overpowering perfume.  Toooooo strong for me.  Down to one star.</li>
            <li> Perfumes bother me, and i could smell the perfume before i even opened the bag.  I bought the product thinking there would just be salt and essential oils.</li>
            <li> This is even good for my plants</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and have lots of aches and pains now. Soaking in these epsom salts several times a week really does relieve the stiffness. The extra chamomile adds to the relaxation benefits. I&#x27;ve used the eucalyptus and the lavendar. I love them all and switch between the 3 regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read up on epsom salts and the magnesium in them actually does help with aches and pains and is best when absorbed through the skin by soaking in the bath.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and feel of these bath salts. It is a very natural fragrance that is quite soothing. It is true that the bag doesn&#x27;t seal correctly after opening, but I store it upright, so this is a non-issue to me. I&#x27;ve even thought about putting this is mason jars with ribbons to give as gifts. You could make a couple of gifts out of one bag. My whole bathroom smells nice after I use this, it feels great on my skin, and it is soothing to my muscles. This has been a great soak during pregnancy and I plan to use this soak in early labor at home, as well. It is a nice big bag, and you don&#x27;t need to use too much so it lasts awhile. Good value.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a little time before bed, this is very soothing and you don&#x27;t need an expensive bubble bath to get a nice smooth skin effect. You just have to use at least 2 cups of it in your bath to get really nice results. So, buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> wife uses this one. she&#x27;s happy, and the aroma from it is great in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite of all of the Dr Teal&#x27;s salts. It smells so nice, and it&#x27;s so relaxing. It also practically melts away soreness.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I used it in the bath and it left my bath smelling lovely. Not only that, but it made my skin super soft and I felt very calm and relaxed. I plan on getting more when I run out on the batch I already have. :)</li>
            <li> The epsom salts are fine, but the smell is too strong and perfumey.  I don&#x27;t like perfumed things and thought this would be more natural smelling.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I picked this up and truly loved the smell when I used it in the bath. It was very relaxing and is probably the best smelling epsom salt I&#x27;ve purchased. I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> This epsom salt is absolutely the best reward after a long day. It smells wonderful which makes the experience all the better! It actually makes the entire bathroom smell&lt;br /&gt;terrific. It transfers a very calming feeling not only during but after the bath. It replenishes your magnesium levels which will help with absorbtion of calcium in your body.&lt;br /&gt;This is one simple thing you can do at least three times a week to help detox, and soothe your bodies adrenal glands. What a gift the earth has given us and Dr. Teal&#x27;s able to package and send to us!  The fragrances are just perfect to soothe the senses during the bath. A wonderful product to purchase.</li>
            <li> I tried a little in bath water, had to drain it out immediately because it stunk up bathroom.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to relieve stress and a mineral bath is fantastic.  I only use this product and use half the recommended measurement.</li>
            <li> I have at least five of the Dr. Teal&#x27;s fragrances of bath salts and this one is still my favorite. The fragrance is so soothing and makes my entire bathroom smell long after the bath is gone. Does not smell of a floral scent, not too sweet, not a sickening smell at all, but it is potent, it will make your bathroom smell good for a couple of hours after you&#x27;ve finished the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read a few other reviews that don&#x27;t like this fragrance. Everyone is different and has varying tastes. For me, this fragrance is bright, fresh, and soothing. I mix it (as with all my salts) with a little baking soda and Kosher salt, and sometimes for an extra fizz, some citric acid. Nothing minimizes the wonderful effect of the bath with the chamomile Dr. Teal&#x27;s salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a long day in the field or working in the barn, this bath salt helps my tired, achy feet and legs. Salts dissolve easily, while their effects linger. I try to order this often, and even though I do enjoy the other scents, this is my fallback - the one I have to make sure and keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen this product at Walgreen&#x27;s and Walmart but the price here is much better, as it&#x27;s usually and Add-on item. I am very happy it&#x27;s available here. Don&#x27;t want to run out of this stuff, it&#x27;s essential at my house for sure.</li>
            <li> I rely on hot epsom salt baths at night and thought it would be nice to have some relaxing scent incorporated...will likely stick to a few drops of essential oil rather than this particular solution as even a small handful of this mixed with about 3 parts regular (unscented) epsom salts is overpowering and lingers in my bathroom for days afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will buy again!  Smells great, it&#x27;s a little slice of  heaven.</li>
            <li> this is a very nice package for someone who already loves it.  i gave this as a gift for christmas</li>
            <li> I really liked Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soak and this was basically the same. BUT, it reeks! I did not enjoy the smell at all and it really clung to me after bathing. Not to mention the smell lingered for quite a while in my bathroom and on my towels. Ick! Will not be buying the Chamomile version again. Other then the smell yes it was relaxing to me and I do not think it is a bad product.</li>
            <li> The very best soaking solution I have ever used.  I&#x27;m a career waitress and this product is so soothing after a long day of work.</li>
            <li> These salts are nice. The smell is pretty but really really strong. i enjoyed putting them in my bath but when my husband came home I had to store them in a separate bag because the whole apartment smell was too strong for him</li>
            <li> Wonderful for sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the fragrance of these salts. They smell like cheap daisys and have a weird medical scent to them that was off putting.</li>
            <li> Fallen in love with Dr. Teal&#x27;s epson salt.  Not too over powering of a scent, the smell isn&#x27;t cheap, good for relaxing muscles.</li>
            <li> This was great if you are able to go right to bed!! My body felt limp and totally relaxed! Excited to try again!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product, but the smell is so strong and product has a very unnatural chemical smell that I can hardly breathe around it. It has given me a headache within a few minutes and is definitely not natural. I will never use again.</li>
            <li> The wife loves these for a quick relaxation at the end of a long day of work, teaching Pilates or travel.  I absolutely love the way these products smell and work to reduce stress as well.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff !!!</li>
            <li> The Epsom salts are very soothing to muscles after a long day out gardening and I love the smell of chamomile, it is wonderful to inhale that sweet smell as I soak the aches away.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this after a bath. It infuses the entire hallway with the awesome smell of chamomile. I think they are discontinuing it though, and it is becoming harder to find this particular product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scented over the non scented and this is great to soak body and/or feet for spa experience at home.</li>
            <li> These salts are soothing and have a wonderful smell.  After standing on my feet all day at a greenhouse, this is the best reward!</li>
            <li> Use it daily. Helps with pain and stiffness.</li>
            <li> Smell is way too strong. Thought I was purchasing something relaxing for my pregnant wife but it&#x27;s not relaxing to be covered in perfume and have the house reek of it for a day. The lavender was wonderful wish I would have purchased that instead.</li>
            <li> So Soaking in epsoms salts has been part of my weekly care in dealing with Fibromyalgia and Arthritis and is one of great benefit. I have found adding the chamomile to my regular epsoms salts really adds to the relaxation.  Works for me!</li>
