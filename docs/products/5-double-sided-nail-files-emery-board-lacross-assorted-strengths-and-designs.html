            <li>A good buy in my opinion</li>
            <li>Got here very quickly love them!</li>
            <li>The ones with print on them work really well and seem to be holding up the best.</li>
            <li>They are great to have handy in case my nails need a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>Nail files are great and these are super.  </li>
            <li>For the price this okay mix bag of emery boards, there are some that I do not like.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I really love these and will order them again.</li>
            <li>Could have been better - use to file a nail</li>
            <li>not the cute baby shower prizes I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love their colors too.</li>
            <li>Weren&#x27;t quite as pictured but okay</li>
            <li>I like these boards, and I&#x27;ll be buying more as I lose these.</li>
            <li>great seller, highly recommend</li>
            <li>These work just fine</li>
            <li>They smooth any nail roughness and are easy to work with on both finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li>I gave two to my husband who likes to keep his nails smooth.</li>
            <li>This was a nice assortment for normal nails.</li>
            <li>Handy double sided Emery Board files that come in cute colors.</li>
            <li>Look more used than new.  </li>
            <li>Very durable &amp; strong.  </li>
            <li>Delivery fast and product representation accurate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to professional files and, while these will work, they are much more flimsy and none of them have the grit size listed on them.</li>
            <li>The miscellaneous patterns are fun</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with these.</li>
            <li>For the most part, these are like the colorful ones you would find in a cup next to the register, but one of mine is labeled as &amp;#34;eco board&amp;#34; and has the brown color of recycled paper, or a paper shopping bag.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t do this again, I&#x27;ll just go back to Target for better price and first quality.</li>
            <li>This assortment of nail files by Sally Hansen really do the trick!  </li>
            <li>The first time I ordered these emory boards they were as advertised.  </li>
            <li>where damaged goods are sold and bought more cheaply than usual, then resold.</li>
            <li>Having this large selection certainly helps with that.</li>
            <li>Mostly marked variety of: 1 for Normal nails, 1 for Fragile nails, 2 files Medium on one side, Fine on the other, 1 file unmarked grit, but says Elegant Emery Board/Colorful Nail File.    </li>
            <li>Works OK, but odd assortment, looks like a bundle of stuff that did not sell otherwise.</li>
            <li>Only two nail files had cute patterns, the rest were solid color or brown-</li>
            <li>Happy so far, but they do seem to wear down a little quicker than I would like.</li>
            <li>Way more expensive than in stores, but the nail field themselves are fine</li>
            <li>cheap nail files, flimsy, do not last more then a use or two if your doing natural nails, for acrylics I&#x27;d suggest a different file, these will not work, not pleased at all,</li>
            <li>I also got a light blue one that worked pretty well but didn&#x27;t really last that long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very much experience with Emery Boards in general other than the original, thin ones from many years ago.</li>
            <li>really like these overall.</li>
            <li>They are different grits, but four out of five are more or less what I am used to, one side a little courser than the other, but both pretty fine.</li>
            <li>These individual boards are all shaped differently, piled on top of each other and wrapped in Saran Wrap.  </li>
            <li>I was disappointed not to get the colorful designs, but the files were in good shipped condition</li>
            <li>The black one is curved, unlike the straight one in the pic.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Been holding onto my previous files to &amp;#34;get every last bit&amp;#34; out of &#x27;em, but when I got these, I tossed my old ones.</li>
            <li> One won&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li> They are resilient and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Four of them are 7 inches, one is 6.5 inches long.</li>
            <li> I got a black coarse one that I think is for acrylic nails, there was a few natural emery boards they work</li>
            <li> Four were exactly the same:  for fragile nails with hardly any sanding surface, the color of plain corrugated cardboard and one board of medium roughness in black.</li>
            <li> These are typical padded emery boards (the larger size, a little smaller than the width of my thumb)&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are well made and outclass other Emery Boards</li>
            <li> After one use the grit wears off and no longer files the nail down.  </li>
            <li> Odd,</li>
            <li> Designs are ugly - pink and blue cats on a yellow background, sad dalmation puppies on a hot pink background, headless ladies with shopping bags, and plain black - not as pictured!</li>
            <li> The fifth is HEAVY grit.</li>
            <li> There is one black one that is a very heavy grit - I&#x27;d save that one for suborn toenails.</li>
            <li> I usually buy all my files at a beauty supply store</li>
            <li> I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> The colors seem to be random, only one of the ones I got matches one in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually purchase my nail files from Sally&#x27;s after seeing these on Amazon I thought way not try them!</li>
            <li> They were wrapped together by the seller in thick saran wrap - awful aesthetic for a beauty product.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad about these...  </li>
            <li> These are not flimsy by any means &amp; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These nail files are horrible.  </li>

            <li> Very durable &amp; strong.  One of the best nail files on the market.  These are not flimsy by any means &amp; you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but odd assortment, looks like a bundle of stuff that did not sell otherwise.</li>
            <li> Happy so far, but they do seem to wear down a little quicker than I would like.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed not to get the colorful designs, but the files were in good shipped condition</li>
            <li> Nothing bad about these...  The black one is curved, unlike the straight one in the pic.</li>
            <li> I usually buy all my files at a beauty supply store but I recently broke my foot and can&#x27;t drive. I&#x27;m used to professional files and, while these will work, they are much more flimsy and none of them have the grit size listed on them.</li>
            <li> I never seem to have enough nail files are, or the ones I do have are not of the write grit. Having this large selection certainly helps with that.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase my nail files from Sally&#x27;s after seeing these on Amazon I thought way not try them! Mistake!!&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap nail files, flimsy, do not last more then a use or two if your doing natural nails, for acrylics I&#x27;d suggest a different file, these will not work, not pleased at all,</li>
            <li> These are great.  They are quite similar to those I have seen used in salons and hold up well to use.</li>
            <li> For the price this okay mix bag of emery boards, there are some that I do not like. I got a black coarse one that I think is for acrylic nails, there was a few natural emery boards they work okay but they do not seem to last. The ones with print on them work really well and seem to be holding up the best. I also got a light blue one that worked pretty well but didn&#x27;t really last that long. I am indifferent if I would purchase again, I think it is best to just buy the brand/type of board I like.</li>
            <li> This was a nice assortment for normal nails. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Designs are ugly - pink and blue cats on a yellow background, sad dalmation puppies on a hot pink background, headless ladies with shopping bags, and plain black - not as pictured! Four of them are 7 inches, one is 6.5 inches long. The 6.5 inch one has scapes on the edges like it&#x27;s been used. They were wrapped together by the seller in thick saran wrap - awful aesthetic for a beauty product. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really love these and will order them again.</li>
            <li> Variety pack of nail files. Mostly marked variety of: 1 for Normal nails, 1 for Fragile nails, 2 files Medium on one side, Fine on the other, 1 file unmarked grit, but says Elegant Emery Board/Colorful Nail File.    Two of the files came with both ends cut off.  Odd, but I believe these are &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; where damaged goods are sold and bought more cheaply than usual, then resold. The ends were probably damaged, cut off and sold here.  I wouldn&#x27;t do this again, I&#x27;ll just go back to Target for better price and first quality.</li>
            <li> Could have been better - use to file a nail and it&#x27;s done. One won&#x27;t last for long.</li>
            <li> Got here very quickly love them!</li>
            <li> Been holding onto my previous files to &amp;#34;get every last bit&amp;#34; out of &#x27;em, but when I got these, I tossed my old ones. Came in a variety of colors and just what I was looking for. Now I keep one in my office and one in my bathroom so I file instead of chew my nails.</li>
            <li> great seller, highly recommend</li>
            <li> These work just fine IF you can get the plastic shrink-wrap off of them! The miscellaneous patterns are fun</li>
            <li> got for my daughter for a birthday gift. She loves it. it contains an assortment of surfaces ( or fineness of the grit?) which she loves. gonna get some for myself cause I am not allowed to borrow them!</li>
            <li> Only two nail files had cute patterns, the rest were solid color or brown- not the cute baby shower prizes I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Way more expensive than in stores, but the nail field themselves are fine</li>
            <li> Sally Hanson products seldom disappoint. Delivery fast and product representation accurate.</li>
            <li> I know I did this one but these are a variety of different boards so it should cover all your needs and they are very good ones</li>
            <li> Handy double sided Emery Board files that come in cute colors. I  put one in the purse I use when I go out,  one in my gym bag, and one in the kitchen. They are great to have handy in case my nails need a quick touch up. I gave two to my husband who likes to keep his nails smooth. They are well made and outclass other Emery Boards I have bought in the past. They smooth any nail roughness and are easy to work with on both finger and toe nails.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Assorted strengths&amp;#34; as in &amp;#34;only 2 of these are technically even nail files&amp;#34;. Most of what I received is useless.</li>
            <li> This assortment of nail files by Sally Hansen really do the trick!  Love their colors too. They are resilient and long lasting. Two sides to each file allows for double the service . Great product.</li>
            <li> Weren&#x27;t quite as pictured but okay</li>
            <li> Very excellent product. I don&#x27;t have very much experience with Emery Boards in general other than the original, thin ones from many years ago. I am pleasantly surprised and pleased with these.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase... :)</li>
            <li> These individual boards are all shaped differently, piled on top of each other and wrapped in Saran Wrap.  Disappointed.  Look more used than new.  I&#x27;ll go to Walmart the next time.</li>
            <li> Nail files are great and these are super.  Don&#x27;t let the color fool you - they file your nails beautifully.  There is one black one that is a very heavy grit - I&#x27;d save that one for suborn toenails.</li>
            <li> These nail files are horrible.  After one use the grit wears off and no longer files the nail down.  I would not recommend these or purchase them again.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered these emory boards they were as advertised.  My re-order was not.  I am attaching a photo of what they sent.&lt;br /&gt;I received 5 emory boards.  Four were exactly the same:  for fragile nails with hardly any sanding surface, the color of plain corrugated cardboard and one board of medium roughness in black.</li>
            <li> Very nice variety set.</li>
            <li> I like the various coarseness of the filers.</li>
            <li> These are terrific. Plus I can now put one every place I need (home, office, car) in case of an emergency.</li>
            <li> I like these boards, and I&#x27;ll be buying more as I lose these. This is just some info for potential buyers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- These are typical padded emery boards (the larger size, a little smaller than the width of my thumb)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The colors seem to be random, only one of the ones I got matches one in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For the most part, these are like the colorful ones you would find in a cup next to the register, but one of mine is labeled as &amp;#34;eco board&amp;#34; and has the brown color of recycled paper, or a paper shopping bag. Don&#x27;t know if that will be the case with yours or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They are different grits, but four out of five are more or less what I am used to, one side a little courser than the other, but both pretty fine. The fifth is HEAVY grit. I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll ever actually use it on my nails, maybe my toenails I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these overall. A good buy in my opinion</li>
