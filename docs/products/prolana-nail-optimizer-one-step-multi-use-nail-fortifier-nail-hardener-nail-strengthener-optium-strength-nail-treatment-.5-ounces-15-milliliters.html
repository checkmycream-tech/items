            <li>It improves the length of time the manicure stays nice.</li>
            <li>It is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>I had acrylic nails for years and when I retired I decided to try and grow my own nails.  </li>

            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>and this really works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and immediately effective.</li>
            <li>Keeps your polish on and your nails very strong.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>I have never been able to keep nail polish on for a full day, N-E-V-E-R!!</li>
            <li>The application was fine, the shine it provided was amazing, but my nails began cracking at the stress points and as a result I had to cut them all off and regrow them again.  </li>
            <li>A must buy!&lt;br /&gt;Salons sell it for a lot more.</li>
            <li>I have used Prolana Nail for about 6 months; many of my friends are using it also.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>This bottle said &amp;#34;Nail Optimizer&amp;#34; at the top and then &amp;#34;Prolana&amp;#34; at the bottom.</li>
            <li>More than anything else I have tried, too.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>ALWAYS, then 2 coats of color, then another coat on top.</li>
            <li>Love the pricing and free shipping from Amazon</li>
            <li>The product dries very quickly which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>and my nails are beautiful again---not as long as I would like them to be, but they are getting there---and healthy too.  </li>
            <li>This is the finest product for keeping nails strong, supple and unbreakable.  </li>
            <li>You want strong, beautiful and lasting nails use this product</li>
            <li>It is fantastic.</li>
            <li>its easy to use and also quick drying...</li>
            <li>Now they are long and look great.  </li>
            <li>That manicure lasted 6 full days.</li>
            <li>I used Prolana 1 1/2 weeks ago as a bottom and top coat over OPI brand polish, I weeded in the garden without gloves, did housework, put some real stress on my nails.</li>
            <li>Prolana made my nails very strong, long and elegant.</li>
            <li>Super product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was relatively quick.</li>
            <li>I was successful and pleasantly surprised so far.</li>
            <li>I have nails for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>Great Product and truly recommend it to anyone having trouble growing their nails..</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I put it on once a day and then take it off on day 5, and reapply with fresh coats.  </li>
            <li>and my nail would peel right across my finger.</li>
            <li>I knew from previous experience that it helps to get my nails in good shape.  </li>
            <li>I have my nails back to the length they were so many years ago after years of sculptured nails (IBD gel) and CND shellac.  </li>
            <li>and this is very inexpensive!</li>
            <li>was pleased to find it here, and at same price!</li>
            <li>I was always unable to grow my own nails, but I have been using this product faithfully and it is truly working!!!!</li>
            <li>NOT the REAL Nail Optimizer!</li>
            <li>Recommended by manicurist for home use really helps polish not to chip!</li>
            <li>They are very chip resistant!  </li>
            <li>I first came across this product in a nail salon.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it would work better if I removed and reapplied it daily.</li>
            <li>Now they are long and strong!  </li>
            <li>It really does a great job keeping my nails hard and unbreakable.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve really had nails since, well, EVER.</li>
            <li>After I started using Nail Optimizer every night (put it on and let it build up for 5 days, then remove and start over), they actually started growing and now look like happy, healthy nails, even though I only get manicures once every few months.</li>
            <li>Now I have strong nails that I have to actually shorten from time to time.  </li>
            <li>I would try to grow my nails but they would get to a certain length and then crack in the corners</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find stores that carry it so buying it on line is a really good option.</li>
            <li>Too many years of acrylic nails have drastically weakened my own nails, but they&#x27;re slowly coming back.  </li>
            <li>It has really strengthened my nails.  </li>
            <li>It really helped my nails grow.</li>
            <li>Dries fast</li>
            <li>I put this on a couple of times a week--and it really makes them stronger.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, if you have difficulty keeping long nails, or have nails that easily break, this product will strengthen them.</li>
            <li>Used the previous optimizer and love it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this before and highly recommend it to strengthen your nails.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps my polish looking and staying fresh for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have used a basecoat, polish and then Nail Optimizer over that as a top coat and reapply it everyday.  </li>
            <li>After using this product every manicure, my nail is normal.  </li>
            <li>Have not tried this product under the new name.  </li>
            <li>and like it so far.</li>
            <li>it made my nails very dry and cracked, so the exact opposite of what the real stuff does for your nails.</li>
            <li>I have had weak brittle nails for years and when I use this product I find I can finally grow my own nails.  </li>
            <li>Be careful which seller you purchase from, my first bottle was from another seller..</li>
            <li>Last night I stripped the polish and redid (the old had gotten a teenie-tiny bit ragged on the edges).</li>
            <li>I have tried various products over the years and this far exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and rarely get a chip or break.</li>
            <li>but currently and only I week thus far, no nails have split...</li>
            <li>This product strengthens weak nails and keeps them strong without splitting.</li>

            <li> but currently and only I week thus far, no nails have split...</li>
            <li> This product strengthens weak nails and keeps them strong without splitting.</li>
            <li> My nails are thin, dry and break easily.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT like the original formula.. Poor product that causes peeling of the nails.</li>
            <li> The only slight downside is that it can take a little longer to take off all the layers, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have also started taking 5000mcg of biotin everyday from the recommendation of my dermatologist to help with my nails which I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Last a long time.  </li>
            <li> My thumb nail has been having a constant split and my other nails were weaker with peeling and ridges present.  </li>
            <li> So I am excited that this might be my cure for my weak split thumb nail as well!  </li>
            <li> This product strengthened my nails to the point that I have to cut them because they&#x27;ve gotten long.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me for dry and brittle fingernails.</li>
            <li> My main problem was that my index fingernail was loose almost all of the way down to the half moon!  </li>
            <li> This is the only top and base coat that I have found to actually work.  </li>
            <li> Moved across the country and finally depleted my little miracle bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years as both a base coat and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the reviews I watched on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> I use the Optimizer as a base, add a color coat, and the Optimizer as the top coat.</li>
            <li> and when you get nail polish on use it as your base and top coat it truly works.</li>
            <li> All you do is apply this as a base coat and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I have used it ever since for my base coat and top coat.  </li>
            <li> for it to work put it on everyday</li>
            <li> I have trouble growin my nails</li>
            <li> My nails have begun to split the the past few yrs</li>
            <li> However, my nails were extremely thin and dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 8 months.</li>
            <li> it truly works and repairs your nails especially if you had fake nails put on.</li>
            <li> No more splitting.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing rings, nail polish, and not having to hide my hands because of terrible looking nails is the biggest plus.</li>
            <li> It was suggested that I use it for my problem nails (peeling, weak).  </li>
            <li> They are naturally very thin and weak, peeled all the time, never grew past my fingertips.</li>
            <li> and they were broken and weak.  </li>
            <li> I have nails that are very weak</li>

            <li> After using Prolana Optimizer for about a month, I can see a difference in my nails.  Too many years of acrylic nails have drastically weakened my own nails, but they&#x27;re slowly coming back.  I use the Optimizer as a base, add a color coat, and the Optimizer as the top coat.</li>
            <li> Have not tried this product under the new name.  Used the previous optimizer and love it.  It improves the length of time the manicure stays nice.</li>
            <li> It is the absolute best. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 8 months. My nails now look like I have wraps on and are stronger than ever.A must buy!&lt;br /&gt;Salons sell it for a lot more.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve really had nails since, well, EVER. They are naturally very thin and weak, peeled all the time, never grew past my fingertips. After I started using Nail Optimizer every night (put it on and let it build up for 5 days, then remove and start over), they actually started growing and now look like happy, healthy nails, even though I only get manicures once every few months. I also like that it dries faster than regular nail polish. The only slight downside is that it can take a little longer to take off all the layers, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a short time but can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> You want strong, beautiful and lasting nails use this product it truly works and repairs your nails especially if you had fake nails put on. my mom uses the stuff if you could only feel and see you won&#x27;t believe they were her nails. for it to work put it on everyday and when you get nail polish on use it as your base and top coat it truly works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I have my nails back to the length they were so many years ago after years of sculptured nails (IBD gel) and CND shellac.  All you do is apply this as a base coat and top coat.  Makes my polish last a week and this is very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  It stops the peeling and cracking.  I wear my  nails short and I have tried everything.  This does work.</li>
            <li> great product for strengthening nails</li>
            <li> Have used this product before, it is one of the best! Thought it could only be found through a salon so was pleased to find it here, and at same price!</li>
            <li> I have used Prolana Nail for about 6 months; many of my friends are using it also.  We are ordering the product on-line because we can find it easier than in stores.  I am now ordering 20 bottles, because when I need the product, I ask all of my friends if they also need a refill.  Everyone I know who is using Nail Optimizer is very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the reviews I watched on YouTube.  Unfortunately this did not help me protect and strengthen my nails.  The application was fine, the shine it provided was amazing, but my nails began cracking at the stress points and as a result I had to cut them all off and regrow them again.  My nails had never done that before.  Prior to this I was using Nailtiques Formula 2 and decided to try this because it was a bit cheaper.  Back to what I know works.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps your polish on and your nails very strong.</li>
            <li> I have had weak brittle nails for years and when I use this product I find I can finally grow my own nails.  highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have never been able to keep nail polish on for a full day, N-E-V-E-R!! The 1st time I was introduced to Nail Optimzer was by a manicure gal, she said it would keep the polish on. That manicure lasted 6 full days. I bought a bottle from the salon. Moved across the country and finally depleted my little miracle bottle. Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere on the west coast. Searched online and am now reunited. I used Prolana 1 1/2 weeks ago as a bottom and top coat over OPI brand polish, I weeded in the garden without gloves, did housework, put some real stress on my nails. Last night I stripped the polish and redid (the old had gotten a teenie-tiny bit ragged on the edges). This isn&#x27;t a good product, it is a freakin&#x27; miracle.</li>
            <li> It has really strengthened my nails.  It was recommended by a friend. I followe directions and continue to keep it on my nails. D.Odom</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for years and when I retired I decided to try and grow my own nails.  However, my nails were extremely thin and dry.  A friend recommended this product and I was amazed at the results.  After a few weeks you could really see the difference.  I get compliments all the times about how wonderful my nails look thanks to this product.  Actually when I placed this order, I was buying it for another friend who had the same problem.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I used to have short, brittle nails.  Now they are long and look great.  What a difference!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to combine with my purchase of the cuticle oil. It was recommended to me for dry and brittle fingernails. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and like it so far.</li>
            <li> It really helped my nails grow. They are stronger also.</li>
            <li> I had this product applied to my nails by a technician at a salon and I liked it so i thought I&#x27;d try to find it on line... I was successful and pleasantly surprised so far. My nails have begun to split the the past few yrs and perhaps it&#x27;s my age or post menopausal adjustments but currently and only I week thus far, no nails have split... Well see. But thank you</li>
            <li> My nails were short and brittle before I started using this product.  Now they are long and strong!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend several years ago.  I&#x27;ve been using it since with great results.  Love the pricing and free shipping from Amazon</li>
            <li> This product strengthens weak nails and keeps them strong without splitting. I use it at least once a week. Great for nails that are growing out from the damage acrylic does.  Super product.</li>
            <li> This items has definitely improved the condition of my nails!  I have tried various products over the years and this far exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> My nail tech recommended that I use this product. Recently I took off my acrylic nails. I was always unable to grow my own nails, but I have been using this product faithfully and it is truly working!!!! I love it.. its easy to use and also quick drying... Great Product and truly recommend it to anyone having trouble growing their nails..</li>
            <li> I have a medical issue that affects my nails and makes them brittle and break. This product strengthened my nails to the point that I have to cut them because they&#x27;ve gotten long. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> I am happy with product. I have used this before and highly recommend it to strengthen your nails.  Shipping was relatively quick.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! NOT the REAL Nail Optimizer! I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;Nail Optimizer&amp;#34; for years and love it! However, when it arrived the bottle looked different then before, and as advertised. This bottle said &amp;#34;Nail Optimizer&amp;#34; at the top and then &amp;#34;Prolana&amp;#34; at the bottom. This stuff is horrible! it made my nails very dry and cracked, so the exact opposite of what the real stuff does for your nails. I ordered it from &amp;#34;La Bella B supply&amp;#34;, which I will never do again!</li>
            <li> I have trouble growin my nails and this really works great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 9 Months as a base coat and an overcoat during my manicures.  It definitely keeps my polish looking and staying fresh for two weeks.  My nails are healthier and stronger.  I got an extra bottle last time for a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this product !!!!! I never had nails. I had stubs no I had nubs !! I would try to grow my nails but they would get to a certain length and then crack in the corners and my nail would peel right across my finger. Not any more, I have beautiful nails because of Prolana. I enjoy wearing rings, nail polish, and not having to hide my hands because of terrible looking nails is the biggest plus. Prolana made my nails very strong, long and elegant. What more can you ask for !</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that a manicurist turned me on to. It strengthens and protects my nails and keeps them from splitting. I&#x27;ve been using it for about eight years. It&#x27;s hard to find stores that carry it so buying it on line is a really good option.</li>
            <li> The reason why I bought Prolana Nail Optimizer is because my friend started using it and her nails have noticeably gotten stronger and longer.  I have been having horrible nail problems since I removed my acrylic nails.  My thumb nail has been having a constant split and my other nails were weaker with peeling and ridges present.  So I wanted to try this polish to see if it would help because I have tried EVERY product from the beauty supply store and nothing has helped, especially the split in my thumb nail.  Well I have started to see the split disappearing!  I have used a basecoat, polish and then Nail Optimizer over that as a top coat and reapply it everyday.  For one, my polish lasts a week now without chipping which I have never had  that happen before!  So I am excited that this might be my cure for my weak split thumb nail as well!  Time will tell!  I have also started taking 5000mcg of biotin everyday from the recommendation of my dermatologist to help with my nails which I highly recommend.  So far so good!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by manicurist for home use really helps polish not to chip! Dries fast</li>
            <li> If it were not for Nail Optimizer I would have no nails to speak of.  Mine flaked like pastry into the \\&quot;quick\\&quot; until I began using Optimizer.  Now I have strong nails that I have to actually shorten from time to time.  They are very chip resistant!  It&#x27;s very easy to use and immediately effective.</li>
            <li> This is the only top and base coat that I have found to actually work.  This item greatly helps keep polish on and looking great.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time. It makes my nails grow. I LOVE IT.!!!!! I even got a friend to use it.</li>
            <li> This is NOT like the original formula.. Poor product that causes peeling of the nails. Be careful which seller you purchase from, my first bottle was from another seller..</li>
            <li> This is great for problem nails.  My main problem was that my index fingernail was loose almost all of the way down to the half moon!  It was attached on the sides.  After using this product every manicure, my nail is normal.  Now I use it for peeling nails.</li>
            <li> I have nails that are very weak and I do a lot of housework.  This nail optimizer HELPS.  More than anything else I have tried, too.</li>
            <li> Works great in helping protect my nails.  I knew from previous experience that it helps to get my nails in good shape.  I had let them go and they were broken and weak.  Two weeks and my nails are beautiful again---not as long as I would like them to be, but they are getting there---and healthy too.  No more splitting.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have nails for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> My nails looks much better!</li>
            <li> This product is designed to strengthen your nails. It is fantastic. I use it everyday and rarely get a chip or break.</li>
            <li> I first came across this product in a nail salon.  It was suggested that I use it for my problem nails (peeling, weak).  That was about 12 years ago...I have used it ever since for my base coat and top coat.  For me it does the trick.  Also, just recently, I had my 81 yo mother-in-law use it on her nails (she has been allergic to nail polish for years).  She knew it was a good product for her because it didn&#x27;t make her nails itch.  So a double endorsement!</li>
            <li> This works.  My nails are thin, dry and break easily.  I put this on a couple of times a week--and it really makes them stronger.  I  have nails.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.  Last a long time.  I recomended it to my friends, too.</li>
            <li> This is the finest product for keeping nails strong, supple and unbreakable.  I have used it for several years as both a base coat and top coat.  Love the shine and it doesn&#x27;t get gloppy!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It really does a great job keeping my nails hard and unbreakable. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> A nail tech told me to try Prolana for my very weak nails.  I put it on once a day and then take it off on day 5, and reapply with fresh coats.  My nails are definitely stronger.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY NAIL STRENGTHENER THAT I HAVE USED AND WILL EVER USE, IT&#x27;S AMAZING AND WORKS WONDERS. WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER PRODUCT BESIDES THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Has only a temporary affect on correcting my problem nails of constant splitting, peeling and breakage. The product dries very quickly which is a plus.  Perhaps it would work better if I removed and reapplied it daily.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, if you have difficulty keeping long nails, or have nails that easily break, this product will strengthen them. I use it as a base coat ALWAYS, then 2 coats of color, then another coat on top.</li>
