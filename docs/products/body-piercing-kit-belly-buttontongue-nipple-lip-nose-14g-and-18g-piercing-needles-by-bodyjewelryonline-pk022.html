            <li>But still I am satisfied!</li>
            <li>Everything else is pretty great!</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t have any problems fitting into the end of the needle!</li>
            <li>and when I pierced my belly it went through nice and smooth!!</li>
            <li>Looks amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing set for the price, it did its job without a problem.</li>
            <li>I liked it .</li>
            <li>Basically, i attempted to do an eyebrow piercing and the needle went in nicely, but I had problems getting the jewelry in</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>but I would have liked to have the shown jewelry instead of what I got</li>
            <li>I pierced my own nose</li>
            <li>This kit was very easy to use and was packaged well, which is what I was concerned about.</li>
            <li>amazing identical to the photo works great and is stronger and higher quality</li>
            <li>everything was in tact needles were right on point and my piercing came out great.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>The gauges fit perfectly with the jewelry and everything was very sterile.</li>
            <li>You get everything you pay for, very good quality, metal clamps are still in good shape and the needles were nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>JUST LIKE THE PICTURE :)</li>
            <li>Overall great deal!</li>
            <li>and they thought they were really cute.</li>
            <li>It hurts but it will heal :)</li>
            <li>but the needle hurts and the clamp is ok wish it was circular not a square-ish type ..</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pierce yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this kit</li>
            <li>Im glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li>After using the kit on myself, I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Clamp is metal which is actually better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect I&#x27;m about to peirce my nose and later my belly button</li>
            <li>Pierced my nose &amp; I love it</li>
            <li>I love it üíãüëèüëèüéÄ</li>
            <li>able to Pierce:&lt;br /&gt;-both nipples</li>
            <li>but I thought it would come with more needles.</li>
            <li>And you have to make sure you&#x27;re clamp is leveled before piercing you&#x27;re bellybutton.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>You get MORE than what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I love the retainer it came with.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE STARTER SETS</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get my kit to start piercing at home.</li>
            <li>I liked it, clean utensils</li>
            <li>Most likely will buy again, Easy application and great service!</li>
            <li>So this is a great kit for that price :) already did my cartilage, nd needles are nice and sharp :)</li>
            <li>love that the forceps are metal which is a huge plus</li>
            <li>I am useing my own but the other one is really good!</li>
            <li>The clamp worked perfectly and I got the needle ALMOST all the way through, but I had a harder time getting the needle through the bottom layer of skin with the clamp, so I ended up not using it.</li>
            <li>I used it right away on my nose and pierced my friends nipples!!</li>
            <li>I mainly had bought this kit to pierce the second side of my nose with a stud, by far the stud that comes with this kit is the best stud that I&#x27;ve worked with, it&#x27;s comfortable, doesn&#x27;t slide out, and fits perfectly with the needles given.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>so the belly ring will not screw in the needls for easy transition during the process.</li>
            <li>My belly button came out just fine.</li>
            <li>I pierced my tongue and the jewelry didnt fit through the needle so that was a pain.</li>
            <li>The foresepts are alright, they worked well but are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Clamp is easy to clean and the packaged arrived on time.</li>
            <li>For being so cheap, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Neither of the belly button rings fit into the needle.</li>
            <li>are plastic and don&#x27;t have a smooth finish which resulted in scratching.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>Worked great for it though, the ripping out was totally my fault.  </li>
            <li>great comes with extra needles!</li>
            <li>Super easy, everything was packaged &amp; sealed correctly.</li>
            <li>I really liked the kit, it came with everything as shown within a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Worth the buy !</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Needles look clean</li>
            <li>everything was packaged in separate packets and clean.</li>
            <li>everything looks clean</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m still gonna clean it )</li>
            <li>but I had what i needed to clean.</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS SENT OUT FAST AND GOT IT QUICKLY!!</li>
            <li>Needles are sharp and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Jewlery is stainless steel,  threading is perfect</li>
            <li>the needles go right through!</li>
            <li>Plainless and get it done right !</li>
            <li>Overall really good</li>
            <li>i most definetly recommend this to anyone who wants to pierce at home</li>
            <li>Everything was overall good.</li>
            <li>The clamp was metal when  I orderd this back in  October, the rings come in good quality.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more very soon</li>
            <li>Other than that the kit was great.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great and sterile</li>
            <li>Piercing my nose was quick and painless.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and everything was there.</li>
            <li>It was decently sharp and the jewelry is very nice as well</li>
            <li>Loved it the needles came sharp and sterilized the jewelery didnt fit in the 14g for the bellybutton</li>
            <li>Very Good Kit For Such A Low Price</li>
            <li>I pierced my lip from this kit but with my own labrets and such.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Really liked it, wish the belly button rings were the Actual ones in the picture</li>
            <li>Worth it for the needles, but buy separate studs.</li>
            <li>sharp needles and good jewelry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but the clamp was too sharp at the edges.</li>
            <li>In right after.</li>
            <li>it went right through with out any problem.</li>
            <li>i did my own belly piercing the first time but not with the same kit will not be buying any products from this person again</li>
            <li>this is the first time I pierced my nose and the first time I did it at home!</li>
            <li>Loved it other than that!</li>
            <li>It came on time and with everything described and expected I love my belly piercing, I&#x27;m cheap</li>
            <li>Came very fast.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>This kit really saved me money!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>but i just put the ring in real wuick and its perf!</li>
            <li>And the top ball on the belly button ring doesn&#x27;t attach back to the ring nor does the ring got into the needle to insert it into to your belly button</li>
            <li>overall I was pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I do suggest buying some sponged forceps as well though, just personal preference :)</li>
            <li>The barbell is perfect too because with the initial swelling you want jewelry that is big enough to accommodate it.  </li>
            <li>Perfactly packaged and everthing needles are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come with the belly button rings shown, just a plain silver one which is fine because it&#x27;s still cute.</li>
            <li>the needles are very sharp and i pierced my septum pretty quickly :)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted and as pictured.</li>
            <li>The clamps of course aren&#x27;t the best you could get, but they work if you need them for other piercings, just a heavy duty plastic clamp.</li>
            <li>Other than that, for the price it&#x27;s great, especially with all the jewelry it included !</li>
            <li>Needles were sharp, jewelry is great quality and if I ever want to do another piercing I&#x27;m definitely buying again!!</li>
            <li>Good set comes with just about all you need but not any thing for your targus :/</li>
            <li>Needles were plenty sharp and went right through my skin, couldn&#x27;t even feel it:)</li>
            <li>Went in easy but the gages were the same size</li>
            <li>It was a quick and nearly painless process.</li>
            <li>The ring also looked like a large zit on my nose, but I put some nail polish on it.</li>
            <li>The accessory pieces are useless to me as I would never put mystery metals in my body but needles were very good quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone that wants an at home kit.</li>
            <li>this was all it said it would be and came really fast</li>
            <li>it came faster then I expected :)</li>
            <li>Just as described,sterile, very neat, fasst shipping will buy from again</li>
            <li>The nose stud is too big to fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overall a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li>Did the job, but the nose ring wouldn&#x27;t fit in the end of the 18g needle, so I ended up having to use the larger needle to pierce my nose.  </li>
            <li>I was actually delivered a much more professional kit than pictured...with a sterile metal clamp ...</li>
            <li>everything came as expected , needles were sharp and good, shipment came fast..</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly except for the cbr.</li>
            <li>I pierced my tongue and it was painless just a pinch needle was nicely sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Ordered this because I wanted to pierce my belly button for Spring break (without having to pay so much to get it done professionally) and just before my boyfriend and I&#x27;s anniversary.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun kit but the jewelry in it is low quality.</li>
            <li>The only thing worth anything is the clamp, and even that is subpar.</li>
            <li>The thing that holds your place where you Pierce is quite painful to place, but everything else was great everything in their own bags the jewelry was out and about though, bit other than that.</li>
            <li>Clamps are cheap plastic, too flimsy to hold skin in place and too sharp to hold a tongue.</li>
            <li>I went to a shop for them to put a new stud in</li>
            <li>and they wanted to charge me for a new piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I am going to bleach the needles &amp; belly rings &amp; ordered a numb cream because I can&#x27;t take that needle lol</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Go to a professional.</li>
            <li>Came early with everything it said it would.</li>
            <li>it came in early</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use the big needle not the little one because I had to restart but that was my fault because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention!</li>
            <li>I would rather have a straight bar nose ring instead of the whirl but other than that the packet was decent.</li>
            <li>This worked great for me, my only complaint is I had trouble getting the nose ring in with the 18g needle</li>
            <li>: includes two needles, clamp, multiple body jewelry ,fast shipping &amp; low priced</li>
            <li>the needles are EXTREMELY sharp, so piercing my nose was even easier than it was the first time I had done it.</li>
            <li>Needles came sterilized, came before estimated due date and the clamps alone are worth the total price of the kit.</li>
            <li>Mine was a week late, and the jewelry fit.</li>
            <li>The needle is not sharp enough to pierce my belly button.</li>
            <li>All in all, the piercing was fast and the needles were very sharp.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Everything else is pretty great!</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t have any problems fitting into the end of the needle!</li>
            <li> and when I pierced my belly it went through nice and smooth!!</li>
            <li> Looks amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing set for the price, it did its job without a problem.</li>
            <li> I liked it .</li>
            <li> Basically, i attempted to do an eyebrow piercing and the needle went in nicely, but I had problems getting the jewelry in</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> but I would have liked to have the shown jewelry instead of what I got</li>
            <li> I pierced my own nose</li>
            <li> This kit was very easy to use and was packaged well, which is what I was concerned about.</li>
            <li> amazing identical to the photo works great and is stronger and higher quality</li>
            <li> everything was in tact needles were right on point and my piercing came out great.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> The gauges fit perfectly with the jewelry and everything was very sterile.</li>
            <li> You get everything you pay for, very good quality, metal clamps are still in good shape and the needles were nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> JUST LIKE THE PICTURE :)</li>
            <li> Overall great deal!</li>
            <li> and they thought they were really cute.</li>
            <li> It hurts but it will heal :)</li>
            <li> but the needle hurts and the clamp is ok wish it was circular not a square-ish type ..</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pierce yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this kit</li>
            <li> Im glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li> After using the kit on myself, I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Clamp is metal which is actually better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect I&#x27;m about to peirce my nose and later my belly button</li>
            <li> Pierced my nose &amp; I love it</li>
            <li> I love it üíãüëèüëèüéÄ</li>
            <li> able to Pierce:&lt;br /&gt;-both nipples</li>
            <li> but I thought it would come with more needles.</li>
            <li> And you have to make sure you&#x27;re clamp is leveled before piercing you&#x27;re bellybutton.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> You get MORE than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love the retainer it came with.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE STARTER SETS</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my kit to start piercing at home.</li>
            <li> I liked it, clean utensils</li>
            <li> Most likely will buy again, Easy application and great service!</li>
            <li> So this is a great kit for that price :) already did my cartilage, nd needles are nice and sharp :)</li>
            <li> love that the forceps are metal which is a huge plus</li>
            <li> I am useing my own but the other one is really good!</li>
            <li> The clamp worked perfectly and I got the needle ALMOST all the way through, but I had a harder time getting the needle through the bottom layer of skin with the clamp, so I ended up not using it.</li>
            <li> I used it right away on my nose and pierced my friends nipples!!</li>
            <li> I mainly had bought this kit to pierce the second side of my nose with a stud, by far the stud that comes with this kit is the best stud that I&#x27;ve worked with, it&#x27;s comfortable, doesn&#x27;t slide out, and fits perfectly with the needles given.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> so the belly ring will not screw in the needls for easy transition during the process.</li>
            <li> My belly button came out just fine.</li>
            <li> I pierced my tongue and the jewelry didnt fit through the needle so that was a pain.</li>
            <li> The foresepts are alright, they worked well but are cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Clamp is easy to clean and the packaged arrived on time.</li>
            <li> For being so cheap, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Neither of the belly button rings fit into the needle.</li>
            <li> are plastic and don&#x27;t have a smooth finish which resulted in scratching.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> Worked great for it though, the ripping out was totally my fault.  </li>
            <li> great comes with extra needles!</li>
            <li> Super easy, everything was packaged &amp; sealed correctly.</li>
            <li> I really liked the kit, it came with everything as shown within a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Worth the buy !</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Needles look clean</li>
            <li> everything was packaged in separate packets and clean.</li>
            <li> everything looks clean</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m still gonna clean it )</li>
            <li> but I had what i needed to clean.</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS SENT OUT FAST AND GOT IT QUICKLY!!</li>
            <li> Needles are sharp and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Jewlery is stainless steel,  threading is perfect</li>
            <li> the needles go right through!</li>
            <li> Plainless and get it done right !</li>
            <li> Overall really good</li>
            <li> i most definetly recommend this to anyone who wants to pierce at home</li>
            <li> Everything was overall good.</li>
            <li> The clamp was metal when  I orderd this back in  October, the rings come in good quality.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more very soon</li>
            <li> Other than that the kit was great.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great and sterile</li>
            <li> Piercing my nose was quick and painless.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and everything was there.</li>
            <li> It was decently sharp and the jewelry is very nice as well</li>
            <li> Loved it the needles came sharp and sterilized the jewelery didnt fit in the 14g for the bellybutton</li>
            <li> Very Good Kit For Such A Low Price</li>
            <li> I pierced my lip from this kit but with my own labrets and such.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really liked it, wish the belly button rings were the Actual ones in the picture</li>
            <li> Worth it for the needles, but buy separate studs.</li>
            <li> sharp needles and good jewelry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but the clamp was too sharp at the edges.</li>
            <li> In right after.</li>
            <li> it went right through with out any problem.</li>
            <li> i did my own belly piercing the first time but not with the same kit will not be buying any products from this person again</li>
            <li> this is the first time I pierced my nose and the first time I did it at home!</li>
            <li> Loved it other than that!</li>
            <li> It came on time and with everything described and expected I love my belly piercing, I&#x27;m cheap</li>
            <li> Came very fast.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> This kit really saved me money!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> but i just put the ring in real wuick and its perf!</li>
            <li> And the top ball on the belly button ring doesn&#x27;t attach back to the ring nor does the ring got into the needle to insert it into to your belly button</li>
            <li> overall I was pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I do suggest buying some sponged forceps as well though, just personal preference :)</li>
            <li> The barbell is perfect too because with the initial swelling you want jewelry that is big enough to accommodate it.  </li>
            <li> Perfactly packaged and everthing needles are nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the belly button rings shown, just a plain silver one which is fine because it&#x27;s still cute.</li>
            <li> the needles are very sharp and i pierced my septum pretty quickly :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted and as pictured.</li>
            <li> The clamps of course aren&#x27;t the best you could get, but they work if you need them for other piercings, just a heavy duty plastic clamp.</li>
            <li> Other than that, for the price it&#x27;s great, especially with all the jewelry it included !</li>
            <li> Needles were sharp, jewelry is great quality and if I ever want to do another piercing I&#x27;m definitely buying again!!</li>
            <li> Good set comes with just about all you need but not any thing for your targus :/</li>
            <li> Needles were plenty sharp and went right through my skin, couldn&#x27;t even feel it:)</li>
            <li> Went in easy but the gages were the same size</li>
            <li> It was a quick and nearly painless process.</li>
            <li> The ring also looked like a large zit on my nose, but I put some nail polish on it.</li>
            <li> The accessory pieces are useless to me as I would never put mystery metals in my body but needles were very good quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that wants an at home kit.</li>
            <li> this was all it said it would be and came really fast</li>
            <li> it came faster then I expected :)</li>
            <li> Just as described,sterile, very neat, fasst shipping will buy from again</li>
            <li> The nose stud is too big to fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li> Did the job, but the nose ring wouldn&#x27;t fit in the end of the 18g needle, so I ended up having to use the larger needle to pierce my nose.  </li>
            <li> I was actually delivered a much more professional kit than pictured...with a sterile metal clamp ...</li>
            <li> everything came as expected , needles were sharp and good, shipment came fast..</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly except for the cbr.</li>
            <li> I pierced my tongue and it was painless just a pinch needle was nicely sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because I wanted to pierce my belly button for Spring break (without having to pay so much to get it done professionally) and just before my boyfriend and I&#x27;s anniversary.  </li>
            <li> This is a fun kit but the jewelry in it is low quality.</li>
            <li> The only thing worth anything is the clamp, and even that is subpar.</li>
            <li> The thing that holds your place where you Pierce is quite painful to place, but everything else was great everything in their own bags the jewelry was out and about though, bit other than that.</li>
            <li> Clamps are cheap plastic, too flimsy to hold skin in place and too sharp to hold a tongue.</li>
            <li> I went to a shop for them to put a new stud in</li>
            <li> and they wanted to charge me for a new piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I am going to bleach the needles &amp; belly rings &amp; ordered a numb cream because I can&#x27;t take that needle lol</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Go to a professional.</li>
            <li> Came early with everything it said it would.</li>
            <li> it came in early</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use the big needle not the little one because I had to restart but that was my fault because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention!</li>
            <li> I would rather have a straight bar nose ring instead of the whirl but other than that the packet was decent.</li>
            <li> This worked great for me, my only complaint is I had trouble getting the nose ring in with the 18g needle</li>
            <li> : includes two needles, clamp, multiple body jewelry ,fast shipping &amp; low priced</li>
            <li> the needles are EXTREMELY sharp, so piercing my nose was even easier than it was the first time I had done it.</li>
            <li> Needles came sterilized, came before estimated due date and the clamps alone are worth the total price of the kit.</li>
            <li> Mine was a week late, and the jewelry fit.</li>
            <li> The needle is not sharp enough to pierce my belly button.</li>
            <li> All in all, the piercing was fast and the needles were very sharp.</li>
            <li> It came with the wrong clamps and the nose ring didn&#x27;t fit into the needle so it was a pain to get the jewlery in.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Which shouldn&#x27;t be a problem as long as you mark where you&#x27;ll be putting the needle through your skin.</li>
            <li> the included barbell was way too long.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t encountered any infections and I only had to spend less than $10 to pierce my belly button versus the $50 in the shop, and it only took less than 10 minutes and one YouTube video!</li>
            <li> And here it is less than four months later</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I got the kit sooner then expected, but I did not come with all as shown.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected</li>
            <li> I took my Monroe out and it closed.</li>
            <li> and you only get a plain one?</li>
            <li> The needles were sharp and everything turned out well.</li>
            <li> I pierced my belly button with this kit and the needles wore really sharp which made it a lot easier to pierce.</li>
            <li> All of the other jewelry in it looks like s</li>
            <li> three stars for the other jewelry it came with, though</li>
            <li> Also came with two needles one 14g &amp; the other 18g.</li>
            <li> it was sharp</li>
            <li> Though the clamps are very very rough in side</li>
            <li> The captive bead ring is extremely difficult to get on and off.</li>
            <li> You gave me a piece of  crap the nose ring won&#x27;t fit through  my nose the needle is to small and to big dummys.</li>
            <li> The nose stud didn&#x27;t have a little diamond thing in it tho.</li>
            <li> BUT a little note the needles don&#x27;t have the thread inside them</li>
            <li> but the forceps were a little tricky</li>
            <li> Did Not Fit Into Needle.</li>
            <li> but I stabbed my self a few times</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste if money.</li>
            <li> None of the jewls for on peircing needles -.- waste</li>
            <li> They had dried puss on them out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> an 18 g 16 g and a few 14 g needles.</li>
            <li> Navel ring nose ring tongue bar and cartilage round</li>
            <li> It was just a plain one.</li>
            <li> The clamps are pretty bad, i didnt use it..</li>
            <li> The only bad part was that I got one plain belly ring instead of the titanium and the blue one.</li>
            <li> The nose ring is a little long and my skin reacted weird with the belly ring that came with it.</li>
            <li> It was too small everything</li>
            <li> However, the needle was too small for belly button ring for it to rest inside, which was a little bit difficult and the clamps were extremely rough on the inside.</li>
            <li> They are very plain and some didn&#x27;t unscrew.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I pushed the needle wouldn&#x27;t go through.</li>
            <li> The material is cheap and the needles were disgusting.</li>
            <li> , Only Bad Thing Is The Nose Ring And Bead Ring</li>
            <li> The clamps hurt tho , it&#x27;s like they&#x27;re rough on the inside , kinda poky and painful .</li>
            <li> the clamps were very sharp and painful.</li>
            <li> I pierced my nipples and my nose with them HOWEVER putting the bar and nosering in is definitely painful because you have to put them in separately instead of following the needle through which I found highly annoying.</li>
            <li> Got two needles, thought it was supposed to come with three, maybe I was wrong?</li>
            <li> Pierced my nose just to get frustrated that I couldn&#x27;t get the stud in.</li>
            <li> However, I was terribly disappointed in jewelry.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy costumer</li>
            <li> I was so shocked!!</li>

            <li> You do get evrything they show but thier needels r not 14g they are way smaller and it comes with 1 belly ring not 2 and the piercings where to big for the needels, but hay what can u expect when ur buying it online.</li>
            <li> this was all it said it would be and came really fast</li>
            <li> It came on time and with everything described and expected I love my belly piercing, I&#x27;m cheap so this was a goooddddd buy</li>
            <li> The thing that holds your place where you Pierce is quite painful to place, but everything else was great everything in their own bags the jewelry was out and about though, bit other than that.</li>
            <li> It is a good kit. sharp needles and good jewelry.  I pierced my tongue and the jewelry didnt fit through the needle so that was a pain. Other than that the kit was great. I would recommended.</li>
            <li> Dose not come with lip percing üò†</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> This kit really saved me money!</li>
            <li> This is a fun kit but the jewelry in it is low quality. Get different jewelry if you buy this.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Ordered this because I wanted to pierce my belly button for Spring break (without having to pay so much to get it done professionally) and just before my boyfriend and I&#x27;s anniversary.  It was suppose to come in on the 12th, which is the day before our anniversary, however it came on the 7th! I ordered two because I seen reviews about people complaining that the clamp was plastic and might break or whatever. The clamp worked perfectly and I got the needle ALMOST all the way through, but I had a harder time getting the needle through the bottom layer of skin with the clamp, so I ended up not using it. Which shouldn&#x27;t be a problem as long as you mark where you&#x27;ll be putting the needle through your skin. The needles were sharp and everything turned out well. I have sensitive skin so I ordered separate belly rings instead, as well as after piercing spray. So far I haven&#x27;t encountered any infections and I only had to spend less than $10 to pierce my belly button versus the $50 in the shop, and it only took less than 10 minutes and one YouTube video! Overall great deal!</li>
            <li> It took about a week to be delivered.other than that the product was great.it got the job done!!(i had pierced my belly button by myself and watch YouTube videos to walk me thru it)</li>
            <li> Very Good Kit For Such A Low Price, Only Bad Thing Is The Nose Ring And Bead Ring Did Not Fit Into Needle. Great For Belly Button Though!</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to use. The accessory pieces are useless to me as I would never put mystery metals in my body but needles were very good quality. You do need to know what you are doing to use this!!!</li>
            <li> I pierced my belly button with this kit and the needles wore really sharp which made it a lot easier to pierce. Everything came that was in the picture.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted and as pictured.</li>
            <li> Go to a professional.</li>
            <li> I pierced my lip with this, used the 14g needle then put a 16g ring in. I had to buy a separate ring because the one in this kit is so s***. All of the other jewelry in it looks like s*** too, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it in any piercing. The needles are find since they&#x27;re pre-packaged and untouched. The foresepts are alright, they worked well but are cheap plastic. You get what you buy, I suppose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but the clamp was too sharp at the edges. It irritated the skin. Rounder edges on the clamp and it would be perfect</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic, was not impressed. Dissapointed that the item was plastic</li>
            <li> amazing identical to the photo works great and is stronger and higher quality that i thought it would be</li>
            <li> Clamps are cheap plastic, too flimsy to hold skin in place and too sharp to hold a tongue. also there&#x27;s no tongue piercing in the kit, why was it in the description? the included barbell was way too long. three stars for the other jewelry it came with, though, I gave them to friends and they thought they were really cute.</li>
            <li> Came very fast. I used it to pierce a naval and was perfect for the job! It also came with sterile piercings and needles</li>
            <li> Works great! And is a great value for what you get with it!</li>
            <li> I love this kit and it was what was in the picture!! It hurts but it will heal :)</li>
            <li> This worked great for me, my only complaint is I had trouble getting the nose ring in with the 18g needle so I had to redo it with the 14g. But that&#x27;s not a problem with the product just me and not measuring before hand</li>
            <li> came with 2 needles 2 belly rings , bar earring , nose ring &amp; septum but the needle hurts and the clamp is ok wish it was circular not a square-ish type .. Needles look clean but I stabbed my self a few times so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pierce yet I am going to bleach the needles &amp; belly rings &amp; ordered a numb cream because I can&#x27;t take that needle lol good product ..</li>
            <li> It was perfect. Everything that wad supposed to be in it was in it. I pierced my lip from this kit but with my own labrets and such. The one problem I did have with it was that the clamps has big pieces of plastic that scratchs anything I try piercing. But hey Its plastic.</li>
            <li> Alright. All the products are good quality. I pierced my nipples and my nose with them HOWEVER putting the bar and nosering in is definitely painful because you have to put them in separately instead of following the needle through which I found highly annoying.</li>
            <li> Used this kit to re pierce my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: includes two needles, clamp, multiple body jewelry ,fast shipping &amp; low priced&lt;br /&gt;Cons:Does not include gloves &amp; the clamp is made out of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I would rather have a straight bar nose ring instead of the whirl but other than that the packet was decent.</li>
            <li> I mainly had bought this kit to pierce the second side of my nose with a stud, by far the stud that comes with this kit is the best stud that I&#x27;ve worked with, it&#x27;s comfortable, doesn&#x27;t slide out, and fits perfectly with the needles given. the needles are EXTREMELY sharp, so piercing my nose was even easier than it was the first time I had done it. The clamps of course aren&#x27;t the best you could get, but they work if you need them for other piercings, just a heavy duty plastic clamp. Although I received this kit over six months ago, i still use the jewelry given, it doesn&#x27;t go to s***, this is a great product and I recommend it to any at home pierces.</li>
            <li> The kit was great. Came with everything it was supposed to. This is the second time I&#x27;ve pierced my belly button at home and it was virtually painless.</li>
            <li> Came early with everything it said it would. Perfectly packaged and Everything look hygenic. Though the clamps are very very rough in side and I couldn&#x27;t pierce my belly button because the insides dug into my skin. I now have a scar inside my belly button.</li>
            <li> So this is a great kit for that price :) already did my cartilage, nd needles are nice and sharp :) nd it came faster then I expected :)</li>
            <li> Came with everything and worked great for piercing my belly button.</li>
            <li> Do you think it would be a good one yo use if you were piercing your septum?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I paid for. But the plastic clamp broke when I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this kit it came in early and when I pierced my belly it went through nice and smooth!! It was decently sharp and the jewelry is very nice as well i most definetly recommend this to anyone who wants to pierce at home</li>
            <li> jewelry looked used/dirty. Very unhappy costumer</li>
            <li> Loved it the needles came sharp and sterilized the jewelery didnt fit in the 14g for the bellybutton but i just put the ring in real wuick and its perf!</li>
            <li> the only problem was the forceps.they hurt so i had o pierce my tounge without and i made hings quite easier</li>
            <li> perfect kit! it came with eveything and even some extra needles. this is the first time I pierced my nose and the first time I did it at home! it&#x27;s painless! the needles go right through! great product!</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money. it came with everything it said it out. everything was packaged in separate packets and clean. i already did my nose i with it and others have done their eyebrow and belly button. love that the forceps are metal which is a huge plus</li>
            <li> Sooo this kit came with everything shown, i only gave this 4 stars because it took me a minute to unscrew the beads, and also I think they should have made it so that the jewelry could screw onto the needle. Basically, i attempted to do an eyebrow piercing and the needle went in nicely, but I had problems getting the jewelry in so now I just have 2 holes by my eyebrow üòë clamp takes a minute to get used to but i guess it does its job</li>
            <li> This kit make my life easier.Now i got a belly ring yay...</li>
            <li> Pierced my tongue üòÑüòÑ . Needles are great ! Worth the buy ! Plainless and get it done right !</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly for my tongue and belt button</li>
            <li> Description was different than the actual product.</li>
            <li> I liked it. The nose stud didn&#x27;t have a little diamond thing in it tho. Loved it other than that!</li>
            <li> No. It did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Loved it its cheap with great quality. Perfactly packaged and everthing needles are nice and sharp. Clamp is easy to clean and the packaged arrived on time. Im glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li> Great kit!!! I just got the kit three days ago and I waited till today to use it. I pierced my tongue and it was painless just a pinch needle was nicely sharp and easy to use. Kit came with one tongue ring, belly ring, nose ring &amp; eyebrow ring. Also came with two needles one 14g &amp; the other 18g. The scissor forceps also came with the kit. I greatly recommend to anyone deciding to buy don&#x27;t hesitate u will not regret it. It&#x27;s cheap too!!</li>
            <li> For being so cheap, I have no complaints. All items including the forceps were properly sealed in medical packaging and without defect. After using the kit on myself, I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Got two needles, thought it was supposed to come with three, maybe I was wrong? But needles and prongs were sealed. But all the bars were not. Have not used yet only because I&#x27;m affraid to because of work. But still I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Had everything I needed. Only wish it came in alcohol wipes, would have helped. Other than that, for the price it&#x27;s great, especially with all the jewelry it included ! Love love love!</li>
            <li> Everything you see here you get! My fianc√© and I absoutely love this kit!! He pierced the bottom of my belly button and his lip! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Worked as described.  I was done within 15 minutes piercing it by myself.</li>
            <li> Really liked it, wish the belly button rings were the Actual ones in the picture</li>
            <li> Got everything I asked for ! Great buy!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I didn&#x27;t get part is of the product that was said to be included</li>
            <li> Everything was overall good. I even got extra 14g needles. The only bad part was that I got one plain belly ring instead of the titanium and the blue one.</li>
            <li> Neither of the belly button rings fit into the needle. It was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the lip ring</li>
            <li> It was great and came with everything I needed.</li>
            <li> The clamp was metal when  I orderd this back in  October, the rings come in good quality. The needles are either 18, or 14 gage. I used the 14 for my belly, and 18 for my nose. It worked good! it was sharp it went right through with out any problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and you get everything that you see BUT a little note the needles don&#x27;t have the thread inside them so the belly ring will not screw in the needls for easy transition during the process.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my kit to start piercing at home. However, I was terribly disappointed in jewelry. They are very plain and some didn&#x27;t unscrew. You get what u pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> Came on time! But! The belly ring wasn&#x27;t what it said it was a ms the forceps cut me! Other than that it&#x27;s great and sterile</li>
            <li> Just as described,sterile, very neat, fasst shipping will buy from again</li>
            <li> I did it! Looks amazing</li>
            <li> The clamps are pretty bad, i didnt use it..the needles are very sharp and i pierced my septum pretty quickly :)</li>
            <li> DIDNT RELIZE IT WAS PLASTIC</li>
            <li> It came with everything it was supposed to and it was so easy to pierce my body and it was great good, quality</li>
            <li> came with everything and it&#x27;s really simple to use!</li>
            <li> the needles are good but the jewelry it came with sucked. The nose stud is too big to fit. Worth it for the needles, but buy separate studs.</li>
            <li> I liked it, clean utensils but the forceps were a little tricky</li>
            <li> The needle is not sharp enough to pierce my belly button. No matter how hard I pushed the needle wouldn&#x27;t go through. And the top ball on the belly button ring doesn&#x27;t attach back to the ring nor does the ring got into the needle to insert it into to your belly button</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS! it&#x27;s a waste if money. Mine was a week late, and the jewelry fit. It was too small everything n the lip rung was kissing and so were the clamps</li>
            <li> Does not come as shown. Clamp is metal which is actually better. Does not come with the multicolored or the gem stone navel ring. It was just a plain one. Needles were plenty sharp and went right through my skin, couldn&#x27;t even feel it:) overall I was pleased with the purchase but I would have liked to have the shown jewelry instead of what I got</li>
            <li> Good set comes with just about all you need but not any thing for your targus :/</li>
            <li> I got the kit sooner then expected, but I did not come with all as shown. It only came with a belly botton ring (silver) and a nose ring (silver) also 4 needles.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for me. I loved this kit. Everything was great quality.</li>
            <li> Kit was just as described, everything packaged and sterilized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect I&#x27;m about to peirce my nose and later my belly button it came with extra needles and everything looks clean ( I&#x27;m still gonna clean it )&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anybody</li>
            <li> Needles were sharp, jewelry is great quality and if I ever want to do another piercing I&#x27;m definitely buying again!!</li>
            <li> Everything came as described in the description. The beally ring was kinda too big for the needle but i made it work. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It was a great kit everything was in tact needles were right on point and my piercing came out great.</li>
            <li> Super easy, everything was packaged &amp; sealed correctly. Pierced my nose &amp; I love it (: doing my belly button next! Good deal for the price</li>
            <li> Great üòÜ everything came as expected , needles were sharp and good, shipment came fast..I love it üíãüëèüëèüéÄ</li>
            <li> Needles are sharp and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Jewlery is stainless steel,  threading is perfect&lt;br /&gt;clamps are plastic and don&#x27;t have a smooth finish which resulted in scratching.&lt;br /&gt;Was able to Pierce:&lt;br /&gt;-both nipples&lt;br /&gt;-belly button&lt;br /&gt;-double nostril&lt;br /&gt;-basic ear piercing&lt;br /&gt;-septum</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected but I thought it would come with more needles. And you have to make sure you&#x27;re clamp is leveled before piercing you&#x27;re bellybutton.</li>
            <li> I love this!! I am very happy with what I received! Especially for the price!! I used it right away on my nose and pierced my friends nipples!! I had to order more needles!! Great product!</li>
            <li> I love it. I have pierced my self at couple of spot in body</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit in October 2014. I pierced my nose with it. It was a quick and nearly painless process. And here it is less than four months later and my nose is fully healed and looks great!</li>
            <li> Good quality products, I am very happy with my purchase! I do suggest buying some sponged forceps as well though, just personal preference :)</li>
            <li> None of the jewls for on peircing needles -.- waste</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve given it four stars if it would have came with a labret stud and five stars if it would&#x27;ve came with the stud and gloves but for the price it&#x27;s awesome. Needles came sterilized, came before estimated due date and the clamps alone are worth the total price of the kit.</li>
            <li> I really liked the kit, it came with everything as shown within a decent amount of time. However, the needle was too small for belly button ring for it to rest inside, which was a little bit difficult and the clamps were extremely rough on the inside. All in all, the piercing was fast and the needles were very sharp. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> You get everything you pay for, very good quality, metal clamps are still in good shape and the needles were nice and sharp. You get MORE than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I pierced my nose my moms nose my cousins knows and my belly button with this kit. It&#x27;d amazing.</li>
            <li> Used the 18G needle to pierce my nose but used a different stud in it... ended up ripping that out in my sleep so had to re-do with a 16G needle.  Worked great for it though, the ripping out was totally my fault.  I used the 14G to do my nipple and used the silver barbell included as the jewelry.  It worked perfectly, but would have been easier to manage if I had another set of hands while doing it.  The barbell is perfect too because with the initial swelling you want jewelry that is big enough to accommodate it.  I will leave it in as it heals but even with the swelling gone I like the way it fits.  Please note that if you are going to pierce yourself at home, you should do your research and take every precaution necessary.  The kit does not come with gloves - do buy some if you are going to pierce yourself!  Excellent kit.</li>
            <li> needle goes through perfect but the ring doesn&#x27;t follow.... i did my own belly piercing the first time but not with the same kit will not be buying any products from this person again</li>
            <li> Most likely will buy again, Easy application and great service!</li>
            <li> It was awesome I did my belly button</li>
            <li> This was awesome! I pierced my lip my belly button and my sister did her tongue. This was great and for a great price</li>
            <li> I read a review that said the nose ring was too big! I should have taken heed of warning! Pierced my nose just to get frustrated that I couldn&#x27;t get the stud in. Everything else is pretty great! My belly button came out just fine. Very satisfied. Will be finishing my nose soon too. It&#x27;s an 18g needle and 18g ring. Getting a 22g ring  so I won&#x27;t have any problems fitting into the end of the needle! Wish me luck and PAIN! LOL.</li>
            <li> great comes with extra needles!</li>
            <li> I will rate this four stars only because I had to reoreder it. The nose ring is a little long and my skin reacted weird with the belly ring that came with it. Mine came with extra needles though</li>
            <li> You gave me a piece of  crap the nose ring won&#x27;t fit through  my nose the needle is to small and to big dummys.</li>
            <li> The captive bead ring is extremely difficult to get on and off. The gauges fit perfectly with the jewelry and everything was very sterile. I love the retainer it came with. Would recommend highly except for the cbr.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the belly button rings shown, just a plain silver one which is fine because it&#x27;s still cute. I got four needles instead of two which is awesome!! And the needle went through so painlessly I was so shocked!! It&#x27;s overall a fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li> It was never delivered to me im sure it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> Amazing set for the price, it did its job without a problem. I will be purchasing more very soon</li>
            <li> The only thing worth anything is the clamp, and even that is subpar. The material is cheap and the needles were disgusting. They had dried puss on them out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I just got this 5 days after I ordered! It came with two needles,septum piercing, tongue ring, and two bellybutton rings. The the only thing it didn&#x27;t come with is cleaning supply but I had what i needed to clean. It worked perfectly and it&#x27;s amazing and I would recommend this to anyone! Just make sure you use the big needle not the little one because I had to restart but that was my fault because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention!</li>
            <li> Great! worked perfect!!</li>
            <li> Did the job, but the nose ring wouldn&#x27;t fit in the end of the 18g needle, so I ended up having to use the larger needle to pierce my nose.  The ring also looked like a large zit on my nose, but I put some nail polish on it.</li>
            <li> Why does It show a multi- color belly piercing and you only get a plain one? I like it though.</li>
            <li> I was actually delivered a much more professional kit than pictured...with a sterile metal clamp ...an 18 g 16 g and a few 14 g needles. Navel ring nose ring tongue bar and cartilage round 14 g septum looking ring as pictured. I don&#x27;t think mine came with an eyebrow ring but I didn&#x27;t need or want that so I was very happy with both the delivery service and quality.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE STARTER SETS AND THIS 1 IS GREAT AND IT WAS SENT OUT FAST AND GOT IT QUICKLY!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase I pierced my own nose</li>
            <li> This kit is great! It arrived quickly and everything was there. I pierced my belly button by myself and it&#x27;s been a month now without infection. Jewelry is good quality, and the needles are sterile. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I took my Monroe out and it closed. I went to a shop for them to put a new stud in and they wanted to charge me for a new piercing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this had everything I needed!</li>
            <li> A great kit for when you don&#x27;t have any piercings or you are going to pierce your friends. I personally will be purchasing just the needles from now on since I have all the jewelry provided in the kit.</li>
