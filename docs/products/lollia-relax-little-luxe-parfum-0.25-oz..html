            <li>My mom was given the lotion in this fragrance and I just fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Probably could find something much better at the dollar store.</li>

            <li>great scent, small but great for your purse or to put in an atomizer</li>
            <li>Just has a strong Vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I cannot use strong scented products because I get an immediate</li>
            <li>I Just love the sweet smell...</li>
            <li>Better off buying it at the store at full price.</li>
            <li>Such a lovely scent; warm, floral, lavendar and vanilla.  </li>
            <li>It may be a great scent for someone else but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Mild scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not at all worth what I paid for it.</li>

            <li>is fresh, clean and last.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I wears off so fast really</li>
            <li>Very alcoholy.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s about an inch or so high.  </li>
            <li>I love this little bottle of Relax..</li>
            <li>I would go so far to say that she is the modern day Chanel.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for something natural that is not overpowering, I suggest you purchase any of the .25 oz.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be a gift for my 24 year old friend.</li>
            <li>It is such a soft perfume.</li>

            <li> It is such a soft perfume.</li>
            <li> Actually smells like a perfume my mom used to wear a long time ago, Vanilla Fields.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last real long</li>
            <li> Definitely not a young smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, but it&#x27;ll last awhile</li>
            <li> I found that they offered a perfume and bought this small size to give it a test drive before I purchased a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> not worth putting on.  </li>
            <li> It is not a light airy scent</li>
            <li> I will give it to someone else that prefers musky heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> Purchased two small bottles of this for my sister and I to sample for a couple of days after taking a whiff of it at the Store.</li>
            <li> Wow...did not expect it to be so small (laughably small), but I admit that&#x27;s my mistake.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t smell it at all, not sure if it is this formula or not.</li>
            <li> At least you know what you&#x27;re going to get.</li>
            <li> the size is ridiculous wear once and its gone.</li>
            <li> smells faintly of the perfume but disappears like vapor when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I probably just received a bad batch of it but highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry!!</li>

            <li> Another beautiful scent by this eloquent designer.  She realy knows how to design for women.  I would go so far to say that she is the modern day Chanel.  Each new scent she designs is more beautiful and luxurious.  Every woman should have some Margot Elena in their perfume drawer.</li>
            <li> this (and I have the bigger size) is my all-time favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s probably my signature scent.&lt;br /&gt;i get compliment ALL the time when i wear this parfume.&lt;br /&gt;my boyfriend loves it too!</li>
            <li> the size is ridiculous wear once and its gone.</li>
            <li> great scent, small but great for your purse or to put in an atomizer</li>
            <li> Smells great! It&#x27;s small, but it&#x27;ll last awhile</li>
            <li> This smells way too powdery for a lavender scent.  I really don&#x27;t like it.  Maybe for someone else, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Smell nothing like the description. It is not a light airy scent and I do not smell notes of honey or lavender. It smells like vanilla and musk. It may be a great scent for someone else but not what I expected. I will give it to someone else that prefers musky heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> I love this little bottle of Relax..It doesn&#x27;t last real long but I don&#x27;t want it to last all day.. I Just love the sweet smell...Its good for a couple of hours...Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but do not like big expensive bottles.  The Petite bottle is perfectly sized and priced!  Mild scent.</li>
            <li> Purchased two small bottles of this for my sister and I to sample for a couple of days after taking a whiff of it at the Store. Smells nothing like the bottle we sampled at Anthropologie. There is no hint of Lavender nor honey. Just has a strong Vanilla scent. Actually smells like a perfume my mom used to wear a long time ago, Vanilla Fields. I probably just received a bad batch of it but highly disappointed. Better off buying it at the store at full price. At least you know what you&#x27;re going to get.</li>
            <li> This bottle is bigger than the wish bottle for some reason. It has more of a floral scent. Very cute and pretty!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel beautiful.  It is such a soft perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I have found on Lollia parfums!  If you are looking for something natural that is not overpowering, I suggest you purchase any of the .25 oz. to test them.  You will not be sorry!!</li>
            <li> I just love the fragrance. also I love the cute little bottle. I am already using the big size, but this one was the gift for my friend because she loves the smell! the shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with the hand creme years ago and this smells just like it plus some.  Such a lovely scent; warm, floral, lavendar and vanilla.  Mmm.  I don&#x27;t know anyone who would not like this!</li>
            <li> I would give this five starts if this had any lasting power.  My mom was given the lotion in this fragrance and I just fell in love with it.  I found that they offered a perfume and bought this small size to give it a test drive before I purchased a bigger bottle. Well like I said it smells great but in about five minutes no one can smell this on me.  I wears off so fast really not worth putting on.  If it had more lasting power I would rate it 5 stars but since it doesn&#x27;t last and that&#x27;s the point of  a perfume I would say you should probably pass.</li>
            <li> The perfect feminine scent.</li>
            <li> Wow...did not expect it to be so small (laughably small), but I admit that&#x27;s my mistake. It&#x27;s about an inch or so high.  Does not come with a box (also my mistake). However the smell isn&#x27;t anything great. Very alcoholy. This was supposed to be a gift for my 24 year old friend. Definitely not a young smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not at all worth what I paid for it. Probably could find something much better at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> smells faintly of the perfume but disappears like vapor when you put it on.  You can&#x27;t smell it at all, not sure if it is this formula or not.</li>
            <li> Love the scent conveyed. I cannot use strong scented products because I get an immediate headache.&lt;br /&gt;This is fresh, clean and last. Have received TONS of compliments.</li>
