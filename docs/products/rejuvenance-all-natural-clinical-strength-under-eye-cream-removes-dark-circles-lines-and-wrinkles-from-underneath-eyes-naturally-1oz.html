            <li>This rejuvenance cream works great.</li>
            <li>it smells good though.</li>
            <li>on some good reviews decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The cream smells nutty and sweet and feels wonderful when you apply it to your eyes and face.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a great reduction in the fine lines under and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>amazing product.  </li>
            <li>This cream has been working effectively for me.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and great price!</li>
            <li>I come across this product from googling an all natural and organic eye cream and was impressed by the reviews</li>
            <li>My make up goes on so nice and the circles are not nearly as bad as they were a week ago!!!  </li>
            <li>The creams easy to use and has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>I think it probably acts as a better moisturiser than it does an under eye cream.</li>
            <li>He is a healthy guy, but</li>
            <li>Because even HE is seeing improvement,&lt;br /&gt;he is more committed to using it faithfully.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Rejuvenance Eye Cream for a month now and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product at a terrific price.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>But it is excellent for the entire body</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to see it was an all natural product and had great reviews.  </li>
            <li>I apply this product as directed and feel it has done a great job so far.</li>
            <li>very sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt give a feeling of a good quality</li>
            <li>This product is great not just for the eyes but for the entire body.</li>
            <li>I was offered 2 free jars for writing a review</li>
            <li>i was so excited to receive this product.</li>
            <li>I am expecting greater results as I begin to use consistently.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for my whole face at night and love how smooth my skin wakes up.</li>
            <li>It comes right to my door to which is definitely great and the effects last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to re-order this when it runs out, but it seems like it&#x27;s going to last a good while.</li>
            <li>I love that this is made with all real wholesome ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of nutrients and does not irritate the eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel fresh in the morning and makes my eyes look brighter.</li>
            <li>In my experience, when it comes to dark circle creams, this is by far as good as it gets!</li>
            <li>I have applied it twice and see its very very sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has also diminished the fine lines which show the early signs of aging</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of eye creams, many of which I do not order a second time.  </li>
            <li>The combination seems to be working pretty well</li>
            <li>First the product missed its delivery dates.</li>
            <li>When I tried returning unopened package that I didn&#x27;t want to receive in the first place I saw a requirement on the returned slip to put  RMA number.</li>
            <li>But now I even use it all over my face and it makes my face so soft and smooth and  </li>
            <li>It will be a perfect substitution to buying those expensive creams.</li>
            <li>During the winter months my face dries out quickly and with the help of the cream my face has been staying soft</li>
            <li>Prior to using this I used Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Extra Eye Repair Creme which is an excellent product but costs $70 for a half ounce.</li>
            <li>I got it mainly for my under eye bags and within the first 2 weeks it had cleared them up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I ordered it but still didn&#x27;t have much faith it would work.  </li>
            <li>It always absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>In fact, it probably makes it stay on much longer</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use as much because of the texture.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - MOVE ON!!!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it removes dark circles by any means but it helped which is more than i can say for a lot</li>
            <li>The main thing I want from an eye cream is hydration without irritation and this delivers.</li>
            <li>I really like Rejuvenance - 100% Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream!</li>
            <li>Now I have been using it every night to prevent getting those bags back and to help keep my skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>It is messy so definitely put it at night before you sleep but other than it&#x27;s very good . .</li>
            <li>My stretch marks aren&#x27;t as thick and obvious and my hands and feet are moisturized for a good length of time.</li>
            <li>but it was more of a wax...other than that I could notice the difference within a few weeks!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I use something different in the morning that I also really like (Revision Teamine).  </li>
            <li>no matter how far away from my eyes i put the product it still irratated them.</li>
            <li>And then when I opened the box I was surprised to see the size and quality of this product.</li>
            <li>ever you do do not order directly from their website because they will charge you every month even if you tell them not too.</li>
            <li>It did not cause redness or puffiness for me which shows no harsh chemicals are used and the product is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I never use night cream because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and probably healing in themselves</li>
            <li>I could notice slight improvement in the way my complexion looks, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>However it will work with wrinkles, my skin wakes up with less wrinkles and smooth, especially under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not only is it reducing my under eye circles but it leaves my skin so soft without bothering my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I had several fine lines by my eyes and this creams helped most of them to fade away, there are still like 2 ones that I can still see, they aren’t anything as bad as they used to be though.</li>
            <li>The consistency was a little harder than I thought it would be; not creamy at all; but that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>Within a few days I could see results; more so than those other much more expensive and unnatural creams had done in several weeks.</li>
            <li>After much money spent and many failed attempts I put a lot of research into how to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone with the same dark shades under</li>
            <li>bad, seemed like going organic on the eye area was a good idea.</li>

            <li> bad, seemed like going organic on the eye area was a good idea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old guy that&#x27;s been struggling with dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember - guess I just have the genes for it.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t cause a major difference in my undereye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have use products in the past where I would stop using them for a  little while and within a week I looked exactly the same as I did before I started.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye cream since long.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the all natural ingredients  I didn’t want to use a product that contained harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually was any better than other less expensive products.</li>
            <li> As others have stated in their reviews, yes it is a little greasy and wherever it is applied will be a little shiny, but really in all honesty, those other eye creams did the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have seen my facial wrinkles almost completely disappear, can hardly tell they are there anymore.</li>
            <li> and I haven’t been peeling off any dry skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see if it removes dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in my hunt for a dark circle reducer and overall face cream.  </li>
            <li> I started to apply the product regularly on the dark circles 3 or 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> Will update further on down the road.  </li>
            <li> It is a little greasy but thats why I put it on at night and let it absorb until the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I have had serious under eye dark circles and bags for years now, and I&#x27;m only 30 yrs old.</li>
            <li> This was not close to what I expected.</li>
            <li> pack is so small and fragile.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about 3 weeks now, but not consistently</li>
            <li> This cream did nothing to reduce the appearance of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The darkness isn&#x27;t as dark.  </li>
            <li> After knowing what to look for in a product I went to Amazon and put in eye cream for dark circles.  </li>
            <li> , i have dark circles.</li>
            <li> My husband has had dark under-eye circles for years.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference with just one week of use with the dark rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It removed the dark circles some</li>
            <li> I noticed the product did reduce dark circles.</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes are even lightening.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t help with dark circles or puffiness,</li>
            <li> been using it for about 3 weeks and see no difference in my dark circles or puffiness under eyes</li>
            <li> I think I have noticed a difference in the Dark Circles.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other products out there and none worked as promised.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for two weeks and have already noticed the difference in my appearance - less darkness and lines under and around my eyes -</li>
            <li> Should have been half the money.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> It does look a little glossy/greasy (like beeswax), but I like the way it feels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the products for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I applied AM/PM everyday and no improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Note that the other reviewers of this product never posted any other review - that is suspect to me - watch for fake postings...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine how something this heavy can heal the delicate area around the eyes.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> I understand it&#x27;s a natural cream made out of wax, but the consistency makes it almost impossible for me to use.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles for the past 2 yrs and have been going crazy trying to cover them with no success.  </li>
            <li> The thin skin under my eyes seems to have thickened a little bit.  </li>
            <li> at least I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  </li>
            <li> but of course still skeptical from my previous let-downs.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m finding it hard to stop looking in the mirror at the improvements it has done to the skin around my eyes!</li>
            <li> under his eyes made him look ill.</li>
            <li> It is too expensive for me to order this product again.  </li>
            <li> Sorry but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> but they arent bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite the consistency that I thought it was going to be, I was expecting an oil but it was more of a wax...other than that I could notice the difference within a few weeks! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have had serious under eye dark circles and bags for years now, and I&#x27;m only 30 yrs old. I have tried a few other products out there and none worked as promised. I come across this product from googling an all natural and organic eye cream and was impressed by the reviews but of course still skeptical from my previous let-downs. Nonetheless I still decided to give it a try. Within a few days I could see results; more so than those other much more expensive and unnatural creams had done in several weeks. I have been using this product now for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m finding it hard to stop looking in the mirror at the improvements it has done to the skin around my eyes! Years seem to have been taken out of my face already! As others have stated in their reviews, yes it is a little greasy and wherever it is applied will be a little shiny, but really in all honesty, those other eye creams did the same thing. In my experience, when it comes to dark circle creams, this is by far as good as it gets!</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - MOVE ON!!!  I have used this product in my hunt for a dark circle reducer and overall face cream.  This cream did nothing to reduce the appearance of my dark circles.  Note that the other reviewers of this product never posted any other review - that is suspect to me - watch for fake postings... just sayin&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32 year old guy that&#x27;s been struggling with dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember - guess I just have the genes for it.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of eye creams, many of which I do not order a second time.  I put some Rejuvenance on before I go to bed.  It does look a little glossy/greasy (like beeswax), but I like the way it feels.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and have noticed my eyes are looking better lately.  The thin skin under my eyes seems to have thickened a little bit.  The darkness isn&#x27;t as dark.  I use something different in the morning that I also really like (Revision Teamine).  The combination seems to be working pretty well and I&#x27;m going to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to re-order this when it runs out, but it seems like it&#x27;s going to last a good while.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!  I love that this is made with all real wholesome ingredients.  I have been using the product for two weeks and have already noticed the difference in my appearance - less darkness and lines under and around my eyes - I no longer have that &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; look.  The cream smells nutty and sweet and feels wonderful when you apply it to your eyes and face.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles for the past 2 yrs and have been going crazy trying to cover them with no success.  After much money spent and many failed attempts I put a lot of research into how to get rid of them.  During my research I found ingredients to look for that will help.  After knowing what to look for in a product I went to Amazon and put in eye cream for dark circles.  This is where I came across Rejuvenance.  I was very excited to see it was an all natural product and had great reviews.  I ordered it but still didn&#x27;t have much faith it would work.  A week later and I am sooo very happy I put the time in and found this!!  Not only is it reducing my under eye circles but it leaves my skin so soft without bothering my very sensitive skin.  It is a little greasy but thats why I put it on at night and let it absorb until the next morning.  My make up goes on so nice and the circles are not nearly as bad as they were a week ago!!!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what they will look for a month from now!!</li>
            <li> i was so excited to receive this product., i have dark circles. but they arent bad. so i thought this would do the trick. i used it foe weeks and nothing. all i got was red eyes. no matter how far away from my eyes i put the product it still irratated them. it smells good though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the products for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in my dark circles. I think it probably acts as a better moisturiser than it does an under eye cream.</li>
            <li> My husband has had dark under-eye circles for years. No amount of supplements,&lt;br /&gt;creams - NOTHING worked to take them away. He is a healthy guy, but these dark&lt;br /&gt;circles under his eyes made him look ill. I came across this on Amazon, and&lt;br /&gt;based on some good reviews decided to give it a try. After using it nightly for&lt;br /&gt;a week, we can all see a definite improvement. We are all looking forward to&lt;br /&gt;seeing what happens after a month of use. Because even HE is seeing improvement,&lt;br /&gt;he is more committed to using it faithfully. Great product!</li>
            <li> It is messy so definitely put it at night before you sleep but other than it&#x27;s very good . .</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye cream since long. After reading the reviews of this product I thought of giving it a try. First the product missed its delivery dates. And then when I opened the box I was surprised to see the size and quality of this product. This was not close to what I expected. I have applied it twice and see its very very sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money. Should have been half the money.&lt;br /&gt;Makes skin very sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt give a feeling of a good quality cream.&lt;br /&gt;The pack is so small and fragile.</li>
            <li> This cream has been working effectively for me. It took a bit of time for me to start to notice results, but not I am happy with how I’m looking. I had several fine lines by my eyes and this creams helped most of them to fade away, there are still like 2 ones that I can still see, they aren’t anything as bad as they used to be though. The creams easy to use and has a nice smell to it. I also like that it isn’t greasy and doesn’t leave my face feeling gross or shiney after I use it. It always absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference with just one week of use with the dark rings under my eyes. No irratation with this product like I have had with others . I highly recommend this product to everyone with the same dark shades under they&#x27;re eyes..fast shipping and great price!</li>
            <li> It removed the dark circles some but it didn&#x27;t cause a major difference in my undereye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Rejuvenance Eye Cream for a month now and LOVE it. The main thing I want from an eye cream is hydration without irritation and this delivers. Thirty days is not really enough time to determine whether under eye discoloration is diminished but I do think I see an improvement in crows feet wrinkles. Prior to using this I used Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Extra Eye Repair Creme which is an excellent product but costs $70 for a half ounce. This is an excellent product at a terrific price.</li>
            <li> I understand it&#x27;s a natural cream made out of wax, but the consistency makes it almost impossible for me to use. It is greasy on the face, and clumpy as I&#x27;m putting it on. It doesn&#x27;t remind me of a cream at all. It should be called eye wax. I&#x27;ll try using the remainder of the jar on my hands.</li>
            <li> I used this up.  It is too expensive for me to order this product again.  I don&#x27;t know if it actually was any better than other less expensive products.</li>
            <li> I tried the product. I could notice slight improvement in the way my complexion looks, but nothing special. If you wanna use it&lt;br /&gt;what ever you do do not order directly from their website because they will charge you every month even if you tell them not too. I had to change my bank card and file a claim with a bank in order to stop their scam. I was told I could simply return the product if I din&#x27;t want to use it and I would be reimbursed. When I tried returning unopened package that I didn&#x27;t want to receive in the first place I saw a requirement on the returned slip to put  RMA number. I called and I asked what the number was and they told me that was the number of approval for reimbursement and they were going to send me an email with the number immediately.  I NEVER RECEIVED ANY EAMILS  FROM THEM even though I called several times asking for it. I received emails from them promptly when they needed something from me but nothing when I asked for reimbursement. IF THEY ARE SCAMMING PEOPLE  ABOUT THE WAY THEY HANDLE THEIR BUSINESS THEY PROBABLY LIE ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT AND WHAT IT DOES TO YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> I started to apply the product regularly on the dark circles 3 or 4 times a day. I noticed the product did reduce dark circles. It did not cause redness or puffiness for me which shows no harsh chemicals are used and the product is made from natural ingredients. It has also diminished the fine lines which show the early signs of aging so now I don&#x27;t have to use any concealers or creams to hide my spots.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it removes dark circles by any means but it helped which is more than i can say for a lot but my circles are from allergies so maybe that is why?</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Have been using this for about 3 weeks now, but not consistently and I have seen a great reduction in the fine lines under and around my eyes.  The dark circles under my eyes are even lightening.  Imagine if I use it every night.  I am expecting greater results as I begin to use consistently.</li>
            <li> I been  using it for a week  under my eyes and is almost removing under eye darkness I got.But now I even use it all over my face and it makes my face so soft and smooth and  in just a short use.I am very happy about this product  and will defiantly order it again.</li>
            <li> I never use night cream because of my sensitive skin. I have been using this for my whole face at night and love how smooth my skin wakes up. It won&#x27;t help with dark circles or puffiness, at least I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  I&#x27;ve owned it for about a week. However it will work with wrinkles, my skin wakes up with less wrinkles and smooth, especially under my eyes. It will be a perfect substitution to buying those expensive creams.</li>
            <li> This product is great not just for the eyes but for the entire body. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see if it removes dark circles under my eyes. But it is excellent for the entire body and I can see and feel immediate results. My stretch marks aren&#x27;t as thick and obvious and my hands and feet are moisturized for a good length of time. And without toxins and chemicals!</li>
            <li> does not work...been using it for about 3 weeks and see no difference in my dark circles or puffiness under eyes</li>
            <li> I really like Rejuvenance - 100% Natural, Organic Under Eye Cream! Makes me feel fresh in the morning and makes my eyes look brighter. Definitely worth it, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the all natural ingredients  I didn’t want to use a product that contained harsh chemicals. I apply this product as directed and feel it has done a great job so far. My dark circles are significantly decreased. I have seen my facial wrinkles almost completely disappear, can hardly tell they are there anymore. I think product is wonderful. It comes right to my door to which is definitely great and the effects last. I have use products in the past where I would stop using them for a  little while and within a week I looked exactly the same as I did before I started. I feel this product has owned up to my expectations and would recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money. I applied AM/PM everyday and no improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, seemed like going organic on the eye area was a good idea.</li>
            <li> amazing product.  can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> Sorry but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this cream. It&#x27;s full of nutrients and does not irritate the eyes. Will buy it again</li>
            <li> This shouldn&#x27;t be called a cream; it has the heavy, solid consistency of a lip balm and is very greasy. It&#x27;s hard to imagine how something this heavy can heal the delicate area around the eyes. The ingredients are natural and probably healing in themselves but it&#x27;s definitely not a cream. I was offered 2 free jars for writing a review but I&#x27;d rather get my money back as I can&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s organic.  That is a MUST with me.  The consistency was a little harder than I thought it would be; not creamy at all; but that&#x27;s fine.  In fact, it probably makes it stay on much longer and you don&#x27;t have to use as much because of the texture.  I think I have noticed a difference in the Dark Circles.  Will update further on down the road.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This rejuvenance cream works great. I got it mainly for my under eye bags and within the first 2 weeks it had cleared them up. Now I have been using it every night to prevent getting those bags back and to help keep my skin feeling fresh. During the winter months my face dries out quickly and with the help of the cream my face has been staying soft and I haven’t been peeling off any dry skin.</li>
