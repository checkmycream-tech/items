            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin, and it contains no smelly special ingredients.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, through Amazon.com I found a retailer who can still supply it.</li>

            <li>Makes my  dry skin feel so-o-o good.  </li>
            <li>Will come back for more!</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it in stock available for me to purchase when I need it....</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin with just the right look, i.e., not too oily.</li>
            <li>I have used this moisturizer for several years and I love it, it makes my skin soft and smooth., but I understand this product is no longer available.</li>
            <li>and it came very fast.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and the product was new &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>Keeps your face soft and free of wrinkles</li>
            <li>I have tried so many facial creams/lotions.  </li>
            <li>First discovered Mary Kay products in Oct. 1978.  </li>
            <li>Positively</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it worked out just fine.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the purveyor for working the &#x27;kinks&#x27; out of some challenges with billing.  </li>
            <li>Again, thanks for hanging in there with me.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>packing was done very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and she agreed with me and also really loves it.</li>
            <li>I know that there are other products with more of this and that, but the bottom line is, if it works why change.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only facial moisturizer she has been able to use in years that doesn&#x27;t break her face out.</li>
            <li>now that I am older</li>
            <li>old now and still use the full facial regime plus all the cosmetic beauty items.  </li>
            <li>Such fun and making money, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is my favorite product and is now hard to come by.  </li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND IT TO ANY YOUNG WOMAN WHO IS LOOKING FOR A MOISTURIZER THAT REALLY PAYS BACK OVER THE YEARS.</li>
            <li>and she said the product was over 4 years old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>NO ONE BELIEVES I AM AS OLD</li>
            <li>It is not heavily perfumed.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;This does not have SPF, but I live in a temperate rain forest, so that&#x27;s not a big concern.</li>
            <li>found other products useful in the winter, especially the Aveeno</li>
            <li>This one is light enough to soak in yet it&#x27;s not so thick that you feel like you have something on your face.</li>

I gave my local Mary Kay representative the serial number on the bottom of the jar and she said the product was over 4 years old.
