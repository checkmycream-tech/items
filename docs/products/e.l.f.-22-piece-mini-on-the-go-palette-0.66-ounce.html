            <li>Wow!  Great for travel!</li>

            <li>The blushes are very fine and get everywhere</li>
            <li>Love, love, love all the colors!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the colors.</li>
            <li>Much smaller than it looks in the picture, but it is great for travel!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>which is okay because I love that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love elf products.</li>
            <li>Its smaller than I would like and the blushes aren&#x27;t the best colors.</li>
            <li>And customer service from the seller was awesome overall</li>
            <li>Wish they had more lip colors, but the size, again, is what I love.</li>
            <li>And I love E.L.F. products.</li>
            <li>The multiple colors for eyes, lips, and blush offer a great palette for day and night looks!</li>
            <li>Fits in my bag for on the go and love the mirror.</li>
            <li>These are cute ways for teenagers introducing them into the world of make up instead of a minimum of $8-9 blush that is not her color.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice and light for a teenager&lt;br /&gt;Starting out with makeup.  </li>
            <li>The eyeshadow colors are okay.  </li>
            <li>Love this little joy in a box,  definitely a great product for when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li>They are good quality and consistent.</li>
            <li>Great investment for busy women.</li>
            <li>The colors are good for almost any skin tone except the very darkest.</li>
            <li>This is nice because 99% of my essentials are right in one spot.  </li>
            <li>Portable and easy access when your on the road.</li>
            <li>agree that the mascara leaves something to be desired - but you could easily slip something else in that spot (eyeliner?)</li>
            <li>Great for travel, and I like the mascara better than my regular mascara!</li>
            <li>they fall apart easily.</li>
            <li>Pretty great color palate, but the mascara is not waterproof and smudges pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I got this kit for an easy travel compact kit.  </li>
            <li>Almost perfect little purse makeup kit.</li>
            <li>to make it more useful and pack a separate mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing, I can pack light when it comes to my make up thanks to this all in one compact.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s super easy to take with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this because it seemed convienent to carry iny purse.</li>
            <li>Still, well worth the $10 I paid!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artist with a variety of kits and this is perfect for my small quick job kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for those who ultra portable or minimal responsibility to keep up with their stuff.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good enough for the price</li>
            <li>I am a long time fan of e.l.f, any product I buy is of good quality.</li>
            <li>This worked great for me because the colors are very complementary, and it has pretty much all I need as far as eyeshadow &amp; blush.</li>
            <li>I only wish it had some kind of concealer/foundation/powder instead of or with the blush.</li>
            <li>I would suggest 1 thing is to make sure mascara is fresh and not dried out.</li>
            <li>I tried three of them, and the color seemed pretty true.  </li>
            <li>Very nice little makeup set.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday or traveling!  </li>
            <li>Love this lovely little makeup kit.</li>
            <li>The mascara that is in the set is okay, but I would probably see what other travel size can fit in there.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This would be better if the blushes were a bit larger.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>love how i have everything in one little easy to transport compact makeup box.  </li>
            <li>long so I will get more of that.</li>
            <li>Also the light color is pretty much white and not on the vanilla side.  </li>
            <li>I would take it apart and add my own eyeshadows etc and fill it myself, NOT WORTH THE BUY!</li>
            <li>I really tend to wear browns and there is only one light brown in the compact.  </li>
            <li>Very nifty for those who travel a lot.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Very Compact size.</li>
            <li>so I did not want to spend too much on toy make-up.....</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I got this is that it&#x27;s really small, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a barbie pink color lip-gloss, and I am not really a pink lipstick wearer, but over my regular lip-liner, it really makes for a great blend.</li>
            <li>Other then that love it.</li>
            <li>This is nice and small so that I can carry it around in my purse for &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li>Overall a really good little kit for when you find yourself away from the house and needing to spruce up or touch up.</li>
            <li>I have found myself using this even while at home over some ofy high end makeup.</li>
            <li>Normally don&#x27;t like elf make up</li>
            <li>Only thing worth using here is the blush.</li>
            <li>I could use most of these (and have) with my pale Edward Cullen-esque skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I do like the mascara, makes my already long eyelashes super</li>
            <li>The mascara is pretty standard and gives decent volume.</li>
            <li>I receive it on time, this little make up is just what you need for your every day use, I love it and the color are the same as the picture I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>ups&amp;#34;.I am pretty low maintenance, so I don&#x27;need all those eye colors.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see an almost full-sized mascara included.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I always travel with a carry on, even abroad, but my individual makeup palettes kept taking up too much space.  </li>
            <li>my 10 year old like to play makeup</li>
            <li>The only problem is, you have to close the top lid down on the eye-shadow section before opening to the next set to prevent the applicators from falling out.</li>
            <li>It is compact enough to fit in her small purse/crowded backpack.</li>

            <li> The eyeshadows are simply not versatile enough for me to travel for a couple of weeks with colors I generally do not use.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was once I dropped it, the blush fell out and created a mess, other than that, I really like the product</li>
            <li> Item was much smaller than expected</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow pallet is versatile enough to work with anyone and the lipsticks are creamy and a little sheer.</li>
            <li> but it powdered up and mixed up with all the other shades..</li>
            <li> I have issues with dry skin and makeup itching, this doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any</li>
            <li> But, overall it works for basic everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I thought the lower left color was a brown, when it is actually a dark plummy color.  </li>
            <li> could have used less shadow options and a larger blush area but other than that</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money!!</li>
            <li> This little case has everything I need for a simple everyday look.</li>
            <li> The lip glosses are dull and don&#x27;t last too.</li>
            <li> Almost got blinded while trying to pile on eyeshadow that didn&#x27;t last half a day!!!</li>
            <li> The only negative was the blush brush, which I found too narrow.  </li>
            <li> This is a little sample of almost everything I use</li>
            <li> Way too small then expected!</li>
            <li> I chose this set because it had a little bit of everything in it for her to try.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is dried up, the eye shadows wouldn&#x27;t show if a primer isn&#x27;t used and even then, a ton of shadow needs to be applied.</li>
            <li> Really really small -</li>
            <li> Small &amp; prefect for trips</li>
            <li> They are a bit small so hard to use your brushes with them.  </li>
            <li> brush that come with the kit are pretty much worthless, but I would leave them in and keep this as an emergency kit.  </li>
            <li> Sadly though, without it, I look like a half dead zombie beast from the depths without it, so to spare the community, I do put it on.  </li>
            <li> Every other thing is useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and packs a wallop!</li>
            <li> Not good size to give to someone as gift.</li>
            <li> It was broken</li>
            <li> the case is very small, awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to see how small the case was</li>
            <li> nothing is worth buying here, the blush made me look horrible and chalky, the shadows chalky and nasty, the mascara is awful, application tools suck.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> The blush and lip gloss brushes are useless!!</li>
            <li> I hate putting it on, I hate taking it off.  </li>
            <li> this is the worst palette in the universe</li>
            <li> the product is horrible!</li>

            <li> Normally don&#x27;t like elf make up but like this one for the price!</li>
            <li> Almost perfect little purse makeup kit. I only wish it had some kind of concealer/foundation/powder instead of or with the blush. The eyeshadow pallet is versatile enough to work with anyone and the lipsticks are creamy and a little sheer. The mascara is pretty standard and gives decent volume. Overall a really good little kit for when you find yourself away from the house and needing to spruce up or touch up.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the young lady is very happy with the product. It is compact enough to fit in her small purse/crowded backpack.</li>
            <li> Loves It! It&#x27;s perfect for go on. It has everything a girls need. The quality is good enough for the price</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this because it seemed convienent to carry iny purse. With 4 kids, I&#x27;m often rushing out of the house and don&#x27;t always have time to put on makeup. I have found myself using this even while at home over some ofy high end makeup. I absolutely love the colors.</li>
            <li> She is using it and likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Very nifty for those who travel a lot. This little case has everything I need for a simple everyday look. I&#x27;d like to see a compartment for eyeliner though.</li>
            <li> Portable and easy access when your on the road. I would guess. Didn&#x27;t care for the colors at all. Great Xmas grab bag gift though.</li>
            <li> Very nice little makeup set. Much smaller than it looks in the picture, but it is great for travel!</li>
            <li> Love this little joy in a box,  definitely a great product for when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> Item was much smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Wonderful idea of having all of your makeup contained in a portable kit like this.  I have used both the lip gloss and the eye shadows regularly and both go on without caking.  Wonderful to have in your purse for those midday emergencies.  Will definitely purchase from E.L.F. again...Thanks!</li>
            <li> My niece loves this compact.</li>
            <li> Love it. Portable, beautiful palette of colors.</li>
            <li> When I opened the lipstick compartment, I noticed all the lipsticks had condensation on them,  like that when products have already or are expiring.</li>
            <li> Awesome. I would suggest 1 thing is to make sure mascara is fresh and not dried out. Other then that love it.</li>
            <li> Really really small - which is okay because I love that.&lt;br /&gt;This was purchased to streamline my cosmetics for a trip to Europe and will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I agree that the mascara leaves something to be desired - but you could easily slip something else in that spot (eyeliner?) to make it more useful and pack a separate mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I could have used less shadow options and a larger blush area but other than that it&#x27;s quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror inside is a nice bonus</li>
            <li> This would be better if the blushes were a bit larger.</li>
            <li> Love it, everything in there comes in handy and its for a great price !!</li>
            <li> I was disapointed,something you would give to a pre--teen, or someone just getting into make-up.</li>
            <li> Nice palette for the price. Fits nicely in your purse. Took it with me on vacation &amp; it was all I needed !!</li>
            <li> I love elf products. This is a little sample of almost everything I use</li>
            <li> Wow!  Great for travel!</li>
            <li> I am a long time fan of e.l.f, any product I buy is of good quality. This fits in my purse nicely.</li>
            <li> Its smaller than I would like and the blushes aren&#x27;t the best colors. But, overall it works for basic everyday wear. I do like the mascara, makes my already long eyelashes super long so I will get more of that.</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> love how i have everything in one little easy to transport compact makeup box.  great for going from a day to night look anytime, anywhere. thanks</li>
            <li> This kit is perfect for on the go touch ups it is a good size to carry in your purse or beach bag or simply for a chic diva on the go. And customer service from the seller was awesome overall this is a good buy!</li>
            <li> I receive it on time, this little make up is just what you need for your every day use, I love it and the color are the same as the picture I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice on the go make up kit but it powdered up and mixed up with all the other shades.. The good is that the powder doesn&#x27;t spill into ur handbag but ur make up kit is all messed up..</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing, I can pack light when it comes to my make up thanks to this all in one compact. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It was broken so I returned it</li>
            <li> Great investment for busy women. You have everything you need to look great on the go.</li>
            <li> Way too small then expected! I was disappointed to see how small the case was but it is nice and compact if you are looking to have lipstick, eye shadow and blush all in one! Not good size to give to someone as gift.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the timeliness of shipment. Once I received the product I immediatly tried it on. I loved the outcome of the look I was going for. The only thing I did not like was once I dropped it, the blush fell out and created a mess, other than that, I really like the product</li>
            <li> This is nice and small so that I can carry it around in my purse for &amp;#34;touch ups&amp;#34;.I am pretty low maintenance, so I don&#x27;need all those eye colors. Wish they had more lip colors, but the size, again, is what I love.</li>
            <li> this is the worst palette in the universe nothing is worth buying here, the blush made me look horrible and chalky, the shadows chalky and nasty, the mascara is awful, application tools suck. The idea is good the product is horrible! I would take it apart and add my own eyeshadows etc and fill it myself, NOT WORTH THE BUY!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  Should receive no stars at all!! Only thing worth using here is the blush. Every other thing is useless. The mascara is dried up, the eye shadows wouldn&#x27;t show if a primer isn&#x27;t used and even then, a ton of shadow needs to be applied. Almost got blinded while trying to pile on eyeshadow that didn&#x27;t last half a day!!! The lip glosses are dull and don&#x27;t last too. The blush and lip gloss brushes are useless!! A complete waste of money!! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Love this lovely little makeup kit. Great colors!</li>
            <li> Great for travel, and I like the mascara better than my regular mascara! Note that there is not eyeliner in it--didn&#x27;t realize this before I went on a trip and had to buy some while I was there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for years, in stores and on the net. I&#x27;m a makeup artist with a variety of kits and this is perfect for my small quick job kit. It has everything but concealer and powder. It&#x27;s small and packs a wallop! I was surprised to see an almost full-sized mascara included. Also, proper applicators for each product are included.  The colors are good for almost any skin tone except the very darkest. And I love E.L.F. products. They are good quality and consistent. It&#x27;s tiny and well organized. A perfect gift for any gal. I got the last two of these and I hope more are on the way!</li>
            <li> Small &amp; prefect for trips</li>
            <li> the case is very small, awkward to handle. I did not like</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel! The multiple colors for eyes, lips, and blush offer a great palette for day and night looks!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love all the colors!  It is the perfect collection to keep in my purse for on the go touch ups.</li>
            <li> This is a handy gadget to have!  I am a self proclaimed makeup snob... I don&#x27;t like it.  I hate putting it on, I hate taking it off.  Sadly though, without it, I look like a half dead zombie beast from the depths without it, so to spare the community, I do put it on.  This is nice because 99% of my essentials are right in one spot.  That&#x27;s super easy to take with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three blushes, five lip colors, ten shades of eye shadow, a lip brush, face brush, and two mascaras.  I could use most of these (and have) with my pale Edward Cullen-esque skin tone.  I have issues with dry skin and makeup itching, this doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for those who ultra portable or minimal responsibility to keep up with their stuff.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This palette is great! Great colors and quality. Fits in my bag for on the go and love the mirror. This is a must have, love e.l.f.!</li>
            <li> These are cute ways for teenagers introducing them into the world of make up instead of a minimum of $8-9 blush that is not her color.</li>
            <li> The shadows aren&#x27;t very good they fall apart easily. The blushes are very fine and get everywhere</li>
            <li> I love this item. It is the perfect size for my purse. I have not tried out the mascara yet. It comes with a barbie pink color lip-gloss, and I am not really a pink lipstick wearer, but over my regular lip-liner, it really makes for a great blend. The eye-shadows and blush are practical colors. The only problem is, you have to close the top lid down on the eye-shadow section before opening to the next set to prevent the applicators from falling out.</li>
            <li> Very Compact size. My wife loved it.</li>
            <li> Pretty great color palate, but the mascara is not waterproof and smudges pretty easily. Still, well worth the $10 I paid!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a friend and she loved it. However, one of the bottom pieces came cracked. I made up for it by buying a separate piece of foundation but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought it was bigger. The brushes are not so good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Granddaughter, she is learning how to apply makeup.  The colors are nice and light for a teenager&lt;br /&gt;Starting out with makeup.  I chose this set because it had a little bit of everything in it for her to try.  Eyeshadow, lipgloss, blush we both are very pleased with set.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> I bought this because I always travel with a carry on, even abroad, but my individual makeup palettes kept taking up too much space.  This worked great for me because the colors are very complementary, and it has pretty much all I need as far as eyeshadow &amp; blush. The color palette is subdued, which works for me (age 38).  The only negative was the blush brush, which I found too narrow.  I purchased a separate mini travel sized brush set and that worked for me.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday or traveling!  Great colors and selection of eyeshadow, lipstick and powders.  Perfect for my purpose.  The colors last well especially the eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I got this kit for an easy travel compact kit.  The first thing I noticed when I got this is that it&#x27;s really small, which is nice.  The eyeshadow colors are okay.  I thought the lower left color was a brown, when it is actually a dark plummy color.  I really tend to wear browns and there is only one light brown in the compact.  Also the light color is pretty much white and not on the vanilla side.  So, it&#x27;s a bit &#x27;90&#x27;s reminiscent.  The lip colors are okay and seem to have a good stain to them.  I tried three of them, and the color seemed pretty true.  The blushes are a good variety.  They are a bit small so hard to use your brushes with them.  The foam eyeshadow, lip, and blush brush that come with the kit are pretty much worthless, but I would leave them in and keep this as an emergency kit.  The mascara that is in the set is okay, but I would probably see what other travel size can fit in there.  I got the Sephora mascara sampler and have a great selection to trade out with.  I decided I&#x27;m not taking this with me on my trip but will keep it in my office as an emergency back up.  The eyeshadows are simply not versatile enough for me to travel for a couple of weeks with colors I generally do not use.</li>
            <li> very nice.....my 10 year old like to play makeup so I did not want to spend too much on toy make-up.....may have to get one for myself!!  ;)</li>
