            <li>This is probably the best shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>From what I can tell, it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>The Massage spa works best to use twice a week to make my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Quality and perfume is wonderful.</li>
            <li>it is very good, I use it for two years.</li>
            <li>She was very pleased!</li>
            <li>It is a great buy</li>
            <li>This product is great for both of my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>and she said this product is great.</li>
            <li>These smell amazing!</li>
            <li>Both of them work really good on me.</li>
            <li>I think this one is good for oil hair.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the packaging is elegant and sturdy, and the set is a great value if you like the product since the bottles are huge.</li>
            <li>I really love the shampoo.</li>
            <li>So it still requires some kind of serum or hair style product to keep it looking smooth.</li>
            <li>I tried it out myself and the it gave my hair more bounce and body.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>have had so many compliments on my hair since using this</li>
            <li>casi un mes y el cambio ha sido notable, lo siento liviano, m치s lacio y con brillo, adem치s el olor es muy rico y la textura del producto muy manejable.</li>
            <li>It kept my hair shiny, healthy and really clean, also loves the smell!</li>
            <li>My hair was very soft and smelled great after washing, drying and styling my hair.</li>
            <li>it help my hair become more smooth.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to clarify your scalp and reduce the greasies, this is a great and super gentle way to do it.</li>
            <li>Also, a great price for quality shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioning products.</li>
            <li>super strong.</li>
            <li>For Asian hair, this product is amazing!~~~</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel squeaky clean even with the conditioner without over drying.</li>
            <li>I have tried the White and Red lines of this product but the Gold works best for me.</li>
            <li>I think this line is great because it makes my hair soft, shiny, and smooth, but I gave it a four out of five since the red line also did this except for shinier.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and moisturized after use ~Love</li>
            <li>The gold keeps my hair fresh longer though it tends to be more drying than the red line which I&#x27;ve also used.</li>
            <li>Bought it at my local market, this bundle price is much better than paying retail, but I wanted it right there...</li>
            <li>I just love it, and the store offers me a free gift because the first set was different than the one I ordered.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I have only been in Japan for about three weeks, but I can tell this is the shampoo for me :3</li>
            <li>The flower scent is really pretty.</li>
            <li>BUT FOR MY HAIR TYPE THE RED TSUBAKI IS BETTER</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing without weighting hair down; it smell nice and makes hair bouncy.</li>
            <li>If I use one for oily hair, it cleans too much and my scalp hurt.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for these products.</li>
            <li>My hair feel clean, smoother and silkier without feeling dry on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Conditioner is liquid and much lighter than I am used to, but I have not noticed my ends drying out so far.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I suggest this for normal to oily hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I find most shampoos to only do one or the other!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo, unlike others, rinses out with a soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>and I have pretty long hair.</li>
            <li>Formula is definitely different than what you&#x27;d find in other, more mainstream american products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Chinese and I have natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>It also helped with the dry scalp my old shampoo was leaving me with.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry my hair or scalp out, it just regulates it enough to reduce the washing.</li>
            <li>The shampoo seems to leave a film and not clean very well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The hair treatment is really brings back the life in dried, flat hair.</li>
            <li> I am going to try the damage package to see how that works since I do flat iron and curl my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with dry hair but oily scalp</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for a long time.</li>

            <li> Since I have been using this for 6 months, I have been able to go 8 weeks without cutting my hair, I usually get it cut every 5 weeks because my ends look brittle but not now since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other kinds of hair products or style my hair.</li>

            <li> hair is past my shoulders and is very coarse and thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble looking for a product that can keep my hair moisturized and frizzy-free.</li>
            <li> It is slightly thin and not coarse at all.</li>
            <li> Weird scent....</li>

            <li> I just love it, and the store offers me a free gift because the first set was different than the one I ordered. Both of them work really good on me. thanks!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best shampoo I have ever used.  I picked it up in the local drug store where I am living in Tokyo, and after one use I saw a total difference!  I don&#x27;t have Asian hair, and it works wonders.  I usually use Pantene, but this is so much nicer!  It leaves my hair soft and shiny!  I find most shampoos to only do one or the other!  It also helped with the dry scalp my old shampoo was leaving me with.  I have only been in Japan for about three weeks, but I can tell this is the shampoo for me :3 It is a great buy and I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really love the shampoo. The flower scent is really pretty. And my hair is a mixture of oily and dry. If I use shampoo for dry hair, it&#x27;s too oily in the summer. If I use one for oily hair, it cleans too much and my scalp hurt. This shampoo is spot on. I guess it&#x27;s an Asian hair thing???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Chinese and I have natural curly hair. My hair dry even though I never permed or dyed my hair. I&#x27;ve always had trouble looking for a product that can keep my hair moisturized and frizzy-free. This product is great for both of my hair and scalp. My hair feel clean, smoother and silkier without feeling dry on my scalp. The only reason I gave it an 4 star is cause my hair is still somewhat frizzy the second day I woke up. So it still requires some kind of serum or hair style product to keep it looking smooth.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for a long time. From what I can tell, it smells wonderful. It makes my hair feel squeaky clean even with the conditioner without over drying. My hair gets greaser faster with the red line by tsubaki than the gold. The gold keeps my hair fresh longer though it tends to be more drying than the red line which I&#x27;ve also used. Therefore, I suggest this for normal to oily hair. I don&#x27;t use any other kinds of hair products or style my hair. I alternate between the two to get the balance for my hair. My hair is hip length and southeast asian hair specifically vietnamese hair. It is slightly thin and not coarse at all. All in all I gave this a four out of five since my hair tends to need a shampoo switch up. I think this line is great because it makes my hair soft, shiny, and smooth, but I gave it a four out of five since the red line also did this except for shinier.</li>
            <li> For Asian hair, this product is amazing!~~~ My hair is soft and moisturized after use ~Love the white set as well~</li>
            <li> Review is for shampoo and conditioner only, have not tried the treatment. Bought it at my local market, this bundle price is much better than paying retail, but I wanted it right there... I used to wash my hair every other day. Using this shampoo I am down to twice a week. It does not dry my hair or scalp out, it just regulates it enough to reduce the washing. Conditioner is liquid and much lighter than I am used to, but I have not noticed my ends drying out so far. If you are looking to clarify your scalp and reduce the greasies, this is a great and super gentle way to do it.</li>
            <li> Product was not what I was expecting,  but they refunded my money promptly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she said this product is great. The shampoo, unlike others, rinses out with a soft and silky feeling. The hair treatment is really brings back the life in dried, flat hair. I tried it out myself and the it gave my hair more bounce and body. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a couple of years now since discovering at Uwajimaya. It kept my hair shiny, healthy and really clean, also loves the smell! I will not use any other brand.</li>
            <li> Weird scent....super strong. I didn&#x27;t care much for these products. The shampoo seems to leave a film and not clean very well. The conditioner and mask leave a filmy feeling as well. I didn&#x27;t like that the ingredients and instructions are only in Japanese. On the plus side, the packaging is elegant and sturdy, and the set is a great value if you like the product since the bottles are huge.</li>
            <li> if you are Asian or have coarse hair and looking for shampoo and conditioner that people will want to touch your hair, then get this. Since I have been using this for 6 months, I have been able to go 8 weeks without cutting my hair, I usually get it cut every 5 weeks because my ends look brittle but not now since I have been using this.  The Massage spa works best to use twice a week to make my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am going to try the damage package to see how that works since I do flat iron and curl my hair every other day.&lt;br /&gt;I have had so many compliments on my hair since using this, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is past my shoulders and is very coarse and thick.</li>
            <li> it is very good, I use it for two years. it help my hair become more smooth. I think this one is good for oil hair.</li>
            <li> Es el mejor shampoo, reacondicionador y crema que he utilizado hasta el momento y soy de las pruebo mucho porque llevo el cabello larg칩 y me gusta llevarlo bien. Lo he utilizado casi un mes y el cambio ha sido notable, lo siento liviano, m치s lacio y con brillo, adem치s el olor es muy rico y la textura del producto muy manejable.</li>
            <li> I purchased it as a gift to my wife. She was very pleased! Quality and perfume is wonderful. Will recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> The Tsubaki Gold shampoo &amp; condition has been my repeated purchase. I have tried the White and Red lines of this product but the Gold works best for me. It&#x27;s moisturizing without weighting hair down; it smell nice and makes hair bouncy. I&#x27;m Asian with dry hair but oily scalp and I wash my hair daily.</li>
            <li> These smell amazing! The pump bottles lasted me about 6 months..and I have pretty long hair. My hair was very soft and smelled great after washing, drying and styling my hair. Also, a great price for quality shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioning products. (And my boyfriend loves the smell)</li>
            <li> BUT FOR MY HAIR TYPE THE RED TSUBAKI IS BETTER</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY!  THANK YOU!!!  Product was as advertised and works for my coarse, asian hair!  Formula is definitely different than what you&#x27;d find in other, more mainstream american products.</li>
