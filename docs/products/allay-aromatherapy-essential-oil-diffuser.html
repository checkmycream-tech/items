            <li>It does great.  </li>
            <li>So, if you want something that provides longer term scent for a space, this is not the best option (unless you like filling it up once an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it works and has a nice shape.</li>

            <li>Inasmuch as I really liked this diffuser, it had a wonderful stream, and was nice looking, and even the company was willing to help when the diffuser kept shutting off from day one.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size and design - not too large or obnoxious.  </li>

            <li>We liked this one</li>
            <li>I just smiled.. and immediately wanted to write my review.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>So I am going to try another kind.</li>
            <li>and she liked it</li>
            <li>I have been putting peppermint oil into the water and it makes the whole house smell great!</li>
            <li>Checked the steam coming out and it too seemed warm.</li>
            <li>It was nice but stopped working after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>it turns off on its own when it runs out of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would be nice if this could run on battery</li>
            <li>I bought a massage table, oil, music, a scented aromatherapy oil set and this mist machine and set up my own at home spa.</li>
            <li>I own three.</li>
            <li>i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>room but after leaving it on all day today, it was nice to have an aroma throughout the house just from one difusser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>buy.&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;I will always be honest in my reviews.</li>
            <li>So happy with my purchase, and I love the color as well :)</li>
            <li>When they were working, I liked them.</li>
            <li>It is, however, perfect for providing a gentle, relaxing send-off when placed on my nightstand.</li>
            <li>I own one</li>
            <li>Honestly, I could not be happier with the ZAQ</li>
            <li>Shuts off on its own when water runs out.</li>
            <li>Lights are a nice feature.</li>
            <li>One for calming and one for the nice fall scent.  </li>
            <li>We use it with Four Thieves oil most often, and it makes the room smell really good.</li>
            <li>Puts out a nice amount of mist.</li>
            <li>nice compact size, works well, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it not working.</li>
            <li>Nice diffuser.</li>
            <li>It has a nice design</li>
            <li>and it makes my whole downstairs smell awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a nice alternative to scented</li>
            <li>This diffuser emits a nice stream of mist for about 4 hours before it shuts itself off.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is quite nice, when it works.</li>
            <li>I now own three of these.</li>
            <li>is nice in bedroom, pine and/or lemongrass</li>
            <li>They shut off on their own.</li>
            <li>I now own 3.</li>
            <li>If it stays this good for more than a year (which is what the warranty covers)</li>
            <li>Adds a nice smelling moisture to the air at night.  </li>
            <li>Cute design, good price.</li>
            <li>I did receive my unit at promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this diffuser.</li>

            <li>Loving this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I have used it for hours straight and still working great!</li>
            <li>and I was looking to get one since I liked the way it smelled.</li>
            <li>It stopped working for me, I changed the disc and made sure it was cleaned out good</li>
            <li>I know it seems like it&#x27;d be nice to have a product that runs for a longer period of time - but</li>
            <li>cost effective.</li>
            <li>Good Quality love that it turns off by itself when water is gone.</li>
            <li>We own two</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now got all my friends using (and loving) one too.</li>
            <li>they are always loved :)</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>so it kind of makes me nervous since it can be damaging to knock it over and let water get into the mechanism.  </li>

            <li>I was sooooo excited!!</li>

            <li>pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It creates steam as soon as I turn it on and the oil I put in smells very strong.</li>
            <li>It disassembles very easily, you fill the water chamber with water and 3-5 drops of the oil of your choice, plug it in, turn it on, and let it go.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>

            <li>you don&#x27;t want that bright light in your room at night.</li>
            <li>Just my own theory.  :-)</li>

            <li>Worked great at first.</li>

            <li>Great at first.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>This is our first difuser, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it seems to work great.</li>
            <li>I bought this just barely over 30 days ago and loved it!!!  </li>

            <li>It gets very warm, to the point of hot when it runs.  </li>

            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I waited.  </li>
            <li>I bought the ZAQ Allay because the price was more affordable.  </li>
            <li>The slightest bump will knock the top off.</li>
            <li>I have waited a couple of weeks for my review on this to make sure it would keep working.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use filtered water or distilled water because I am sure you would end up with a clogged diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love these diffusers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love love love.  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I thought I would look online to find a better deal.</li>
            <li>Such a great deal for the price, bought one for my mom for Christmas and she loves it too!</li>
            <li>Pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>It takes I guess more than two hrs duration to diffuse.</li>
            <li>Love this..</li>
            <li>I love it in fact I am ordering another one...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering ordering more of these for our home</li>
            <li>I also love the fact it turns itself off when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li>I have since bought 2 more, one for my office and one as a gift?</li>
            <li>I love this  </li>
            <li>I put some rosemary, eucalyptus or peppermint and it makes my sinuses feel better.</li>
            <li>I love that it turns off itself when it runs out of water</li>

            <li>which is why I bought 2 more.</li>
            <li>I initially liked this diffuser because it didn&#x27;t light up the bedroom while I was using oils for sleep and relaxation, and because it would turn off automatically after about 3 hours of use.</li>
            <li>I Love the way it diffuses the oils in the air and uses the water to do so.</li>
            <li>and it cost more than this one.</li>

            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>When it did work it was ok, it did not seem to put out alot of aroma from the oils (DoTERRA brand)  </li>

            <li>Has a nice  appearance with a soothing light that can can be turned off while diffuser is still running.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has an automatic shut off once the water is diffused out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for diffusing essential oils.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>mother uses it mostly at night while she sleeps beside her bed.</li>
            <li>With that being said though, I won&#x27;t be able to use it in my bedroom as planned without some modification.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to try that and feel almost 100% sure it will work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly pleased with that</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I like that you can turn the light off, but keep the diffuser on too!</li>
            <li>Amazon got it to us the next day which was awesome!</li>

            <li>Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser lets out a lot of nice mist but no condensation, which is really good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
            <li>; 2) runs 2 hours; 3) emits strong mist.</li>
            <li>I bought two Smiley Daisy diffusers with this one and they are still going strong, as stated.  </li>
            <li>or it will be way too strong.</li>
            <li>Bombay Electronics was very fast and courteous in honoring the 1-year warranty that these come with.</li>

            <li>Though I love sweetly scented candles, they can sometimes make my asthma flare.</li>
            <li>This is cool because you can help your body in a better way without taking medicine.</li>
            <li>but I agree with somenof the others who dislike how bright the on/off switch is when you turn the main light off.  </li>
            <li>I generally use lemongrass pure oil which is one of the strongest and the diffuser runs flawlessly</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working fine still.  </li>
            <li>After the first one, I bought 2 more for myself and 1 more for a friend.</li>
            <li>I know that might sound funny, but it just feels nice.</li>
            <li>She said after doing that it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I can smell the oils I put in this in the air, so I guess it works fine.</li>
            <li>And although I thought I was fine with that.</li>
            <li>everything work fine, but</li>
            <li>This diffuser was fine while it lasted.</li>

            <li>they work fine.  </li>
            <li>I move mine from room to room which is fine for now.  </li>

            <li>This starts off great then becomes increasingly less effective.</li>
            <li>This product is soothing to watch light up and quickly produces a mist that rolls out of the top.</li>
            <li>easy to clean, small and compact, great for countertop or bedside, puts out a good amount of steam.</li>
            <li>Love this...set it up in my office and put oils that help keep a clear mind and be able to focus!</li>
            <li>with so many similar seeming products on the market it was easy to see why this one was so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very portable and easy to use and really does a great job diffusing oils throughout the house.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this diffuser for a little over a month now and it works great!</li>
            <li>Love the pretty lights!</li>
            <li>This little thing is one of the best diffusers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Thanks!! :)</li>
            <li>best little diffuser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>When it did work it was very quiet and had a great night light.</li>
            <li>it might make a great night light for some, but I just turn the blue part to face away from my bed.</li>
            <li>it might make a great night light for some, but I just turn the blue part to face away from my bed.</li>
            <li>Also, the fact that I can shut off the internal light within the diffuser or leave it on to relax with is a great feature.</li>
            <li>The light (even in OFF mode) is a bit too bright to sleep near, so I have to put a cloth around it.</li>
            <li>I already owned a ZAQ Mirage, which has a huge &amp;#34;footprint&amp;#34; and takes up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it has been great to diffuse my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I put it in our bedroom at night and shut the light off.</li>
            <li>I  liked it so much.  </li>
            <li>It was great while it lasted, but that was only 3 months</li>
            <li>The light broke</li>
            <li>There is a light around the power button that does not go out.</li>
            <li>Not optimal when sleeping, but it throws of virtually negligible amount of light.</li>
            <li>like that you can turn the light off if you want and just</li>
            <li>I also do not like the light.  </li>
            <li>Love my defuser  Love the fact it s***s off on its own and covers the entire room with aromatherapy</li>
            <li>I am happy its lasting well</li>
            <li>You can shut the light off.</li>
            <li>You can turn off the light or not while diffusing.</li>

            <li>They are easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li>and you can have the light on or off.</li>

            <li>Great for essential oils!</li>
            <li>You can turn off the light if you want to by pressing twice.</li>
            <li>The mist coming out from the top is mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>The light would work and the water would bubble</li>
            <li>Light can be turned off while still using it.</li>
            <li>is it&#x27;s just made with cheap crappy parts from China (circuit board and power supply)...</li>
            <li>It works great when it will actually stay on.</li>
            <li>I turn off the light feature as it&#x27;s too distracting for sleep</li>
            <li>I like that you can turn off the light</li>
            <li>This thing really gets warm.</li>
            <li>Allows light on or off while diffusing.</li>
            <li>and I like that the light can be turned on or off, while the diffuser continues to run...</li>
            <li>Thank you, ZAQ.com for a great product and the very next day delivery!!</li>
            <li>I like that you can leave the light off if you don&#x27;t want it on.</li>
            <li>She likes the water chamber size, and the ability to change the color of the light.</li>
            <li>I use cheap $1tree oil</li>
            <li>and it stills makes my whole apartment smell amazing</li>
            <li>You push the button again and the glowing light shuts off but still runs.</li>
            <li>I also like that I can use it with the light on or off.</li>
            <li>I like that you can turn the color off if you just want the aroma and not the light.</li>
            <li>OVERALL: This diffuser would make a great wedding shower gift.</li>
            <li>or you can choose to turn off the light.</li>
            <li>There is option to turn the light off.</li>
            <li>Great diffuser for short time diffusing.  </li>
            <li>The light can be switched off if you want by the press of a button.</li>
            <li>Affordable option for those who enjoy aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>I really liked this, while it lasted, which was a whole 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I makes gurgling sound too.  </li>
            <li>Great diffuser for essential oils!</li>
            <li>When I use this with lavendar to help my insomnia the light is a killer.</li>
            <li>You can turn the light off that shines through the funnel, but you can&#x27;t turn off the light that glows around the front button.  </li>
            <li>However, neither of my lids feel secure despite my efforts to tighten.  </li>
            <li>Overall works great.</li>
            <li>and I like that you don&#x27;t need to have the light on if you choose not to.  </li>
            <li>It does not need to warm up, a gentle mist with the chosen scent started the moment we pressed the on button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I feel comfortable running it in our bedrooms at night.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a few hours, and the best part- when the water runs out, it shuts itself off.</li>
            <li>If you press the power button once, it turns the unit on, light + steam.</li>
            <li>, it turns the unit on, light + steam.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it started shutting off before the water would run out, but I have been using it without the light on and it runs longer.</li>
            <li>Can be diffused with the light off or on.  </li>
            <li>this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I now own 3 because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>I enjoy them both.</li>
            <li>Light can be turned off.  </li>
            <li>After about a month of use, we are exceptionally happy with the overall performance of this product and the vendor.  </li>
            <li>It also has an adjustable on/off light function.</li>
            <li>It filled the room with my scented oil immediately.</li>
            <li>Have had this for 9 months and it works fabulous still.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, and has met all of my expectations.</li>

            <li>I like the fact I can turn on the light, or turn it off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use, easy to clean, and looks great in any room.</li>
            <li>I use a variety of essential oils and my room smells great.</li>
            <li>These things aren&#x27;t cheap for what they are.</li>
            <li>(I face it to the wall and cover the light with a book for now)  </li>
            <li>This one definitely does and smells great.</li>
            <li>No leaking, easy to clean...</li>
            <li>Works great, and the fact that it turns off by itself when it runs out of water is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I have bought two of these, work great with essential oils</li>
            <li>I received a free product to review.</li>
            <li>You can also decide to turn on or off the light.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>so much he&#x27;s considering spending his money to buy one of his own.</li>
            <li>I like how you can have the light on or off.</li>
            <li>It makes a great nightlight for the younger kid</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned with the light, but it is mellow and the orange is not obnoxious at all.  </li>
            <li>Three reasons I like this product:  1) light can be turned off</li>
            <li>I like that you can keep the light off.</li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>and I was overall happy with it.</li>
            <li>The light turns off for day use.</li>
            <li>Instead of filling it up with water, I filled it up with rubbing alcohol and let it sit for about an hour.</li>
            <li>, I enjoy it every night at bedtime.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>I like that the light can be turned on or off.</li>
            <li>There are 2 settings, one with the light on and one without if you prefer not to have the light on.</li>
            <li>I like how you can use it with or without the night light.</li>
            <li>There light bubbling</li>
            <li>Works great but wish it was bigger and lasted longer</li>
            <li>or you can turn the light off if you want to.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>and it filled the room with the relaxing scent of lavender and everyone that came in</li>
            <li>I used to go through tea light candles like water.</li>
            <li>The light can be turned off if you don&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>The light shuts off automatically when the unit is empty&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>You can either have the light on as shown in the picture or off during the operation.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the comforting aromas while resting for the evening.  </li>
            <li>Uses all the water before it shuts off (unlike another brand I tried), and has a light on/off option.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that even with the light off (which is how I prefer it)</li>
            <li>Even when I do not have congestion - I enjoy the soothing smells to help lull me to sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to operate and clean.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and nice to watch.</li>

            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The color, the way it works, the light.</li>

            <li>The light won&#x27;t even turn on when I push the button.  </li>

            <li>Such a great buy - I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is easy to clean since all the parts come off.</li>
            <li>It is so simple to use, looks attractive sitting out and (now that I think about it</li>
            <li>Just started to use, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This diffuser works very well with my essential oils, it was a great value too!  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Everyone was in a good mood, and my mind felt clear all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I didn&#x27;t know there was such a device, but when I had received an opportunity to give the Allay Aromatherapy defused a try for free, try it for a while and then give my feedback and a very honest informative review so that all purchasers could find out detailed information about the product so that they can decide and make a informed purchase of the Allay Defuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill and the light is cool.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still a decent size and works great for a bedroom, not in a large living room, etc.</li>
            <li>Top part just falls right off &amp; doesn&#x27;t tighten like directions tell you to do.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser, it&#x27;s easy to set up, easy to travel with, and it really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Works exactly like it says!!</li>
            <li>This is a great little diffuser i use in my kitchen but keeps my whole house smelling amazing!  </li>
            <li>I love the steady stream of mist infused with the essential oil that adds a wonderful healing aroma with just the right amount of humidity to our room.  </li>
            <li>Very simple and very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use, turns off automatically when the water runs out, and has a light on or off function so you can use it as a nightlight or not.  </li>
            <li>Its like a beautiful little stream of fragrant mist spilling from the top</li>
            <li>Nice diffuser however after some time I do notice a high pitched sound coming from the machine.</li>
            <li>Produces a nice steady stream of steam.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s nice looking and gives out a decent amount of mist</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to put water In water &amp; add oil.</li>
            <li>The diffuser quickly and easily fills my bedroom or livingroom</li>
            <li>I just hope that it lasts a long time because this really is a neat product, and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I just hope that it lasts a long time because this really is a neat product, and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to deliver natural scents to a room while providing real health benefits!</li>
            <li>The first press of the button turns the unit on and mist immediately begins flowing, a light also lights up the power button and the colored cone at the top.  </li>
            <li>It diffuses terrifically, and it&#x27;s easy to disconnect quickly to refill.</li>
            <li>I just wish the lights were brighter so the color of the cone would light up more and be more vivid.</li>
            <li>I also own a larger one from a different manufacturer which holds more water and lasts through the night but this one is great for day use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I loved the light on it and it did a great job diffusing oils, but I can&#x27;t believe it worked for such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome little machine  that does its job very well love it</li>
            <li>easy to clean, durable, and freshens up the atmosphere quickly.</li>
            <li>Quiet, with a pleasant trickling sound.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good humidifier/diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty quiet and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We can now have fresh scents in our home that are not empowering because we can now take control of how light or strong we&#x27;d like our home to smell</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean</li>
            <li>Super easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find that the ZAQ Allay occupies less space on a table or shelf, and still fills my room with a great scent.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to work and adds a calm light for their room too.</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit and was very happy with the product( great flow, soft light, long lasting stream ) ...</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s such an amazing price!</li>
            <li>One of those are the remarkable properties of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Fun product!  </li>

            <li>*Original Review</li>
            <li>This is a small sized diffuser that would be perfect for a small/medium sized room.  </li>
            <li>but I was so excited I just had to say something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with my diffuser so far.  </li>
            <li>cool looking and like the ability to turn off light and still diffuse</li>
            <li>In my opinion they are perfect for small rooms (home office, nursery, etc).</li>
            <li>and it looks so original</li>
            <li>this is a lovely and very functional product!</li>
            <li>and you can smell the aroma throughout most of the first floor of our house.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>This brand has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mesmerizing!</li>
            <li>I love my diffuser so much!  </li>
            <li>My first diffuser, so read a lot of reviews on many products.  </li>
            <li>Very efficient, easy to operate!  </li>
            <li>I initially liked the diffuser very much but after the first day using it, it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I loved this diffuser for the first 3 days, after that, it started to emit a high pitched noise which i couldn&#x27;t shut off.</li>
            <li>Not like there is a bunch of parts to clean.</li>
            <li>and yes I do clean it often.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and did everything people recommended, cleaning the ring at the bottom, flushing it clean, letting it rest, etc.</li>
            <li>Well the point was to be able to use the essential oils I already own.</li>
            <li>It is the easiest of my 3 to use, load, and clean.</li>
            <li>Perfect for using my Young Living essential oils at night on my night stand.</li>
            <li>My only complaints are the light, even the one for the power switch, is way too bright</li>
            <li>I clean it out all the time</li>
            <li>I loved the glowing blue light and the mist it gave out.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s not as useful for the essential oil properties as it is for making a room/area smell great.  </li>
            <li>It works great EXCEPT, when the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s not really off &amp; the power button is still lit up.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I dumped out the alcohol and scrubbed out the inside with some q-tips and paper towels to clean the metal ring.</li>
            <li>When I received item I loved the look of it, I filled it with water and added essential oil</li>
            <li>I am going to take the advice from some of the q&amp;a&#x27;s here and clean it out and start over again.  </li>
            <li>(But I clean it</li>
            <li>Easier to clean.</li>
            <li>We have used it for about 3 full weeks now and she has consistently reported better sleep since we implemented this.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it diffuses very well!&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I needed to clean it out</li>
            <li>The diffuser is amazing, I love how stong the scent is and that it automatically turns off when the water levels get too low.</li>
            <li>, you will never get them clean</li>
            <li>Read Q&amp;A and tried to clean it and still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>First off it did work great (for the short time that it was working) and it looked very nice with blue led lights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, quick to set up, and I really like the way it looks.</li>
            <li>I loved this when I first got it, but as I am not home a lot, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it very much in the first month.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t over power with too much moisture, the light is beautiful (blue).  </li>
            <li>It is very pretty and have even used it in my daughter&#x27;s room as a night light when she was sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works beautifully and I love the soft blue glow.  </li>
            <li>So far I love this diffuser!</li>
            <li>I have a young living diffuser and this one is way better!</li>
            <li>Was able to return the first one through Amazon because it broke that quickly.</li>
            <li>The light shuts off after a few hours, so this works great as a defacto night light for going to bed if don&#x27;t need the light all night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to set up and start using right away.</li>
            <li>cool gadget, it works perfecly, i been running it dayly for a month now, havent even clean it</li>
            <li>I purchased special EO for this unit.  </li>
            <li>My clients love the simplicity of this diffuser and the surprisingly large quantity of diffused air it omits.</li>
            <li>Much better than using a candle below pure oil method.</li>
            <li>It puts me right to sleep too!</li>
            <li>... needs to be cranked up right now!)</li>
            <li>Thank you, you&#x27;ve invented a great little machine! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am super excited to receive the ZAQ</li>
            <li>It is working fine right now.</li>
            <li>It is so bright next to my bed, I have to cover it up.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and pretty when lit.</li>
            <li>Absolutely beautiful and wonderful diffuser, completely idiot proof to operate.</li>
            <li>(though note the blue power button is still lit, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overly bright).  </li>
            <li>At first, I liked how much vapor was coming out of it</li>
            <li>The blue is so pretty with the mist coming out - it was great if it would have just kept running.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to fill and refill, and clean - doesn&#x27;t get hot,</li>
            <li>I will say it is good for a smaller space.  </li>
            <li>The top part is really tipsy too.</li>
            <li>Loved it for a short time, then it stopped working.</li>
            <li>Wish led lights changed the whole spectrum of colors instead of just the plastic piece on top being one color period.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old handles filling his own at night with no problem.</li>
            <li>It does a good job at diffusing essential oils!</li>
            <li>I keep it in the bathroom and turn it on every-time I walk in because it makes me feel good to have essential oil aromatherapy in the air.  </li>
            <li>I liked this diffuser until it stopped working at 4 months old.</li>
            <li>I love the light, sound and vapor that comes from this product as it really creates a peaceful spa-like ambiance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for the price</li>
            <li>Peppermint essential oils is good for allergies, so when I received it, I used it by my bed at night.  </li>
            <li>I was in love with hers so much I decided to buy one myself.</li>
            <li>I changed the water frequently but after about 4 months it started to shut off on its own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cordless would be cool.</li>
            <li>Looks cool.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Loving this diffuser so far.  </li>
            <li>the item looks cool and sleek</li>
            <li>It works very well and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It also runs for a shorter amount of time, which is good for daytime use when i might want to use one blend of oils in the morning and another later in the day.  </li>
            <li>Was cool when it worked.</li>
            <li>Full story:</li>
            <li>And it looks cool.</li>
            <li>Checked water was still full, turned it on and it shut off after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>A cap full of vinegar and water and run it.</li>
            <li>Good product very quiet, but not reliable every use.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it is a cool mist.</li>
            <li>commented on how cool it looked.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is so cool, it lights up when you turn it on.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it look great, quiet, aroma from oils is nice, 2-3 drops are enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is our first day, so far so good.</li>
            <li>One out of two is not bad.</li>
            <li>So far it has been a good investment being my first diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love the diffuser, it is easy to use, easy to clean, and has worked flawlessley for me for the last 7 months.  </li>
            <li>Puts out the right amount of smell, the light is so calming.</li>
            <li>Operation is super easy, has a lights off mode, and turns just a few drops of oil into a great aroma.</li>
            <li>As for ease of use, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It looks super cool and starts diffusing the water/essential oils the moment it is turned on.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and pretty to look at</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has more throw (the carry of scent) than a single wick candle, easily delivering smell to most my downstairs.</li>
            <li>Allows me to have my favorite essential oils steaming into the room with the light on, so you can use it as a night light, or the light off, and the diffuser still going.</li>
            <li>With the dry winter air filling the house, this adds just the right amount of humidity to keep my sinuses happy.</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase and will probably purchase another one for other areas of the house.</li>
            <li>The other one still works great</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, and mom really likes that it adds a little moisture to the room.</li>
            <li>I love my new diffuser!</li>
            <li>I used it a couple of times when I first purchased it in August and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine during the first week</li>
            <li>I help in the classroom once a week and have always been amazed by how fresh and clean their room smells.</li>
            <li>Luckily it comes with a warranty and we contacted the company.  </li>
            <li>I finally have my husband believing in the benefits of diffusing oils, and I only use DoTerra oils, but now I am facing another decision of what diffuser is best.</li>
            <li>Love the contemporary look to it.</li>
            <li>The glowing blue light is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I looks pretty cool too with the built in light and the fog coming out.</li>
            <li>when I discovered here it should not shut off so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I experimented with it twice more to be sure it was actually malfunctioning.</li>
            <li>My husband was super unsure about oils</li>
            <li>This unit has a much more robust stream of vapor, which I&#x27;m glad for because my bedroom is considerably larger than that massage room.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super overpriced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit is very portable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit is very portable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It freshens the air quickly.</li>
            <li>You can put more for an increasingly potent aroma while the device is running, but I don&#x27;t find the aroma to last when the device is not in use.</li>
            <li>They should have said 30 to 40 minutes if you are lucky.  </li>
            <li>This is a MUCH more economical solution than candles and is much healthier.</li>
            <li>The seller has always responded quickly to my messages and has been nothing but helpful.</li>
            <li>It comes on quick, works until chamber empties</li>
            <li>It is mildly tricky to clean--you need to use q-tips to get into some of the areas.</li>
            <li>It gets 5 stars for it&#x27;s function but it is not the better model of the 2 main types of ZAQ diffusers.  </li>
            <li>It also serves as a night light which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Product quick working today.</li>
            <li>If I put stronger smelling oils in it, I can smell it through most of my main floor.</li>
            <li>Just lovely and the light display is unexpected</li>
            <li>This is a really great device that last up to 4 or 5 hrs.and has a pretty blue night light that can be turned off if you like; love the lite mist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazon on the other hand was amazing with the 2 returns I love their customer service.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ll say that they have great customer service, the first one that I owned only would run for like 15 minutes at a time and then shut off.  </li>
            <li>I think having the light on makes it too hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very pleased and would recommend and may buy another but would maybe buy a different shape.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>First, the light went out, and then the automatic shut off</li>
            <li>I keep it on my nightstand and it puffs out scented oil for a good long time while I fall to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>...delivers nice scent throughout the room and has a simple clean up.. Would definetly recommend</li>
            <li>The mist is a nice steady stream and leaves the room very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>I is not too small or to large, it is wonderful in my kitchen!!!  </li>
            <li>It does not cover a large area, but is perfect for a small bedroom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to operate, has about a 4 hr run time (which is really convenient), and the auto shut-off really is a &amp;#34;shut-off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Good product, diffuses well, and for a long time!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it. :)</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of aroma therapy and I am enjoying learning about the oils and what they can do.</li>
            <li>I keep it in my bedroom and it fills the whole space very quickly.</li>
            <li>noise it makes is very soothing on top of the vapor it puts off is very relaxing with my lavender oil!</li>
            <li>Not to pricey really does nice job in defusing essential oil and nice soft light worth the price you pay</li>
            <li>Used it with peppermint, lavender, orange and grapefruit essential oils the first time and it did a great job of filling our quite large kitchen with fresh</li>
            <li>I purchased this for myself, had it exactly one month before it stopped working!</li>
            <li>Lasts for about 4 hours and puts out pretty powerful aromas!</li>
            <li>Does not come with essential oils, so be sure to have some on hand because you will want to try this out as soon as it arrives!</li>
            <li>I cleaned it regularly every day--sometimes more depending what oils I would diffuse!</li>
            <li>but mine will only stay on maybe fifteen minutes at the most!  </li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>My daughter raved about this diffuser, so I bought one for my daugher-in-law who absolutely loves it!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fill, easy to clean, and really quiet.  </li>
            <li>It may be fine for someone who just wants to scent their air, but not for the benefits I thought it wiuld give me.</li>
            <li>For my downstairs open kitchen/dining/living room concept this device easily spreads a nice smell throughout the whole downstairs area.</li>
            <li>It is fine, but I wish I would have paid a little bit more for a better diffuser.</li>
            <li>It is like having a pure chemical free candle that infuses the room with whatever scent you choose.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little diffuser.</li>
            <li>then this is a great little diffuser when it works.</li>
            <li>This is a great little diffuser.</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser, works well.</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser for my bedroom.</li>
            <li>Great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Great little diffuser.</li>
            <li>This is a great little device.</li>
            <li>The aroma fills very large rooms quickly.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice light scent in large rooms and stronger in smaller rooms.  </li>
            <li>Worked great but shorted out a few days ago....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and it works great.</li>
            <li>Because we have had such great results we will be buying my daughter the pink one for her bedroom:)</li>
            <li>I had amazing sleep the last two nights and am using it on a Saturday to help me with a migraine.  </li>
            <li>Do sound, very quite.</li>
            <li>Works great no problems, use them everyday.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let this company take your money, go with someone that has a better reputation and actually offers returns</li>
            <li>It looks nice with the blue lit up</li>
            <li>A bigger water holder would be nice though since I have to fill it about every 4 hours of use.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these on July 2013 but rarely used it.</li>
            <li>You can turn the light on the top on or off, but the blue glow around the power button will not turn off.</li>
            <li>Makes the home smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>Some diffusers change colors, but this one one is lit with an interior LED light, which only lights up the top of the diffuser</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about this product - I bought it because of the simple design and good reviews.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I loved it so much we bought another for the second floor.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the on light can&#x27;t be turned off and so gives a bright blue light in the bedroom at night - we just cover it though.</li>
            <li>device also shuts itself off when empty which is good, however when I used heavier oils (darker)</li>
            <li>I think so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it so far - I&#x27;ve had it for about a month.</li>
            <li>I swear I feel like I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Far better price than some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li>It is pretty, every guest points it out for being cool looking.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Young Living&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silent and produces a nice mist.</li>
            <li>I love that I have the option to enjoy the blue ambiance or not.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful but hold a small amount so ur always messing with it.</li>
            <li>but I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>As our elderly mother lives with us, we have days that we do not feel the room is as fresh as we would like.</li>
            <li>I have to wonder if these vapo-diffusers are really worth it.</li>
            <li>And it has a great soft and soothing blue glow.</li>
            <li>it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>The kids love the blue light it gives off &amp; I like the fact I can turn it off at night if I don&#x27;t want the ambiance</li>
            <li>loved it so much, bought a second for my daughter&#x27;s room.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and it puts out a nice amount of vapor.  </li>
            <li>However, for the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li>Been using this daily and loving it.</li>
            <li>Love that you can hit the button a second time to disable the light.</li>
            <li>The blue has a nice calming glow</li>
            <li>read on line that a diffuser of natural jasmine oil would help one sleep better.</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve been nice if it actually worked though.</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>works well and humidifies at the same time, it gives a nice atmosphere to the room as well...</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>It works great so far (we only started using it today).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased that these have worked so well in the long run.</li>
            <li>I used it often for three months and really liked it, so I ordered a second one for another room.   </li>
            <li>2 drops of your favorite essential oil is all it takes to have a light mist to freshen the air.  </li>
            <li>They work great with Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised though the blue light doesn&#x27;t turn off my more.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and it is excellent!</li>
            <li>I like the auto shut off feature, and the fact that you can turn the top blue light off by clicking the power button again.  </li>
            <li>I Am Using The doTERRA Essential Oils, And Am Loving The Benefits ...</li>
            <li>It is worth it to buy a quality diffuser.</li>
            <li>Diffuses a really nice amount of essential oil aroma into your space.</li>
            <li>I have a much more expensive diffuser in addition to this one and this one is absolutely incredible.</li>
            <li>Her room smells so good, and I think the nightlight effect and gentle bubbling sounds are definitely helping.</li>
            <li>I like my young living diffuser much more.</li>
            <li>Love it so much, I have ordered several as gifts for family members :)</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I purchased one for both the fresh smell and sense of calmness in my house.</li>
            <li>I rarely by things on Amazon</li>
            <li>it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>We loved it so much I bought another one about 6 months later for our bedroom.</li>
            <li>I love that it can run with the light on, the light off, and it shuts off automatically when the water runs dry!!</li>
            <li>The light is too bright to put right next to your head while you sleep if you are like me and enjoy total darkness.</li>
            <li>Good for small room, easy to assemble and operate.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.. and the blue light is a soothing color!!</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t the light, and it also shuts off on its own when the reservoir is empty!</li>
            <li>A great little diffuser that really puts out a strong steady mist!  </li>
            <li>The only good news here is that the repair part immediately got my diffuser working just like new!</li>
            <li>It works great, looks so pretty with the blue light and the mist flowing out softly, quietly.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s a very attractive unit, u can really smell the essential oils put in it, &amp; very quiet.</li>
            <li>but so far customer service has been quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I think the only thing I would&#x27;ve done differently is clean it out better ever couple of days.</li>
            <li>So far,I can&#x27;t tell it does anything other than make the room smell good.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good diffuser.</li>
            <li>I use my diffuser all day long, I am in love with it!</li>
            <li>It is fascinating to watch (at least the cats think so) and the fact that it happens immediately is pretty magical too.  </li>
            <li>Some days it&#x27;s good and other days</li>
            <li>I also had purchased other brands of diffusers and they often stop working fairly soon after getting them.  </li>
            <li>first of I was very excited since I love the smell of the vitamin store and an very relaxed after shipping, so I picked up a healing essential oil</li>
            <li>highly recommend this diffuser and will probably buy another one for my mom because she loves it so much &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Without the blue light, I&#x27;d have been slightly less impressed since it really sets a relaxing mood at night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s emits just the right amount of moisture, &amp;</li>
            <li>I returned to Amazon to return to the seller right away.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have thrown out the box right way</li>
            <li>It sits right by my computer.</li>
            <li>So I posted a question to them about my diffuser and what I can do to get it to work right</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, it wouldn&#x27;t even power on.  </li>
            <li>Diffuses just the right amount and does not leave the desk with any moisture.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box it would stay on about 10 mins &amp; shut off.</li>
            <li>I used it right away.</li>
            <li>/sit right on of the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I might not be using it right.</li>
            <li>Never worked right.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and it was taken care of right away without a problem.</li>
            <li>Item did not even work properly right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Using it in a bedroom right now.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, great price, love the blue light and it diffuses the essential oils well.</li>
            <li>This diffuser works really well at putting the aroma in the air and is really pretty when the light is on.</li>
            <li>but there was still a small bright light coming from the switch and it illuminated the room.</li>
            <li>They last around 3-4 hours and emit a beautiful blue glow.</li>
            <li>Quiet, effective, pretty.</li>
            <li>and I can have the light off if it&#x27;s in the older kid&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li>Sometimes too much oil builds up on the bottom, and I must clean it out with paper towels.  </li>
            <li>Really puts out a good quantity for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Great little diffuser for the money!</li>
            <li>Great little machine!</li>
            <li>Very easy and quiet.</li>
            <li>It had a very strong smell of orange essential oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be made with high quality parts and doesn&#x27;t appear flimsy or cheaply made</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t taken it in our basement yet to see how it works in a very large space</li>
            <li>I like the light on for an easy visual in the daytime</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and I love that it automatically shuts off when empty.  </li>
            <li>Great size for a bedroom or small office.</li>
            <li>Only issue is the blue light on the button is too bright for nighttime use.</li>
            <li>I am very disapointed because it looks really cool when it is working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works great for small spaces - bedroom, office, etc.  </li>
            <li>I realized it&#x27;s pretty powerful</li>
            <li>It seems to work best when cleaned after each use, which is not too bad since it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser and plan on ordering more to have in different rooms and to give as gifts to my adult children for their homes.  </li>
            <li>Great diffuser for the bedroom or small room.</li>
            <li>The light (I have blue) is soft and nice.  </li>
            <li>Works great in my small apartment.</li>
            <li>its pretty cool, has a blue light in it too!  </li>
            <li>There are 2 different settings on this -- one is the top is lit up and gives a soft, glowing look as the mist pours out the top.</li>
            <li>Really looks cool when it does work.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several different kinds and this is the most amazing one made.  </li>
            <li>The 3-4hr range is perfect for how long it takes for the oils (in general) to run out as far as the aroma goes.</li>
            <li>They automatically turn off when empty which is great thanks so much</li>
            <li>I own a salon &amp; want the place to smell professional, good, relaxing, &amp; welcoming, look edgy.</li>
            <li>For the price as good as other higher prices</li>
            <li>I think that when I wrote the review below, I must have gotten diffusers from a production run that was sub-par, because my later ZAQ Allay diffusers have run for many months trouble-free, the disks do not need changing as often (4-6 months between disks!), and the diffuser runs for much longer (2-3 hours instead of 30-60 minutes).</li>
            <li>Not as effective in large open spaces.</li>
            <li>It is easy to refill and the blue light sends a peaceful vibe into the room.</li>
            <li>With a little aromatic essential oils this would really be a wonderful gift item.</li>
            <li>I wish this lamp would have a little more sophisticated appearance.</li>
            <li>I wish the reservoir were a little bigger works great with Doterra!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting good pure essential oils.</li>
            <li>but I had to return the first on because it did not work right.</li>
            <li>I like the following: ease of use, ease of cleaning, glow light that is soothing with the ability to turn it off, soothing sound.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the blue light when we are watching tv with the lights</li>
            <li>This oil diffuser works quickly and cleans the air fast.  </li>
            <li>I am returning this diffuser and just waiting for the larger ones to come back into stock as they work great.</li>
            <li>We liked this so much in the downstairs guest bathroom to dispense various citrus scents when we have company that we bought another for upstairs in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>used it every night, as directed, and i loved drifting off to the slight smell of lavendar.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and has an option of lighting up the blue stem or not.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product and has met all our basic needs.</li>
            <li>This came in super fast.</li>
            <li>A second press of the button turns off the light on the cone, but the power button light still remains on.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s simple and easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>The comments about the blue light are accurate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and very effective moving my selected fragrance throughout the house.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about the  bright blue light, but discovered if I clicked on the on button again, the light would go off.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few aromatherapy diffusers and I think the whole concept is too good to be true.</li>
            <li>There are numerous good reviews on this product, so I&#x27;ll keep this short &amp; sweet.  </li>
            <li>I am currently purchaseing 3 more to put in my childrens rooms because of their allergys and just need right amout of moisture to help their sinus cavities.</li>
            <li>My other feedback is the super bright blue light.</li>
            <li>I read the previous reviews and they all seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and no mess.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser is very light weight and extremely quiet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use very much oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very modern looking.</li>
            <li>I love these misters I have a few and have given as gifts they are reasonably priced and have a light like a night light.</li>
            <li>Top comes off in two pieces and can easily be wiped down as can</li>
            <li>It is a great deal compared to other products that are near or over $100.  </li>
            <li>Could be because they aren&#x27;t using enough oil as this is more than adequate to fill the whole front of our home with scent using about 10-12 drops of oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really bright in a dark room!  </li>
            <li>we have had this product for a little over a month now and we have loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a good little diffuser.</li>
            <li>this seems to be a good one for the price, wish it would run a little longer but all in all I like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good little</li>
            <li>It does get a little splashy toward the end, but that&#x27;s just a good signal to help me remember to refill it.</li>
            <li>I received this diffuser and was so excited to use it with my new oils.  </li>
            <li>I liked this while it worked, but can&#x27;t rate it as high as I&#x27;d hoped to since it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, diffuses nicely for several hours and shuts off when it is empty.</li>
            <li>Tremendous product, we&#x27;ll probably end up purchasing a few more as well!</li>
            <li>Since this was my first diffuser ever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the first one for well over a year now</li>
            <li>We love mixing the essential oils in it and it lasts about 3 hours on a continuous mist.</li>
            <li>This is pretty, it works as advertised and price is so-so.  </li>
            <li>They work exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Way better than going around smelling &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; from all the essential oils, since I like to mix them!</li>
            <li>It was my first</li>
            <li>I use it ever day with my Essential Oils love it I have bought 3 and give them to my friends</li>
            <li>I was able to use it for maybe 3 months almost daily.</li>
            <li>This was much cooler than I anticipated!</li>
            <li>Works well and consistently.</li>
            <li>Fills the entire first floor of our house with a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>She uses it all the time and it works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I had looked at diffusers available through some of the companies like Young Living and Do Terra.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and I liked it!</li>
            <li>, I only use it 1x per week at most.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what it is supposed to while doubling as a nightlight.</li>
            <li>Definitely wakes me up :)</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t turn the light completely off.</li>
            <li>Everything in the description was exact.</li>
            <li>Love it and use it almost daily.</li>
            <li>If it would actually stay on I would have bought at least one more because when it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>If you are planning on having it cover more then you might need to purchase multiple.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser!</li>
            <li>(though it is pretty).  </li>
            <li>For one, it looks cool with the light (I got the blue version.)</li>
            <li>Quiet, doesn&#x27;t leave puddles, love it.</li>
            <li>Decent price and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t want a diffuser running this hot.</li>
            <li>About 20 min after it&#x27;s first use</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better in a much smaller space.</li>
            <li>Love starting the day with a peppermint</li>
            <li>Then I ordered another thinking that the first one was just a fluke.</li>
            <li>This was my first essential oil diffuser to use and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;ve came across essential oils</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m married to a fireman</li>
            <li>I fill it with a favorite essential oil and turn it on.</li>
            <li>have several diffusers now and they seem to just get better.</li>
            <li>There are MUCH better diffusers out there for the same amount of money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite tall and pretty to look at when lit</li>
            <li>I will probably order another at some point for better coverage of the first floor since it is pretty open.</li>
            <li>The first worked for 6 months then broke</li>
            <li>The first one worked well.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, love it!</li>
            <li>Possibly, it needed better rinsing between uses, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it turned off within 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Add 3-5 drops of your favorite essential oil to the water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to buy 1 or 2 more to place in my daughter&#x27;s rooms, especially for the winter.</li>
            <li>It worked the first day.  </li>
            <li>But hey it looks the part;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is our first diffuser gadget.</li>
            <li>This is the first diffuser I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>First time I used it (followed directions exactly)</li>
            <li>The most recent hurdle I tackled was using plug-in air fresheners.</li>
            <li>I like this much better than traditional plug in air fresheners.</li>
            <li>but I find that it sounds like a gentle stream so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, it just adds to the ambiance!  </li>
            <li>I love using it with my d≈çTERRA essential oils.</li>
            <li>I have the yellow one too, which I&#x27;ve had longer and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>of my personal favorite blends are:&lt;br /&gt;Lavender + Peppermint (before bend or to relax)&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus</li>
            <li>I wish there were an option to turn out the light completely</li>
            <li>streams forth exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it and will be ordering a second one for my bedroom.</li>
            <li>We have been trying to move away from chemicals, but really like a fresh house.</li>
            <li>and it just run and diffuse the oil pretty well.</li>
            <li>This actually happens more often than not</li>
            <li>We have used this diffuser for about a month now and really like it!</li>
            <li>It lasted almost exactly 4 months.</li>
            <li>and we love the blue glow in the evenings.</li>
            <li>We use a long list of Doterra essential oils in it and they all work great.</li>
            <li>Evidently once out of the return policy you can&#x27;t contact the seller about it just stuck with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one for two on this so hopefully their quality is higher than that.  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser and use it almost daily.</li>
            <li>Other than that, though, I love it!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This Diffuser was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Practical and pretty.</li>
            <li>The first week in February it stopped working again.</li>
            <li>so I am going to try different oils to find which ones I like most.</li>
            <li>Have recommended this to many people as I am actually using it in a  salon to help purify and freshen the air.</li>
            <li>It works well but more for smaller rooms and areas.  </li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot, but what would make it better is if it had a bigger container to hold water.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>Overall, however, I&#x27;m really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>Way better than paying for generic deodorizers like glade plug ins or something.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a defuser.  </li>
            <li>It has been reliable and consistent.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it advertised</li>
            <li>Then the first one stopped working.</li>
            <li>The second one worked just as well, but it had a brown grime in the bottom by about the seconduse, so it got rinsed after most uses to prevent any buildup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall works exactly as I hoped it would, I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if it was bigger so it could hold more water.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ve only had this item one day</li>
            <li>I love my essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>If you like essential oils, you will love the way this diffuser makes your house smell.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own when *empty* (about a couple of hours).</li>
            <li>really do like it a lot, though!</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>I think this is standard for most diffusers and keeps the product compact.</li>
            <li>When lit up the color is more red.  </li>
            <li>Steam shoots up a bit higher</li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time buying and using a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I purchased as an aroma therapy diffuser, and it does exactly what is supposed to to.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly as we want and lasts a sufficient amount of time.</li>
            <li>This was my first diffuser purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am back to buy two more.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed for my home.</li>
            <li>The second setting is just the mist, and the top portion is not lit.</li>
            <li>-- I only wish it lasted more than 4 hours at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting 3 more next pay day!</li>
            <li>We have used many different oils and they have helped us both!</li>
            <li>The first diffuser I bought wanted De-mineralized water.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase several more at Christmastime.</li>
            <li>When you put the water and oil in and turn it on it lasts for 4 - 5 hours, which I love because I can change out the scent several times a day.  </li>
            <li>My first diffuser, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually about to buy two more... 1 for the master bedroom and one for the living room.  </li>
            <li>I looked at MANY options, but ultimately, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a diffuser.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t last forever and it does shut off after 3-4 hours, but the scent lasts long after, and I think it does a great job for the price.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try different oils to see which one I like the most.</li>
            <li>5 drops of your favorite essential oil, turn it on and let it go!  </li>
            <li>Would be willing to buy again if the product lasted longer.</li>
            <li>At first, this would shut off after just an hour.  </li>
            <li>It only takes about 3 drops and water filled up to the max line or it doesn&#x27;t run the full time.  </li>
            <li>The first one quit running after a month, but the seller replaced immediately under warranty without any hassle.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly whT</li>
            <li>The first time I saw this at my daughter-in-laws house</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a diffuser.</li>
            <li>This diffuser got 5 stars for the first two months.</li>
            <li>I purchased one and loved it so purchased another despite reading some reviews that they broke after a few months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not huge but puts out a good amount which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It came with very clear instructions on how to use and clean</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s just getting into the essential oils and has been loving coming over to my house and smelling my new oils in my diffusers.&lt;br /&gt;She requested this diffuser.</li>
            <li>once it turns itself off i clean it well simply by wiping it out with a clean cloth to get excess water and oils out.</li>
            <li>Great to also put a bit of moisture back in the air as we are coming into the dry weather season.</li>
            <li>I was very excited that mine came in the blue which ironically matches my living room.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to make your house smell great without using those bad chemicals!</li>
            <li>I already have a Young Living Diffuser and although it doesn&#x27;t run as long as this one, it is better at using and spreading the oils and dispersing the fine particles into the air, I know this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty with the blue light that automatically turns on when you run it .</li>
            <li>This particular one is quiet, has a night light setting or you can use without the light, AND it automatically shuts off when it is finished.</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast, in an easy to open box, and set-up was a breeze!</li>
            <li>The scent is more contained and would likely be lost in a large room.  </li>
            <li>A larger diffuser requires more oils, even though the aroma still runs out after a certain period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I love the way this little diffuser puts out the fragrance and the optional light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room, yet it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>Would never buy any other kind.</li>
            <li>It looks so cool misting away, I get lots of WOW comments!  </li>
            <li>had one stop working and the return policy was super simple and buyer friendly.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and as new in box.</li>
            <li>I was a little scared to purchase this based on some negative reviews, but I am happy to report that I love my diffuser!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fun to use, spreads the aroma well, and everyone who comes over asks about the &amp;#34;genie lamp&amp;#34; :) I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months of almost daily use, it&#x27;s still like new......</li>
            <li>It is just the right size and the blue light is pretty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and clean and runs for about 5 hours until it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li>There is no messy wax to melt or clean up.</li>
            <li>This is good if you only want to diffuse for a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>and it actually fills the enter room of nice aroma, which I was surprised.</li>
            <li>I have bought several and  getting ready to purchase more for my business.</li>
            <li>Mine doesn&#x27;t last 3-4 hours, more like 2 hours, but it does work VERY well.</li>
            <li>It has a colorful blue LED light display.  </li>
            <li>Read many negative reviews but the overwhelming positive response was what sold it for me.  </li>
            <li>My family is super sensitive to scents!</li>
            <li>The output of mist is generous and the sound puts me right into a deep cocoon of sleep.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I initially purchased the ZAQ Dew diffuser, and then right after I purchased mine, it was no longer available.</li>
            <li>It is cute, takes up only a little room, and diffuses the oils nicely.  </li>
            <li>I would have been willing to try a straight exchange for another one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it pretty much all day every day since I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
            <li>Kept trying, even tried turning the blue light off, but it still would only stay on for 3 minutes at the most.  </li>
            <li>Great for bedrooms or other smaller rooms.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It works very well, and is pretty as well.</li>
            <li>and they are good, but the water tank is small.</li>
            <li>Nice when it worked, but not worth the risk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put this behind some decorative glass bottles and it illuminates them beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend $40 on this small unit anyway, but heard good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good for small room.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much gunk could have accumulated in six weeks, but I used a soft cloth and q-tip to clean up any openings and tried again with distilled water.  </li>
            <li>My room starting smelling fresh and clean within 5-10 min., and</li>
            <li>It also proves to be a cheaper alternative to burning candles (especially if you care about buying soy, cotton wick candles that burn clean).</li>
            <li>I don‚Äôt love the blue, which is why it‚Äôs in my bedroom and not out in my main living space.</li>
            <li>so I can have multiple oils in the appropriate spaces (sleep in our room, 4 Thieves in the main living area etc.)</li>
            <li>On top of that I call it a little humidifier cause it make that cool mist</li>
            <li>The product is a decent amount of money, but it&#x27;s less than other diffusers and works excellent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty small but delivers the scents for quite a while, and it&#x27;s super easy to use and refill!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this every night for the past week and so far it works great.</li>
            <li>easy to change out from one oil to the next if you want to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and so quiet.</li>
            <li>Easy to reach individual parts for cleaning.</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure to use Distilled water and air dry after use and you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li>I replied that I was and his response was that it only works with water soluble oils which can easily be found on the internet.</li>
            <li>The picture illustrations, accompanied by text, makes it easy enough for everyone to understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is way smaller than I was expecting and goes through the water/oil VERY quickly (sometimes under an hour).</li>
            <li>easy care and quiet</li>
            <li>I bought several of these as gifts as I have a larger model that I have been very pleased with.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is easy to use, and is quiet.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s strong enough to take care of 2 levels.</li>
            <li>seemed great at first but must have blew a short because it stops working after I had it a little over a month.....</li>
            <li>I like this diffuser, but it makes a little more noise than I care for and it seems to run out of water fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser was recommended by a friend, and it has certainly lived up to its recommendation.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly large room that I use it in and it is noticeable throughout.</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t fill a large room.</li>
            <li>Certainly a mold/mildew issue to develop if I keep using it.</li>
            <li>I use it in a large room and the aroma can be smelled all over the place.</li>
            <li>This does put out alot of smell if you use alot of oil in it or use pure scented liquid instead of mixing it with water.</li>
            <li>but sometimes certain EO linger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Essential oils are believed to effect certain glands, and are beneficial heathwise.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it now!!</li>
            <li>Set in a stable spot it is sensitive to movement because the water is very hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and blends in well, but it gives off a nice glow and soft dripping sound.  </li>
            <li>I bought this diffuser a few months ago and I love it!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, simple, efficient, and very relaxing.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly but it can easily be knocked off since there is nothing holding it onto the base.</li>
            <li>Very reliable, low maintenance and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and was surprised to see how much the smell really moves around the room from such a small object.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so tranquil having it run at night with the soft light ambiance it offers!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased various different brands of diffusers but this one was the only one I really liked because of the consistency in the mist and easy clean-up.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little diffuser.</li>
            <li>Fine mist with gentle aromatherapy infused into the air when essential oils added.  </li>
            <li>Great for a small room!!</li>
            <li>Just wish it could hold a little more and last for more than four hours</li>
            <li>We love it just wish it was a little bigger and lasted all night :) thank you</li>
            <li>I love that it takes a little water, a drop or two of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li>I purchased the blue light, very pleasing and relaxing on the eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing that a relatively small amount of water can create hours and hours of mist.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I got the blue model, and the light is very low-key and relaxing.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well helping at night with sleeping and clearing the air.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY IS QUALITY FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li>They are great with standing behind their product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>it can double as a night light.</li>
            <li>and it really worked well until yesterday (January 10, 2015).  </li>
            <li>I have had it for over 6 months now and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I like the option to have the whole diffuser lit up or not.</li>
            <li>is working very well still.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very tempted to buy myself one sometime very soon.</li>
            <li>If you press the button a second time the light goes out.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It really helps our breathing and shuts off when the water is used up.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and she can choose the scent she wants.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and appreciated by receiver.</li>
            <li>I like how much smell comes out of this thing.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it next to my bed to lightly humidify, although I have no idea if it&#x27;s working well for that</li>
            <li>You push the button once and it comes on with the light, push the same button again</li>
            <li>and it turns the light off (except the button itself which stays lit), and a third time turns the unit off.</li>
            <li>I put it in whatever room I am in at the time and really notice the difference.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I was overfilling it, putting in too much oil, using it too much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, works well.</li>
            <li>It worked really well for a month and then broke.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit does not create much steam/vapor.</li>
            <li>Fell of the shelf (thanks cat) and didn&#x27;t break, thank god.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>If you press it a second time, the light will turn off, but it will continue to diffuse.</li>
            <li>Makes my whole house smell like tea.</li>
            <li>CONs: Can be a bit noisy sometimes (we kept thinking the washer or dishwasher was running after we went to bed, but once we got used to having it, it didn&#x27;t seem to bother us as much.)      </li>
            <li>Too much money for one year.</li>
            <li>Makes the slightest bubbling noise and the light of the button stays on even after you turn off the blue.</li>
            <li>Very quality and reliable product for the price.  </li>
            <li>That means it is not putting much oil into the air.  </li>
            <li>So much for support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s calming and very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>This item works very well and is does what it advertises.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and well.</li>
            <li>different light options.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only thing is the button&#x27;s light stays on in both on modes.</li>
            <li>You push the front button once and the entire unit turns on along with the glowing light.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>However, when you turn it off, there is no lingering smell which is what I am really after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li>It comes gift ready</li>
            <li>This diffuser worked great for the first 6 weeks, but now it has stopped working altogether, and it&#x27;s apparently too late to return it.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from this company.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell much of the fragrance with this machine....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the water evaporates fast.</li>
            <li>Love the automatic shut off which seems to always be when it is empty and not before.  </li>
            <li>Really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to friends, thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This really works well.  </li>
            <li>It really boils frantically - maybe it&#x27;s a defect?</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>more than i expected.</li>
            <li>I have owned the air bubbler ones and you can scent a whole room.</li>
            <li>The water vapor, if you watch, comes out the top and just sinks, so maybe the scent goes with it.</li>
            <li>and it controls the smell really well.</li>
            <li>I read on line and it was suggested that too much oil in the water caused it to go off.  </li>
            <li>and it helps me breathe so much easier.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>This thing has really helped me sleep.  </li>
            <li>That is a real bonus since I like to leave it on when I leave my house</li>
            <li>I like it, just not a fan of the diffused air going straight up.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing to the soul..</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>only con is it a bit cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast too</li>
            <li>It was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I will NOT be recommending this product to anyone and would really like to return it and be refunded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this in my living room/kitchen area and when I have the ceiling fan on it circulates the scent to the whole area.  </li>
            <li>It runs for about 4-5 hours straight before needing a refill.</li>
            <li>Using the essential oils have the room smelling fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy it daily!</li>
            <li>Also, with being out of a diffuser for this amount of time has shown me how much I NEED my diffuser.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really all I have to say,</li>
            <li>Really like the product</li>
            <li>It was very relaxing and soothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it really depends on the oil you choose how much you should put in.</li>
            <li>They work very well.  </li>
            <li>Relaxing and reaches almost the whole house.</li>
            <li>and I find the blue light soothing.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>The second light setting works well for night time use</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser</li>
            <li>During which time, you can have the option to have the low light on or off.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll just have to buy another because my fianc√© wants to keep it in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and distributes the aroma well throughput the room.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>There is also an internal light that can turned on or off.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am putting to much oil in it.</li>
            <li>I find that I don&#x27;t want to put too much oil in at once</li>
            <li>Although if one wanted to carry the unit and plug together, you could just keep the cord attached the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hum&#x27; when running, the flow of the &#x27;steam&#x27; is relaxing, the blue light is not obnoxious-</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m finding it&#x27;s size to be very convenient-</li>
            <li>*, even when the unit is absolutely level.</li>
            <li>and the flavor filled my moderately sized room in 15 min!!!!</li>
            <li>Ready to use again.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of use, blue light just stays on even when the machine is off.</li>
            <li>Works very well in my office.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.  </li>
            <li>I love using about 3 drops of lavender to help me sleep, or 3-5 drops of peppermint, lemon, or orange to freshen a room if the dogs come in wet.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than candle oil warmers.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>, there is still a tiny light that remains, because that lets me know it&#x27;s on...and when I wake up in the night to go to the bathroom, I can tell by a glance whether it&#x27;s still on or has gone to auto shut-</li>
            <li>It is quiet &amp; you can either use it with the light or without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned I do prefer  a difissuer that propels the droplets out into the room rather than straight up like this one.</li>
            <li>It was gently used.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would run 3-4 hours straight</li>
            <li>When it came, it literally weighed ounces with the whole package</li>
            <li>It worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>im using it in my massage room, its really help</li>
            <li>I really like the Diffuser.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine got it much cheaper with a Groupon.</li>
            <li>I guess if too much oil collects in the bottom, its going to go</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>The color is calming, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Only wish the light was a bit dimmer.</li>
            <li>Really like that it shuts</li>
            <li>Very efficient.</li>
            <li>I really like them when they&#x27;re working tho.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain about this product.</li>
            <li>has a line so that you know how much water to add</li>
            <li>I like the blue light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying myself another soon, because who wants to move the diffuser all over the house.  </li>
            <li>Fast shopping</li>
            <li>It really &#x27;puts&#x27; out the oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy another very soon</li>
            <li>I like how you can use it with the blue light or without the blue light.</li>
            <li>Absolutely don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li>While you can choose to turn the light off it still glows around the on/off button and would be enough to disrupt my sleep.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The blue glowing light can be on or off.</li>
            <li>What I really like is that when the water runs out, it automatically turns itself off so we don&#x27;t have to worry about anything.</li>
            <li>we use it all the time and it really scents a medium size room</li>
            <li>It is very quite and shuts off automatically when it is out of water.</li>
            <li>Works really and</li>
            <li>Honestly, even without the light, I think it might be too intense for me to have only a few feet away.  </li>
            <li>Just a few drops of oil and the whole room smells nice.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was kind of small</li>
            <li>It distributes the oils into the air in an instant, it is very quiet and effective.  </li>
            <li>and I love the soft blue glow.</li>
            <li>The color is fascinating, the unit works instantly and it turns itself off when empty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but doesn&#x27;t give off as much scent as expected.  </li>
            <li>I have multiple diffusers and by far this is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to buy two more for gifts and my daughter saw the blue one and said she really wanted that one, so I bought her one, and the same one for my daughter in law, then I bought a second one for myself, and it worked ok for awhile,</li>
            <li>We also have a diffuser from Young Living essential oils that has worked better and held up longer.</li>
            <li>I own 2 of these along with a larger diffuser from a different company .  </li>
            <li>Very good price compare to other similar essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li>I have a very large open loft (over 1200 sqft), and I can smell the essential oils with no problem in most of the loft.  </li>
            <li>Plus the blue looks very cool in a dimly lit room!</li>
            <li>A bonus is that it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use and works great.&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the strength by placing more or less drops of essential</li>
            <li>I really like this, subtle light and the mist makes for a lovely atmosphere.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quiet (and the little noise it makes is relaxing,) and my apartment is filled with such a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that it seems like the smell is more intense when you first turn it on and then dies down quickly.</li>
            <li>I have other glass-blown diffusers that work a lot better, and for comparable price.</li>
            <li>Since, I have bought one for 3 other people and they all love it too.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this with my doterra essential oils.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was going to be, but I still love it!</li>
            <li>Will be buying more for my other bedrooms.</li>
            <li>Love the diffuser and the price was a fraction of the other companies.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive the blue one through a promotion for testing and quality purposes.</li>
            <li>The other thing that would make me like it better is if it came in a neutral color.</li>
            <li>Purchased two and works better than I expected!</li>
            <li>The other diffuser worked for 6 more months (and needed two replacement discs during that time) and then that motor died as well.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased one for a Christmas gift, then one for myself, one for a birthday gift and now this fourth one for me again.</li>
            <li>Although the other one will run on a timer, I feel like this one does more in the 3-4 hours it runs</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;tall&amp;#34; verses &amp;#34;short and wide,&amp;#34; like some other diffusers out there.</li>
            <li>love the other fact that it shuts itself off when it runs out of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quiet and makes my Young Living diffuser sound really loud.</li>
            <li>The mist fills our entire bedroom easily, but you definitely need more than one for an entire house.  </li>
            <li>It has a small footprint, very effectively diffuses essential oil throughout a large room in my home.  </li>
            <li>but I am using distilled water....that may help reduce any possible clogging or need to clean it alot</li>
            <li>I use quality DoTerra essential oils, clean between uses according to directions, and use room temperature tap water as directed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it several times, even though it&#x27;s already clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t like that the oil (which I mixed with some water) would eventually boil away, and if you were not careful, it would scald the glass piece at the top.</li>
            <li>I do clean it occasionally with rubbing alcohol as the packaging suggested and that seems to remedy the issue for a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I love more than the soft blue glow and puffy clouds of steam is knowing my family is being treated with therapeutic grade essential oils.  </li>
            <li>lasts a long time, you can use any kind of essential oil and it cleans well.  </li>
            <li>but I love this so much that I just had to break down and do it.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser so much that I had to purchase two additional for other rooms!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It even came by special messenger the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absolutely is just as strong as a candle lit oil burner minus the flames.</li>
            <li>Opened the box, reviewed the simple, easy to follow directions with my 93 year old mother.</li>
            <li>I loved the previous two I purchased, which is why I purchased a third, this one decided not to work however ;(</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small and quiet, super easy to refill and clean.  </li>
            <li>But.. I really do love how you can choose your own oils and the scent lasts for a few hours with just a few drops.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this little machine so much!!</li>
            <li>Unless you buy soy candles with a lead free wick, which are expensive, you are better off with this!  </li>
            <li>I got one at first which was taken over by my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>With that said, my friend puts it in her young daughters&#x27; room and they don&#x27;t seem to be interested in it at all.</li>
            <li>It only takes 3-5 drops of scented oil and this thing fills your room with sweet aroma.</li>
            <li>Small and compact fits nice on my desk at work.</li>
            <li>I would love to see it in the dark.</li>
            <li>The packaging looks so pretty and professional.</li>
            <li>My daughter noticed a considerable change after the first night of usage.</li>
            <li>and it has been much warmer than normal).  </li>
            <li>I just wish the top attached better to the base, it doesn&#x27;t seal at all and just sits on top</li>
            <li>Much better than burning insence and no dusty mess.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good, less expensive diffuser that would work well enough to fill a room with the wonderful aroma of essential oil.</li>
            <li>Last s a long time, and very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very frustrating that I paid good money for this product and it died so quickly.  </li>
            <li>but I almost wish it didn&#x27;t go straight up and had a little curve to the top.</li>
            <li>My new diffuser came in the mail!</li>
            <li>I ordered the blue model though there are other colors available) and I find the light adds to the calming effect of the oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased better diffusers for less money and WOULD NEVER buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Now, it easily runs for 3 hours until the reservoir is empty every time.  </li>
            <li>A diffuser that runs for a shorter period of time is better also, because you&#x27;re using less oils.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly at night because that is when I am in my room.</li>
            <li>Only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have enough money to buy more....</li>
            <li>I made sure the water wasn&#x27;t low and turned it back on.</li>
            <li>This particular diffuser was defective from the start.  </li>
            <li>Press the button once to turn on, twice to turn off the light only, and three to completely turn off the machine.</li>
            <li>The light is soft enough to use even at night and not be too distracting to sleep with</li>
            <li>This diffuser can be used with the light which creates a soft blue glow or without.  </li>
            <li>I was worried by some of the one-star reviews, especially those mentioning the ones that quick working after a week.  </li>
            <li>Soft blue light.  </li>
            <li>really do love this thing and am now considering a bigger one from the same company for my downstairs.  </li>
            <li>really do love this thing and am now considering a bigger one from the same company for my downstairs.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was the same design only would hold more water.</li>
            <li>and I wanted -- quietly diffuses essential oils into the air, refreshing my house and those in it.</li>
            <li>My kids love using it in their rooms for the essential oils benefit and the blue glow it gives off.</li>
            <li>the main reservoir.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blue light is soft and soothing.  </li>
            <li>After doing much research, I found this to be one of the most reliable brands...and one of the few that is backed by a one year warranty.</li>
            <li>I like the way it looks compared to others that I have seen that are more expensive and in many cases not as pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that it gets oily over time and if you put it close to a wall it will leave water there, so be sure to keep it away and in the middle of a table in a room.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only wish it could hold more liquid so it would run longer, but it does run for a couple of hours before the liquid and essential oils dissipate.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would love is one that can handle a larger room.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super quiet.</li>
            <li>This may not put out as much &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; as some other diffusers, but that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic little diffuser, but it doesn&#x27;t cover a very large area.</li>
            <li>Very pretty blue lights.</li>
            <li>the blue is very pretty and the water trickle</li>
            <li>Although I will say that my kids love to mess with this</li>
            <li>The blue is very pretty and soothing.</li>
            <li>With this one I don&#x27;t need to know much about them since this one works right out of the box since it&#x27;s so simple to use.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just a matter of being filled slightly too high, or</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>

            <li>After receiving one as a gift, using it daily, and being exceedingly happy with how it automatically turns off and fills an approximately 15&#x27; x 10&#x27; space with a light essential oil aroma - I bought one for my brother who also loves it.</li>

            <li>The second replacement disc got the second diffuser working just fine right away, and it DOES have instructions on the back of the package, along with an aftermarket UPC label, so I think the first one just had the directions covered up.  </li>
            <li>But as expected everything looked fine on the inside.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, and the option of light or no light is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was actually surprised at how large this diffuser was when I got it and opened the box.</li>
            <li>I really love this little gadget.</li>
            <li>This little guy is OK.</li>
            <li>and then a little lavender is a lovely for ending the day.</li>
            <li>Love this little thing.</li>
            <li>But other then that it works well and is cool to look at!  </li>
            <li>Wish it would disburse they oil scent a little more evenly.</li>
            <li>Replacement piece fixed the diffuser!!  </li>
            <li>love the quality of this little diffuser</li>
            <li>I love this little thing.</li>
            <li>and it worked a little better but would still shut off before it ran out of water, so</li>
            <li>It seems maybe a little more of a mist, than a diffuser.</li>
            <li>Their advice was to clean it and let it dry before using again.</li>
            <li>I also use it in our bedrooms at night if someone is ill, great was to help deliver therapeutic scents like eucalyptus to the sinuses.</li>
            <li>Some of these diffusers get really expensive and this is a great value.</li>
            <li>Spend a few dollars more and get the Doterra Lotus diffuser if you want four hours of quality diffusing.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s still on or it&#x27;s out of water, but turn the light off at night to keep the room dark (dark rooms are better for quality sleep).  </li>
            <li>so simple and so powerful---</li>
            <li>Fun to watch and working well with occasional use.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>(I have a few friends that have it and LOVE it)</li>
            <li>I add more than a few drops because I like stronger smells.  </li>
            <li>however, if i reeeeally want to use citrus, i have a normal electric and a candle burner for oils i can use.</li>
            <li>you need to do is apply a few drops of the oil you want and you will be able to smell it as the diffuser gives off mist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been really useful with the proper oils, even for therapeutic uses.</li>
            <li>I have used three different types of essential oils diffusers, and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was not only mesmerizing to look at</li>
            <li>I love this product for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser and use it just about everyday while I sleep.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser however it is pretty small, but does the job!</li>
            <li>I made sure no water got in the vent, turned upside down and left 2 days in warm dry weather (I live in Southern California</li>
            <li>My entire master bedroom and bath smelled amazing in less than an hour</li>
            <li>Its so easy to use and has been non stop diffusing for the last several days since it arrived.</li>
            <li>Liked the way it worked, but only worked for less than four months.  </li>
            <li>We love it so much we&#x27;re buying a second one for the other part of the house.</li>
            <li>I gave this 3 stars because the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to travel meaning you have to literally be right next to it to appreciate the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that it emits just the right amount of humidity</li>
            <li>There are lots of great things about the diffuser including that it can (1) free a home of candle or other artificial (and possibly toxic) methods to bring aromatherapy into your space, (2) offer novelty seekers a huge variety of aromas (each use of this device lasts about 3-4 hours) without having to clutter a home with individual candles or plug-ins (3) be a pretty accent to a room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its smaller and lasts around 2-3 hours before its empty which is totally fine by me!</li>
            <li>bedtime I moved it next to my bed and the soft blue glow of light really gave it a relaxing ambiance.  </li>
            <li>I just put it on the other side of my lamp to block out some of the light.</li>
            <li>Waste of money received better results when I  put essential oils in hot water.</li>
            <li>I need a new part</li>
            <li>Now when I move to new house</li>
            <li>but after that just like new.</li>
            <li>I returned it and am reluctant to try a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months and it still works like new.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t hear soon I will be returning to Amazon and finding something new.</li>
            <li>The manufacturing company emailed me and said I must have a faulty disc in the bottom and they&#x27;re sending me a new one.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope the new disc will solve all the problems.</li>
            <li>They promptly sent me a new one, with no hassle.</li>
            <li>but then when you do it works like new.  </li>
            <li>- Plan to buy a new one when the discs are no longer are the problem.  </li>
            <li>Assuming you pay $30 for this, that&#x27;s $75 a year for new diffusers and discs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to aromatherapy</li>
            <li>This unit is easy to fill and scents about half the house.</li>
            <li>but as soon as its empty it shuts off and I am back to refilling :).</li>
            <li>and she should clean it out and dry completely.</li>
            <li>You can have the option of the blue light on or off but the on/off switch stays blue.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>It was really easy to use, fill using filtered water to the full line, add 3 to 5 drops of essential oil, put the lid back on, hit the button, and wala, room fills with a fresh scent in only 1 minute for small rooms, 3 to 5 minutes for large rooms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter is very sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>My wife is very much into essential oils and their therapeutic properties</li>
            <li>I have an aroma ace diffuser and it is very loud, so</li>
            <li>and they seem to be fine so far, so perhaps mine must be defective, although it seems several others are having the same problem, so</li>
            <li>I am new to using essential oils and found that warmers just seem to make the oils too hot and the oils smell burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really make the whole house much less the whole room smell as much as i had hoped.</li>
            <li>Pretty LED blue color.</li>
            <li>The light does turn off, if you prefer it dark.</li>
            <li>Although I love the mist and it&#x27;s aroma, again the aroma could be stronger and I am not sure if the mist will discolor or ruin any surface I have played it on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the first presents I&#x27;ve bought for her that she actually likes.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase more for other rooms, but for that reason alone I will probably try a different one.</li>
            <li>It completely died out on me today!  </li>
            <li>I thoroughly examined all the components and the only logical conclusion</li>
            <li>so I am sure my experience was not the usual</li>
            <li>This is my first diffusser and I was reluctant to purchase because the reviews were mixed</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely manner which I was pleased with because I was anxious.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a simple diffuser that works very well!</li>
            <li>However, after the first day, it would short out after 1 minute of operation.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is quiet,(a soft bubbling sound can be heard when the room is quiet), very simple to use, and diffuses the aromas well.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser but will not be my last.</li>
            <li>I returned the first litemist I purchased to Amazon for shutting of after only 5 or 10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>I filled it and went to turn it on the other night and its completely shot ...</li>
            <li>Well, sure enough one of the two no longer works after only 2 months of use (and only used about a dozen times).  </li>
            <li>but for the cost I think it&#x27;s a pretty solid purchase.</li>
            <li>for a small area, wish i held more liquid.....</li>
            <li>Because of this gift, we are now regular haunts at the local healthy store&#x27;s essential oil aisle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/therapeutic properties of essential oils, there are other products out there that are better suited for the task.  </li>
            <li>Got the first as a present for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, quiet, hassle-free.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly so far!</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s probably a touch smaller than you are expecting, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a nightlight that shines a pretty blue )</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my daughter&#x27;s second grade teacher.</li>
            <li>DO NOT waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li>Even after several months it still feels nurturing and special when I crawl into bed, breathe deeply, and let the cares of the day melt away.</li>
            <li>but I had to constantly add water so that the tempreture wouldn&#x27;t get too hot and boil the oils causing a huge mess on my walls and table.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to fill and lasts a few hrs on each filling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions were ridiculously easy to follow, just a few steps.</li>
            <li>I got the blue one and love the color it lets out in the dark.</li>
            <li>Then it started only running for a short time and turning off, even though it was still full.  </li>
            <li>The other unit offers a better array of lights and operation ‚îÄ 3 modes (i.e. rotate color, fixed color, low-light), and there is only one piece or &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; to remove when you add oil.  </li>
            <li>The vapor only seems to go about 6&amp;#34; above the unit, then falls towards the table, so I&#x27;m not sure that it gets the oil into the air as good as it could.</li>
            <li>ZAQ Allay Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser - 80 ML Capacity, Blue  Package arrived quickly and</li>
            <li>There is only one on/off button which makes the diffuser super simple to operate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, super simple to use and works like a dream.</li>
            <li>And like some other reviewers have stated, I too had the issue where it would turn off early sometimes when it was still full.</li>
            <li>have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t put out enough scent for a large room, but I have not found that to be the case.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I miss is there is no timer to set for a certain amount of time like the Doterra diffuser</li>
            <li>Fills a large master bedroom with therapeutic essential oil aromas in seconds!</li>
            <li>The aroma from the essential oils covers a large area.</li>
            <li>Goodbye large humidifiers with filters that only use distilled water.</li>
            <li>I use 100% pure essential oils with it, and I have always used the recommended amount of drops in it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic little diffuser.</li>
            <li>This little diffuser is fantastic for the price and helped my wife while she was in labor.</li>
            <li>I love this little glowing essential oils diffuser!  </li>
            <li>This little diffuser is quiet, and it works alot better then the young living diffuser that my MIL has.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I would love it a little more if it stayed on at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Also great when you have a cold.</li>
            <li>Maybe this would work great in a small apartment of a small room in the house.</li>
            <li>Fill the water tank up to max level line (this line is clearly defined in the instruction</li>
            <li>The power button cycles through &amp;#34;on, light off, off&amp;#34;.  Simple, but works as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the area covered is what I hoped it to be, but for a small space I believe it would work great.</li>
            <li>I just got it and like it so far.  </li>
            <li>Also, while it doesn&#x27;t use much water (maybe about 2 tablespoons), it seems to run for several hours.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s about how far the aromatics will travel.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>It works all night in the background, has an automatic shutoff when it empties, and is ready to go again the next day.</li>
            <li>It spreads pretty well, and it doesn&#x27;t take too long to make the room smell like the oil.</li>
            <li>I like that you can turn of the led, wish the power led would dim as well.</li>
            <li>I really like it but wish I would have bought a bigger one.</li>
            <li>I use 6 days a week once per day, after 2 years the motor is dying (loud gurgly noises)</li>
            <li>but nothing ever fixed it.</li>
            <li>I also bought one in January, not even a month old</li>
            <li>I keep a piece of heavy paper on my nightstand, with one side folded up to cover the light, and it seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li>It really pumps out the essential oils and runs until the water is gone.</li>
            <li>It is not used frequently.  </li>
            <li>so much so bought a second one.</li>
            <li>I read many negative reviews regarding this product, but I bought it anyway.  </li>
            <li>away from this product until the defect is fixed.</li>
            <li>I preferred my old diffuser with timer and twist on cover</li>
            <li>Two weeks ago it ran all night long, smelling hot and toxic by morning.</li>
            <li>It was, and is malfunctioning, and could be a real safety hazard, starting a fire, or melting the components of the device, running without water in it.</li>
            <li>It does not get all clogged up like the Young Living Diffusers.  </li>
            <li>far I have used this diffuser in our bedroom, kitchen and living room.</li>
            <li>So far I like the product.</li>
            <li>But the blue glows very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has the option of light or no light.  </li>
            <li>My 4 yr old would ask for me to turn it on on days</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had it now for about 8 months and use it frequently.  </li>
            <li>Gave my diffuser from Young Living to my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Young Living has been out of Diffusers for months.  </li>
            <li>Tried to contact Zaq.com directly to see what they would say</li>
            <li>I have been using this product frequently for almost a year</li>
            <li>It has really increased my interest in essential oils and their healing/emotional qualities.  </li>
            <li>I got it and then not functional at all very soon at the 2nd week.</li>
            <li>one for home and one for my friends house where I frequent.</li>
            <li>I really really like the Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser!</li>
            <li>but it was just too loud.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll ask her how much to use of the essential oil.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy at least 3 more and give them as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing and quiet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely defective.  </li>
            <li>I  pushes out way  too much  of the  essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li>My 11 year old likes it</li>
            <li>I really wish it was bigger</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to noise and it gurgles, to me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does make some sounds, they just sound like gurgling water, but I find them soothing after I have gotten used to them after a few nights.</li>
            <li>We use this every day and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it (purchased in March), works well with all oils we&#x27;ve used so far (Young Living, Doterra, Veriditas Botanicals).</li>
            <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li>and my 3 year old has knocked it off a couple times.</li>
            <li>and I really wouldn&#x27;t want a bigger</li>
            <li>I really appreciate how quiet this one is.</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law ordered one, and when I saw hers in action I just had to have one.</li>
            <li>When the lights are low for facials it looks really soothing as well.</li>
            <li>but I only seem to need the 4 hours, so is it really a drawback?</li>
            <li>the oils keep their natural aromatherapy benefits when diffusing.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>If they fixed this defect from the factory, I would consider buying another one.</li>
            <li>I have been using it nightly in my five year old daughter&#x27;s room with Plant Therapy oils</li>
            <li>I set it on a low table in my room next to my bed and the blue light doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I bought two and so far</li>
            <li>Then I completely broke and I&#x27;m contacting the company now.</li>
            <li>I recently developed interest in aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>When I got this I filled the bottom part with water as instructed and added a few drops of frankincense oil and turned it on.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it doesn‚Äôt take much time to make it work and it lasts for up to 4 hours of constant use.</li>
            <li>Essential Oils can really change your mood.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hear it humming like the diffuser I have from Young Living.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My 9 year old son asked for one for Christmas, to put in his room.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very affordable diffuser.</li>
            <li>Works well so far.  </li>
            <li>Then you drop in a few drops of your choice of oils, replace the cones on top, and plug the unit back into the cord.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful enough to fill a standard bedroom with the aromatherapy oil I use for my kiddos.  </li>
            <li>Love it just what I wanted Used it everyday all winter with essential oil to keep flu away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small,you can smell it only when you sitting right next to it,  tried different kinds oils,</li>
            <li>Smells great, looks cool, and is less expensive than similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>this little diffuser works amazingly well AND turns itself off when it&#x27;s empty!</li>
            <li>We also appreciated that we could use a variety of essential oils, such as lavender for a calming feeling, or any other of the many and variety of essential</li>
            <li>Worked well for the first few days, after that the aroma of my oils would die down pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Diffuses oils nicely, easy to use and small.</li>
            <li>it turned itself off while the water basin was still half full.  </li>
            <li>After about a month of use, the diffuser now stops when the reservoir is over half full.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like strong scents and have a small room, it would work.</li>
            <li>Too bright, and I think this diffuser is not strong enough compare to other product that i purchased, i guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean it out thinking it was clogged - and while it helped a little it still has lost it&#x27;s strength.</li>
            <li>But eventually the oil stains the inside so bad that no amount of cleaning with alcohol is going to get it clean, kind of like how coffee stains your plastic insulated coffee mugs</li>
            <li>No mess.  </li>
            <li>If you only use a few drops of oil with a full tank of water it doesn&#x27;t put out much scent at all.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and I would compare it to some of the more expensive diffusers.</li>
            <li>It is almost ridiculous how much we love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I like the slight gurgly sound from the water when it runs (you can hear it in a quiet room, but I don&#x27;t find it to be intrusively loud).</li>
            <li>I was busy with work and didn&#x27;t have time to research to see if this was normal until recently</li>
            <li>My older children have asked for one to keep in their rooms at night to double as a nightlight.</li>
            <li>I love this difusser, small enough to take with us on vacation.</li>
            <li>The first time used, it only lasted several minutes.  </li>
            <li>and I can smell it pretty strongly on my entire 2nd floor (2 bedrooms, a hall and a bath)</li>
            <li>This was the second diffuser I ordered since the first one didn&#x27;t work( different brand).</li>
            <li>one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied is that there is still a small puddle at the bottom of the bowl when it&#x27;s *</li>
            <li>Quiet and with a calming blue color, this diffuser is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Last about 5 hours steadily.  </li>
            <li>My main reason for purchasing was to add essential oils to help with congestion while I slept.  </li>
            <li>I also don‚Äôt like the smell of commercial air freshener, they always have this chemically smell, never fresh or light.</li>
            <li>Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil diffuser is of decent size-80 ml.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for use with essential oils.</li>
            <li>We use this item daily and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this diffuser and I will definitely be using mine</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than other diffusers, we love it, I have it running all day long, usually take 2 refills for the whole day of diffusing.</li>
            <li>Very easy to fill and use; simply remove the colored cover, and a small plastic framing piece, pour water and scent to the line, place covers back on and hit the power</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very powerful little guy!</li>
            <li>But when I filled it with water and oil it only ran for about half an hour before it shut off.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item September 2nd, 2013 based on several positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s diffuses the oil very well and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>However, the power button is always lit with a small LED light if it is on.  </li>
            <li>They stay on for several hours and put out plenty of mist for a normal sized bedroom.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It shuts off with a full tank of water every few minutes.</li>
            <li>They produce a heavy stream of cool mist.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get my diffuser in the mail but that quickly turned to disappointment.</li>
            <li>Perfectly adequate little diffuser.</li>
            <li>I learned that there are many chemicals in such items that should be avoided, and so I started searching for more natural ways to freshen the air of my apartment, especially in the winter months when it&#x27;s too cold for me to open</li>
            <li>/&gt;While certain candles may fill a larger space with aroma, this seems to work in the area that I currently have it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this diffuser along with the 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Basic Sampler Essential Oil Gift Set.</li>
            <li>I use this in a large, open 20x20 room and have no problem with smelling the essential oil anywhere in the room.</li>
            <li>It was fun while it lasted, but it didn&#x27;t last near long enough.  </li>
            <li>I would guess that in large spaces or with high ceilings, this device would be less effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have spent more on other diffusers and had the same result as this one.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and the company that makes them and Amazon had me send it back and overnighted me a new one.</li>
            <li>My neighbors are smokers (live in a condo) and running this w essential oil helps me from jumping out the window.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to essential oils and diffusing but with the doterra oils it does the trick!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using essential oils</li>
            <li>Built very sturdy and a breeze to wipe dry and refill</li>
            <li>I have been using it regularly for several months and it still works really well.</li>
            <li>I got the blue, but I really wish it came in just white</li>
            <li>For scents that are more delicate, like lavender, it will smell the entire room but the scent goes away as soon as it is no longer diffusing.</li>
            <li>I have several diffusers and I have to say this one is by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>I just want to say after a couple hours you will need to put another 5 drops in for essential oils, even though it&#x27;s still half full.</li>
            <li>The main problem I had with this product is the fact that it does not stay on long before turning off automatically.  </li>
            <li>really enjoyed the lamp while it lasted although it would only hold a very small amount of water.</li>
            <li>such simple remedies have such a positive effect.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I was lax on cleaning it, but overall I tried to remember to clean it after a few uses.</li>
            <li>It only takes a drop or two of essential oil added to the water and it creates a steady mist.</li>
            <li>This was a decent enough diffuser except for the fact that it only lasted for 1-2.5 hours instead of 3-4.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cut short on me a couple times while there is still water left over, however, I think it was the particular oil I had been using (not water-soluble).</li>
            <li>It works pretty decent for my small apartment.</li>
            <li>Have had this little diffuser for 2 months, use it almost daily, and enjoy it immensely.  </li>
            <li>This model is able to handle our master bedroom with ease and distributes the oil&#x27;s scent just a little ways down the hall.</li>
            <li>We agree with the other positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li>It generally goes about three hours before shutting off.</li>
            <li>Save your money avoid this company in general.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally leave reviews.</li>
            <li>The water container inside is a bit small, so it only runs for an hour or so before turning off and needs to be filled up.</li>
            <li>The steam lasts for about 3 hours when fully filled, and I usually put 5 drops of my choice of essential oils (3-5 drops is recommended).</li>
            <li>Under the blue cone there is another clear plastic cone.</li>
            <li>It Uses ultrasonic waves to work with water and natural essential oil in the tank, spray mist for aromatherapy, humidifying, purifying for your home,office,Car .</li>
            <li>Press a third time, and the diffuser will turn completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that once it is empty it automatically turns off.</li>
            <li>I like how the entire unit will shut off completely when its done.</li>
            <li>So naturally I bought a 2nd 1</li>
            <li>I have Young Living Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>ZAQ apparently has a quality assurance issue.  </li>
            <li>I nearly had a heart attack at the price I paid for it, especially concerning</li>
            <li>Use it for my Young Living Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>Delivering whatever blends of natural oils I choose into the air it not only doesn&#x27;t upset my asthma but soothes my body and mind.</li>
            <li>Really like the auto shutoff when empty too.</li>
            <li>Try it using Thieves essential oil from Young Living..</li>
            <li>Longest lasting diffuser I&#x27;ve had so far...</li>
            <li>I am now busy compiling an arsenal of every essential oil known to man....</li>
            <li>You can buy one jar of essential oil and it will last MUCH longer than any candle since a 3-4 hour cycle in the diffusser uses only 5 drops.</li>
            <li>Well, apparently I didn&#x27;t read everything well because I didn&#x27;t realize this was a water/oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li>One stopped all together in December, the second makes a loud buzzing noise and I don&#x27;t trust it to stay in my kids room.  </li>
            <li>My 14 yr old recently began having insomnia.</li>
            <li>Rather than send it back, I contacted Bombay Electronics site directly.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I miss is that my first diffuser would alternate with 4-5 different colors and this one only glows with one color.  </li>
            <li>water reservoir holds about a small dixie cup full of water.</li>
            <li>Afterwards I found with a thin wisp of vapor curling out of the elegantly arched neck.  </li>
            <li>: I ordered two more and one is already broken after using it for four weeks.</li>
            <li>I would prefer it to be able to run intermittently and emit a little less moisture.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that when I am diffusing oils (and they are not cheap oils) it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how many drops I use, nobody can smell them unless you are standing right next to the machine.</li>
            <li>diffuser has no intermittent function (which, as it turns out, I really like on my other diffuser) and it emits quite a large amount of mist, making whatever surface it&#x27;s sitting on wet if run continuously!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really only need a few drops of oil to fill a large room (large by my big city living standards!)</li>
            <li>I immediately sent it back, got a new one and it too only stayed on for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously considering purchasing another diffuser in the future, even though this is so easy to take room to room (have to save up a little first!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously considering purchasing another diffuser in the future, even though this is so easy to take room to room (have to save up a little first!)</li>
            <li>Add some water and a few drops of essential oil and the scent quickly fills the room.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many that were too weak and did not give off enough scent.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t exactly timed the exact amount of time but it holds such a small amount of water it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would go for as long as it does.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser, but I wish it lasted longer than 4 hours other than that I would</li>
            <li>My other diffuser from another company really fills up the room with scent and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I really hope that the other 2 that I bought as gifts continue to work.</li>
            <li>After several trips to the Dr. and allergy specialist for other bizarre and unexplainable symptoms we have found she suffers from many types of allergies and that insomnia is one of the effects on her body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different essential oils and live in a very open concept.  </li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is the brightness of the blue light.</li>
            <li>It also only has one color (as opposed to various) and the 2 led&#x27;s clearly show through the plastic.  </li>
            <li>So far, 2 out of the 3 have stopped working suddenly even after proper cleaning.   </li>
            <li>We have the blue and the yellow one, my 5 year old loves having one in her bedroom.</li>
            <li>This only runs for about 3 hours when completely full, which usually does the job</li>
            <li>I use distilled water and quality YL essential oils, usually 3 drops in a full reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently</li>
            <li>This little thing really works!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this not only for it&#x27;s calming therapy, but the warmth it adds to the dry winter air.</li>
            <li>The only draw back is that it doesn&#x27;t hold much water, therefore does not last long.</li>
            <li>You just fill it to the line with tap water, add a few drops of essential oil, and it starts right up every time.</li>
            <li>Releases just the right amount of scent which you choose be adding a few drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, we love this little thing - a few drops of essential oils and some water and</li>
            <li>I have had that problem and am probably guilty of using a few extra drops because we are all suffering from colds and allergies this week, so I will need to clean it out and resist the temptation to add more than I should in the future.</li>
            <li>Worked well when I first got it but only had it less than a month before it stopped misting.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed in that, though it was no fault of the seller, but my mom was happy about it, because she uses it in their room, and she is deaf, so the color changing probably would have made her wake up.</li>
            <li>so you can see it in the dark, all you really need.</li>
            <li>-- apparently, you have only 30 days to return this item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now March and only one barely works.  </li>
            <li>Button to adjust the amount of fog,the small one works for essential oils,the big one for cool Mist Humidifier .</li>
            <li>I wish it held more water, and the blue light on the on/off switch is annoying, but I just block it.</li>
            <li>size and design are functional and useful for small areas.</li>
            <li>We had it working within the first few minutes</li>
            <li>You can smell them the first few min</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t timed it, but when it&#x27;s full of water, I would estimate that it lasts at least 6 hours or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard not to get mad when an item that had worked perfectly for 2 1/2 months just suddenly stops working 2 min after turning it on.</li>
            <li>i tried all of the potential solutions in the Q &amp; A, and not a single one worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just the right size for my small apartment.</li>
            <li>I like the diffuser, it is easy to use; however I don&#x27;t care for the water gurgle that it makes - sounds like a dog licking its paws...sort of irritating.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth trying to purchase a replacement kit for the ceramic piece or not--probably order another, of a different brand--because 3 months just isn&#x27;t going to cut it for me!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quite and takes up little space.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser does not hold much water so it doesn&#x27;t last a long time between refills, but other than that</li>
            <li>After comparing several oil diffusers online and reading blog recommendations/reviews this is one of the less expensive oil diffuser I&#x27;ve found that work just as good as the more expensive ones (per reviews I&#x27;ve read).</li>
            <li>Amazon took it back and shipped a  new difuser.i should have heeded the warnings from the other reviews.  </li>

            <li> So, if you want something that provides longer term scent for a space, this is not the best option (unless you like filling it up once an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it works and has a nice shape.</li>

            <li> So easy and works great.</li>
            <li> Inasmuch as I really liked this diffuser, it had a wonderful stream, and was nice looking, and even the company was willing to help when the diffuser kept shutting off from day one.  </li>
            <li> Perfect size and design - not too large or obnoxious.  </li>
            <li> It works great as a night light</li>
            <li> This diffuser is amazing.</li>
            <li> Out of the box this thing works amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an oil diffuser before but this is amazing.</li>
            <li> I use Eternal Essence oils in it and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Frankincense, myrrh and lavender at bedtime was amazing.  </li>

            <li> Looks nice too.</li>
            <li> but still it looks nice with my decor.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone</li>
            <li> comments on how nice it is when they see it.</li>

            <li> We liked this one</li>
            <li> I just smiled.. and immediately wanted to write my review.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> So I am going to try another kind.</li>
            <li> and she liked it</li>
            <li> I have been putting peppermint oil into the water and it makes the whole house smell great!</li>
            <li> Checked the steam coming out and it too seemed warm.</li>
            <li> It was nice but stopped working after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> it turns off on its own when it runs out of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would be nice if this could run on battery</li>
            <li> I bought a massage table, oil, music, a scented aromatherapy oil set and this mist machine and set up my own at home spa.</li>
            <li> I own three.</li>
            <li> i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> room but after leaving it on all day today, it was nice to have an aroma throughout the house just from one difusser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> buy.&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;I will always be honest in my reviews.</li>
            <li> So happy with my purchase, and I love the color as well :)</li>
            <li> When they were working, I liked them.</li>
            <li> It is, however, perfect for providing a gentle, relaxing send-off when placed on my nightstand.</li>
            <li> I own one</li>
            <li> Honestly, I could not be happier with the ZAQ</li>
            <li> Shuts off on its own when water runs out.</li>
            <li> Lights are a nice feature.</li>
            <li> One for calming and one for the nice fall scent.  </li>
            <li> We use it with Four Thieves oil most often, and it makes the room smell really good.</li>
            <li> Puts out a nice amount of mist.</li>
            <li> nice compact size, works well, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it not working.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser.</li>
            <li> It has a nice design</li>
            <li> and it makes my whole downstairs smell awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a nice alternative to scented</li>
            <li> This diffuser emits a nice stream of mist for about 4 hours before it shuts itself off.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is quite nice, when it works.</li>
            <li> I now own three of these.</li>
            <li> is nice in bedroom, pine and/or lemongrass</li>
            <li> They shut off on their own.</li>
            <li> I now own 3.</li>
            <li> If it stays this good for more than a year (which is what the warranty covers)</li>
            <li> Adds a nice smelling moisture to the air at night.  </li>
            <li> Cute design, good price.</li>
            <li> I did receive my unit at promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Nice that you have the option to keep it lit up or not.</li>
            <li> Loving this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have used it for hours straight and still working great!</li>
            <li> and I was looking to get one since I liked the way it smelled.</li>
            <li> It stopped working for me, I changed the disc and made sure it was cleaned out good</li>
            <li> I know it seems like it&#x27;d be nice to have a product that runs for a longer period of time - but</li>
            <li> cost effective.</li>
            <li> Good Quality love that it turns off by itself when water is gone.</li>
            <li> We own two</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now got all my friends using (and loving) one too.</li>
            <li> they are always loved :)</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> so it kind of makes me nervous since it can be damaging to knock it over and let water get into the mechanism.  </li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law had one of these and my husband even commented on the nice fragrance the house had.</li>
            <li> I was sooooo excited!!</li>

            <li> I love that it has aromatherapy benefits to diffuse certain oils, plus it makes everything smell great!</li>
            <li> Diffuses great and love the option for the light to be on or off.</li>

            <li> pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It creates steam as soon as I turn it on and the oil I put in smells very strong.</li>
            <li> It disassembles very easily, you fill the water chamber with water and 3-5 drops of the oil of your choice, plug it in, turn it on, and let it go.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>

            <li> Watching the steam coming out of the top of it is nice and calming.</li>
            <li> You can choose to have the nitelite on or off, but even with the light off, the button glows so brightly it keeps me awake.</li>

            <li> The mist stays going for many hours, and scents the room nicely.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m pleased that the diffuser is working again, that it looks nice, and that it does what it says it should -- when it&#x27;s working.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s perfect as far as timing goes.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want that bright light in your room at night.</li>
            <li> Just my own theory.  :-)</li>

            <li> The beautiful Aqua color is very soothing to my mind, body and soul.  </li>
            <li> Worked great at first.</li>
            <li> but the packaging is great and the product looks exactly like it was represented.</li>
            <li> For the first hour of use it puts out a great amount-</li>
            <li> They are beautiful when they are lit up and the pricing was reasonable and I recieved the product in 2 days!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great at first.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> This is our first difuser, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it seems to work great.</li>
            <li> I bought this just barely over 30 days ago and loved it!!!  </li>
            <li> Seemed great for the first two days then died.</li>

            <li> It has been a year or more, and this diffuser is still going strong!</li>
            <li> I believe using distilled water is very important.  </li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use and so cool and pretty!!!</li>
            <li> The lighting is also quite nice and pretty bright.</li>

            <li> It worked very nicely, the design and style was attractive and the light was nice; however, I had to refill it several times throughout the night.  </li>
            <li> It gets very warm, to the point of hot when it runs.  </li>
            <li> I especially love the light feature - very cool looking on  top of being very functional.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems yet, and very easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Loved it while it worked, but not so much any more!</li>

            <li> Love it .</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I waited.  </li>
            <li> I bought the ZAQ Allay because the price was more affordable.  </li>
            <li> The slightest bump will knock the top off.</li>
            <li> I have waited a couple of weeks for my review on this to make sure it would keep working.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use filtered water or distilled water because I am sure you would end up with a clogged diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love these diffusers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love love love.  </li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.</li>

            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> I read some where that this is the best way to diffuse essential oils and that you don&#x27;t want to heat them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> but when I need it most it&#x27;s not working correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lets off a nice steam as well as a light scent from the oil.</li>
            <li> I started getting into essential oils and this diffuser is great!  </li>

            <li> Buy it :)</li>

            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product and am considering buying another one so that I dont have to keep bringing it from room to room.</li>
            <li> The Allay has more parts than the Mirage.</li>
            <li> You can turn the glowing light on or off, which is nice for a nightlight if you want it.</li>

            <li> which is why I bought 2 more.</li>
            <li> I initially liked this diffuser because it didn&#x27;t light up the bedroom while I was using oils for sleep and relaxation, and because it would turn off automatically after about 3 hours of use.</li>
            <li> I Love the way it diffuses the oils in the air and uses the water to do so.</li>
            <li> and it cost more than this one.</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t  be more pleased with this purchase.  </li>

            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> When it did work it was ok, it did not seem to put out alot of aroma from the oils (DoTERRA brand)  </li>

            <li> I love the fact that it has an automatic shut off once the water is diffused out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for diffusing essential oils.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>

            <li> mother uses it mostly at night while she sleeps beside her bed.</li>
            <li> With that being said though, I won&#x27;t be able to use it in my bedroom as planned without some modification.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to try that and feel almost 100% sure it will work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly pleased with that</li>

            <li> Its pretty but not overly bright for their room.  </li>

            <li> Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser lets out a lot of nice mist but no condensation, which is really good.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
            <li> ; 2) runs 2 hours; 3) emits strong mist.</li>
            <li> I bought two Smiley Daisy diffusers with this one and they are still going strong, as stated.  </li>
            <li> or it will be way too strong.</li>
            <li> Bombay Electronics was very fast and courteous in honoring the 1-year warranty that these come with.</li>

            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t require any special water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the best place for mine is on my bed table right next to my side of the bed</li>

            <li> Though I love sweetly scented candles, they can sometimes make my asthma flare.</li>
            <li> This is cool because you can help your body in a better way without taking medicine.</li>
            <li> but I agree with somenof the others who dislike how bright the on/off switch is when you turn the main light off.  </li>
            <li> I generally use lemongrass pure oil which is one of the strongest and the diffuser runs flawlessly</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working fine still.  </li>
            <li> After the first one, I bought 2 more for myself and 1 more for a friend.</li>
            <li> I know that might sound funny, but it just feels nice.</li>
            <li> She said after doing that it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I can smell the oils I put in this in the air, so I guess it works fine.</li>
            <li> And although I thought I was fine with that.</li>
            <li> everything work fine, but</li>
            <li> This diffuser was fine while it lasted.</li>

            <li> they work fine.  </li>
            <li> I move mine from room to room which is fine for now.  </li>

            <li> This starts off great then becomes increasingly less effective.</li>
            <li> This product is soothing to watch light up and quickly produces a mist that rolls out of the top.</li>
            <li> easy to clean, small and compact, great for countertop or bedside, puts out a good amount of steam.</li>
            <li> Love this...set it up in my office and put oils that help keep a clear mind and be able to focus!</li>
            <li> with so many similar seeming products on the market it was easy to see why this one was so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very portable and easy to use and really does a great job diffusing oils throughout the house.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this diffuser for a little over a month now and it works great!</li>
            <li> Love the pretty lights!</li>
            <li> This little thing is one of the best diffusers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Thanks!! :)</li>
            <li> best little diffuser I have ever used.</li>
            <li> When it did work it was very quiet and had a great night light.</li>
            <li> it might make a great night light for some, but I just turn the blue part to face away from my bed.</li>
            <li> it might make a great night light for some, but I just turn the blue part to face away from my bed.</li>
            <li> Also, the fact that I can shut off the internal light within the diffuser or leave it on to relax with is a great feature.</li>
            <li> The light (even in OFF mode) is a bit too bright to sleep near, so I have to put a cloth around it.</li>
            <li> I already owned a ZAQ Mirage, which has a huge &amp;#34;footprint&amp;#34; and takes up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it has been great to diffuse my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I put it in our bedroom at night and shut the light off.</li>
            <li> I  liked it so much.  </li>
            <li> It was great while it lasted, but that was only 3 months</li>
            <li> The light broke</li>
            <li> There is a light around the power button that does not go out.</li>
            <li> Not optimal when sleeping, but it throws of virtually negligible amount of light.</li>
            <li> like that you can turn the light off if you want and just</li>
            <li> I also do not like the light.  </li>
            <li> Love my defuser  Love the fact it s***s off on its own and covers the entire room with aromatherapy</li>
            <li> I am happy its lasting well</li>
            <li> You can shut the light off.</li>
            <li> You can turn off the light or not while diffusing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can run with the colored light or run without a light.</li>

            <li> They are easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> and you can have the light on or off.</li>
            <li> the light on it is so soothing.  </li>
            <li> Great for essential oils!</li>
            <li> You can turn off the light if you want to by pressing twice.</li>
            <li> The mist coming out from the top is mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> The light would work and the water would bubble</li>
            <li> Light can be turned off while still using it.</li>
            <li> is it&#x27;s just made with cheap crappy parts from China (circuit board and power supply)...</li>
            <li> It works great when it will actually stay on.</li>
            <li> I turn off the light feature as it&#x27;s too distracting for sleep</li>
            <li> I like that you can turn off the light</li>
            <li> This thing really gets warm.</li>
            <li> Allows light on or off while diffusing.</li>
            <li> and I like that the light can be turned on or off, while the diffuser continues to run...</li>
            <li> Thank you, ZAQ.com for a great product and the very next day delivery!!</li>
            <li> I like that you can leave the light off if you don&#x27;t want it on.</li>
            <li> She likes the water chamber size, and the ability to change the color of the light.</li>
            <li> I use cheap $1tree oil</li>
            <li> and it stills makes my whole apartment smell amazing</li>
            <li> You push the button again and the glowing light shuts off but still runs.</li>
            <li> I also like that I can use it with the light on or off.</li>
            <li> I like that you can turn the color off if you just want the aroma and not the light.</li>
            <li> OVERALL: This diffuser would make a great wedding shower gift.</li>
            <li> or you can choose to turn off the light.</li>
            <li> There is option to turn the light off.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for short time diffusing.  </li>
            <li> The light can be switched off if you want by the press of a button.</li>
            <li> Affordable option for those who enjoy aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> I really liked this, while it lasted, which was a whole 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I makes gurgling sound too.  </li>
            <li> Great diffuser for essential oils!</li>
            <li> When I use this with lavendar to help my insomnia the light is a killer.</li>
            <li> You can turn the light off that shines through the funnel, but you can&#x27;t turn off the light that glows around the front button.  </li>
            <li> However, neither of my lids feel secure despite my efforts to tighten.  </li>
            <li> Overall works great.</li>
            <li> and I like that you don&#x27;t need to have the light on if you choose not to.  </li>
            <li> It does not need to warm up, a gentle mist with the chosen scent started the moment we pressed the on button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I feel comfortable running it in our bedrooms at night.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a few hours, and the best part- when the water runs out, it shuts itself off.</li>
            <li> If you press the power button once, it turns the unit on, light + steam.</li>
            <li> , it turns the unit on, light + steam.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it started shutting off before the water would run out, but I have been using it without the light on and it runs longer.</li>
            <li> Can be diffused with the light off or on.  </li>
            <li> this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I now own 3 because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I enjoy them both.</li>
            <li> Light can be turned off.  </li>
            <li> After about a month of use, we are exceptionally happy with the overall performance of this product and the vendor.  </li>
            <li> It also has an adjustable on/off light function.</li>
            <li> It filled the room with my scented oil immediately.</li>
            <li> Have had this for 9 months and it works fabulous still.</li>

            <li> I use a variety of essential oils and my room smells great.</li>
            <li> These things aren&#x27;t cheap for what they are.</li>
            <li> (I face it to the wall and cover the light with a book for now)  </li>
            <li> This one definitely does and smells great.</li>
            <li> No leaking, easy to clean...</li>
            <li> Works great, and the fact that it turns off by itself when it runs out of water is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I have bought two of these, work great with essential oils</li>
            <li> I received a free product to review.</li>
            <li> You can also decide to turn on or off the light.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> so much he&#x27;s considering spending his money to buy one of his own.</li>
            <li> I like how you can have the light on or off.</li>
            <li> It makes a great nightlight for the younger kid</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned with the light, but it is mellow and the orange is not obnoxious at all.  </li>
            <li> Three reasons I like this product:  1) light can be turned off</li>
            <li> I like that you can keep the light off.</li>
            <li> Great product overall.</li>
            <li> and I was overall happy with it.</li>
            <li> The light turns off for day use.</li>
            <li> Instead of filling it up with water, I filled it up with rubbing alcohol and let it sit for about an hour.</li>
            <li> , I enjoy it every night at bedtime.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> I like that the light can be turned on or off.</li>
            <li> There are 2 settings, one with the light on and one without if you prefer not to have the light on.</li>
            <li> I like how you can use it with or without the night light.</li>
            <li> There light bubbling</li>

            <li> or you can turn the light off if you want to.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> and it filled the room with the relaxing scent of lavender and everyone that came in</li>
            <li> I used to go through tea light candles like water.</li>

            <li> The light shuts off automatically when the unit is empty&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> You can either have the light on as shown in the picture or off during the operation.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the comforting aromas while resting for the evening.  </li>
            <li> Uses all the water before it shuts off (unlike another brand I tried), and has a light on/off option.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that even with the light off (which is how I prefer it)</li>
            <li> Even when I do not have congestion - I enjoy the soothing smells to help lull me to sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to operate and clean.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing and nice to watch.</li>

            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is easy to clean since all the parts come off.</li>
            <li> It is so simple to use, looks attractive sitting out and (now that I think about it</li>
            <li> Just started to use, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works very well with my essential oils, it was a great value too!  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Everyone was in a good mood, and my mind felt clear all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I didn&#x27;t know there was such a device, but when I had received an opportunity to give the Allay Aromatherapy defused a try for free, try it for a while and then give my feedback and a very honest informative review so that all purchasers could find out detailed information about the product so that they can decide and make a informed purchase of the Allay Defuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill and the light is cool.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still a decent size and works great for a bedroom, not in a large living room, etc.</li>
            <li> Top part just falls right off &amp; doesn&#x27;t tighten like directions tell you to do.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser, it&#x27;s easy to set up, easy to travel with, and it really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like it says!!</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser i use in my kitchen but keeps my whole house smelling amazing!  </li>
            <li> I love the steady stream of mist infused with the essential oil that adds a wonderful healing aroma with just the right amount of humidity to our room.  </li>
            <li> Very simple and very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use, turns off automatically when the water runs out, and has a light on or off function so you can use it as a nightlight or not.  </li>
            <li> Its like a beautiful little stream of fragrant mist spilling from the top</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser however after some time I do notice a high pitched sound coming from the machine.</li>
            <li> Produces a nice steady stream of steam.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s nice looking and gives out a decent amount of mist</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to put water In water &amp; add oil.</li>
            <li> The diffuser quickly and easily fills my bedroom or livingroom</li>
            <li> I just hope that it lasts a long time because this really is a neat product, and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I just hope that it lasts a long time because this really is a neat product, and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to deliver natural scents to a room while providing real health benefits!</li>
            <li> The first press of the button turns the unit on and mist immediately begins flowing, a light also lights up the power button and the colored cone at the top.  </li>
            <li> It diffuses terrifically, and it&#x27;s easy to disconnect quickly to refill.</li>
            <li> I just wish the lights were brighter so the color of the cone would light up more and be more vivid.</li>
            <li> I also own a larger one from a different manufacturer which holds more water and lasts through the night but this one is great for day use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I loved the light on it and it did a great job diffusing oils, but I can&#x27;t believe it worked for such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome little machine  that does its job very well love it</li>
            <li> easy to clean, durable, and freshens up the atmosphere quickly.</li>
            <li> Quiet, with a pleasant trickling sound.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good humidifier/diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty quiet and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We can now have fresh scents in our home that are not empowering because we can now take control of how light or strong we&#x27;d like our home to smell</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean</li>
            <li> Super easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find that the ZAQ Allay occupies less space on a table or shelf, and still fills my room with a great scent.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to work and adds a calm light for their room too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit and was very happy with the product( great flow, soft light, long lasting stream ) ...</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s such an amazing price!</li>
            <li> One of those are the remarkable properties of essential oils.</li>

            <li> *Original Review</li>
            <li> This is a small sized diffuser that would be perfect for a small/medium sized room.  </li>
            <li> but I was so excited I just had to say something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with my diffuser so far.  </li>
            <li> cool looking and like the ability to turn off light and still diffuse</li>
            <li> In my opinion they are perfect for small rooms (home office, nursery, etc).</li>
            <li> and it looks so original</li>
            <li> this is a lovely and very functional product!</li>
            <li> and you can smell the aroma throughout most of the first floor of our house.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> This brand has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mesmerizing!</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser so much!  </li>
            <li> My first diffuser, so read a lot of reviews on many products.  </li>
            <li> Very efficient, easy to operate!  </li>
            <li> I initially liked the diffuser very much but after the first day using it, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser for the first 3 days, after that, it started to emit a high pitched noise which i couldn&#x27;t shut off.</li>
            <li> Not like there is a bunch of parts to clean.</li>
            <li> and yes I do clean it often.  </li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and did everything people recommended, cleaning the ring at the bottom, flushing it clean, letting it rest, etc.</li>
            <li> Well the point was to be able to use the essential oils I already own.</li>
            <li> It is the easiest of my 3 to use, load, and clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect for using my Young Living essential oils at night on my night stand.</li>
            <li> My only complaints are the light, even the one for the power switch, is way too bright</li>
            <li> I clean it out all the time</li>
            <li> I loved the glowing blue light and the mist it gave out.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s not as useful for the essential oil properties as it is for making a room/area smell great.  </li>
            <li> It works great EXCEPT, when the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s not really off &amp; the power button is still lit up.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I dumped out the alcohol and scrubbed out the inside with some q-tips and paper towels to clean the metal ring.</li>
            <li> When I received item I loved the look of it, I filled it with water and added essential oil</li>
            <li> I am going to take the advice from some of the q&amp;a&#x27;s here and clean it out and start over again.  </li>
            <li> (But I clean it</li>
            <li> Easier to clean.</li>
            <li> We have used it for about 3 full weeks now and she has consistently reported better sleep since we implemented this.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it diffuses very well!&lt;br /&gt;8)</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I needed to clean it out</li>
            <li> The diffuser is amazing, I love how stong the scent is and that it automatically turns off when the water levels get too low.</li>
            <li> , you will never get them clean</li>
            <li> Read Q&amp;A and tried to clean it and still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> First off it did work great (for the short time that it was working) and it looked very nice with blue led lights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, quick to set up, and I really like the way it looks.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first got it, but as I am not home a lot, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it very much in the first month.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over power with too much moisture, the light is beautiful (blue).  </li>
            <li> It is very pretty and have even used it in my daughter&#x27;s room as a night light when she was sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and I love the soft blue glow.  </li>
            <li> So far I love this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I have a young living diffuser and this one is way better!</li>
            <li> Was able to return the first one through Amazon because it broke that quickly.</li>
            <li> The light shuts off after a few hours, so this works great as a defacto night light for going to bed if don&#x27;t need the light all night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to set up and start using right away.</li>
            <li> cool gadget, it works perfecly, i been running it dayly for a month now, havent even clean it</li>
            <li> I purchased special EO for this unit.  </li>
            <li> My clients love the simplicity of this diffuser and the surprisingly large quantity of diffused air it omits.</li>
            <li> Much better than using a candle below pure oil method.</li>
            <li> It puts me right to sleep too!</li>
            <li> ... needs to be cranked up right now!)</li>
            <li> Thank you, you&#x27;ve invented a great little machine! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am super excited to receive the ZAQ</li>
            <li> It is working fine right now.</li>
            <li> It is so bright next to my bed, I have to cover it up.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and pretty when lit.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful and wonderful diffuser, completely idiot proof to operate.</li>
            <li> (though note the blue power button is still lit, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overly bright).  </li>
            <li> At first, I liked how much vapor was coming out of it</li>
            <li> The blue is so pretty with the mist coming out - it was great if it would have just kept running.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to fill and refill, and clean - doesn&#x27;t get hot,</li>
            <li> I will say it is good for a smaller space.  </li>
            <li> The top part is really tipsy too.</li>
            <li> Loved it for a short time, then it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Wish led lights changed the whole spectrum of colors instead of just the plastic piece on top being one color period.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old handles filling his own at night with no problem.</li>
            <li> It does a good job at diffusing essential oils!</li>
            <li> I keep it in the bathroom and turn it on every-time I walk in because it makes me feel good to have essential oil aromatherapy in the air.  </li>
            <li> I liked this diffuser until it stopped working at 4 months old.</li>
            <li> I love the light, sound and vapor that comes from this product as it really creates a peaceful spa-like ambiance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for the price</li>
            <li> Peppermint essential oils is good for allergies, so when I received it, I used it by my bed at night.  </li>
            <li> I was in love with hers so much I decided to buy one myself.</li>
            <li> I changed the water frequently but after about 4 months it started to shut off on its own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cordless would be cool.</li>
            <li> Looks cool.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Loving this diffuser so far.  </li>
            <li> the item looks cool and sleek</li>
            <li> It works very well and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It also runs for a shorter amount of time, which is good for daytime use when i might want to use one blend of oils in the morning and another later in the day.  </li>
            <li> Was cool when it worked.</li>
            <li> Full story:</li>
            <li> And it looks cool.</li>
            <li> Checked water was still full, turned it on and it shut off after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> A cap full of vinegar and water and run it.</li>
            <li> Good product very quiet, but not reliable every use.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it is a cool mist.</li>
            <li> commented on how cool it looked.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is so cool, it lights up when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it look great, quiet, aroma from oils is nice, 2-3 drops are enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is our first day, so far so good.</li>
            <li> One out of two is not bad.</li>
            <li> So far it has been a good investment being my first diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love the diffuser, it is easy to use, easy to clean, and has worked flawlessley for me for the last 7 months.  </li>
            <li> Puts out the right amount of smell, the light is so calming.</li>
            <li> Operation is super easy, has a lights off mode, and turns just a few drops of oil into a great aroma.</li>
            <li> As for ease of use, it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It looks super cool and starts diffusing the water/essential oils the moment it is turned on.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and pretty to look at</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has more throw (the carry of scent) than a single wick candle, easily delivering smell to most my downstairs.</li>
            <li> Allows me to have my favorite essential oils steaming into the room with the light on, so you can use it as a night light, or the light off, and the diffuser still going.</li>
            <li> With the dry winter air filling the house, this adds just the right amount of humidity to keep my sinuses happy.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase and will probably purchase another one for other areas of the house.</li>
            <li> The other one still works great</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, and mom really likes that it adds a little moisture to the room.</li>
            <li> I love my new diffuser!</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times when I first purchased it in August and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine during the first week</li>
            <li> I help in the classroom once a week and have always been amazed by how fresh and clean their room smells.</li>
            <li> Luckily it comes with a warranty and we contacted the company.  </li>
            <li> I finally have my husband believing in the benefits of diffusing oils, and I only use DoTerra oils, but now I am facing another decision of what diffuser is best.</li>
            <li> Love the contemporary look to it.</li>
            <li> The glowing blue light is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> I looks pretty cool too with the built in light and the fog coming out.</li>
            <li> when I discovered here it should not shut off so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I experimented with it twice more to be sure it was actually malfunctioning.</li>
            <li> My husband was super unsure about oils</li>
            <li> This unit has a much more robust stream of vapor, which I&#x27;m glad for because my bedroom is considerably larger than that massage room.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super overpriced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is very portable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is very portable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It freshens the air quickly.</li>
            <li> You can put more for an increasingly potent aroma while the device is running, but I don&#x27;t find the aroma to last when the device is not in use.</li>
            <li> They should have said 30 to 40 minutes if you are lucky.  </li>
            <li> This is a MUCH more economical solution than candles and is much healthier.</li>
            <li> The seller has always responded quickly to my messages and has been nothing but helpful.</li>
            <li> It comes on quick, works until chamber empties</li>
            <li> It is mildly tricky to clean--you need to use q-tips to get into some of the areas.</li>
            <li> It gets 5 stars for it&#x27;s function but it is not the better model of the 2 main types of ZAQ diffusers.  </li>
            <li> It also serves as a night light which is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Product quick working today.</li>
            <li> If I put stronger smelling oils in it, I can smell it through most of my main floor.</li>
            <li> Just lovely and the light display is unexpected</li>
            <li> This is a really great device that last up to 4 or 5 hrs.and has a pretty blue night light that can be turned off if you like; love the lite mist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon on the other hand was amazing with the 2 returns I love their customer service.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ll say that they have great customer service, the first one that I owned only would run for like 15 minutes at a time and then shut off.  </li>
            <li> I think having the light on makes it too hot</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very pleased and would recommend and may buy another but would maybe buy a different shape.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> First, the light went out, and then the automatic shut off</li>
            <li> I keep it on my nightstand and it puffs out scented oil for a good long time while I fall to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ...delivers nice scent throughout the room and has a simple clean up.. Would definetly recommend</li>
            <li> The mist is a nice steady stream and leaves the room very fragrant.  </li>
            <li> I is not too small or to large, it is wonderful in my kitchen!!!  </li>
            <li> It does not cover a large area, but is perfect for a small bedroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to operate, has about a 4 hr run time (which is really convenient), and the auto shut-off really is a &amp;#34;shut-off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good product, diffuses well, and for a long time!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. :)</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of aroma therapy and I am enjoying learning about the oils and what they can do.</li>
            <li> I keep it in my bedroom and it fills the whole space very quickly.</li>
            <li> noise it makes is very soothing on top of the vapor it puts off is very relaxing with my lavender oil!</li>
            <li> Not to pricey really does nice job in defusing essential oil and nice soft light worth the price you pay</li>
            <li> Used it with peppermint, lavender, orange and grapefruit essential oils the first time and it did a great job of filling our quite large kitchen with fresh</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself, had it exactly one month before it stopped working!</li>
            <li> Lasts for about 4 hours and puts out pretty powerful aromas!</li>
            <li> Does not come with essential oils, so be sure to have some on hand because you will want to try this out as soon as it arrives!</li>
            <li> I cleaned it regularly every day--sometimes more depending what oils I would diffuse!</li>
            <li> but mine will only stay on maybe fifteen minutes at the most!  </li>
            <li> Love it so far!</li>
            <li> My daughter raved about this diffuser, so I bought one for my daugher-in-law who absolutely loves it!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fill, easy to clean, and really quiet.  </li>
            <li> It may be fine for someone who just wants to scent their air, but not for the benefits I thought it wiuld give me.</li>
            <li> For my downstairs open kitchen/dining/living room concept this device easily spreads a nice smell throughout the whole downstairs area.</li>
            <li> It is fine, but I wish I would have paid a little bit more for a better diffuser.</li>
            <li> It is like having a pure chemical free candle that infuses the room with whatever scent you choose.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser.</li>
            <li> then this is a great little diffuser when it works.</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser, works well.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is a great little device.</li>
            <li> The aroma fills very large rooms quickly.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice light scent in large rooms and stronger in smaller rooms.  </li>
            <li> Worked great but shorted out a few days ago....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and it works great.</li>
            <li> Because we have had such great results we will be buying my daughter the pink one for her bedroom:)</li>
            <li> I had amazing sleep the last two nights and am using it on a Saturday to help me with a migraine.  </li>
            <li> Do sound, very quite.</li>
            <li> Works great no problems, use them everyday.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let this company take your money, go with someone that has a better reputation and actually offers returns</li>
            <li> It looks nice with the blue lit up</li>
            <li> A bigger water holder would be nice though since I have to fill it about every 4 hours of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these on July 2013 but rarely used it.</li>
            <li> You can turn the light on the top on or off, but the blue glow around the power button will not turn off.</li>
            <li> Makes the home smell fresh.  </li>
            <li> Some diffusers change colors, but this one one is lit with an interior LED light, which only lights up the top of the diffuser</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about this product - I bought it because of the simple design and good reviews.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I loved it so much we bought another for the second floor.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the on light can&#x27;t be turned off and so gives a bright blue light in the bedroom at night - we just cover it though.</li>
            <li> device also shuts itself off when empty which is good, however when I used heavier oils (darker)</li>
            <li> I think so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love it so far - I&#x27;ve had it for about a month.</li>
            <li> I swear I feel like I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Far better price than some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li> It is pretty, every guest points it out for being cool looking.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Young Living&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silent and produces a nice mist.</li>
            <li> I love that I have the option to enjoy the blue ambiance or not.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful but hold a small amount so ur always messing with it.</li>
            <li> but I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> As our elderly mother lives with us, we have days that we do not feel the room is as fresh as we would like.</li>
            <li> I have to wonder if these vapo-diffusers are really worth it.</li>
            <li> And it has a great soft and soothing blue glow.</li>
            <li> it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The kids love the blue light it gives off &amp; I like the fact I can turn it off at night if I don&#x27;t want the ambiance</li>
            <li> loved it so much, bought a second for my daughter&#x27;s room.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and it puts out a nice amount of vapor.  </li>
            <li> However, for the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li> Been using this daily and loving it.</li>
            <li> Love that you can hit the button a second time to disable the light.</li>
            <li> The blue has a nice calming glow</li>
            <li> read on line that a diffuser of natural jasmine oil would help one sleep better.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve been nice if it actually worked though.</li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Worth buying.</li>
            <li> works well and humidifies at the same time, it gives a nice atmosphere to the room as well...</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> It works great so far (we only started using it today).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased that these have worked so well in the long run.</li>
            <li> I used it often for three months and really liked it, so I ordered a second one for another room.   </li>
            <li> 2 drops of your favorite essential oil is all it takes to have a light mist to freshen the air.  </li>
            <li> They work great with Young Living Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised though the blue light doesn&#x27;t turn off my more.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and it is excellent!</li>
            <li> I like the auto shut off feature, and the fact that you can turn the top blue light off by clicking the power button again.  </li>
            <li> I Am Using The doTERRA Essential Oils, And Am Loving The Benefits ...</li>
            <li> It is worth it to buy a quality diffuser.</li>
            <li> Diffuses a really nice amount of essential oil aroma into your space.</li>
            <li> I have a much more expensive diffuser in addition to this one and this one is absolutely incredible.</li>
            <li> Her room smells so good, and I think the nightlight effect and gentle bubbling sounds are definitely helping.</li>
            <li> I like my young living diffuser much more.</li>
            <li> Love it so much, I have ordered several as gifts for family members :)</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I purchased one for both the fresh smell and sense of calmness in my house.</li>
            <li> I rarely by things on Amazon</li>
            <li> it is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> We loved it so much I bought another one about 6 months later for our bedroom.</li>
            <li> I love that it can run with the light on, the light off, and it shuts off automatically when the water runs dry!!</li>
            <li> The light is too bright to put right next to your head while you sleep if you are like me and enjoy total darkness.</li>
            <li> Good for small room, easy to assemble and operate.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.. and the blue light is a soothing color!!</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t the light, and it also shuts off on its own when the reservoir is empty!</li>
            <li> A great little diffuser that really puts out a strong steady mist!  </li>
            <li> The only good news here is that the repair part immediately got my diffuser working just like new!</li>
            <li> It works great, looks so pretty with the blue light and the mist flowing out softly, quietly.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s a very attractive unit, u can really smell the essential oils put in it, &amp; very quiet.</li>
            <li> but so far customer service has been quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I think the only thing I would&#x27;ve done differently is clean it out better ever couple of days.</li>
            <li> So far,I can&#x27;t tell it does anything other than make the room smell good.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a good diffuser.</li>
            <li> I use my diffuser all day long, I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> It is fascinating to watch (at least the cats think so) and the fact that it happens immediately is pretty magical too.  </li>
            <li> Some days it&#x27;s good and other days</li>
            <li> I also had purchased other brands of diffusers and they often stop working fairly soon after getting them.  </li>
            <li> first of I was very excited since I love the smell of the vitamin store and an very relaxed after shipping, so I picked up a healing essential oil</li>
            <li> highly recommend this diffuser and will probably buy another one for my mom because she loves it so much &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Without the blue light, I&#x27;d have been slightly less impressed since it really sets a relaxing mood at night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s emits just the right amount of moisture, &amp;</li>
            <li> I returned to Amazon to return to the seller right away.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have thrown out the box right way</li>
            <li> It sits right by my computer.</li>
            <li> So I posted a question to them about my diffuser and what I can do to get it to work right</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, it wouldn&#x27;t even power on.  </li>
            <li> Diffuses just the right amount and does not leave the desk with any moisture.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box it would stay on about 10 mins &amp; shut off.</li>
            <li> I used it right away.</li>
            <li> /sit right on of the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might not be using it right.</li>
            <li> Never worked right.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and it was taken care of right away without a problem.</li>
            <li> Item did not even work properly right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Using it in a bedroom right now.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, great price, love the blue light and it diffuses the essential oils well.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works really well at putting the aroma in the air and is really pretty when the light is on.</li>
            <li> but there was still a small bright light coming from the switch and it illuminated the room.</li>
            <li> They last around 3-4 hours and emit a beautiful blue glow.</li>
            <li> Quiet, effective, pretty.</li>
            <li> and I can have the light off if it&#x27;s in the older kid&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> Sometimes too much oil builds up on the bottom, and I must clean it out with paper towels.  </li>
            <li> Really puts out a good quantity for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Great little diffuser for the money!</li>
            <li> Great little machine!</li>
            <li> Very easy and quiet.</li>
            <li> It had a very strong smell of orange essential oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be made with high quality parts and doesn&#x27;t appear flimsy or cheaply made</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t taken it in our basement yet to see how it works in a very large space</li>
            <li> I like the light on for an easy visual in the daytime</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and I love that it automatically shuts off when empty.  </li>
            <li> Great size for a bedroom or small office.</li>
            <li> Only issue is the blue light on the button is too bright for nighttime use.</li>
            <li> I am very disapointed because it looks really cool when it is working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great for small spaces - bedroom, office, etc.  </li>
            <li> I realized it&#x27;s pretty powerful</li>
            <li> It seems to work best when cleaned after each use, which is not too bad since it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser and plan on ordering more to have in different rooms and to give as gifts to my adult children for their homes.  </li>
            <li> Great diffuser for the bedroom or small room.</li>
            <li> The light (I have blue) is soft and nice.  </li>
            <li> Works great in my small apartment.</li>
            <li> its pretty cool, has a blue light in it too!  </li>
            <li> There are 2 different settings on this -- one is the top is lit up and gives a soft, glowing look as the mist pours out the top.</li>
            <li> Really looks cool when it does work.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several different kinds and this is the most amazing one made.  </li>
            <li> The 3-4hr range is perfect for how long it takes for the oils (in general) to run out as far as the aroma goes.</li>
            <li> They automatically turn off when empty which is great thanks so much</li>
            <li> I own a salon &amp; want the place to smell professional, good, relaxing, &amp; welcoming, look edgy.</li>
            <li> For the price as good as other higher prices</li>
            <li> I think that when I wrote the review below, I must have gotten diffusers from a production run that was sub-par, because my later ZAQ Allay diffusers have run for many months trouble-free, the disks do not need changing as often (4-6 months between disks!), and the diffuser runs for much longer (2-3 hours instead of 30-60 minutes).</li>
            <li> Not as effective in large open spaces.</li>
            <li> It is easy to refill and the blue light sends a peaceful vibe into the room.</li>
            <li> With a little aromatic essential oils this would really be a wonderful gift item.</li>
            <li> I wish this lamp would have a little more sophisticated appearance.</li>
            <li> I wish the reservoir were a little bigger works great with Doterra!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting good pure essential oils.</li>
            <li> but I had to return the first on because it did not work right.</li>
            <li> I like the following: ease of use, ease of cleaning, glow light that is soothing with the ability to turn it off, soothing sound.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the blue light when we are watching tv with the lights</li>
            <li> This oil diffuser works quickly and cleans the air fast.  </li>
            <li> I am returning this diffuser and just waiting for the larger ones to come back into stock as they work great.</li>
            <li> We liked this so much in the downstairs guest bathroom to dispense various citrus scents when we have company that we bought another for upstairs in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> used it every night, as directed, and i loved drifting off to the slight smell of lavendar.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and has an option of lighting up the blue stem or not.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product and has met all our basic needs.</li>
            <li> This came in super fast.</li>
            <li> A second press of the button turns off the light on the cone, but the power button light still remains on.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s simple and easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> The comments about the blue light are accurate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and very effective moving my selected fragrance throughout the house.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the  bright blue light, but discovered if I clicked on the on button again, the light would go off.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few aromatherapy diffusers and I think the whole concept is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> There are numerous good reviews on this product, so I&#x27;ll keep this short &amp; sweet.  </li>
            <li> I am currently purchaseing 3 more to put in my childrens rooms because of their allergys and just need right amout of moisture to help their sinus cavities.</li>
            <li> My other feedback is the super bright blue light.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews and they all seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and no mess.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser is very light weight and extremely quiet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use very much oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very modern looking.</li>
            <li> I love these misters I have a few and have given as gifts they are reasonably priced and have a light like a night light.</li>
            <li> Top comes off in two pieces and can easily be wiped down as can</li>
            <li> It is a great deal compared to other products that are near or over $100.  </li>
            <li> Could be because they aren&#x27;t using enough oil as this is more than adequate to fill the whole front of our home with scent using about 10-12 drops of oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bright in a dark room!  </li>
            <li> we have had this product for a little over a month now and we have loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a good little diffuser.</li>
            <li> this seems to be a good one for the price, wish it would run a little longer but all in all I like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little</li>
            <li> It does get a little splashy toward the end, but that&#x27;s just a good signal to help me remember to refill it.</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser and was so excited to use it with my new oils.  </li>
            <li> I liked this while it worked, but can&#x27;t rate it as high as I&#x27;d hoped to since it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, diffuses nicely for several hours and shuts off when it is empty.</li>
            <li> Tremendous product, we&#x27;ll probably end up purchasing a few more as well!</li>
            <li> Since this was my first diffuser ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the first one for well over a year now</li>
            <li> We love mixing the essential oils in it and it lasts about 3 hours on a continuous mist.</li>
            <li> This is pretty, it works as advertised and price is so-so.  </li>
            <li> They work exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Way better than going around smelling &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; from all the essential oils, since I like to mix them!</li>
            <li> It was my first</li>
            <li> I use it ever day with my Essential Oils love it I have bought 3 and give them to my friends</li>
            <li> I was able to use it for maybe 3 months almost daily.</li>
            <li> This was much cooler than I anticipated!</li>
            <li> Works well and consistently.</li>
            <li> Fills the entire first floor of our house with a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> She uses it all the time and it works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had looked at diffusers available through some of the companies like Young Living and Do Terra.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and I liked it!</li>
            <li> , I only use it 1x per week at most.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what it is supposed to while doubling as a nightlight.</li>
            <li> Definitely wakes me up :)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t turn the light completely off.</li>
            <li> Everything in the description was exact.</li>
            <li> Love it and use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> If it would actually stay on I would have bought at least one more because when it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> If you are planning on having it cover more then you might need to purchase multiple.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser!</li>
            <li> (though it is pretty).  </li>
            <li> For one, it looks cool with the light (I got the blue version.)</li>
            <li> Quiet, doesn&#x27;t leave puddles, love it.</li>
            <li> Decent price and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t want a diffuser running this hot.</li>
            <li> About 20 min after it&#x27;s first use</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work better in a much smaller space.</li>
            <li> Love starting the day with a peppermint</li>
            <li> Then I ordered another thinking that the first one was just a fluke.</li>
            <li> This was my first essential oil diffuser to use and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;ve came across essential oils</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m married to a fireman</li>
            <li> I fill it with a favorite essential oil and turn it on.</li>
            <li> have several diffusers now and they seem to just get better.</li>
            <li> There are MUCH better diffusers out there for the same amount of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite tall and pretty to look at when lit</li>
            <li> I will probably order another at some point for better coverage of the first floor since it is pretty open.</li>
            <li> The first worked for 6 months then broke</li>
            <li> The first one worked well.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, love it!</li>
            <li> Possibly, it needed better rinsing between uses, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it turned off within 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Add 3-5 drops of your favorite essential oil to the water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to buy 1 or 2 more to place in my daughter&#x27;s rooms, especially for the winter.</li>
            <li> It worked the first day.  </li>
            <li> But hey it looks the part;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is our first diffuser gadget.</li>
            <li> This is the first diffuser I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> First time I used it (followed directions exactly)</li>
            <li> The most recent hurdle I tackled was using plug-in air fresheners.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than traditional plug in air fresheners.</li>
            <li> but I find that it sounds like a gentle stream so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, it just adds to the ambiance!  </li>
            <li> I love using it with my d≈çTERRA essential oils.</li>
            <li> I have the yellow one too, which I&#x27;ve had longer and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> of my personal favorite blends are:&lt;br /&gt;Lavender + Peppermint (before bend or to relax)&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus</li>
            <li> I wish there were an option to turn out the light completely</li>
            <li> streams forth exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it and will be ordering a second one for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> We have been trying to move away from chemicals, but really like a fresh house.</li>
            <li> and it just run and diffuse the oil pretty well.</li>
            <li> This actually happens more often than not</li>
            <li> We have used this diffuser for about a month now and really like it!</li>
            <li> It lasted almost exactly 4 months.</li>
            <li> and we love the blue glow in the evenings.</li>
            <li> We use a long list of Doterra essential oils in it and they all work great.</li>
            <li> Evidently once out of the return policy you can&#x27;t contact the seller about it just stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one for two on this so hopefully their quality is higher than that.  </li>
            <li> I love this diffuser and use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> Other than that, though, I love it!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This Diffuser was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Practical and pretty.</li>
            <li> The first week in February it stopped working again.</li>
            <li> so I am going to try different oils to find which ones I like most.</li>
            <li> Have recommended this to many people as I am actually using it in a  salon to help purify and freshen the air.</li>
            <li> It works well but more for smaller rooms and areas.  </li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but what would make it better is if it had a bigger container to hold water.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> Overall, however, I&#x27;m really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> Way better than paying for generic deodorizers like glade plug ins or something.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a defuser.  </li>
            <li> It has been reliable and consistent.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it advertised</li>
            <li> Then the first one stopped working.</li>
            <li> The second one worked just as well, but it had a brown grime in the bottom by about the seconduse, so it got rinsed after most uses to prevent any buildup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall works exactly as I hoped it would, I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it was bigger so it could hold more water.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve only had this item one day</li>
            <li> I love my essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> If you like essential oils, you will love the way this diffuser makes your house smell.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own when *empty* (about a couple of hours).</li>
            <li> really do like it a lot, though!</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> I think this is standard for most diffusers and keeps the product compact.</li>
            <li> When lit up the color is more red.  </li>
            <li> Steam shoots up a bit higher</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time buying and using a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I purchased as an aroma therapy diffuser, and it does exactly what is supposed to to.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly as we want and lasts a sufficient amount of time.</li>
            <li> This was my first diffuser purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am back to buy two more.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed for my home.</li>
            <li> The second setting is just the mist, and the top portion is not lit.</li>
            <li> -- I only wish it lasted more than 4 hours at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting 3 more next pay day!</li>
            <li> We have used many different oils and they have helped us both!</li>
            <li> The first diffuser I bought wanted De-mineralized water.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase several more at Christmastime.</li>
            <li> When you put the water and oil in and turn it on it lasts for 4 - 5 hours, which I love because I can change out the scent several times a day.  </li>
            <li> My first diffuser, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually about to buy two more... 1 for the master bedroom and one for the living room.  </li>
            <li> I looked at MANY options, but ultimately, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a diffuser.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t last forever and it does shut off after 3-4 hours, but the scent lasts long after, and I think it does a great job for the price.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try different oils to see which one I like the most.</li>
            <li> 5 drops of your favorite essential oil, turn it on and let it go!  </li>
            <li> Would be willing to buy again if the product lasted longer.</li>
            <li> At first, this would shut off after just an hour.  </li>
            <li> It only takes about 3 drops and water filled up to the max line or it doesn&#x27;t run the full time.  </li>
            <li> The first one quit running after a month, but the seller replaced immediately under warranty without any hassle.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly whT</li>
            <li> The first time I saw this at my daughter-in-laws house</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a diffuser.</li>
            <li> This diffuser got 5 stars for the first two months.</li>
            <li> I purchased one and loved it so purchased another despite reading some reviews that they broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not huge but puts out a good amount which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It came with very clear instructions on how to use and clean</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s just getting into the essential oils and has been loving coming over to my house and smelling my new oils in my diffusers.&lt;br /&gt;She requested this diffuser.</li>
            <li> once it turns itself off i clean it well simply by wiping it out with a clean cloth to get excess water and oils out.</li>
            <li> Great to also put a bit of moisture back in the air as we are coming into the dry weather season.</li>
            <li> I was very excited that mine came in the blue which ironically matches my living room.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to make your house smell great without using those bad chemicals!</li>
            <li> I already have a Young Living Diffuser and although it doesn&#x27;t run as long as this one, it is better at using and spreading the oils and dispersing the fine particles into the air, I know this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty with the blue light that automatically turns on when you run it .</li>
            <li> This particular one is quiet, has a night light setting or you can use without the light, AND it automatically shuts off when it is finished.</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast, in an easy to open box, and set-up was a breeze!</li>
            <li> The scent is more contained and would likely be lost in a large room.  </li>
            <li> A larger diffuser requires more oils, even though the aroma still runs out after a certain period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I love the way this little diffuser puts out the fragrance and the optional light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room, yet it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Would never buy any other kind.</li>
            <li> It looks so cool misting away, I get lots of WOW comments!  </li>
            <li> had one stop working and the return policy was super simple and buyer friendly.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and as new in box.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to purchase this based on some negative reviews, but I am happy to report that I love my diffuser!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fun to use, spreads the aroma well, and everyone who comes over asks about the &amp;#34;genie lamp&amp;#34; :) I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months of almost daily use, it&#x27;s still like new......</li>
            <li> It is just the right size and the blue light is pretty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and clean and runs for about 5 hours until it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> There is no messy wax to melt or clean up.</li>
            <li> This is good if you only want to diffuse for a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> and it actually fills the enter room of nice aroma, which I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I have bought several and  getting ready to purchase more for my business.</li>
            <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t last 3-4 hours, more like 2 hours, but it does work VERY well.</li>
            <li> It has a colorful blue LED light display.  </li>
            <li> Read many negative reviews but the overwhelming positive response was what sold it for me.  </li>
            <li> My family is super sensitive to scents!</li>
            <li> The output of mist is generous and the sound puts me right into a deep cocoon of sleep.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I initially purchased the ZAQ Dew diffuser, and then right after I purchased mine, it was no longer available.</li>
            <li> It is cute, takes up only a little room, and diffuses the oils nicely.  </li>
            <li> I would have been willing to try a straight exchange for another one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it pretty much all day every day since I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
            <li> Kept trying, even tried turning the blue light off, but it still would only stay on for 3 minutes at the most.  </li>
            <li> Great for bedrooms or other smaller rooms.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> It works very well, and is pretty as well.</li>
            <li> and they are good, but the water tank is small.</li>
            <li> Nice when it worked, but not worth the risk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put this behind some decorative glass bottles and it illuminates them beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend $40 on this small unit anyway, but heard good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good for small room.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much gunk could have accumulated in six weeks, but I used a soft cloth and q-tip to clean up any openings and tried again with distilled water.  </li>
            <li> My room starting smelling fresh and clean within 5-10 min., and</li>
            <li> It also proves to be a cheaper alternative to burning candles (especially if you care about buying soy, cotton wick candles that burn clean).</li>
            <li> I don‚Äôt love the blue, which is why it‚Äôs in my bedroom and not out in my main living space.</li>
            <li> so I can have multiple oils in the appropriate spaces (sleep in our room, 4 Thieves in the main living area etc.)</li>
            <li> On top of that I call it a little humidifier cause it make that cool mist</li>
            <li> The product is a decent amount of money, but it&#x27;s less than other diffusers and works excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty small but delivers the scents for quite a while, and it&#x27;s super easy to use and refill!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every night for the past week and so far it works great.</li>
            <li> easy to change out from one oil to the next if you want to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and so quiet.</li>
            <li> Easy to reach individual parts for cleaning.</li>
            <li> You just need to make sure to use Distilled water and air dry after use and you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> I replied that I was and his response was that it only works with water soluble oils which can easily be found on the internet.</li>
            <li> The picture illustrations, accompanied by text, makes it easy enough for everyone to understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is way smaller than I was expecting and goes through the water/oil VERY quickly (sometimes under an hour).</li>
            <li> easy care and quiet</li>
            <li> I bought several of these as gifts as I have a larger model that I have been very pleased with.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is easy to use, and is quiet.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s strong enough to take care of 2 levels.</li>
            <li> seemed great at first but must have blew a short because it stops working after I had it a little over a month.....</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser, but it makes a little more noise than I care for and it seems to run out of water fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser was recommended by a friend, and it has certainly lived up to its recommendation.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly large room that I use it in and it is noticeable throughout.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t fill a large room.</li>
            <li> Certainly a mold/mildew issue to develop if I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I use it in a large room and the aroma can be smelled all over the place.</li>
            <li> This does put out alot of smell if you use alot of oil in it or use pure scented liquid instead of mixing it with water.</li>
            <li> but sometimes certain EO linger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Essential oils are believed to effect certain glands, and are beneficial heathwise.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it now!!</li>
            <li> Set in a stable spot it is sensitive to movement because the water is very hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and blends in well, but it gives off a nice glow and soft dripping sound.  </li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser a few months ago and I love it!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, simple, efficient, and very relaxing.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly but it can easily be knocked off since there is nothing holding it onto the base.</li>
            <li> Very reliable, low maintenance and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and was surprised to see how much the smell really moves around the room from such a small object.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so tranquil having it run at night with the soft light ambiance it offers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased various different brands of diffusers but this one was the only one I really liked because of the consistency in the mist and easy clean-up.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little diffuser.</li>
            <li> Fine mist with gentle aromatherapy infused into the air when essential oils added.  </li>
            <li> Great for a small room!!</li>
            <li> Just wish it could hold a little more and last for more than four hours</li>
            <li> We love it just wish it was a little bigger and lasted all night :) thank you</li>
            <li> I love that it takes a little water, a drop or two of your favorite essential oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased the blue light, very pleasing and relaxing on the eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing that a relatively small amount of water can create hours and hours of mist.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I got the blue model, and the light is very low-key and relaxing.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well helping at night with sleeping and clearing the air.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY IS QUALITY FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> They are great with standing behind their product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> it can double as a night light.</li>
            <li> and it really worked well until yesterday (January 10, 2015).  </li>
            <li> I have had it for over 6 months now and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I like the option to have the whole diffuser lit up or not.</li>
            <li> is working very well still.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very tempted to buy myself one sometime very soon.</li>
            <li> If you press the button a second time the light goes out.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It really helps our breathing and shuts off when the water is used up.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> and she can choose the scent she wants.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and appreciated by receiver.</li>
            <li> I like how much smell comes out of this thing.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it next to my bed to lightly humidify, although I have no idea if it&#x27;s working well for that</li>
            <li> You push the button once and it comes on with the light, push the same button again</li>
            <li> and it turns the light off (except the button itself which stays lit), and a third time turns the unit off.</li>
            <li> I put it in whatever room I am in at the time and really notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was overfilling it, putting in too much oil, using it too much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, works well.</li>
            <li> It worked really well for a month and then broke.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit does not create much steam/vapor.</li>
            <li> Fell of the shelf (thanks cat) and didn&#x27;t break, thank god.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> If you press it a second time, the light will turn off, but it will continue to diffuse.</li>
            <li> Makes my whole house smell like tea.</li>
            <li> CONs: Can be a bit noisy sometimes (we kept thinking the washer or dishwasher was running after we went to bed, but once we got used to having it, it didn&#x27;t seem to bother us as much.)      </li>
            <li> Too much money for one year.</li>
            <li> Makes the slightest bubbling noise and the light of the button stays on even after you turn off the blue.</li>
            <li> Very quality and reliable product for the price.  </li>
            <li> That means it is not putting much oil into the air.  </li>
            <li> So much for support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s calming and very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> This item works very well and is does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and well.</li>
            <li> different light options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing is the button&#x27;s light stays on in both on modes.</li>
            <li> You push the front button once and the entire unit turns on along with the glowing light.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> However, when you turn it off, there is no lingering smell which is what I am really after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> It comes gift ready</li>
            <li> This diffuser worked great for the first 6 weeks, but now it has stopped working altogether, and it&#x27;s apparently too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> I expected more from this company.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell much of the fragrance with this machine....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the water evaporates fast.</li>
            <li> Love the automatic shut off which seems to always be when it is empty and not before.  </li>
            <li> Really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to friends, thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This really works well.  </li>
            <li> It really boils frantically - maybe it&#x27;s a defect?</li>
            <li> Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> more than i expected.</li>
            <li> I have owned the air bubbler ones and you can scent a whole room.</li>
            <li> The water vapor, if you watch, comes out the top and just sinks, so maybe the scent goes with it.</li>
            <li> and it controls the smell really well.</li>
            <li> I read on line and it was suggested that too much oil in the water caused it to go off.  </li>
            <li> and it helps me breathe so much easier.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> This thing has really helped me sleep.  </li>
            <li> That is a real bonus since I like to leave it on when I leave my house</li>
            <li> I like it, just not a fan of the diffused air going straight up.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing to the soul..</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> only con is it a bit cheap looking.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast too</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I will NOT be recommending this product to anyone and would really like to return it and be refunded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this in my living room/kitchen area and when I have the ceiling fan on it circulates the scent to the whole area.  </li>
            <li> It runs for about 4-5 hours straight before needing a refill.</li>
            <li> Using the essential oils have the room smelling fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy it daily!</li>
            <li> Also, with being out of a diffuser for this amount of time has shown me how much I NEED my diffuser.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really all I have to say,</li>
            <li> Really like the product</li>
            <li> It was very relaxing and soothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it really depends on the oil you choose how much you should put in.</li>
            <li> They work very well.  </li>
            <li> Relaxing and reaches almost the whole house.</li>
            <li> and I find the blue light soothing.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> The second light setting works well for night time use</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser</li>
            <li> During which time, you can have the option to have the low light on or off.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just have to buy another because my fianc√© wants to keep it in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and distributes the aroma well throughput the room.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> There is also an internal light that can turned on or off.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am putting to much oil in it.</li>
            <li> I find that I don&#x27;t want to put too much oil in at once</li>
            <li> Although if one wanted to carry the unit and plug together, you could just keep the cord attached the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hum&#x27; when running, the flow of the &#x27;steam&#x27; is relaxing, the blue light is not obnoxious-</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m finding it&#x27;s size to be very convenient-</li>
            <li> *, even when the unit is absolutely level.</li>
            <li> and the flavor filled my moderately sized room in 15 min!!!!</li>
            <li> Ready to use again.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, blue light just stays on even when the machine is off.</li>
            <li> Works very well in my office.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too.  </li>
            <li> I love using about 3 drops of lavender to help me sleep, or 3-5 drops of peppermint, lemon, or orange to freshen a room if the dogs come in wet.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than candle oil warmers.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> , there is still a tiny light that remains, because that lets me know it&#x27;s on...and when I wake up in the night to go to the bathroom, I can tell by a glance whether it&#x27;s still on or has gone to auto shut-</li>
            <li> It is quiet &amp; you can either use it with the light or without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned I do prefer  a difissuer that propels the droplets out into the room rather than straight up like this one.</li>
            <li> It was gently used.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would run 3-4 hours straight</li>
            <li> When it came, it literally weighed ounces with the whole package</li>
            <li> It worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> im using it in my massage room, its really help</li>
            <li> I really like the Diffuser.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine got it much cheaper with a Groupon.</li>
            <li> I guess if too much oil collects in the bottom, its going to go</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> The color is calming, and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Only wish the light was a bit dimmer.</li>
            <li> Really like that it shuts</li>
            <li> Very efficient.</li>
            <li> I really like them when they&#x27;re working tho.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain about this product.</li>
            <li> has a line so that you know how much water to add</li>
            <li> I like the blue light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying myself another soon, because who wants to move the diffuser all over the house.  </li>
            <li> Fast shopping</li>
            <li> It really &#x27;puts&#x27; out the oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy another very soon</li>
            <li> I like how you can use it with the blue light or without the blue light.</li>
            <li> Absolutely don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> While you can choose to turn the light off it still glows around the on/off button and would be enough to disrupt my sleep.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> The blue glowing light can be on or off.</li>
            <li> What I really like is that when the water runs out, it automatically turns itself off so we don&#x27;t have to worry about anything.</li>
            <li> we use it all the time and it really scents a medium size room</li>
            <li> It is very quite and shuts off automatically when it is out of water.</li>
            <li> Works really and</li>
            <li> Honestly, even without the light, I think it might be too intense for me to have only a few feet away.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops of oil and the whole room smells nice.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was kind of small</li>
            <li> It distributes the oils into the air in an instant, it is very quiet and effective.  </li>
            <li> and I love the soft blue glow.</li>
            <li> The color is fascinating, the unit works instantly and it turns itself off when empty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but doesn&#x27;t give off as much scent as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have multiple diffusers and by far this is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to buy two more for gifts and my daughter saw the blue one and said she really wanted that one, so I bought her one, and the same one for my daughter in law, then I bought a second one for myself, and it worked ok for awhile,</li>
            <li> We also have a diffuser from Young Living essential oils that has worked better and held up longer.</li>
            <li> I own 2 of these along with a larger diffuser from a different company .  </li>
            <li> Very good price compare to other similar essential oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have a very large open loft (over 1200 sqft), and I can smell the essential oils with no problem in most of the loft.  </li>
            <li> Plus the blue looks very cool in a dimly lit room!</li>
            <li> A bonus is that it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use and works great.&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the strength by placing more or less drops of essential</li>
            <li> I really like this, subtle light and the mist makes for a lovely atmosphere.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quiet (and the little noise it makes is relaxing,) and my apartment is filled with such a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it seems like the smell is more intense when you first turn it on and then dies down quickly.</li>
            <li> I have other glass-blown diffusers that work a lot better, and for comparable price.</li>
            <li> Since, I have bought one for 3 other people and they all love it too.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this with my doterra essential oils.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was going to be, but I still love it!</li>
            <li> Will be buying more for my other bedrooms.</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser and the price was a fraction of the other companies.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive the blue one through a promotion for testing and quality purposes.</li>
            <li> The other thing that would make me like it better is if it came in a neutral color.</li>
            <li> Purchased two and works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> The other diffuser worked for 6 more months (and needed two replacement discs during that time) and then that motor died as well.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased one for a Christmas gift, then one for myself, one for a birthday gift and now this fourth one for me again.</li>
            <li> Although the other one will run on a timer, I feel like this one does more in the 3-4 hours it runs</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;tall&amp;#34; verses &amp;#34;short and wide,&amp;#34; like some other diffusers out there.</li>
            <li> love the other fact that it shuts itself off when it runs out of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quiet and makes my Young Living diffuser sound really loud.</li>
            <li> The mist fills our entire bedroom easily, but you definitely need more than one for an entire house.  </li>
            <li> It has a small footprint, very effectively diffuses essential oil throughout a large room in my home.  </li>
            <li> but I am using distilled water....that may help reduce any possible clogging or need to clean it alot</li>
            <li> I use quality DoTerra essential oils, clean between uses according to directions, and use room temperature tap water as directed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it several times, even though it&#x27;s already clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like that the oil (which I mixed with some water) would eventually boil away, and if you were not careful, it would scald the glass piece at the top.</li>
            <li> I do clean it occasionally with rubbing alcohol as the packaging suggested and that seems to remedy the issue for a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I love more than the soft blue glow and puffy clouds of steam is knowing my family is being treated with therapeutic grade essential oils.  </li>
            <li> lasts a long time, you can use any kind of essential oil and it cleans well.  </li>
            <li> but I love this so much that I just had to break down and do it.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser so much that I had to purchase two additional for other rooms!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It even came by special messenger the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absolutely is just as strong as a candle lit oil burner minus the flames.</li>
            <li> Opened the box, reviewed the simple, easy to follow directions with my 93 year old mother.</li>
            <li> I loved the previous two I purchased, which is why I purchased a third, this one decided not to work however ;(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small and quiet, super easy to refill and clean.  </li>
            <li> But.. I really do love how you can choose your own oils and the scent lasts for a few hours with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this little machine so much!!</li>
            <li> Unless you buy soy candles with a lead free wick, which are expensive, you are better off with this!  </li>
            <li> I got one at first which was taken over by my 5 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> With that said, my friend puts it in her young daughters&#x27; room and they don&#x27;t seem to be interested in it at all.</li>
            <li> It only takes 3-5 drops of scented oil and this thing fills your room with sweet aroma.</li>
            <li> Small and compact fits nice on my desk at work.</li>
            <li> I would love to see it in the dark.</li>
            <li> The packaging looks so pretty and professional.</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed a considerable change after the first night of usage.</li>
            <li> and it has been much warmer than normal).  </li>
            <li> I just wish the top attached better to the base, it doesn&#x27;t seal at all and just sits on top</li>
            <li> Much better than burning insence and no dusty mess.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, less expensive diffuser that would work well enough to fill a room with the wonderful aroma of essential oil.</li>
            <li> Last s a long time, and very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating that I paid good money for this product and it died so quickly.  </li>
            <li> but I almost wish it didn&#x27;t go straight up and had a little curve to the top.</li>
            <li> My new diffuser came in the mail!</li>
            <li> I ordered the blue model though there are other colors available) and I find the light adds to the calming effect of the oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased better diffusers for less money and WOULD NEVER buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Now, it easily runs for 3 hours until the reservoir is empty every time.  </li>
            <li> A diffuser that runs for a shorter period of time is better also, because you&#x27;re using less oils.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly at night because that is when I am in my room.</li>
            <li> Only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have enough money to buy more....</li>
            <li> I made sure the water wasn&#x27;t low and turned it back on.</li>
            <li> This particular diffuser was defective from the start.  </li>
            <li> Press the button once to turn on, twice to turn off the light only, and three to completely turn off the machine.</li>
            <li> The light is soft enough to use even at night and not be too distracting to sleep with</li>
            <li> This diffuser can be used with the light which creates a soft blue glow or without.  </li>
            <li> I was worried by some of the one-star reviews, especially those mentioning the ones that quick working after a week.  </li>
            <li> Soft blue light.  </li>
            <li> really do love this thing and am now considering a bigger one from the same company for my downstairs.  </li>
            <li> really do love this thing and am now considering a bigger one from the same company for my downstairs.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was the same design only would hold more water.</li>
            <li> and I wanted -- quietly diffuses essential oils into the air, refreshing my house and those in it.</li>
            <li> My kids love using it in their rooms for the essential oils benefit and the blue glow it gives off.</li>
            <li> the main reservoir.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blue light is soft and soothing.  </li>
            <li> After doing much research, I found this to be one of the most reliable brands...and one of the few that is backed by a one year warranty.</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks compared to others that I have seen that are more expensive and in many cases not as pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it gets oily over time and if you put it close to a wall it will leave water there, so be sure to keep it away and in the middle of a table in a room.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only wish it could hold more liquid so it would run longer, but it does run for a couple of hours before the liquid and essential oils dissipate.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would love is one that can handle a larger room.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s super quiet.</li>
            <li> This may not put out as much &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; as some other diffusers, but that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little diffuser, but it doesn&#x27;t cover a very large area.</li>
            <li> Very pretty blue lights.</li>
            <li> the blue is very pretty and the water trickle</li>
            <li> Although I will say that my kids love to mess with this</li>
            <li> The blue is very pretty and soothing.</li>
            <li> With this one I don&#x27;t need to know much about them since this one works right out of the box since it&#x27;s so simple to use.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just a matter of being filled slightly too high, or</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>

            <li> After receiving one as a gift, using it daily, and being exceedingly happy with how it automatically turns off and fills an approximately 15&#x27; x 10&#x27; space with a light essential oil aroma - I bought one for my brother who also loves it.</li>

            <li> The second replacement disc got the second diffuser working just fine right away, and it DOES have instructions on the back of the package, along with an aftermarket UPC label, so I think the first one just had the directions covered up.  </li>
            <li> But as expected everything looked fine on the inside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, and the option of light or no light is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was actually surprised at how large this diffuser was when I got it and opened the box.</li>
            <li> I really love this little gadget.</li>
            <li> This little guy is OK.</li>
            <li> and then a little lavender is a lovely for ending the day.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing.</li>
            <li> But other then that it works well and is cool to look at!  </li>
            <li> Wish it would disburse they oil scent a little more evenly.</li>
            <li> Replacement piece fixed the diffuser!!  </li>
            <li> love the quality of this little diffuser</li>
            <li> I love this little thing.</li>
            <li> and it worked a little better but would still shut off before it ran out of water, so</li>
            <li> It seems maybe a little more of a mist, than a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Their advice was to clean it and let it dry before using again.</li>
            <li> I also use it in our bedrooms at night if someone is ill, great was to help deliver therapeutic scents like eucalyptus to the sinuses.</li>
            <li> Some of these diffusers get really expensive and this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Spend a few dollars more and get the Doterra Lotus diffuser if you want four hours of quality diffusing.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s still on or it&#x27;s out of water, but turn the light off at night to keep the room dark (dark rooms are better for quality sleep).  </li>
            <li> so simple and so powerful---</li>
            <li> Fun to watch and working well with occasional use.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> (I have a few friends that have it and LOVE it)</li>
            <li> I add more than a few drops because I like stronger smells.  </li>
            <li> however, if i reeeeally want to use citrus, i have a normal electric and a candle burner for oils i can use.</li>
            <li> you need to do is apply a few drops of the oil you want and you will be able to smell it as the diffuser gives off mist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really useful with the proper oils, even for therapeutic uses.</li>
            <li> I have used three different types of essential oils diffusers, and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was not only mesmerizing to look at</li>
            <li> I love this product for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser and use it just about everyday while I sleep.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser however it is pretty small, but does the job!</li>
            <li> I made sure no water got in the vent, turned upside down and left 2 days in warm dry weather (I live in Southern California</li>
            <li> My entire master bedroom and bath smelled amazing in less than an hour</li>
            <li> Its so easy to use and has been non stop diffusing for the last several days since it arrived.</li>
            <li> Liked the way it worked, but only worked for less than four months.  </li>
            <li> We love it so much we&#x27;re buying a second one for the other part of the house.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to travel meaning you have to literally be right next to it to appreciate the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that it emits just the right amount of humidity</li>
            <li> There are lots of great things about the diffuser including that it can (1) free a home of candle or other artificial (and possibly toxic) methods to bring aromatherapy into your space, (2) offer novelty seekers a huge variety of aromas (each use of this device lasts about 3-4 hours) without having to clutter a home with individual candles or plug-ins (3) be a pretty accent to a room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its smaller and lasts around 2-3 hours before its empty which is totally fine by me!</li>
            <li> bedtime I moved it next to my bed and the soft blue glow of light really gave it a relaxing ambiance.  </li>
            <li> I just put it on the other side of my lamp to block out some of the light.</li>
            <li> Waste of money received better results when I  put essential oils in hot water.</li>
            <li> I need a new part</li>
            <li> Now when I move to new house</li>
            <li> but after that just like new.</li>
            <li> I returned it and am reluctant to try a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months and it still works like new.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t hear soon I will be returning to Amazon and finding something new.</li>
            <li> The manufacturing company emailed me and said I must have a faulty disc in the bottom and they&#x27;re sending me a new one.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope the new disc will solve all the problems.</li>
            <li> They promptly sent me a new one, with no hassle.</li>
            <li> but then when you do it works like new.  </li>
            <li> - Plan to buy a new one when the discs are no longer are the problem.  </li>
            <li> Assuming you pay $30 for this, that&#x27;s $75 a year for new diffusers and discs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to aromatherapy</li>
            <li> This unit is easy to fill and scents about half the house.</li>
            <li> but as soon as its empty it shuts off and I am back to refilling :).</li>
            <li> and she should clean it out and dry completely.</li>
            <li> You can have the option of the blue light on or off but the on/off switch stays blue.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  </li>
            <li> I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> It was really easy to use, fill using filtered water to the full line, add 3 to 5 drops of essential oil, put the lid back on, hit the button, and wala, room fills with a fresh scent in only 1 minute for small rooms, 3 to 5 minutes for large rooms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter is very sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> My wife is very much into essential oils and their therapeutic properties</li>
            <li> I have an aroma ace diffuser and it is very loud, so</li>
            <li> and they seem to be fine so far, so perhaps mine must be defective, although it seems several others are having the same problem, so</li>
            <li> I am new to using essential oils and found that warmers just seem to make the oils too hot and the oils smell burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really make the whole house much less the whole room smell as much as i had hoped.</li>
            <li> Pretty LED blue color.</li>
            <li> The light does turn off, if you prefer it dark.</li>
            <li> Although I love the mist and it&#x27;s aroma, again the aroma could be stronger and I am not sure if the mist will discolor or ruin any surface I have played it on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the first presents I&#x27;ve bought for her that she actually likes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase more for other rooms, but for that reason alone I will probably try a different one.</li>
            <li> It completely died out on me today!  </li>
            <li> I thoroughly examined all the components and the only logical conclusion</li>
            <li> so I am sure my experience was not the usual</li>
            <li> This is my first diffusser and I was reluctant to purchase because the reviews were mixed</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner which I was pleased with because I was anxious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a simple diffuser that works very well!</li>
            <li> However, after the first day, it would short out after 1 minute of operation.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is quiet,(a soft bubbling sound can be heard when the room is quiet), very simple to use, and diffuses the aromas well.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser but will not be my last.</li>
            <li> I returned the first litemist I purchased to Amazon for shutting of after only 5 or 10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> I filled it and went to turn it on the other night and its completely shot ...</li>
            <li> Well, sure enough one of the two no longer works after only 2 months of use (and only used about a dozen times).  </li>
            <li> but for the cost I think it&#x27;s a pretty solid purchase.</li>
            <li> for a small area, wish i held more liquid.....</li>
            <li> Because of this gift, we are now regular haunts at the local healthy store&#x27;s essential oil aisle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /therapeutic properties of essential oils, there are other products out there that are better suited for the task.  </li>
            <li> Got the first as a present for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Pretty, quiet, hassle-free.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly so far!</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s probably a touch smaller than you are expecting, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a nightlight that shines a pretty blue )</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my daughter&#x27;s second grade teacher.</li>
            <li> DO NOT waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Even after several months it still feels nurturing and special when I crawl into bed, breathe deeply, and let the cares of the day melt away.</li>
            <li> but I had to constantly add water so that the tempreture wouldn&#x27;t get too hot and boil the oils causing a huge mess on my walls and table.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to fill and lasts a few hrs on each filling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions were ridiculously easy to follow, just a few steps.</li>
            <li> I got the blue one and love the color it lets out in the dark.</li>
            <li> Then it started only running for a short time and turning off, even though it was still full.  </li>
            <li> The other unit offers a better array of lights and operation ‚îÄ 3 modes (i.e. rotate color, fixed color, low-light), and there is only one piece or &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; to remove when you add oil.  </li>
            <li> The vapor only seems to go about 6&amp;#34; above the unit, then falls towards the table, so I&#x27;m not sure that it gets the oil into the air as good as it could.</li>
            <li> ZAQ Allay Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser - 80 ML Capacity, Blue  Package arrived quickly and</li>
            <li> There is only one on/off button which makes the diffuser super simple to operate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, super simple to use and works like a dream.</li>
            <li> And like some other reviewers have stated, I too had the issue where it would turn off early sometimes when it was still full.</li>
            <li> have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t put out enough scent for a large room, but I have not found that to be the case.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I miss is there is no timer to set for a certain amount of time like the Doterra diffuser</li>
            <li> Fills a large master bedroom with therapeutic essential oil aromas in seconds!</li>
            <li> The aroma from the essential oils covers a large area.</li>
            <li> Goodbye large humidifiers with filters that only use distilled water.</li>
            <li> I use 100% pure essential oils with it, and I have always used the recommended amount of drops in it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic little diffuser.</li>
            <li> This little diffuser is fantastic for the price and helped my wife while she was in labor.</li>
            <li> I love this little glowing essential oils diffuser!  </li>
            <li> This little diffuser is quiet, and it works alot better then the young living diffuser that my MIL has.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I would love it a little more if it stayed on at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Also great when you have a cold.</li>
            <li> Maybe this would work great in a small apartment of a small room in the house.</li>
            <li> Fill the water tank up to max level line (this line is clearly defined in the instruction</li>
            <li> The power button cycles through &amp;#34;on, light off, off&amp;#34;.  Simple, but works as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the area covered is what I hoped it to be, but for a small space I believe it would work great.</li>
            <li> I just got it and like it so far.  </li>
            <li> Also, while it doesn&#x27;t use much water (maybe about 2 tablespoons), it seems to run for several hours.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s about how far the aromatics will travel.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> It works all night in the background, has an automatic shutoff when it empties, and is ready to go again the next day.</li>
            <li> It spreads pretty well, and it doesn&#x27;t take too long to make the room smell like the oil.</li>
            <li> I like that you can turn of the led, wish the power led would dim as well.</li>
            <li> I really like it but wish I would have bought a bigger one.</li>
            <li> I use 6 days a week once per day, after 2 years the motor is dying (loud gurgly noises)</li>
            <li> but nothing ever fixed it.</li>
            <li> I also bought one in January, not even a month old</li>
            <li> I keep a piece of heavy paper on my nightstand, with one side folded up to cover the light, and it seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> It really pumps out the essential oils and runs until the water is gone.</li>
            <li> It is not used frequently.  </li>
            <li> so much so bought a second one.</li>
            <li> I read many negative reviews regarding this product, but I bought it anyway.  </li>
            <li> away from this product until the defect is fixed.</li>
            <li> I preferred my old diffuser with timer and twist on cover</li>
            <li> Two weeks ago it ran all night long, smelling hot and toxic by morning.</li>
            <li> It was, and is malfunctioning, and could be a real safety hazard, starting a fire, or melting the components of the device, running without water in it.</li>
            <li> It does not get all clogged up like the Young Living Diffusers.  </li>
            <li> far I have used this diffuser in our bedroom, kitchen and living room.</li>
            <li> So far I like the product.</li>
            <li> But the blue glows very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has the option of light or no light.  </li>
            <li> My 4 yr old would ask for me to turn it on on days</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had it now for about 8 months and use it frequently.  </li>
            <li> Gave my diffuser from Young Living to my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Young Living has been out of Diffusers for months.  </li>
            <li> Tried to contact Zaq.com directly to see what they would say</li>
            <li> I have been using this product frequently for almost a year</li>
            <li> It has really increased my interest in essential oils and their healing/emotional qualities.  </li>
            <li> I got it and then not functional at all very soon at the 2nd week.</li>
            <li> one for home and one for my friends house where I frequent.</li>
            <li> I really really like the Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser!</li>
            <li> but it was just too loud.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll ask her how much to use of the essential oil.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy at least 3 more and give them as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing and quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely defective.  </li>
            <li> I  pushes out way  too much  of the  essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Cost</li>
            <li> My 11 year old likes it</li>
            <li> I really wish it was bigger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to noise and it gurgles, to me</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does make some sounds, they just sound like gurgling water, but I find them soothing after I have gotten used to them after a few nights.</li>
            <li> We use this every day and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it (purchased in March), works well with all oils we&#x27;ve used so far (Young Living, Doterra, Veriditas Botanicals).</li>
            <li> The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about</li>
            <li> and my 3 year old has knocked it off a couple times.</li>
            <li> and I really wouldn&#x27;t want a bigger</li>
            <li> I really appreciate how quiet this one is.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law ordered one, and when I saw hers in action I just had to have one.</li>
            <li> When the lights are low for facials it looks really soothing as well.</li>
            <li> but I only seem to need the 4 hours, so is it really a drawback?</li>
            <li> the oils keep their natural aromatherapy benefits when diffusing.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> If they fixed this defect from the factory, I would consider buying another one.</li>
            <li> I have been using it nightly in my five year old daughter&#x27;s room with Plant Therapy oils</li>
            <li> I set it on a low table in my room next to my bed and the blue light doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I bought two and so far</li>
            <li> Then I completely broke and I&#x27;m contacting the company now.</li>
            <li> I recently developed interest in aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> When I got this I filled the bottom part with water as instructed and added a few drops of frankincense oil and turned it on.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it doesn‚Äôt take much time to make it work and it lasts for up to 4 hours of constant use.</li>
            <li> Essential Oils can really change your mood.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hear it humming like the diffuser I have from Young Living.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My 9 year old son asked for one for Christmas, to put in his room.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very affordable diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works well so far.  </li>
            <li> Then you drop in a few drops of your choice of oils, replace the cones on top, and plug the unit back into the cord.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful enough to fill a standard bedroom with the aromatherapy oil I use for my kiddos.  </li>
            <li> Love it just what I wanted Used it everyday all winter with essential oil to keep flu away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small,you can smell it only when you sitting right next to it,  tried different kinds oils,</li>
            <li> Smells great, looks cool, and is less expensive than similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> this little diffuser works amazingly well AND turns itself off when it&#x27;s empty!</li>
            <li> We also appreciated that we could use a variety of essential oils, such as lavender for a calming feeling, or any other of the many and variety of essential</li>
            <li> Worked well for the first few days, after that the aroma of my oils would die down pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Diffuses oils nicely, easy to use and small.</li>
            <li> it turned itself off while the water basin was still half full.  </li>
            <li> After about a month of use, the diffuser now stops when the reservoir is over half full.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like strong scents and have a small room, it would work.</li>
            <li> Too bright, and I think this diffuser is not strong enough compare to other product that i purchased, i guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I tried to clean it out thinking it was clogged - and while it helped a little it still has lost it&#x27;s strength.</li>
            <li> But eventually the oil stains the inside so bad that no amount of cleaning with alcohol is going to get it clean, kind of like how coffee stains your plastic insulated coffee mugs</li>
            <li> No mess.  </li>
            <li> If you only use a few drops of oil with a full tank of water it doesn&#x27;t put out much scent at all.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable and I would compare it to some of the more expensive diffusers.</li>
            <li> It is almost ridiculous how much we love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I like the slight gurgly sound from the water when it runs (you can hear it in a quiet room, but I don&#x27;t find it to be intrusively loud).</li>
            <li> I was busy with work and didn&#x27;t have time to research to see if this was normal until recently</li>
            <li> My older children have asked for one to keep in their rooms at night to double as a nightlight.</li>
            <li> I love this difusser, small enough to take with us on vacation.</li>
            <li> The first time used, it only lasted several minutes.  </li>
            <li> and I can smell it pretty strongly on my entire 2nd floor (2 bedrooms, a hall and a bath)</li>
            <li> This was the second diffuser I ordered since the first one didn&#x27;t work( different brand).</li>
            <li> one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied is that there is still a small puddle at the bottom of the bowl when it&#x27;s *</li>
            <li> Quiet and with a calming blue color, this diffuser is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Last about 5 hours steadily.  </li>
            <li> My main reason for purchasing was to add essential oils to help with congestion while I slept.  </li>
            <li> I also don‚Äôt like the smell of commercial air freshener, they always have this chemically smell, never fresh or light.</li>
            <li> Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil diffuser is of decent size-80 ml.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for use with essential oils.</li>
            <li> We use this item daily and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this diffuser and I will definitely be using mine</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than other diffusers, we love it, I have it running all day long, usually take 2 refills for the whole day of diffusing.</li>
            <li> Very easy to fill and use; simply remove the colored cover, and a small plastic framing piece, pour water and scent to the line, place covers back on and hit the power</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a very powerful little guy!</li>
            <li> But when I filled it with water and oil it only ran for about half an hour before it shut off.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item September 2nd, 2013 based on several positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s diffuses the oil very well and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, the power button is always lit with a small LED light if it is on.  </li>
            <li> They stay on for several hours and put out plenty of mist for a normal sized bedroom.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It shuts off with a full tank of water every few minutes.</li>
            <li> They produce a heavy stream of cool mist.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my diffuser in the mail but that quickly turned to disappointment.</li>
            <li> Perfectly adequate little diffuser.</li>
            <li> I learned that there are many chemicals in such items that should be avoided, and so I started searching for more natural ways to freshen the air of my apartment, especially in the winter months when it&#x27;s too cold for me to open</li>
            <li> /&gt;While certain candles may fill a larger space with aroma, this seems to work in the area that I currently have it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser along with the 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Basic Sampler Essential Oil Gift Set.</li>
            <li> I use this in a large, open 20x20 room and have no problem with smelling the essential oil anywhere in the room.</li>
            <li> It was fun while it lasted, but it didn&#x27;t last near long enough.  </li>
            <li> I would guess that in large spaces or with high ceilings, this device would be less effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent more on other diffusers and had the same result as this one.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and the company that makes them and Amazon had me send it back and overnighted me a new one.</li>
            <li> My neighbors are smokers (live in a condo) and running this w essential oil helps me from jumping out the window.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and diffusing but with the doterra oils it does the trick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using essential oils</li>
            <li> Built very sturdy and a breeze to wipe dry and refill</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly for several months and it still works really well.</li>
            <li> I got the blue, but I really wish it came in just white</li>
            <li> For scents that are more delicate, like lavender, it will smell the entire room but the scent goes away as soon as it is no longer diffusing.</li>
            <li> I have several diffusers and I have to say this one is by far one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> I just want to say after a couple hours you will need to put another 5 drops in for essential oils, even though it&#x27;s still half full.</li>
            <li> The main problem I had with this product is the fact that it does not stay on long before turning off automatically.  </li>
            <li> really enjoyed the lamp while it lasted although it would only hold a very small amount of water.</li>
            <li> such simple remedies have such a positive effect.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I was lax on cleaning it, but overall I tried to remember to clean it after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It only takes a drop or two of essential oil added to the water and it creates a steady mist.</li>
            <li> This was a decent enough diffuser except for the fact that it only lasted for 1-2.5 hours instead of 3-4.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cut short on me a couple times while there is still water left over, however, I think it was the particular oil I had been using (not water-soluble).</li>
            <li> It works pretty decent for my small apartment.</li>
            <li> Have had this little diffuser for 2 months, use it almost daily, and enjoy it immensely.  </li>
            <li> This model is able to handle our master bedroom with ease and distributes the oil&#x27;s scent just a little ways down the hall.</li>
            <li> We agree with the other positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> It generally goes about three hours before shutting off.</li>
            <li> Save your money avoid this company in general.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally leave reviews.</li>
            <li> The water container inside is a bit small, so it only runs for an hour or so before turning off and needs to be filled up.</li>
            <li> The steam lasts for about 3 hours when fully filled, and I usually put 5 drops of my choice of essential oils (3-5 drops is recommended).</li>
            <li> Under the blue cone there is another clear plastic cone.</li>
            <li> It Uses ultrasonic waves to work with water and natural essential oil in the tank, spray mist for aromatherapy, humidifying, purifying for your home,office,Car .</li>
            <li> Press a third time, and the diffuser will turn completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that once it is empty it automatically turns off.</li>
            <li> I like how the entire unit will shut off completely when its done.</li>
            <li> So naturally I bought a 2nd 1</li>
            <li> I have Young Living Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> ZAQ apparently has a quality assurance issue.  </li>
            <li> I nearly had a heart attack at the price I paid for it, especially concerning</li>
            <li> Use it for my Young Living Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li> Delivering whatever blends of natural oils I choose into the air it not only doesn&#x27;t upset my asthma but soothes my body and mind.</li>
            <li> Really like the auto shutoff when empty too.</li>
            <li> Try it using Thieves essential oil from Young Living..</li>
            <li> Longest lasting diffuser I&#x27;ve had so far...</li>
            <li> I am now busy compiling an arsenal of every essential oil known to man....</li>
            <li> You can buy one jar of essential oil and it will last MUCH longer than any candle since a 3-4 hour cycle in the diffusser uses only 5 drops.</li>
            <li> Well, apparently I didn&#x27;t read everything well because I didn&#x27;t realize this was a water/oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li> One stopped all together in December, the second makes a loud buzzing noise and I don&#x27;t trust it to stay in my kids room.  </li>
            <li> My 14 yr old recently began having insomnia.</li>
            <li> Rather than send it back, I contacted Bombay Electronics site directly.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I miss is that my first diffuser would alternate with 4-5 different colors and this one only glows with one color.  </li>
            <li> water reservoir holds about a small dixie cup full of water.</li>
            <li> Afterwards I found with a thin wisp of vapor curling out of the elegantly arched neck.  </li>
            <li> : I ordered two more and one is already broken after using it for four weeks.</li>
            <li> I would prefer it to be able to run intermittently and emit a little less moisture.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that when I am diffusing oils (and they are not cheap oils) it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how many drops I use, nobody can smell them unless you are standing right next to the machine.</li>
            <li> diffuser has no intermittent function (which, as it turns out, I really like on my other diffuser) and it emits quite a large amount of mist, making whatever surface it&#x27;s sitting on wet if run continuously!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really only need a few drops of oil to fill a large room (large by my big city living standards!)</li>
            <li> I immediately sent it back, got a new one and it too only stayed on for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously considering purchasing another diffuser in the future, even though this is so easy to take room to room (have to save up a little first!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously considering purchasing another diffuser in the future, even though this is so easy to take room to room (have to save up a little first!)</li>
            <li> Add some water and a few drops of essential oil and the scent quickly fills the room.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many that were too weak and did not give off enough scent.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t exactly timed the exact amount of time but it holds such a small amount of water it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would go for as long as it does.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser, but I wish it lasted longer than 4 hours other than that I would</li>
            <li> My other diffuser from another company really fills up the room with scent and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really hope that the other 2 that I bought as gifts continue to work.</li>
            <li> After several trips to the Dr. and allergy specialist for other bizarre and unexplainable symptoms we have found she suffers from many types of allergies and that insomnia is one of the effects on her body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different essential oils and live in a very open concept.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the brightness of the blue light.</li>
            <li> It also only has one color (as opposed to various) and the 2 led&#x27;s clearly show through the plastic.  </li>
            <li> So far, 2 out of the 3 have stopped working suddenly even after proper cleaning.   </li>
            <li> We have the blue and the yellow one, my 5 year old loves having one in her bedroom.</li>
            <li> This only runs for about 3 hours when completely full, which usually does the job</li>
            <li> I use distilled water and quality YL essential oils, usually 3 drops in a full reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently</li>
            <li> This little thing really works!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this not only for it&#x27;s calming therapy, but the warmth it adds to the dry winter air.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it doesn&#x27;t hold much water, therefore does not last long.</li>
            <li> You just fill it to the line with tap water, add a few drops of essential oil, and it starts right up every time.</li>
            <li> Releases just the right amount of scent which you choose be adding a few drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, we love this little thing - a few drops of essential oils and some water and</li>
            <li> I have had that problem and am probably guilty of using a few extra drops because we are all suffering from colds and allergies this week, so I will need to clean it out and resist the temptation to add more than I should in the future.</li>
            <li> Worked well when I first got it but only had it less than a month before it stopped misting.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in that, though it was no fault of the seller, but my mom was happy about it, because she uses it in their room, and she is deaf, so the color changing probably would have made her wake up.</li>
            <li> so you can see it in the dark, all you really need.</li>
            <li> -- apparently, you have only 30 days to return this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now March and only one barely works.  </li>
            <li> Button to adjust the amount of fog,the small one works for essential oils,the big one for cool Mist Humidifier .</li>
            <li> I wish it held more water, and the blue light on the on/off switch is annoying, but I just block it.</li>
            <li> size and design are functional and useful for small areas.</li>
            <li> We had it working within the first few minutes</li>
            <li> You can smell them the first few min</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t timed it, but when it&#x27;s full of water, I would estimate that it lasts at least 6 hours or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard not to get mad when an item that had worked perfectly for 2 1/2 months just suddenly stops working 2 min after turning it on.</li>
            <li> i tried all of the potential solutions in the Q &amp; A, and not a single one worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just the right size for my small apartment.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser, it is easy to use; however I don&#x27;t care for the water gurgle that it makes - sounds like a dog licking its paws...sort of irritating.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is worth trying to purchase a replacement kit for the ceramic piece or not--probably order another, of a different brand--because 3 months just isn&#x27;t going to cut it for me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quite and takes up little space.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser does not hold much water so it doesn&#x27;t last a long time between refills, but other than that</li>
            <li> After comparing several oil diffusers online and reading blog recommendations/reviews this is one of the less expensive oil diffuser I&#x27;ve found that work just as good as the more expensive ones (per reviews I&#x27;ve read).</li>
            <li> Amazon took it back and shipped a  new difuser.i should have heeded the warnings from the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Just not strong enough to cover a large area.</li>
            <li> The mist goes straight up and then usually comes straight back down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order another one that is less than this and others have rated highly to try.</li>
            <li> This one was a little cheaper and, as such, it seems that it&#x27;s not as high of quality as the more expensive one.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it when the new one will probably break too.</li>
            <li> I am not expecting this to be built like a tank, but for the price I paid, I expect the sucker to work right.</li>
            <li> you want an aroma therapy machine that is reliable, do yourself a favor and pass on this one.ect the sucker to work right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this diffuser because there are so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews, but after this died on me in less than 90 days feel like I need</li>
            <li> I have used three or four different types of diffusers and this one has far outlasted and outperformed any of the other ones.</li>
            <li> I did read another review that the diffuser would shut off before being completely empty of water but after contacting the manufacturer she was told it was probably due to using too much oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but is only good for small spaces such as the bathroom :(</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased several other diffusers the past couple of years (including used ones) and none of them have ever died let alone this quickly.</li>
            <li> but so far I have not done anything other than refill pick the oil/oils I want to diffuse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I don&#x27;t see other reviews with this problem.</li>
            <li> I had a diffuser before (a different brand) and didn&#x27;t use distilled water and it ruined it, although we do have pretty hard water in my city.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works really well for small rooms only like the size of a kids bedroom.</li>
            <li> Therefore, to clean it, you can leave the cord behind and just take the unit to the sink.</li>
            <li> Therefore, to clean it, you can leave the cord behind and just take the unit to the sink.</li>
            <li> Really helpful with the oils and small enough to take with when we travel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold enough water therefore doesn&#x27;t run long enough</li>
            <li> Too small for a large room.</li>
            <li> Small but fills a large room with diffused scents.</li>
            <li> - Plan to pay a couple extra bucks every few months for a new disc to keep it running.</li>
            <li> I dry it out and use a cotton ball to soak up any moisture (the instructions say to use a Q-tip, but I find that&#x27;s not a big enough absorbent area).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dry it out and use a cotton ball to soak up any moisture (the instructions say to use a Q-tip, but I find that&#x27;s not a big enough absorbent area).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The water will last several hours and it turns itself off once the water runs dry.</li>
            <li> Lasted a whole year of heavy use!</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t ready to commmit to spening a small fortune on one.</li>
            <li> Anything much beyond that, is just pointless for the sake of aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;Trust</li>
            <li> - it was my only one for a long time, and I was using it with &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think that aroma hangs around long enough.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Last only a 1 or 2 hrs max, expected an intermitent mode but only has 3 (off/</li>
            <li> (just under 9\\&quot; tall), but it had such high reviews compared to other similar models that cost less.</li>
            <li> The old down side is having to refill the water often and cord.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it had a little more power behind it.  </li>
            <li> but seriously with any normal room you&#x27;d have a hard time smelling it and getting the full effect.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> We use our mister for essential oils and to add moisture to the air during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> It completely stopped working less than 3 months after I bought it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold much water.</li>
            <li> The most common complaint was it shut off or stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that the build-up from hard water as well as the oil interacting with the hard water is pretty much no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this for my parents for Christmas last year, only to find out it has broken down and won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old can mess with it all day and not get hurt or break it.</li>
            <li> The plug on the back came loose and fell off.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser is still at least half full.</li>
            <li> The water is still room temp and at least half full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other, more expensive diffusers, but they&#x27;ve died within months.</li>
            <li> Read several other reviews stating the same.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said, its one touch to turn on then the second touch turns off the blue light.&lt;br</li>
            <li> particular diffuser is small, but powerful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only down side is the price is a little high for what it is.</li>
            <li> love this thing, I use it all the time, I have a head cold</li>
            <li> I have used this diffuser for a few months so far</li>
            <li> This is simple, and works just as expected.</li>
            <li> This thing is considerably smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> They offer this Allay diffuser in three colors which are blue, orange, and pink.</li>
            <li> I tried it about 10 times and carefully cleaned it after every use, but each time it would shut off in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> Now I have had it too long to return it.</li>
            <li> My problem is with how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Who knows how long that will take so</li>
            <li> feel like it doesn&#x27;t run as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected, but it works and thats all that I care about.</li>
            <li> It only stayed on for 10 minutes instead of the alleged 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I would like it to run until empty but not a big deal</li>
            <li> I have one in blue and one in pink.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time and turns off by itself.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get an atomizer.  </li>
            <li> been looking for a oil diffuser for a long time</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve been having is that the unit will sometimes shut itself off before the basin is empty.</li>
            <li> They have agreed to replace the unit so long as I pay shipping and handling of $18.00.</li>
            <li> Maybe 3 hrs, sometimes not that long.</li>
            <li> It runs for a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as it holds up, I&#x27;ll be recommending these to friends.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not very mechanically inclined to replace parts even if they are simple in nature.  </li>
            <li> Have had these for a long time.</li>
            <li> I recommend the blue version over the pink version.</li>
            <li> It has a long cord.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> Ease to use and lasts a long time before having to fill the tank.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, not much of a water reservoir .</li>
            <li> I had a different &amp;#34;infuser&amp;#34; that after a year of use was so loud I could not sleep due to the noise - it was much larger than this, so I will take the small size over noise any day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much water, maybe a half a cup and just a few drops of EO.</li>
            <li> My daughter took this to her work place and uses it in the loby, and and has not been sick since, where as before she was catching everyones sickness</li>
            <li> I used this diffuser for less than a month, and it completely stopped working, despite following care instructions, and using less than 20 times.  </li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a smaller well than what I am used to, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as others....</li>
            <li> I chose pink to save a few dollars, but would like to try blue for my next one, as one of these is not enough.</li>
            <li> I have had the diffuser for about 2 months and use it almost daily and have absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> I used it daily, so I&#x27;m not sure if it is only designed for occasional use?</li>
            <li> Saw that some other reviewers had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I have read other reviews stating it just needs to be cleaned properly.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I tried filling it to different levels, but nothing works!</li>
            <li> It works for longer time compared to other essential  oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li> plan to purchase a 2nd unit and take it to my extremely stressful workplace.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, 2 months after I got the second unit, it too met its demise in the same manner as the first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to diffuse other essential oils in it to ward off sickness.</li>
            <li> I use it at night typically with a high quality essential oil mix known as &amp;#34;Breathe.&amp;#34;  No more stuffy nose in the morning.  </li>
            <li> doesnt stay on very long</li>
            <li> If anyone in the house is sick, I diffuse lavender and tea tree EO and helps clear us up quickly!</li>
            <li> the water ran dry during the night but the diffuser didn&#x27;t turn off like it was supposed to, cracking the heating element.  </li>
            <li> Washed it out, let it dry throughly for 2 days, and still continued to shut off after 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think cleaning the unit and letting it dry out will solve that according to the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> (there was still water in the reservoir, it wasn&#x27;t running dry).  </li>
            <li> Runs about 30-45 minutes for me (dry environment).</li>
            <li> Leave the two units separate for a while to dry.</li>
            <li> has a shutoff when liquid runs dry.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that when it is filled to capacity with room temp.</li>
            <li> Uses only few drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li> When it lighs up, the pink is a bit red, but it fades to pink.</li>
            <li> , you only put a few maybe 3 out 4 drips of essential oil in then there is a cone that goes on after that</li>
            <li> The plug which is not attached so that about every 3 used you wipe the fluid base out with a soft cotton or tissue easily,  then Plug it in and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> When this arrived I was a little surprised at the size, it was a little smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Have had it for about 4 days now and have used it every single day</li>
            <li> , I turned it on in morning and absolutely nothing works, not a good thing at 35.99 price.</li>
            <li> No more post nasal drip and having to clear my throat all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the timer feature was so not worth the extra $100.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product twice and it only lasted on average 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Clearly it&#x27;s a consistent problem with this product if both of mine failed in the same way at about the same usage point, and it&#x27;s happening to a lot of other users.</li>
            <li> What kind of company offers a product without a return policy, a company that knows they sell horrible products that wont last...</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was the outer top, which is the blue cone part, does not snap or click onto the base.</li>
            <li> I opened it up to see if maybe a wire had come loose or something.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would not recommend this product, it&#x27;s a big let down.</li>
            <li> It would come on and then automatically shut back down.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely looooooove this little thing!!!</li>
            <li> I wish it came in other colors, but other than that, it diffuses quietly and and it&#x27;s calming to watch.</li>
            <li> I saw many reviewer mentioned the same problem :(</li>
            <li> I leave him on my counter in the kitchen and will typically use it on the weekends with differing essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product less than a year and have followed directions for proper use</li>
            <li> A few drops of essential oils go a long way.</li>
            <li> The other one lasts about three hours before shutting off due to low water content.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this is for a smaller room - a really small room.</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy another one and it has only lasted a month and a half now is broke.</li>
            <li> I find that I don&#x27;t need to use as much essential oil with the Allay since it holds less water than the Mirage.  </li>
            <li> Considering that I cleaned these regularly and they did nothing more than sit on a shelf and run, I&#x27;m disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> The issue I had was that it would only run 30 min to an hour before cutting off, leaving almost a full tank of water in it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disapointed in the fact that it only had a 3-hour run time, this thing holds less then a cup of water, so thats probably why.</li>
            <li> Used mine almost every day for the last year and a half.</li>
            <li> (not sure why the orange one is more expensive?)</li>
            <li> I particularly like how long this one runs--at least 3-4 hours on average.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other aromatherapy diffusers, but they were all difficult to clean or didn&#x27;t run well.</li>
            <li> If it were a little less expensive I would buy one for every room. :)</li>
            <li> I use it every single day!</li>
            <li> We have been using it every single night without any problems !</li>
            <li> I wish the reservoir were a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Have only had this item a little over a month</li>
            <li> Even provides a little zen in larger rooms.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the smaller side</li>
            <li> but maybe I don&#x27;t put enough into the little dish</li>
            <li> Wished it would last a little longer</li>
            <li> A simple fix for all other glowing things in my bedroom has been to cover it with black electrical tape</li>
            <li> but now, only a couple weeks later, there is hardly any vapor at all.  </li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is a great affordable option compared to the crazy expensive models.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is I only get about 4 hours tops put of one tank of water, despite the claims of 8 hours.</li>
            <li> When empty it turns itself off.  </li>
            <li> Lasts about 4 hours and turns off as soon as the water is empty.</li>
            <li> You can have it so the led is on or off and the unit shuts off automatically when it is empty or after 4 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste to use essential oils unless you are using for holistic reasons.</li>
            <li> Use it almost everyday with lemon essential oil.  </li>
            <li> No phone number, no real address.</li>
            <li> Only had this for a few month</li>
            <li> This diffuser is just what I wanted and expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate only having to use a few drops of oil to water to achieve benefits of aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> It does turn itself off when it is empty, so I don&#x27;t have a fear of forgetting to turn it off before I leave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like those that by the time you have left it on for an hour, you area of where the diffuser is like a pool of water.&lt;br /&gt;I put this one in my living room and add a few drops</li>
            <li> The automatic feature shuts it off when empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days.  </li>
            <li> I closed our bedroom door to ensure the diffuser could fill our room</li>
            <li> It shuts off automatically once the reservoir is empty.</li>
            <li> The unit isn&#x27;t as bag as I had expected it to be</li>
            <li> After that it would only stay on for a few minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li> I have to be extremely careful with the scents I have in my environment.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not a problem.  </li>
            <li> this was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I use it in my son&#x27;s room with just a few (3 or so) drops of essential oils and this will fill the room in about a minute.</li>
            <li> I kept turning it back on and it would run for a few minutes then shut off again.  </li>
            <li> I use doTerra essential oils and can smell them throughout the room with just a few drops in this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to restart it 3-4 times before it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m out the $40 bucks I spent.</li>
            <li> I am a forgetful person</li>
            <li> I like how it has automatic shutoff when empty and don&#x27;t need to worry about wasting energy.</li>
            <li> it shuts off when it is empty.</li>
            <li> I can leave it on for a couple of hours, but then it goes empty.</li>
            <li> I only lasted two weeks is damaged not light</li>
            <li> Just fill to the line with water and add a few drops of essential oil</li>
            <li> (only turns on for a few seconds and then turns off).</li>
            <li> add a few drops of essential oil</li>
            <li> empty</li>
            <li> Otherwise works as expected.</li>
            <li> I never really paid attention to that, since I assumed I would not have a problem.</li>
            <li> Come as expected.</li>
            <li> It turns itself off when the reservoir is empty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that one would be offered with a white cone and one with a green cone.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> a few hours later it auto shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I am careful to wipe it out after each use, checking to see no residue is building on the ceramic plate.  </li>
            <li> Base and plug also got too warm for comfort.</li>
            <li> , it is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> First off to those who wrote a bad review about this diffuser, you most likely got a bad one or don&#x27;t know how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> The other diffuser lasted only a few months also.</li>
            <li> uses very little essential oil (3 drops is enough) lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Love this crazy little thing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thats not a good thing when you set this thing to run during the night and you go to bed, not realizing that the unit turned off, only to wake up later to find that the unit once again was unreliable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to assemble the base</li>
            <li> A little oil goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough, and lasts for quite a while before shut off time!  </li>
            <li> I do wish it came in other colours</li>
            <li> and I think it works just as well if not better than the Doterra one that I got next.</li>
            <li> I am not sure on the third one since it was a gift.    </li>
            <li> I believe that MIGHT be the reason the other customers are having theirs break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll usually put 5 drops of essential oil as opposed to the recommended dosage of 3.</li>
            <li> My other one lasted a year, so I had to order another one.</li>
            <li> It is not returnable due to their policy.  </li>
            <li> This is a small diffuser- much smaller than I had anticipated-</li>
            <li> I knew this diffuser only held a small amount of water (from another review)</li>
            <li> Apparently it is now too late to return or get a  refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback to this device is the small size of the water reservoir.</li>
            <li> it abruptly stopped working today.  </li>
            <li> The water was boiling, which is NOT ok for essential oils.</li>
            <li> but you can still smell the oils in other rooms.</li>
            <li> That means you can put it in your bedroom with some lavender or other oil of your choice, and you can fall asleep to it without worrying about a candle burning your house down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other one lasted about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Hoping I don&#x27;t have problems with it quitting like some of the other reviewers mentioned</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works and other times</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else has had this issue, but the unit won&#x27;t turn on at all currently.    </li>
            <li> The other one works intermittently.</li>
            <li> Works well for a small room, like 200 square feet or smaller.</li>
            <li> all my other diffusers went pfft</li>
            <li> and then it will run until it is empty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that there is no customer service, or better information for customers.</li>
            <li> reservoir is small and only runs 3-4 hours, but this is not a gripe.</li>
            <li> For the past two years I have used this almost daily.  </li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve done that, it is back to business as usual.  </li>
            <li> than the other one will in 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I wiped the inner side with small piece of paper towel to absorb the moister.</li>
            <li> I usually use 5 drops of doTerra essential oils.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the small resevoir for water.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying another one or two for other rooms in the house.</li>
            <li> Have used citrus and other oils with it.</li>
            <li> Now I am very careful to stay under the line.  </li>
            <li> but I still expected it to last at least a year.</li>
            <li> I have other, larger diffusers that are now hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I was having to add at least 8-10 drops of oil to get the faintest smell when using my other diffuser and same oils</li>
            <li> tap water, it runs for approximately 3 to 3 and a half hours, so I find myself filling it several times daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product since October 2013 and bought it to diffuse our essential oils (mainly eucalyptus for cold season).  </li>
            <li> and I only put distilled water in it hoping it would prevent any hard water build up and to help keep it cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to see if I can save that little bit of water and oil in a small bottle because I don&#x27;t want a scent or blended scent to mix in with a totally different scent</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m more disappointed in the utter failure of ZAQ to properly address these issues in this product and their failure to provide any customer service.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I read the feedbacks and the only negative feedback that was there</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for over a month and the ONLY COMPLAINT I have is that there is NOT an automatic timer to shut it off.</li>
            <li> Have ordered At least 10 of these diffusers for various people.  </li>
            <li> This product has a defect, and based on the negative reviews its a similar theme throughout.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> For someone that likes the room pitch dark... this won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Have used this every day since I got it (4 days ago) &amp; it runs on average 3-4 hours with a fill.  </li>
            <li> I tried cleaning it as some reviews stated but with no success.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately now not even 6 months later it is already starting to just turn off when it is not even empty yet.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I went back to ZAQ&#x27;s website, which has a link to contact them, along with a video about this common problem.</li>
            <li> Go buy another product this is definitely not worth your money.</li>
            <li> My son is scared of the dark</li>
            <li> i have since found some that last at least 10 hours.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to cycle through the water/oil within 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> For the price it costs, it should at least come with a sampling of some Essential Oils.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the brightness of the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button</li>
            <li> My one complaint might be that the two cover pieces are in no way attached to the base making it more likely you lose them, or they get knocked off.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soothing more than annoying.  </li>
            <li> Maybe tape down a dark piece of fabric around</li>
            <li> I bought it when two of my sons came down with whooping cough.</li>
            <li> But other than that I would recommend!</li>
            <li> it sometimes switched off half way through.  </li>
            <li> Less than 24 hrs with this litemist diffuser</li>
            <li> and then the second only worked for month a half, sadly two weeks after returns accepted.</li>
            <li> but it started leaking and the scent started smelling slightly burned or off.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it lasts seconds, sometimes it lasts half an hour.  </li>
            <li> but less than two weeks using it</li>
            <li> Sometimes the auto off does no work and if you slightly over fill it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser 2 and a half months ago.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet and the faint noise actually puts me to sleep.  </li>
            <li> down with a little virus and ran it every night by my bed with orange and peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of water but when full it lasts for about 3 hours which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> This is not ideal if you want it in your bedroom while sleeping and are sensitive to lights, like I am.  </li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I was a little disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I am using distilled water, because I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a possibility that anything in tap water will mess with the diffuser&#x27;s mechanisms...</li>
            <li> I was frustrated that more expensive diffusers seem to quit working after about 6 months, but this one didn&#x27;t even last 1 month.</li>
            <li> The unit comes with a base, an unpluggable cord, an inner clear plastic cone, and the outer (in our case blue) plastic cone.  </li>
            <li> Wipe it down every few uses, use tap water, and mix in 4- 6 drops of oils.</li>
            <li> I avoided getting full on sick</li>
            <li> I am an Amazon addict and base all of my purchases on product reviews, but this is the first actual review I&#x27;ve written myself.</li>
            <li> It stays running for a long time, I have not timed it however it is a few hours at least.  </li>
            <li> While putting a little bit of moisture in the air, it infuses my chosen oil fragrance into the room.  </li>
            <li> This little guy does everything it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> The little off button still lit up, but I shield it and have no problems sleeping.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over two months ago.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I came home, my apartment would still smell a little bit of lavendar.</li>
            <li> Every so often I would get a little whiff of scent.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> Also, there is little to no scent throw with this.</li>
            <li> I am trying to green-ify my life, one little thing at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this diffuser for a little over 1 month.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the other colors cost more??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> by day 11 of owning this little device, it would not turn on.</li>
            <li> This is a little workhorse...</li>
            <li> and I believe in part it was from this little thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other diffusers in the past but this surpasses them in quality.  </li>
            <li> After doing a little research, I bought this as a gift for my elderly parents and one for my son at Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste yours on this little piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I have had this little guy for a few months now and use it often.</li>
            <li> The condensation part is a little bummer but not huge for the positives that come from this unit.  </li>
            <li> but I like to sleep in a very dark room</li>
            <li> Love to use it when my kiddos are sick and can&#x27;t sleep!</li>
            <li> When I first started using the diffuser it had a high pitched hum which was very annoying; however, after running it for a while it stopped and is now working like a charm.  </li>
            <li> It worked for a few weeks and then just broke.  </li>
            <li> Went through all the trouble shooting issues.</li>
            <li> , this stopped working a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I have been using almost everyday for 2 months, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday, sometimes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind purchasing these every few months</li>
            <li> and it went dead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few products from ZAQ</li>
            <li> I did have trouble with it shutting off prematurely and called the company.</li>
            <li> until a few months after using it</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks now and it works without any problem.</li>
            <li> Has held up well under everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have read of a few others that this has happened to.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of my pricey oils and no help to my daughter&#x27;s allergies.  </li>
            <li> A few time it shut off, I looked inside and there was still plenty of water in it.</li>
            <li> It succeeded in running for a few hours, but then began to overheat.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m not impressed with this machine.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress.\\&quot;  So, defective product is being returned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is running everyday, M-F, all day.  </li>
            <li> Ran this a few times a day for 2 weeks, then stopped using it for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> but now its dead.</li>
            <li> I used to have trouble falling asleep, but not anymore.  </li>
            <li> and then it went dead.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have had no complaints about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a few months use this item became fickle and would not stay on even after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I did keep it, but I&#x27;m not entirely pleased since I wanted one that would be completely dark if I wanted it to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I run it every night in my sons room who has trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li> Tried to return it and returns are not available.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s a few notes on maintenance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just fill, drop a few drops, and turn it on.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> One chamberful of water and a few drops of oil lasts about 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> I cleaned it, did everything the trouble</li>
            <li> /&gt;With just a few drops of oil</li>
            <li> Can also choose the option of steam with no light glowing.  </li>
            <li> today I got tired of dealing with it and am sending it back while I still can.</li>
            <li> We have been using in for a few months and haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> Used it everyday in the morning to diffuse.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was going to be some cheap crap.</li>
            <li> It is dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months</li>
            <li> This arrived dead out of the box.</li>
            <li> I have a few others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve for a few years and decided I needed another couple for my office and living room.  </li>
            <li> I bought two, neither worked after a few months</li>
            <li> Got it for Xmas,  and it&#x27;s dead...</li>
            <li> Used lightly, not even everyday, during that time period.</li>
            <li> The lights still work and the unit automatically shuts down when there is no more water.</li>
            <li> my daughters room is small, and I can smell the lavender and peppermint down the hall.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> appreciate that it uses plain tap water.</li>
            <li> Right when I got sick.</li>
            <li> maybe this one a little too small for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sniffy, sneeze-filled, mess without it!    </li>
            <li> A little on the small side.</li>
            <li> It definitely spreads fragrance around well, but doesn&#x27;t humidify enough, at least for someone like me that suffers from winter dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these over the past few months.  </li>
            <li> Thought about buying a second one, but it is just a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think that if they should be much less expensive if they are only last a couple of months.   </li>
            <li> Disappointed, after using this for only a few times it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> Very little noise</li>
            <li> There is very little noise, and it automatically shuts off after about three hours..  </li>
            <li> It arrived so fast I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> This is ridiculously small.</li>
            <li> Nothing to not love about it.  </li>
            <li> Turns on and sometimes will mist for a few minutes and then shuts off!</li>
            <li> After seeing oil diffusers sold by a lady at a small stand in a market (priced between $60 - $80)</li>
            <li> It has a small capacity and runs for maybe three or four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this use in my small massage business and it&#x27;s does the trick.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t want anyone else to buy an expensive product that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> days past the return period.</li>
            <li> Have had no problems in past month.  </li>
            <li> But it runs for a couple of hours on that small amount of water.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> Its usually around 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> The front desk is small, not a lot of room for things.</li>
            <li> I usually just use it to diffuse oils in the kids&#x27; room at bedtime.</li>
            <li> This is a small unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is.</li>
            <li> Sometime twice a day, but usually just once.</li>
            <li> It shut itself off randomly - sometimes after operating for only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Control the level of scent with the amount of drops, I usually go heavier with about 10 drops.</li>
            <li> have a small candle oil diffuser ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Totally waste my money!</li>
            <li> I usually turn it on while I cook</li>
            <li> so it can be used on small end tables &amp; night stands.  </li>
            <li> The vessel is small</li>
            <li> Even in my daughters small room the diffuser seems to struggle with coverage.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be like the others and just give a small puff here and there.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard in the past that citrus oils can&#x27;t be used with these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works because of the oil or because of the placebo affect</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it works</li>
            <li> I am past the 30 day return mark</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> Zaq Allay is a small Aromatherapy Diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I usually put about 5 drops into the machine</li>
            <li> Maybe it depends on the type of oils I put in, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that I have to pay for a repair part in such a short time.</li>
            <li> Slick.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ll probably have to return the blue ones.</li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day for the past three weeks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this diffuser only lasted a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a defective one or if it is just the brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it will work on this though since it would limit the function of the button; will have to try it and see.  </li>
            <li> But I still would buy another for a small room.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!  </li>
            <li> It will not work after 2 months, of course that is past the return date so</li>
            <li> Simply remove the outer and inner covers that are attached to the base</li>
            <li> So it was not a very good product at all.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this diffuser :(</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s pretty annoying.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> This one was easily the worst!!</li>
            <li> some reason I thought a diffuser might be hard to use.</li>
            <li> Therefore you will never get an possible deposits (especially if in a hard water area) on your furniture or in the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially in winter time during cold season.</li>
            <li> Overall, disappointing that the longevity hasn&#x27;t held.</li>
            <li> At least it was within the return window</li>
            <li> This broke within a week of using it- company tries not to honor their warranty by making it difficult for you to return</li>
            <li> The small blue leds where you fill up the water when turned on show a very faint flicker and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems, it covers 1-2 rooms at least, depending on size of room.  </li>
            <li> The motor made a dreadful sound and it never ran again.</li>
            <li> so no way to access control panel without cutting the thing open.</li>
            <li> feature stopped working, which could be dangerous if left on unattended.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy, but my living room is about 900 square feet with 20 foot ceilings, and this diffuser fills up the entire room with a the diffused scent....</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve seen that this is a common issue with these diffusers.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper and don&#x27;t smell the the chemical crap you get at the stores.</li>
            <li> Now that I have a non functional item, I wish it had broken a few weeks sooner, or held up to justify the price I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> BUT that steam - follow it down - it soaked my rattan/wood nightstand!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a small and inexpensive diffuser for my EOs!</li>
            <li> One shuts itself off randomly, the other is leaking.</li>
            <li> Then you turn it on, it lights up, and immediately starts working (I mean</li>
            <li> trust me on this - it&#x27;s not better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for the oils and could be potentially dangerous if left unattended.</li>
            <li> The water place is very small...</li>
            <li> Does work well though in a very small area.</li>
            <li> 1 month is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The lotus diffuser is twice as expensive and works half as well.</li>
            <li> - These do eventually fail (1yr or less by my experience).</li>
            <li> I did not use it every day but did use it with a very small amount of essential oils when my kids were sick.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not a good thing to do, but I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Not a good value.</li>
            <li> The dead unit in which the motor failed was repaired under warranty by Bombay Electronics.</li>
            <li> If you have a hard time with sleeping and lights, consider this before buying!</li>
            <li> Personally, I was disappointed that it was plastic.  </li>
            <li> My diffuser died last night! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the diffuser only works to a point.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed since this was my second diffuser and both didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> But $40 for less than 3 months of use is just disappointing.</li>
            <li> Creates a very thick mist.</li>
            <li> Bad news is that the part came with no instructions, and even though I&#x27;d watched the how-to video, it took two tries to get the disc installed correctly.</li>
            <li> in fact I&#x27;ve got five of them but they have all broken</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I should have payed attention to the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the company&#x27;s lack of response.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> each use, you are suggested to fill the base with water and 5 drops of an essential oil.</li>
            <li> There was plenty of water in the base, so it wasn&#x27;t because the water was low.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for approximately 2 weeks and it stopped working out of no where.</li>
            <li> Addicted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read the reviews about this problem before purchasing these, so I was disappointed but not surprised.</li>
            <li> Used it approximately once a day.  </li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife, and when she went to use it was broken.</li>
            <li> Chinese crap.</li>
            <li> Broken.</li>
            <li> It has a poor sensor inside, it can&#x27;t tell the difference between water and oil, so</li>
            <li> It didnt seem to run very long before cutting off!  </li>
            <li> and I feel robbed if my money spent on this diffuser. :(</li>
            <li> With bad sinus problems this diffuser allows easier breathing, opening up the sinus passages with a slight aroma.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one for awhile but finally got around to ordering one when my family had a bad cold on Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is very faint for a small space.</li>
            <li> am very disappointed that I wasted my hard earned money on this poor quality diffuser that no longer works.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it has quit working after 3 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say my diffuser died.  </li>
            <li> I have to say he did not steer me wrong and thank him for taking the time to send in a video..</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a bit expensive</li>
            <li> I am totally obsessed with aromatherapy oils and until now have just used plug ins.</li>
            <li> Terrible return policy, it should be different if product is defective.</li>
            <li> This diffuser randomly turns off.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be an entirely random occurrence as I have tried in vain to replicate what might be causing it.</li>
            <li> Lousy materials, would not be another.</li>
            <li> Lame piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I just got this today so this review might be irrelevant</li>
            <li> : Unfortunately I have to add that it stopped working after not even 6 months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser despite the problems that others had with it randomly shutting off.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t return this item because it&#x27;s been longer than 30 days.</li>
            <li> Unable to find any return information.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> was skeptical at purchasing based on reviews, however, this has been working well for me for three months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing and the company has poor customer service.</li>
            <li> Seriously unhappy.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these diffusers, both have been a disappointment considering what I paid.</li>
            <li> he diffuser during cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Some oils are for relaxing like jasmine, musk is to mask odors and mint is to help you if you have a cold.</li>
            <li> Even with cold water, I find that this starts diffusing immediately and does so for hours.  </li>
            <li> The specifications say this would run 3 - 4 hours before cutting off &amp; by that time all the water/essential oil would be used up.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sad it now doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> so I have no way of knowing if I am doing anything wrong!  </li>
            <li> Seems you might as well buy an expensive one!  </li>
            <li> Very unfortunate.</li>
            <li> but I think it very expensive .if</li>
            <li> bad:</li>
            <li> Bad quality.  </li>
            <li> It had been cared for well, so it seems the motor goes bad.</li>
            <li> maybe it was a bad batch?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so frustrated with no response.</li>
            <li> I use it for when we are sick to get rid of odors etc.</li>
            <li> Some lavender oil to put us asleep, eucalyptus/peppermint when we&#x27;re sick...</li>
            <li> I use it with my kids when they are sick, and hubby takes it to the office sometimes.  </li>
            <li> If your sick, you need something that will run all night to help you breath, don&#x27;t count on this thing to provide.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I cant return it :(</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed, and would NOT reccomend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product as well as their customer service.</li>
            <li> I even bought one for the grandson with autism and was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that ZAQ knows this is a problem, but doesn&#x27;t include a spare disk with their products or make any effort to resolve the problem for the consumer.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> that I am this disappointed with.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> For the price, the base could be made of ceramic.</li>
            <li> (And I hate reading instructions).  </li>
            <li> but I just wrap a towel around the base.</li>
            <li> Very Lame!</li>
            <li> Bad diffuser!</li>
            <li> No one got sick all winter!</li>
            <li> Buy it you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been disappointed by it yet!</li>
            <li> We both very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible, DO NOT BUY, I had this diffuser for 3 days</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  </li>
            <li> Worthless!</li>
            <li> it was broken in just 1 month!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s annoying to fall asleep too!</li>
            <li> The return policy is terrible, so basically we are stuck with this diffuser that works well for maybe 10-12 minutes then shuts off for no reason...</li>
            <li> Nothing terrible, but the one I saw in use in a friends home, seemed to be a finer mist.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> On night three of use, there was a pop at 2AM and the diffuser ceased to function.</li>
            <li> Since this was my first diffuser ever I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but it has been great to diffuse my essential oils. I put it in our bedroom at night and shut the light off. Too bright for me! It lasts probably 5 hours. Just use regular tap water. Great buy and not too $$$$.</li>
            <li> Love this...set it up in my office and put oils that help keep a clear mind and be able to focus!</li>
            <li> within a month of use it doesn&#x27;t work anymore , and you can&#x27;t return item after 30 days. It&#x27;s not like I even use it every day. They should give longer than a month for returns on an item such as this.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible, DO NOT BUY, I had this diffuser for 3 days an now it no longer works. I went in to try to return it and it says this product is nonreturnable! What kind of company offers a product without a return policy, a company that knows they sell horrible products that wont last...don&#x27;t let this company take your money, go with someone that has a better reputation and actually offers returns</li>
            <li> runs out of water very quickly</li>
            <li> Works great but I agree with somenof the others who dislike how bright the on/off switch is when you turn the main light off.  It is still very bright even when turned away from you.  It can be dirsruptive when you sleep.</li>
            <li> This is my second ZAQ Allay Litemist diffuser.  I have one at home and one at my daughter&#x27;s for the occasional nights that I stay there.  I&#x27;ve had the first one for well over a year now and it is still in perfect working order.  Whatever area I use it in is filled with the wonderful essences of my choice.  Immediate relaxation and peace set in when I use the diffusers and it&#x27;s quite often that I do.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> The diffuser arrived on time and in perfect condition.  It has worked very well helping at night with sleeping and clearing the air. We have a shelf on our headboard so we keep the diffuser on it so it is closer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this and thought I could only dream of something like this.  It is perfect for what my needs were.  While putting a little bit of moisture in the air, it infuses my chosen oil fragrance into the room.  It adds a bit of drama to the room with the beautiful blue tower lit up and steaming away.  A little oil goes a long way.  I ordered an extra one I  liked it so much.  It starts misting immediately upon turning on.  When empty it turns itself off.  You will not regret purchasing this great diffuser!</li>
            <li> I was up at my Nephew&#x27;s house and saw it there. My Niece was using it and it was wonderful. I have not tried my as of yet. I will be doing this shortly when I receive the oils I want.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I Love my Aromatherapy Oil Diffuser!  The beautiful Aqua color is very soothing to my mind, body and soul.  I use my Essential Oils in it from Doterra.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a timely manner which I so appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;The only criticism I can give it is that I wish the vessel were a bit larger so as to not have to fill it so often, but at the same time, the Differser turns itself off when it runs low or out!&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Lissa J. Giger</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser - love the &amp;#34;genie bottle&amp;#34; design!  It&#x27;s very easy to operate, has about a 4 hr run time (which is really convenient), and the auto shut-off really is a &amp;#34;shut-off&amp;#34; (unlike some I have seen that stay powered).  I just wish the lights were brighter so the color of the cone would light up more and be more vivid.</li>
            <li> This is an okay diffuser. It gets very warm, to the point of hot when it runs.  I have to wonder what it does to the oils.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS THING IT REALLY IS QUALITY FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> we have had this product for a little over a month now and we have loved it. We love mixing the essential oils in it and it lasts about 3 hours on a continuous mist. this is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> love them!!!!! They are great!!!</li>
            <li> They are great with standing behind their product.  Wonderful misters.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! Was pleased with the simplicity of assembly and it&#x27;s reliability.</li>
            <li> This is pretty, it works as advertised and price is so-so.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is good if you only want to diffuse for a short period of time.  Spend a few dollars more and get the Doterra Lotus diffuser if you want four hours of quality diffusing.</li>
            <li> It was great while it lasted, but that was only 3 months</li>
            <li> Fantastic little diffuser. I love that you can use it with the lights on or off.  Produces a nice steady stream of steam. Diffuses my essential oils perfectly!</li>
            <li> We now have two of these. I got one at first which was taken over by my 5 year old daughter. She loves the aromatherapy at bedtime. So I got a second one for the master bedroom. They work exactly as advertised. I love the auto shut-off feature.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.  And the price was great.</li>
            <li> Works well and shuts off automatically. It also looks nice. I&#x27;m Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Pretty LED blue color. It&#x27;s small and easy to use! I was worried about it possibly overheating if I left it on at night, but it shuts off after a while ( I think when it runs out of water). Makes the room smell beautiful!</li>
            <li> I did like this thing but it only lasted a month. Tonight it&#x27;s not working. I didn&#x27;t use it much. The light broke and I think it&#x27;s not smoking anymore.</li>
            <li> Lasted a whole year of heavy use! I didn&#x27;t take care of it as well as I should have with cleaning and I&#x27;m about to buy another! Love this thing!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser !! Love the look. It doesn&#x27;t change color as some do but just stays blue. Lasts about 4 hours and turns off as soon as the water is empty. It does a great job making even a pretty big room smell good very fast! Love it . Just wish it lasted longer than 4 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser. I like that it can double as a night light. The light does turn off, if you prefer it dark.</li>
            <li> seemed great at first but must have blew a short because it stops working after I had it a little over a month.....</li>
            <li> So far this has been an excellent addition to our home. We are becoming more convinced about the wisdom of our ancestors. One of those are the remarkable properties of essential oils. They can promote health, breathing easier for example, calmness, mood elevation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason I thought a diffuser might be hard to use. This is very simple. It looks nice with the blue lit up but you do have the ability to turn it off. There is a light around the power button that does not go out. Not optimal when sleeping, but it throws of virtually negligible amount of light. Recommended</li>
            <li> It is smaller then I thought. It works good.</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  I used this diffuser for less than a month, and it completely stopped working, despite following care instructions, and using less than 20 times.  Will never buy a ZAQ product again, and will discourage my friends and family from purchasing them as well.  A complete waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> I just got it and like it so far.  Very easy to use and clean.  I will say it is good for a smaller space.  Not as effective in large open spaces.</li>
            <li> It worked for a few weeks and then just broke.  Luckily it comes with a warranty and we contacted the company.  They replaced it with a different/larger model and that one has been holding up perfectly.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my nana with essential oils. She loves to use it at night to fall asleep with some lavendar. Great product, nice design.</li>
            <li> Works great. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with the product. Compact in size and fits in well with the decor.</li>
            <li> excellent product, lasts about 3.5 hours when filled to the max.  I like the following: ease of use, ease of cleaning, glow light that is soothing with the ability to turn it off, soothing sound. great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this October 29, 2014 and it really worked well until yesterday (January 10, 2015).  I had cleaned it once and when it quit working I removed the ceramic disk as shown in the video, cleaned it and replaced it,  but the diffuser still does not work.  I had been thinking about buying a second one but I&#x27;m glad I waited.  I bought the ZAQ Allay because the price was more affordable.  But $40 for less than 3 months of use is just disappointing. I finally have my husband believing in the benefits of diffusing oils, and I only use DoTerra oils, but now I am facing another decision of what diffuser is best.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  I use it every night. It is great for a bedroom. Too small for a large room. Unfortunately it has quit working after 3 months and I have to send it back for repair.&lt;br /&gt;I am in the process of doing so but so far customer service has been quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased 3 of these and I&#x27;m impressed with the quality for the price!  I also own a larger one from a different manufacturer which holds more water and lasts through the night but this one is great for day use.&lt;br /&gt;I like that you can turn the light off if you want and just diffuse.&lt;br /&gt;I have the orange and the blue...both are beautiful and soothing colors.&lt;br /&gt;Some have mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t put out enough scent for a large room, but I have not found that to be the case.  Could be because they aren&#x27;t using enough oil as this is more than adequate to fill the whole front of our home with scent using about 10-12 drops of oil.&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of choices now in diffusers and I did a lot of reading about these before I chose these and I&#x27;ve been very happy with these!&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this a great choice!  This makes a GREAT wedding, housewarming or baby shower gift!  I&#x27;m now known as the &amp;#34;diffuser pusher&amp;#34;  LOL!</li>
            <li> I use it every single day! easy to clean, durable, and freshens up the atmosphere quickly.</li>
            <li> Good quality &amp; works great. Looks nice too.</li>
            <li> Works great, i use it every night with peppermint oil from young living. It is a great diffuser.</li>
            <li> Though the diffuser works just as advertised, I wish the water compartment was larger so it would last longer.  I also do not like the light.  Even when I turn it off (by pushing the on/off switch twice), the glow of the switch is too bright.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good starter diffuser.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself, had it exactly one month before it stopped working! Went through all the trouble shooting issues. Not like there is a bunch of parts to clean. Tried everything it suggested, still doesn&#x27;t work. I would have thought for $35.00 I could expect it to work longer than 1 month.</li>
            <li> Works great and has automatic shut off!  It is small enough, and lasts for quite a while before shut off time!  Way better than going around smelling &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; from all the essential oils, since I like to mix them!</li>
            <li> Great product! Works just as described</li>
            <li> This is ridiculously small. It holds a tiny amount of water and goes through it within 3-4 hrs. It would be great in an office cubicle or broom closet...but seriously with any normal room you&#x27;d have a hard time smelling it and getting the full effect. The top part is really tipsy too. The slightest bump will knock the top off. I&#x27;d like to send it back but the box got thrown away. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love my defuser  Love the fact it s***s off on its own and covers the entire room with aromatherapy</li>
            <li> I loved the diffuser. It is small, however it does a great job and is pleasant to look at.</li>
            <li> I love the way this little diffuser puts out the fragrance and the optional light.  I like the light on for an easy visual in the daytime that it&#x27;s still on or it&#x27;s out of water, but turn the light off at night to keep the room dark (dark rooms are better for quality sleep).  Nothing to not love about it.  Works great and looks great - either with or without the light on.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this diffuser for a few months so far and it works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very pleased with the ease of use and function</li>
            <li> I have waited a couple of weeks for my review on this to make sure it would keep working. This is simple, and works just as expected. I have had no issues with it. It&#x27;s so easy to set up and start using right away.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even work for one day! Turns on and sometimes will mist for a few minutes and then shuts off! Worthless!</li>
            <li> I just love this! I have had it for over 6 months now and it works really well. Make sure you use filtered water or distilled water because I am sure you would end up with a clogged diffuser. Love the contemporary look to it. I use this every day and night. I like the option to have the whole diffuser lit up or not. I do wish it came in other colours but still it looks nice with my decor.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone comments on how nice it is when they see it. I am happy its lasting well and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE APRIL 2016:&lt;br /&gt;This is working very well still. I ONLY use filtered/ purified water. I have had no issues with this unit since buying it. The lights still work and the unit automatically shuts down when there is no more water. Still the best diffuser!</li>
            <li> I love these diffusers. This is the third one I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ve purchased other, more expensive diffusers, but they&#x27;ve died within months. My original of this brand is well over a year old and works great. I love that the glow of the light at night makes my children feel good - no need for an additional nite-lite! I&#x27;ve recommended this countless time to others and will continue to do so!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this diffuser for a little over a month now and it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love love love.  This little guy does everything it says it will do.  I have used it every night since I bought it and have added a different fragrance every night.  Got me through bronchitis season remarkably well.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!! Very pretty blue lights. Very quiet. I have had the diffuser for about 2 months and use it almost daily and have absolutely no complaints! Would recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!! Works as advertised. Smells great, looks cool, and is less expensive than similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It works very well, gives a nice glow &amp; disperses smells of any oil you want to use very nicely. It shuts off automatically when water runs out &amp; very easy to refill.</li>
            <li> The water place is very small...</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. It was my first and I think it works just as well if not better than the Doterra one that I got next. I keep it in my bedroom and it fills the whole space very quickly. The output of mist is generous and the sound puts me right into a deep cocoon of sleep.  I don‚Äôt love the blue, which is why it‚Äôs in my bedroom and not out in my main living space. I wish it was just a neutral white or off white, but I‚Äôm not going to take a star off because of it. You can shut the light off.</li>
            <li> Very nice and a great bargain! It is nice that it has two settings. We like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This item does not disappoint.  Works excellently with zero issues.  We love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this present as a gift for my boyfriend for his birthday. After seeing oil diffusers sold by a lady at a small stand in a market (priced between $60 - $80) I thought I would look online to find a better deal. I found this one, I loved the shape of it compared to others. My boyfriend loves the product. He talks about it a lot. I&#x27;m very tempted to buy myself one sometime very soon. It is easy to use, simple, efficient, and very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love the shape and the way that this diffuser emits the cool diffused air. Its like a beautiful little stream of fragrant mist spilling from the top If this unit ever goes on sale I would buy some to give as gifts. With a little aromatic essential oils this would really be a wonderful gift item.</li>
            <li> I use it ever day with my Essential Oils love it I have bought 3 and give them to my friends</li>
            <li> This product works really well for small rooms only like the size of a kids bedroom.</li>
            <li> Mist output is great.  Lasts several hours.  I wish that it would have an automatic turn off, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it does.&lt;br /&gt;Updated a year later: 12/18/15&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this stopped working a few months ago.  I was so excited to buy this for my parents for Christmas last year, only to find out it has broken down and won&#x27;t work.  Very unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal for the price, bought one for my mom for Christmas and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have been using almost everyday for 2 months, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this little machine so much!! It works great, is easy to use and adds the perfect touch to my bedroom!</li>
            <li> This was very nice, but just stopped working after 6 months!!!</li>
            <li> I initially liked the diffuser very much but after the first day using it, it stopped working. It would run for about a minute then just shut off. It&#x27;s very disappointing and the company has poor customer service. Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice diffuser. I have spent more on other diffusers and had the same result as this one. The mist is even and think and I could smell the oils within in seconds from starting it up. It lasts about 2 hours for me but I don&#x27;t fill it up all the way.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser however it is pretty small, but does the job!</li>
            <li> Worked well for under 30 days.</li>
            <li> We had this for one week and it quit working!  Amazon took it back and shipped a  new difuser.i should have heeded the warnings from the other reviews.  It worked well but just for one week.</li>
            <li> April:  I&#x27;m sad to say my diffuser died.  I read several comments that it can get plugged but a through cleaning should get it working again.  I don&#x27;t know how much gunk could have accumulated in six weeks, but I used a soft cloth and q-tip to clean up any openings and tried again with distilled water.  No - go.  I had to toss it.  It was fun while it lasted, but it didn&#x27;t last near long enough.  March: Fun product!  The mist is a nice steady stream and leaves the room very fragrant.  It&#x27;s a great way tool to test out new scents and change the atmosphere of the room.  The glowing blue light is a nice touch.  The only thing I would change is to have a larger reservoir so it could run longer before refilling.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is a really great device that last up to 4 or 5 hrs.and has a pretty blue night light that can be turned off if you like; love the lite mist.&lt;br /&gt;The button lights up so you can see it in the dark, all you really need. Just started to use, but so far so good. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. You can turn off the light or not while diffusing. It takes I guess more than two hrs duration to diffuse.</li>
            <li> Love this..the blue is very pretty and the water trickle noise it makes is very soothing on top of the vapor it puts off is very relaxing with my lavender oil!</li>
            <li> I love it in fact I am ordering another one...great product  THANK yOU!</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly, easily a 5 star review, and then one day it just quit and never worked again.</li>
            <li> Although I love the mist and it&#x27;s aroma, again the aroma could be stronger and I am not sure if the mist will discolor or ruin any surface I have played it on.  I monitor that.</li>
            <li> Just wish it could hold a little more and last for more than four hours</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Loved it for a short time, then it stopped working. I cleaned it regularly but it just stopped one day and never worked again. I was able to use it for maybe 3 months almost daily. Not worth the money. I have found cheaper, longer lasting options.  ORIGINAL: LOVE THIS! It works great as a night light, the oils are definitely filling the room, and my husband likes the &amp;#34;smoke&amp;#34; it makes when it&#x27;s on. I&#x27;m considering ordering more of these for our home so I can have multiple oils in the appropriate spaces (sleep in our room, 4 Thieves in the main living area etc.) This was much cooler than I anticipated! A bigger water holder would be nice though since I have to fill it about every 4 hours of use.</li>
            <li> Very nice diffuser. Works well and consistently. Recommended for price, ease of use and reliability.</li>
            <li> This is a good little diffuser. It runs strong. A lot of mist comes out and it can make a large room smell very nice. I only use distilled water in it. I had a diffuser before (a different brand) and didn&#x27;t use distilled water and it ruined it, although we do have pretty hard water in my city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can run with the colored light or run without a light. It has a small capacity and runs for maybe three or four hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of use this is still a great diffuser! I ordered and paid for this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It puts out a good amount of water vapor and lights up. If you press the button a second time the light goes out.&lt;br /&gt;But the lighting around the power button stays on.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts about 3hrs. Is a good buy at $34.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd one of these. Great size for a bedroom or small office.</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser! The perfect one for my needs at a great price! It&#x27;s small enough it doesn&#x27;t take up too much room, yet it does the job perfectly. I got the blue one and love the color it lets out in the dark. I also love the fact it turns itself off when it runs out of water. I shopped around and decided this was the best value. I have since bought 2 more, one for my office and one as a gift? I highly recommend üòä</li>
            <li> I love the color, and its very easy to clean. I wish it would last longer, thus the 4 star rating. Otherwise, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this  in fact I&#x27;ve got five of them but they have all broken the steam doesn&#x27;t come out the lights go all I need to have the seller tell me what to do I need a new part</li>
            <li> I have owned this diffuser for months (Edit: Bought in March 2014) - it was my only one for a long time, and I was using it with &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; essential oils before I became a rep with a company. It has always worked as it should - and is perfect for beside the bed. It goes for about 4 hours and shuts off automatically. I would recommend this diffuser for beginners - I have actually. It does not cover a large area, but is perfect for a small bedroom.</li>
            <li> Works well -looks cool!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!  so simple and so powerful---what a difference this has made in my home</li>
            <li> Works great, no issues.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it! Especially in winter time during cold season. I put some rosemary, eucalyptus or peppermint and it makes my sinuses feel better. I love that it turns off itself when it runs out of water so if I fall asleep it&#x27;s no big deal. You can also turn off the light and have the diffuser still on. Great product.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday, sometimes twice a day.  Fills the entire first floor of our house with a lovely scent.  I just run a cycle of vinegar through it once a week to keep it working properly.</li>
            <li> The novelty wore off before the essential oils did. It didn&#x27;t really make the whole house much less the whole room smell as much as i had hoped. I still use it when i think about it. Nicely made product and function for the price. Wish led lights changed the whole spectrum of colors instead of just the plastic piece on top being one color period.</li>
            <li> nice with oils I purchased</li>
            <li> perfect for small room diffusing.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> torturing my husband with this. It follows into every room. Just a few drops of oil and the whole room smells nice. sleep with it on the headboard.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted for my downstairs.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and I love that it automatically shuts off when empty.  I can go about my day without worrying about watching it.  It generally goes about three hours before shutting off.</li>
            <li> We love these diffusers. I bought one for my bedroom and my son&#x27;s bedroom. They stay on for several hours and put out plenty of mist for a normal sized bedroom. They are easy to fill and clean. My 11 year old handles filling his own at night with no problem. Very little noise and you can have the light on or off.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a gift for my teenage daughter who loves smelly candles but I was not keen on her having an open flame in her room.  So I took a chance on this item as a safe alternative to scent her room.  ITS FANTASTIC!  she loves it and the idea that she can change the scents on a whim.  I bought her an essential oil variety pack so she can experiment mixing scents.  It was delivered quickly and was very nicely packaged.  The item is lightweight and compact so fits virtually anywhere.  Buy it you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:   I loved them when they worked.   So far, 2 out of the 3 have stopped working suddenly even after proper cleaning.   I am not sure on the third one since it was a gift.    Unfortunately, I think that if they should be much less expensive if they are only last a couple of months.   If you don&#x27;t mind purchasing these every few months then this is a great little diffuser when it works.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is amazing!  It&#x27;s emits just the right amount of moisture, &amp; the light on it is so soothing.  I put my Do Terra oils in it, &amp; love the scent that comes out!</li>
            <li> This diffuser was recommended by a friend, and it has certainly lived up to its recommendation. I was a little concerned about the  bright blue light, but discovered if I clicked on the on button again, the light would go off. The little off button still lit up, but I shield it and have no problems sleeping. It really helps our breathing and shuts off when the water is used up.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to travel meaning you have to literally be right next to it to appreciate the fragrance.  There are, however, several positives to note. The diffuser is very light weight and extremely quiet. Also, while it doesn&#x27;t use much water (maybe about 2 tablespoons), it seems to run for several hours. I purchased the blue light, very pleasing and relaxing on the eyes. I&#x27;ve found that the best place for mine is on my bed table right next to my side of the bed, that&#x27;s about how far the aromatics will travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this defused for my dad about 6 months ago. Everyone that can in his nursing home room liked it. Today it no longer works. We liked this one but I need one that last longer than 6 months ( he didn&#x27;t use it every day mostly on the weekends when a family member could fill it and turn it on. Sad it now doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Does what it says. No issues so far.</li>
            <li> I got it for my wife and she loves it. She uses it all the time and it works exactly as advertised. I looks pretty cool too with the built in light and the fog coming out. I got a variety pack of scented oil to use with it and she can choose the scent she wants. No problems setting it up and low maintenance operation. It also seems safer than scented candles. It&#x27;s one of the first presents I&#x27;ve bought for her that she actually likes.</li>
            <li> nice working diffuser easy to use and would recommend it to anyone for the price  helps scent the room air</li>
            <li> Lasted only about 30 uses before the unit died and won&#x27;t turn on anymore.  No way to contact seller and no return options.</li>
            <li> I wanted a small and inexpensive diffuser for my EOs! I read the feedbacks and the only negative feedback that was there was that it broke quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for over a month and the ONLY COMPLAINT I have is that there is NOT an automatic timer to shut it off. I believe that MIGHT be the reason the other customers are having theirs break. Maybe they are leaving it on at night and burning out the motor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing!</li>
            <li> love this diffuser...will buy from again for sure.</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas present for my daughter in law and have not heard about it since</li>
            <li> Works great and I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great for essential oils!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  It works all night in the background, has an automatic shutoff when it empties, and is ready to go again the next day.</li>
            <li> This is very nice. Its so easy to use and has been non stop diffusing for the last several days since it arrived. I wish it ran longer than the 3-4 hours but as soon as its empty it shuts off and I am back to refilling :). The instructions say to use tap water but I am using distilled water....that may help reduce any possible clogging or need to clean it alot but so far I have not done anything other than refill pick the oil/oils I want to diffuse and then turn it back on.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and appreciated by receiver.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for awhile now for my oils.  It makes the room smell amazing and is very pretty also.  You can turn off the light if you want to by pressing twice.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Been running it pretty consistently for about a week, and it has worked great! We love the feature were you can turn the light on and off. It will truly run about 4 hours without running out!</li>
            <li> Operation is super easy, has a lights off mode, and turns just a few drops of oil into a great aroma. Beats the hell out of the toxic air fresheners and candles people use these days.</li>
            <li> I like how much smell comes out of this thing. It spreads pretty well, and it doesn&#x27;t take too long to make the room smell like the oil. Sometimes I use it next to my bed to lightly humidify, although I have no idea if it&#x27;s working well for that or not (I&#x27;ll try the humidity sensor and report back). But as for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, it works quite beautifully. I know it&#x27;s not a good thing to do, but I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet and have had no problems. As for ease of use, it&#x27;s pretty easy. You lift the blue cover, lift the white cover under that, pour in water up to the line, drop in a couple drops of oil, replace the covers, and turn it on. Easy. You push the button once and it comes on with the light, push the same button again and it turns the light off (except the button itself which stays lit), and a third time turns the unit off. It has a whirring sound while it&#x27;s running, but it&#x27;s nothing irritating.</li>
            <li> it was broken in just 1 month!!!!!!!  I use it every night....</li>
            <li> Works Great and use it in my spa</li>
            <li> I like that you can turn of the led, wish the power led would dim as well. I can fix that with a resistor? Good product, diffuses well, and for a long time!  Love the sandlewood scented room!</li>
            <li> Great item! I bought two-one for home, and one for school!</li>
            <li> I bought this use in my small massage business and it&#x27;s does the trick. I wish it came in other colors, but other than that, it diffuses quietly and and it&#x27;s calming to watch. The price point is excellent.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is a great value and it works great. It only takes a drop or two of essential oil added to the water and it creates a steady mist. I think it is sufficient for about 200 square feet. I put it in whatever room I am in at the time and really notice the difference. It is easy to fill and the light is cool. You can have it so the led is on or off and the unit shuts off automatically when it is empty or after 4 hours. I had looked at diffusers available through some of the companies like Young Living and Do Terra. This is much more affordable and meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser. It works great and goes for hours on one tank and is easy to clean. The only thing I miss is there is no timer to set for a certain amount of time like the Doterra diffuser but the timer feature was so not worth the extra $100. I am happy with my purchase and will probably purchase another one for other areas of the house.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this diffuser.  I have another more expensive one that does not work as well as my Allay.&lt;br /&gt;So simple to use and not a drop of moisture on the table underneath the diffuser.  I&#x27;m thinking of buying&lt;br /&gt;another one for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these on July 2013 but rarely used it. Now when I move to new house I start used it from time to time. Recently, the item no longer functions. When you turn it on, it shuts itself off after 20 to 30 second. I saw many reviewer mentioned the same problem :(</li>
            <li> Our first diffuser and we love it! Love the option of having the light on or off while still diffusing.</li>
            <li> Soooo awesome. It does a good job at diffusing essential oils!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Works very well. Shuts off by itself. I use doTERRA  oils in it and have had no problems. I wipe it out with a paper towel after each use. I would definitely purchase another one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and I liked it! It Is Easy to use AND it works great for my home!  You will like it.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my boys room.  Its pretty but not overly bright for their room.  It does not last for hours, but when it runs out of water it automatically shuts off and its a perfect time for their room at bed time.</li>
            <li> My diffuser stop working before my 1 year warranty. How can I replace it?</li>

            <li> I was encouraged to purchase this when I saw a customer post a video of his review - I could see  how well it worked and how much he loved it. I have to say he did not steer me wrong and thank him for taking the time to send in a video.. with so many similar seeming products on the market it was easy to see why this one was so good. I gave it as a gift and they totally love it.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday and had to try it last night. It was not even on for 3 minutes and my husband was like \\&quot;that smells strong\\&quot;.. I just smiled.. and immediately wanted to write my review. I only put in three drops of oil. It absolutely is just as strong as a candle lit oil burner minus the flames. My entire master bedroom and bath smelled amazing in less than an hour (about 600sq ft). I was sooooo excited!! I am totally buying another one for another area in my house and as a gift for my mother. This one is NOT leaving my bedroom. Love it.</li>
            <li> This works absolutely wonderful, I am thinking about getting a couple more! I highly recommend this product for use with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these over the past few months.  Easy and dependable!</li>
            <li> Works great!  My granddaughter broke it and they replaced it.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser, works well. It has an auto shut off when the water runs out. It starts diffusing very quickly. I wish the reservoir were a little bigger. My biggest complaint is the brightness of the blue light. You can turn the light on the top on or off, but the blue glow around the power button will not turn off. It is so bright next to my bed, I have to cover it up. I wanted to purchase more for other rooms, but for that reason alone I will probably try a different one.</li>
            <li> I really like it but wish I would have bought a bigger one.</li>
            <li> Have ordered At least 10 of these diffusers for various people.  They are great and a great price.  All of them are still working and I will continue to purchase them as I need them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in search for a aromatherapy product to use to give my home a spa like smell and feel. This product did that but after a month it stopped working. I used this machine about 5x and when I turned it on it would stay on for a minute or two. Then when it would stay on there was no steam/fog coming out. I returned to Amazon to return to the seller right away.</li>
            <li> Stopped working 3 weeks outside return period. Read several other reviews stating the same. It happened to me too!</li>
            <li> It works great!  The mist coming out from the top is mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and pretty when lit. Using fragrant oils and water works great for freshening the air. It&#x27;s a waste to use essential oils unless you are using for holistic reasons. In that case you should use distilled water.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a bedroom!  I ordered 2 and am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these now... One for home and one for my office! My family and even my kids teachers have bought one too! Great product, easy to use and so cool and pretty!!!</li>
            <li> Puts out a perfect amount of mist</li>
            <li> I love it.  It runs 24/7 at my house.</li>
            <li> I have 3 of these all purchased at different times.  1 I use 6 days a week once per day, after 2 years the motor is dying (loud gurgly noises) and yes I do clean it often.  1 I&#x27;ve had 10 months, I only use it 1x per week at most.  It completely died out on me today!  The 3rd I only use like 1x per month and it&#x27;s working fine still.  Overall, disappointing that the longevity hasn&#x27;t held.</li>
            <li> Not to pricey really does nice job in defusing essential oil and nice soft light worth the price you pay</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I use it for my sinuses and Mindfulness.  It&#x27;s so tranquil and soothing!  It has an auto-shut-off so you don&#x27;t need to worry if you fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it! Works great. No problems.</li>
            <li> Also broke after not even 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> This thing is considerably smaller than I expected. About the size of my elbow to my wrist. Works great and I would recommend but works best in a smaller room.  Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Worked great but shorted out a few days ago....</li>
            <li> I like these and they are good, but the water tank is small.</li>
            <li> Three months after I bought it, it broke. It just stopped emitting steam. The light would work and the water would bubble but the steam stopped. I thought maybe I was overfilling it, putting in too much oil, using it too much. I read all the reviews and did everything people recommended, cleaning the ring at the bottom, flushing it clean, letting it rest, etc. but nothing ever fixed it. I tried to contact Amazon and the seller but after 90 days, I wasn&#x27;t allowed to do anything. However, I don&#x27;t want anyone else to buy an expensive product that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Bought it in September and by November it was no longer working! Item is not eligible to return.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than other diffusers, we love it, I have it running all day long, usually take 2 refills for the whole day of diffusing.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, works well. Very happy with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ! Only issue is the blue light on the button is too bright for nighttime use.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it is supposed to while doubling as a nightlight. I use this mainly at night because that is when I am in my room. The light is too bright to put right next to your head while you sleep if you are like me and enjoy total darkness. I just put it on the other side of my lamp to block out some of the light. I do enjoy the blue light when we are watching tv with the lights dimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it lends a pleasant glow to the room and would be perfect as a nightlight in a kid&#x27;s room. Although I will say that my kids love to mess with this and they are 8 and 12 (!) so you might want to think twice about putting your kid alone in a room with it. That wisp of vapor that comes off the top is very intriguing. With that said, my friend puts it in her young daughters&#x27; room and they don&#x27;t seem to be interested in it at all. So I guess that is just something to think about.</li>
            <li> I also bought one in January, not even a month old and it went dead, I turned it on in morning and absolutely nothing works, not a good thing at 35.99 price.</li>
            <li> It worked really well for a month and then broke.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! Please make more colors available!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every night for the past week and so far it works great. I did learn NOT to diffuse peppermint oil when I&#x27;m trying to go to sleep! I need to bring this into my office. It&#x27;s small and would be the perfect size. Peppermint oil would be great for mornings! Definitely wakes me up :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item September 2nd, 2013 based on several positive reviews. However, had I known that it would break just a month later (literally a day after the return policy expired) I would not have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does not create much steam/vapor. I have other glass-blown diffusers that work a lot better, and for comparable price. The unit would always leave water at the bottom of the reservoir, and even after just a couple uses a \\&quot;crack\\&quot; has appeared on the heating element.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying to return, I was notified I was two (2!) days past the return period. I welcome the company to contact me; I am very hopeful their customer service is better than the quality of the products they are carrying.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful and wonderful diffuser, completely idiot proof to operate. Fell of the shelf (thanks cat) and didn&#x27;t break, thank god. Auto shutoff when water is gone is a awesome feature. Only regret is that I didn&#x27;t have enough money to buy more.... ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°</li>
            <li> I really like this oil diffuser. The only thing I wish it had is automatic shut off.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use and works great.&lt;br /&gt;You can adjust the strength by placing more or less drops of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to change out from one oil to the next if you want to.</li>
            <li> Lasts for about 4 hours and puts out pretty powerful aromas!</li>
            <li> Bought two - both stopped working. Was able to return the first one through Amazon because it broke that quickly. The second one is still under warranty but I need to pay the shipping to return it to them. Not worth it when the new one will probably break too. Save your money avoid this company in general.</li>
            <li> Love my difusser!  It&#x27;s easy to use and so quiet.</li>
            <li> I bought this January 5th, 2015 and it is no longer working on May 4th, 2015!  Didn&#x27;t even last 4 months!!! It still turns on and I can hear the motor running, but no vapor comes out of the top anymore.  I am very disapointed because it looks really cool when it is working.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well.  I wish it held more water, and the blue light on the on/off switch is annoying, but I just block it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have had no problems in past month.  Use it almost everyday with lemon essential oil.  Makes the home smell fresh.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Not an eye sore :)  nice glowing light when it&#x27;s on and puts out a perfect amount of diffused oil.  does auto shut off when it&#x27;s empty which is awesome.  I don&#x27;t like to baby sit things.  My sisters have all bought this one because they saw me using it and loved it too.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great diffuser! One of the best I&#x27;ve gotten!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually surprised at how large this diffuser was when I got it and opened the box. I&#x27;ve gotten a few products from ZAQ and they are all of great quality. They offer this Allay diffuser in three colors which are blue, orange, and pink. Some diffusers change colors, but this one one is lit with an interior LED light, which only lights up the top of the diffuser whichever color you purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir holds about a small dixie cup full of water. There&#x27;s a water line inside the reservoir so you don&#x27;t over-fill it. Filling to the fill line will allow the diffuser to run for several hours. Once you have added water, you then put in your essential oil of choice. You then have to put the first water-cover on, then the top cover. Press the button on the front of the diffuser and it will start diffusing! If you press it a second time, the light will turn off, but it will continue to diffuse. Press a third time, and the diffuser will turn completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, this diffuser creates the best mist out of four other diffusers I have.. it&#x27;s great!! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Love using it with the bergamot oil. Makes my whole house smell like tea.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.</li>
            <li> We use our mister for essential oils and to add moisture to the air during the dry winter months. PROs: Immediate steam when you turn it on.      Runs for about 5 hours.      Easy to reach individual parts for cleaning. CONs: Can be a bit noisy sometimes (we kept thinking the washer or dishwasher was running after we went to bed, but once we got used to having it, it didn&#x27;t seem to bother us as much.)      You can&#x27;t turn the light completely off. If you&#x27;re used to sleeping in total darkness this can be a problem. I keep a piece of heavy paper on my nightstand, with one side folded up to cover the light, and it seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Loving this diffuser!  Everything in the description was exact. I love the glow. Just the right size for my small apartment.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser for my bedroom. The front light is pretty bright so I cover it at night.</li>
            <li> Works well. I&#x27;ll usually put 5 drops of essential oil as opposed to the recommended dosage of 3. Everyone who enters the room asks where I got it.</li>
            <li> works great and is just right for a medium sized room</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it and use it almost daily. East to use. Light can be turned off while still using it. Love it!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews, but after this died on me in less than 90 days feel like I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: First off it did work great (for the short time that it was working) and it looked very nice with blue led lights. It ran for about 4 hours(ish) before automatically turning off and it put out a strong mist of vapor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: It&#x27;s hard not to get mad when an item that had worked perfectly for 2 1/2 months just suddenly stops working 2 min after turning it on. I opened it up to see if maybe a wire had come loose or something. But as expected everything looked fine on the inside. I thoroughly examined all the components and the only logical conclusion is it&#x27;s just made with cheap crappy parts from China (circuit board and power supply)... If you&#x27;re going to spend $35 on something (that lists for $60), I expect it to last longer than 80 days... We&#x27;ve purchased several other diffusers the past couple of years (including used ones) and none of them have ever died let alone this quickly. I personally will find another brand when I replace this.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this diffuser. It works great when it will actually stay on. I shouldn&#x27;t have thrown out the box right way, the thing won&#x27;t stay on for more then 10 minutes! If it would actually stay on I would have bought at least one more because when it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;m so disappointed and I feel robbed if my money spent on this diffuser. :(</li>
            <li> Maybe this would work great in a small apartment of a small room in the house. If you are planning on having it cover more then you might need to purchase multiple. Just not strong enough to cover a large area.</li>
            <li> I already have a Young Living Diffuser and although it doesn&#x27;t run as long as this one, it is better at using and spreading the oils and dispersing the fine particles into the air, I know this because after about an hour, you can no longer smell the oils coming from this diffuser, it used them all up front.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser for the money!</li>
            <li> I had this til last month, May 2015, bought April 2014. Last month it died, now I am having to buy another. Too much money for one year. So I am going to try another kind.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful device. Works perfectly.  It&#x27;s really fun to use, spreads the aroma well, and everyone who comes over asks about the &amp;#34;genie lamp&amp;#34; :) I&#x27;ve had this for about 6 months of almost daily use, it&#x27;s still like new......Makes the slightest bubbling noise and the light of the button stays on even after you turn off the blue.</li>
            <li> Very quality and reliable product for the price.  I shopped around before I bought this one and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love love it. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This may not put out as much &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; as some other diffusers, but that&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s quiet, easy to clean, and looks good.  I love the auto off feature when it is out of liquid.  I may buy another one for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser! I have a fairly large room that I use it in and it is noticeable throughout. I also really like the fact that once it is empty it automatically turns off. I have been using it regularly for several months and it still works really well. Great product for a great price. I will likely buy another for my bedroom soon.</li>
            <li> Love it works awesome.</li>
            <li> I really love this little gadget. I did have trouble with it shutting off prematurely and called the company. They promptly mailed me a replacement disc which resolved the problem. I suspect they had a component defect problem that was out of their control. Hopefully by now they resolved that.  It&#x27;s a great product that I use in our bedroom.  Add water &amp; oils about 30 min before sleep time and you&#x27;ll love the essence in your room to help you nod off.  It shuts off automatically.  I turn off the light feature as it&#x27;s too distracting for sleep (though it is pretty).  Would buy it again as a gift.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit and was very happy with the product( great flow, soft light, long lasting stream ) ...until a few months after using it and it just stopped working. I changed outlets ... Plugged and unplugged cord ...still no luck...it just stopped functioning for what seems like no reason ...as an almost $40 investment  I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Lasts for hours and isn&#x27;t a pain to fill or add oil to. My other one lasted a year, so I had to order another one. I think the only thing I would&#x27;ve done differently is clean it out better ever couple of days. I think it would have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in August 2013.  It worked for about 30-45 minutes and then stopped working.  I tried it about 10 times and carefully cleaned it after every use, but each time it would shut off in a very short time.  I was busy with work and didn&#x27;t have time to research to see if this was normal until recently when I discovered here it should not shut off so quickly.  Now I have had it too long to return it. I do see a lot of good reviews so I am sure my experience was not the usual but I do need a diffuser that works longer so I am waiting  until I can afford to buy another unit.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great. For one, it looks cool with the light (I got the blue version.) It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise, which is also a plus for me since I can&#x27;t stand lots of background noise. There isn&#x27;t any leakage with this product, and it works. It&#x27;s great, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love diffusing oil! I like this machine but I almost wish it didn&#x27;t go straight up and had a little curve to the top.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser, but I wish it lasted longer than 4 hours other than that I would but it again. I like that you can turn off the light but the power button is still so bright that it lights up the whole room.</li>
            <li> This diffuser has been running non-stop since I got it three weeks ago! It really pumps out the essential oils and runs until the water is gone. I would recommend using this in a bedroom no larger than 300 square feet. I&#x27;m looking for something as reliable as this one for a larger room. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about this product - I bought it because of the simple design and good reviews.  However this didn&#x27;t even last one use - the water ran dry during the night but the diffuser didn&#x27;t turn off like it was supposed to, cracking the heating element.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems getting my money back but haven&#x27;t decided whether to give this product another try or move on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, it&#x27;s a beautiful color when it&#x27;s on and it&#x27;s strong enough to take care of 2 levels. Reeeeeaaalllyyy top quality with a great output. Impressed!</li>
            <li> My favorite! I love everything about this. Works great, easy to do and lasts for hours. Haven&#x27;t been disappointed by it yet!</li>
            <li> This oil diffuser works quickly and cleans the air fast.  I keep it in the bathroom and turn it on every-time I walk in because it makes me feel good to have essential oil aromatherapy in the air.  I am repurchasing one for my classroom and my bedroom because it works without heat and cleans the air without chemical aerosol sprays.  Nothing like a discount to sell a product to a buyer.  Oh and did I mention that the design is elegant and appealing.</li>
            <li> Love It.  I just use about 6 drops and it last in my master bedroom for hours.</li>
            <li> Quiet, doesn&#x27;t leave puddles, love it.</li>
            <li> Aboslutely love this diffuser! Bought one for my sister in November and after seeing how well hers worked had to get one for myself. shes had hers for months and it still works great but from time to time has had to clean the top becauseit got clogged with oil residue but after that just like new. Mine works great as well :-)</li>
            <li> This diffuser works well.  It&#x27;s size and design are functional and useful for small areas. Highly recommend this durable diffuser.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over two months ago.  It is not used frequently.  The plug on the back came loose and fell off.  It is not returnable due to their policy.  Bad quality.  Plastic housing inside unit holding plug broke.</li>
            <li> An Awesome diffuser. I bought one for my daughter in law and she liked it so much so bought a second one.</li>
            <li> This is a small diffuser- much smaller than I had anticipated- but great nonetheless. I have had this for a few weeks now and it works without any problem.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I use this in my classroom and it&#x27;s easy to operate and the perfect size.  Decent price and quick delivery.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome product! I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. I have been putting peppermint oil into the water and it makes the whole house smell great! I would definitely purchase this again! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great, and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on it! Love the pretty lights!</li>
            <li> Wow, what a great product.  The beauty of this device is that you can use a variety of oils.  Great price as well.  I read many negative reviews regarding this product, but I bought it anyway.  The product works like it&#x27;s supposed to.  My wife and I loved it so much we bought another for the second floor.  Everyone that comes to our house say how wonderful it smells.  Sorry I didn&#x27;t buy it sooner.</li>
            <li> Worked great at first. Now it won&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> This little guy is OK. I leave him on my counter in the kitchen and will typically use it on the weekends with differing essential oils. For my downstairs open kitchen/dining/living room concept this device easily spreads a nice smell throughout the whole downstairs area. Plus the automatic shut-off is brilliant.</li>
            <li> This thing really gets warm. So warm in fact that the water is heated like it was on a stove! Base and plug also got too warm for comfort. Checked the steam coming out and it too seemed warm. Yes, it&#x27;s nice looking and gives out a decent amount of mist but you don&#x27;t want a diffuser running this hot. It&#x27;s not good for the oils and could be potentially dangerous if left unattended. Not taking a chance with another. Return.</li>
            <li> I have other, larger diffusers that are now hard to find.  I knew this diffuser only held a small amount of water (from another review) and I was okay with that.  But it runs for a couple of hours on that small amount of water.  That means it is not putting much oil into the air.  I am using oils for health reasons and this diffuser does not provide the benefits of putting the oil into the air.  I am returning this diffuser and just waiting for the larger ones to come back into stock as they work great.</li>
            <li> Works great. We use it all the time. I don&#x27;t have to use very much oil and it covers a good amt of area.</li>
            <li> I went with this diffuser because it looks good and has tons of good reviews from other users. About 20 min after it&#x27;s first use I noticed the unit turned off. I made sure the water wasn&#x27;t low and turned it back on. Then 10 minutes later it turned off again. I even checked the manual if the unit had a timer, and it didn&#x27;t. So I went on the manufacturer&#x27;s website and under contact only noticed PO box and email. No phone number, no real address. So much for support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sending it back to Amazon for refund.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I was able to return this product to amazon.com.  It was nice but stopped working after 2 weeks.  At least it was within the return window and I wasn&#x27;t stuck with it.  Skip it.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser affordable works well and I need 3 more!</li>
            <li> This product stopped working 4 months after I bought it, and it is not eligible to be returned through Amazon. I loved the light on it and it did a great job diffusing oils, but I can&#x27;t believe it worked for such a short amount of time. I used it daily, so I&#x27;m not sure if it is only designed for occasional use?</li>
            <li> I liked this diffuser until it stopped working at 4 months old.</li>
            <li> Have only had this item a little over a month and it has quit working and is ineligible for return or replacement. Dont waste your money! Only gave one star because it was required.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a few months now and it works great. I use it multiple times a day and have never had a problem. You just need to make sure to use Distilled water and air dry after use and you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product based on the strong reviews posted in Amazon. Unfortunately, I should have payed attention to the negative reviews. This product worked great for about a week. Than it stopped making any steam. The water would heat up and almost jump from the open container causing moisture to build up in the cover. I believe that the build up of the moisture is preventing the steam from rising. Regardless of the cause, the bottom line remains the same. This product has a defect, and based on the negative reviews its a similar theme throughout.&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this product until the defect is fixed.</li>
            <li> Bad diffuser! Mine worked for only a month and I couldn&#x27;t return it! Do not buy this diffuser!!</li>
            <li> This is my first diffusser and I was reluctant to purchase because the reviews were mixed but I am glad that I did order it because it&#x27;s perfect for me.  I use it every night in my bedroom and it&#x27;s calming and very relaxing.  It arrived in a timely manner which I was pleased with because I was anxious.</li>
            <li> Good diffuser for the price.</li>
            <li> I love that you can leave the light on or turn the light off and it&#x27;s quiet</li>
            <li> Will defintely purchase another one for the office. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I have used three or four different types of diffusers and this one has far outlasted and outperformed any of the other ones. It&#x27;s just a simple diffuser that works very well!</li>
            <li> Great diffuser! Allows light on or off while diffusing. Love that!</li>
            <li> no auto-shut off/timer, and the way the top just sits seems flimsy.  I preferred my old diffuser with timer and twist on cover</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil diffuser. I chose pink to save a few dollars, but would like to try blue for my next one, as one of these is not enough. Fills a large master bedroom with therapeutic essential oil aromas in seconds! Very quiet motor and I like that the light can be turned on or off, while the diffuser continues to run... Thank you, ZAQ.com for a great product and the very next day delivery!!</li>
            <li> Great product...steady stream of aromatherapy ...easy to clean and use colorful and attractive in the house...Would reccommend iot to others</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to having this diffuser in my home.  However, after the first day, it would short out after 1 minute of operation. I had a defective item so I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Highly recommend to anyone looking for something like this.  I give it a 4.5 star.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the on light can&#x27;t be turned off and so gives a bright blue light in the bedroom at night - we just cover it though.</li>
            <li> I did like this product. I have had it since January 2015. It is now June 3, 2015. This diffuser is set to turn off as a safety measure, when the water is evaporated out of it. Its usually around 2-3 hours. Two weeks ago it ran all night long, smelling hot and toxic by morning. I experimented with it twice more to be sure it was actually malfunctioning. It was, and is malfunctioning, and could be a real safety hazard, starting a fire, or melting the components of the device, running without water in it. Apparently it is now too late to return or get a  refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the maker of this product or Amazon sees this review, I would definitely like to get a refund on this defective product.</li>
            <li> I heard great reviews, and have friends that have the pyramid shaped model and love it. Unfortunately, the one I bought never stayed on for more than a minute. I returned it and am reluctant to try a new one.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, great price, love the blue light and it diffuses the essential oils well. I like that you can leave the light off if you don&#x27;t want it on. And I like that it turns off on its own when it runs out of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how we got by without this!  We use it every nite and quite often thru the day....works perfect every time and just the right size..with easy fast instructions!  Buy with confidence on this one!</li>
            <li> enjoy the aroma it produces!!!</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser however after some time I do notice a high pitched sound coming from the machine. That can get distracting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product less than a year and have followed directions for proper use and it&#x27;s already broken.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first, but after just 1 week it won&#x27;t mist anymore, and for the money I paid it should of lasted longer than that!!</li>
            <li> It is an interesting looking diffuser and it seems to work well and is easy to maintain. The only complaint I have is that when I am diffusing oils (and they are not cheap oils) it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter how many drops I use, nobody can smell them unless you are standing right next to the machine. Maybe it would work better in a much smaller space. My other diffuser from another company really fills up the room with scent and that&#x27;s what I was looking for. For the price I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it. I am going to order one for work.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is quiet,(a soft bubbling sound can be heard when the room is quiet), very simple to use, and diffuses the aromas well. Planning to order others for family members.</li>
            <li> Only had this for a few month and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Excellent diffuser, purchased in Dec for home office and just bought a second one for the bedroom.  Just starting to explore all the goodness of essential oils.  Love starting the day with a peppermint and then a little lavender is a lovely for ending the day.</li>
            <li> This broke within a week of using it- company tries not to honor their warranty by making it difficult for you to return</li>
            <li> Fun to watch and working well with occasional use.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! I use it daily and it works wonderfully. Now I want one for every room!</li>
            <li> I love the light, sound and vapor that comes from this product as it really creates a peaceful spa-like ambiance.  The old down side is having to refill the water often and cord.  Would be nice if this could run on battery so I could move it around with more ease.</li>
            <li> I own a salon &amp; want the place to smell professional, good, relaxing, &amp; welcoming, look edgy. The front desk is small, not a lot of room for things. This Diffuser is small &amp; perfect for a corner spot! It&#x27;s super easy to put water In water &amp; add oil. Puts out the right amount of smell, the light is so calming. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I love it and use it everyday.  I can breathe easier with the essential oils I use.  It sits right by my computer.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is just what I wanted and expected it to be.  It puts out a nice smell and the color is so pretty and relaxing.  It is easy to operate.  This is my first diffuser but will not be my last.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend to use at work.  Works as advertised. Has held up well under everyday use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This item works very well and is does what it advertises. Slightly smaller than i anticpated but wife loves it</li>
            <li> I have used this every day since it arrived.  It does not get all clogged up like the Young Living Diffusers.  Love it - I&#x27;m going to get another one so I can use it downstairs too!  Would never buy any other kind.</li>
            <li> great product and fast service</li>
            <li> This Diffuser is amazing!  It is the best diffuser I have found.  After the first one, I bought 2 more for myself and 1 more for a friend.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 3 days, and it has yet to run longer than 1 hour at a time.  Yesterday it turned off after 10 minutes.  This seems like a trend with this item.. I would like to exchange it or return it, but I am unsure who I should contact.  I emailed the seller, but haven&#x27;t heard back from them..</li>
            <li> I returned the first litemist I purchased to Amazon for shutting of after only 5 or 10 minutes of use. Then I ordered another thinking that the first one was just a fluke. Well the 2nd one was also defective same problem would not stay on. I found the company on Facebook and almost all their comments were from customers with the same issue. So I posted a question to them about my diffuser and what I can do to get it to work right but no response. I also went to their website and e-mailed their customer service and never received a response from them. The product does not stay till the water is low. It shuts off with a full tank of water every few minutes. I returned the product back to Amazon. Not happy with the company&#x27;s lack of response. Amazon on the other hand was amazing with the 2 returns I love their customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer. Friends have been talking about these for awhile and I finally gave it a try. OMG it works!! This particular one is quiet, has a night light setting or you can use without the light, AND it automatically shuts off when it is finished.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I bought a massage table, oil, music, a scented aromatherapy oil set and this mist machine and set up my own at home spa. It only takes 3-5 drops of scented oil and this thing fills your room with sweet aroma. Great purchase at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> I have tried several diffusers. Some hardier than others. So far, this diffuser is one of the best ones that I have tried. It is super easy to use , and gives off a nice flow of mist and aroma. I have gotten many that were too weak and did not give off enough scent. This is not the case with the Allay diffuser. I am very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and well. Product as described. Even provides a little zen in larger rooms.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is amazing. That&#x27;s all you need to know. I own three. It&#x27;s so easy to use, and the option of light or no light is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> Garbage. Worked 1 time and stopped working after that. Device would not start and keep on blinking instead. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Daughter&#x27;s birthday. She&#x27;s just getting into the essential oils and has been loving coming over to my house and smelling my new oils in my diffusers.&lt;br /&gt;She requested this diffuser. She likes the water chamber size, and the ability to change the color of the light. # different light options.&lt;br /&gt;The mister is quiet and works well. She&#x27;s very pleased with this unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for the price but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I usually just use it to diffuse oils in the kids&#x27; room at bedtime.</li>
            <li> This is a small unit. Good for small room, easy to assemble and operate. I appreciate only having to use a few drops of oil to water to achieve benefits of aromatherapy. Attractive jenie-shape that lights up beautiful blue!</li>
            <li> Love this little thing. Makes my too. Smell good and I love watching the mist come out of it. I&#x27;ve knocked mine over too many times and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had read that diffusing Lavender, Lemon, and Peppermint essential oils is good for allergies, so when I received it, I used it by my bed at night.  It worked very nicely, the design and style was attractive and the light was nice; however, I had to refill it several times throughout the night.  So, I ended up purchasing another one for my bedside and am using this one at my desk during the day.  It is perfect for this kind of use.  It does turn itself off when it is empty, so I don&#x27;t have a fear of forgetting to turn it off before I leave.</li>
            <li> easy to clean, small and compact, great for countertop or bedside, puts out a good amount of steam. Please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I read ALOT of reviews before purchasing this one and glad I did! This one works wonderful and I diffuse on a daily bases. I use it for when we are sick to get rid of odors etc. Its smaller and lasts around 2-3 hours before its empty which is totally fine by me! love the color and option to turn off the color. Great little machine! Puts aroma in one room. My need to purchase another for my room!</li>
            <li> It worked great for 3-4 months then just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend this product, it&#x27;s a big let down.</li>
            <li> Second one I have purchased for an xmas present.  My one is still going strong.  Top tip, use distilled water (not tap or purified water) as all the elements are removed.  Therefore you will never get an possible deposits (especially if in a hard water area) on your furniture or in the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device also shuts itself off when empty which is good, however when I used heavier oils (darker) it sometimes switched off half way through.  I generally use lemongrass pure oil which is one of the strongest and the diffuser runs flawlessly</li>
            <li> Looks like a good product. It&#x27;s a gift so I haven&#x27;t used it yet but the packaging is great and the product looks exactly like it was represented.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser, it&#x27;s interesting to look at and I like the color when it&#x27;s lit up. The only thing I wish it had was a timer setting or an automatic turn off function when the water runs out.</li>
            <li> This was my first essential oil diffuser to use and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months and it still works like new. Since, I have bought one for 3 other people and they all love it too. It&#x27;s diffuses the oil very well and lasts for a long time. It looks cool too!</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and I just love it.  It&#x27;s very portable and easy to use and really does a great job diffusing oils throughout the house.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> We liked this so much in the downstairs guest bathroom to dispense various citrus scents when we have company that we bought another for upstairs in the bedroom. Some lavender oil to put us asleep, eucalyptus/peppermint when we&#x27;re sick... you name it. I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;ve came across essential oils and we&#x27;ve found lots of good things to try.</li>
            <li> I actually really love this diffuser however it was purchased in August 2013 and now has stopped working.  I have read of a few others that this has happened to. When it did work it was very quiet and had a great night light.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Just doesn&#x27;t fill a large room. Perfect for a small bedroom or bath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this diffuser because there are so many positive reviews. I use quality DoTerra essential oils, clean between uses according to directions, and use room temperature tap water as directed. It is beautiful when it lights up, and my daughter was very excited. My problem is with how long it lasts. For the first hour of use it puts out a great amount- my daughters room is small, and I can smell the lavender and peppermint down the hall. We shut it off after about an hour. When I go to turn it on in the evening, I see the mist coming out, but no smell unless I hang my head over it. Like I said, it&#x27;s a tiny room. The diffuser is still at least half full. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is. The water is still room temp and at least half full. This is a waste of my pricey oils and no help to my daughter&#x27;s allergies.  I&#x27;ve contacted the company and have yet to hear back. I hope I do, because it works wonderful when you first fill it. If I don&#x27;t hear soon I will be returning to Amazon and finding something new.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these diffusers. Both have stopped working. One stopped working within the 30 day warranty period and was replaced promptly by the seller. The replacement diffuser worked for five months and quit. The other diffuser lasted only a few months also. I do not recommend this product because it does not last.</li>
            <li> Bought for my parents and they love it and the oils! Runs for 3-4 hours.  You wouldn&#x27;t want more than that anyway when diffusing oils.</li>
            <li> Love these! I have 2, one in each of my toddlers rooms. They last around 3-4 hours and emit a beautiful blue glow. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Small and compact fits nice on my desk at work. Super cute and efficient. Only thing is the button&#x27;s light stays on in both on modes. It bothered my husband so I didn&#x27;t keep it next to my bed.</li>
            <li> Worked for just over a month and stopped working. Has no power. Worked good while it did.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!!!!!  I purchased special EO for this unit.  Much cheaper and don&#x27;t smell the the chemical crap you get at the stores.</li>
            <li> I only had this product for 2 months and it quit on me!!!  I definitely suggest the doTerra diffuser over this!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! I use cheap $1tree oil and it stills makes my whole apartment smell amazing</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s a great way to make your house smell great without using those bad chemicals!</li>
            <li> We agree with the other positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold enough water therefore doesn&#x27;t run long enough</li>
            <li> Excellent diffuser, great price!</li>
            <li> Worked about a month and stopped working.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this for me and I was so excited to try it out!  Right out of the box, it wouldn&#x27;t even power on.  Tried it in multiple plugs, checked instructions, etc.  No luck.  I would have been willing to try a straight exchange for another one but they won&#x27;t do it so now I have to wait for the return to be received, processed and refunded.  Who knows how long that will take so I&#x27;m looking for another diffuser in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Nope. Top part just falls right off &amp; doesn&#x27;t tighten like directions tell you to do. Not a fan. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Use it every night. Love it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I will probably purchase another one!!!</li>
            <li> I love it! My sister in law has one of these and every time I went to her house I was in love with hers so much I decided to buy one myself. I searched for a week before i decided to go with this one. I bought this and the DoTerra OnGuard to use with it. I bought the blue one. It shipped quickly and as new in box. It came with very clear instructions on how to use and clean the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it doesn&#x27;t run as long as I would like. A few time it shut off, I looked inside and there was still plenty of water in it. I simply just turn it back on and it keeps running. You push the front button once and the entire unit turns on along with the glowing light. You push the button again and the glowing light shuts off but still runs. Push it for the third time and the entire unit shuts off. I like how the entire unit will shut off completely when its done. I&#x27;m married to a fireman so he worries about every possible fire hazzard in our home and this passed his test. haha It gives off plenty of scent. I love that it doesn&#x27;t heat up. I read some where that this is the best way to diffuse essential oils and that you don&#x27;t want to heat them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have used this diffuser in our bedroom, kitchen and living room. I haven&#x27;t taken it in our basement yet to see how it works in a very large space but it does its job. Overall A++. Would buy another one and recommend this one to others as well.</li>
            <li> I felt it was a bit expensive but I like how it looks and it works really great. It leaves a nice light scent in large rooms and stronger in smaller rooms.  I also like that I can use it with the light on or off.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! Works as good as my expense doterra one. Definetely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite diffuser I have found.  It submits a good amount of scent and mist and shuts itself off.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before choosing this diffuser.  It&#x27;s works great for small spaces - bedroom, office, etc.  Easy to use, and I like that you can turn the color off if you just want the aroma and not the light.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Does everything i need it to. I use doterra oils and this product diffuses like a champ. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a good diffuser and didn&#x27;t want to spend as much as they wanted for one at Doterra - this was a perfect fit and works wonderful!  I especially love the light feature - very cool looking on  top of being very functional.</li>
            <li> It stopped working the SAME DAY! I was so looking forward to using this and it broke or stopped working on the same day!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent diffuser.  Allows me to have my favorite essential oils steaming into the room with the light on, so you can use it as a night light, or the light off, and the diffuser still going. Automatic shut off. So far so good:)</li>
            <li> just so so , but I think it very expensive .if you did not have a lot money , don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I researched and read about many aromatherapy diffusers before the purchase.  It smells great (some oils are better than others wuality wise) and I have to say it is quiet and puts a nice aroma out into the room while it runs.  It&#x27;s pretty and small enough which I like.  However, when you turn it off, there is no lingering smell which is what I am really after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> I returned it as it stopped working after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Waste of money received better results when I  put essential oils in hot water.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:96d1f86a40530ecbdadfae3b92ccf4b9]] ‚òÖ i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I was not influenced by anyone in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;üåü UPDATED: 6/26/2016 - I got this diffuser August 2015. Almost a year ago. I keep it in my front 2nd bathroom and I use it on a daily basis. I fill it with a favorite essential oil and turn it on. Sometime twice a day, but usually just once. But it has been really great so far. Absolutely love it still. Just wanted to update on how it&#x27;s going.&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;I have several diffusers now and they seem to just get better. I think so far this one is my favorite. I like the way it&#x27;s designed and the way it feels. I know that might sound funny, but it just feels nice. This ZAQ Allay Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser lets out a lot of nice mist but no condensation, which is really good. I don&#x27;t like those that by the time you have left it on for an hour, you area of where the diffuser is like a pool of water.&lt;br /&gt;I put this one in my living room and add a few drops o my lavender essential oil and it actually fills the enter room of nice aroma, which I was surprised. In my video I said &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; room but after leaving it on all day today, it was nice to have an aroma throughout the house just from one difusser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;‚úîÔ∏è OVERALL: This diffuser would make a great wedding shower gift. It comes gift ready and I feel that this diffuser is a really good buy.&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;I will always be honest in my reviews. I know that being a consumer myself, I want to see honest reviews, not a 4-5 star just to make a seller happy. My husband and I rely on reviews for our buying decisions as well.</li>
            <li> The diffuser works great. Easy to clean, set up and operate and it diffused nicely. There&#x27;s nothing I can complain about.</li>
            <li> Diffusers are great and I&#x27;ve had many of them. This one was easily the worst!! It completely stopped working less than 3 months after I bought it. Judging by the reviews here, that seems to be a trend. There are MUCH better diffusers out there for the same amount of money. Don&#x27;t waste yours on this little piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I bought this in September and have only used it a handful of times... I filled it and went to turn it on the other night and its completely shot ... wont even turn on. Very disappointing and I cant return it :(</li>
            <li> I bought two of these diffusers:  one for the living room and one for the bedroom.  They are perfect for one room.</li>
            <li> Great product that works well and looks nice. A bonus is that it&#x27;s not very expensive. Bought one for myself and another on for a friend. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day! She loves it to pieces! She uses it every night with her EOs. :)</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best purchases I made in 2014. This little diffuser is fantastic for the price and helped my wife while she was in labor. (We bought a bottle of Lavendar EO to relax her)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we use it around the house with different oils to set the mood and help everyone relax.</li>
            <li> So far I love this diffuser! I had wanted to order this for quite some time and I finally made the decision to go ahead and order it in Blue. It&#x27;s quite tall and pretty to look at when lit or you can choose to turn off the light. The auto shut-off is a great feature! I have had it for a week and it works as described. I will probably order another at some point for better coverage of the first floor since it is pretty open. I did read another review that the diffuser would shut off before being completely empty of water but after contacting the manufacturer she was told it was probably due to using too much oil and she should clean it out and dry completely. She said after doing that it worked fine.  I have had that problem and am probably guilty of using a few extra drops because we are all suffering from colds and allergies this week, so I will need to clean it out and resist the temptation to add more than I should in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the design and look. A larger water reservoir would have received a five star rating.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase and it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this.  It works great.</li>
            <li> This diffuser worked great for the first 6 weeks, but now it has stopped working altogether, and it&#x27;s apparently too late to return it.  It&#x27;s very frustrating that I paid good money for this product and it died so quickly.  I expected more from this company.</li>
            <li> So far I like the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell much of the fragrance with this machine....I do like the way the blue color glows at night and how quiet it is though</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and some were a bit worrisome... But I bought the diffuser anyway and I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It creates steam as soon as I turn it on and the oil I put in smells very strong. I love it so far - I&#x27;ve had it for about a month. I run it every day, no problems. The automatic feature shuts it off when empty. There is option to turn the light off. But the blue glows very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very pleased! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. The condensation part is a little bummer but not huge for the positives that come from this unit.  Great seller too.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for short time diffusing.  Has the option of light or no light.  Diffuses just the right amount and does not leave the desk with any moisture.  It&#x27;s very quiet!!!</li>
            <li> I bought 1 of these &amp; I loved it and I still love it! Works exactly like it says!! So naturally I bought a 2nd 1 and it doesn&#x27;t work. Right out of the box it would stay on about 10 mins &amp; shut off. I was sooo bummed! I&#x27;m in the process of sending it back. I sooo wish I could recommend this but it&#x27;s to risky. I would&#x27;ve bought many many of these for so many people...but I can&#x27;t chance it!!</li>
            <li> This does not make the room smell.</li>
            <li> Too bright, and I think this diffuser is not strong enough compare to other product that i purchased, i guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser.  At first I thought it was kind of small but when I started using it I realized it&#x27;s pretty powerful and I love it.  It turns itself off when it is out of water and that is a life saver.</li>
            <li> I use DoTerra oils and only ever need to add 2-3 drops. The light can be switched off if you want by the press of a button. The diffuser quickly and easily fills my bedroom or livingroom (the two places I use it most) within minutes with the diffused oils. My older children have asked for one to keep in their rooms at night to double as a nightlight. Affordable option for those who enjoy aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> This is the best diffuser I have found, in fact I love it so much I now have two. I love the fact that you can turn off the light if you wish</li>
            <li> I am an Amazon addict and base all of my purchases on product reviews, but this is the first actual review I&#x27;ve written myself. I LOVE THIS DIFFUSER! I am totally obsessed with aromatherapy oils and until now have just used plug ins. Less than 24 hrs with this litemist diffuser and I&#x27;ll NEVER go back to plug ins. I haven&#x27;t turned the diffuser off since I&#x27;ve got it. It&#x27;s so quiet (and the little noise it makes is relaxing,) and my apartment is filled with such a pleasant scent. The product is a decent amount of money, but it&#x27;s less than other diffusers and works excellent. I swear I feel like I&#x27;ve already gotten my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Love the way it dispenses oils and really enjoy the changing colors.</li>
            <li> This has help get to sleep and stay asleep. I love it</li>
            <li> Used only about 5 times and no longer works.  I cannot even find the seller to see if they will cover it under warranty.  Terrible return policy, it should be different if product is defective.</li>
            <li> I must have another one of these!!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 and BOTH BROKE- The first worked for 6 months then broke and then the second only worked for month a half, sadly two weeks after returns accepted.</li>
            <li> Well made. As described. works perfectly. Superior to others I&#x27;ve tried.  Would definitely buy again. Excellent seller. Highly recommended. A+++</li>
            <li> So far,I can&#x27;t tell it does anything other than make the room smell good.  The essential oils have  not improved my breathing at night as my friend who sells oils said it would, but possibly it is too soon to tell.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few days.  I wish it had a timer so I could set it to turn off.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser, it is easy to use; however I don&#x27;t care for the water gurgle that it makes - sounds like a dog licking its paws...sort of irritating.  But other then that it works well and is cool to look at!  Very simple.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mist type diffuser. After reading reviews of this one, I was convinced i should try it.Shipment was fast. I used it right away.I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the water evaporates fast.Other than that it&#x27;s a good diffuser.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this diffuser!  I have bought several and  getting ready to purchase more for my business. They are beautiful when they are lit up and the pricing was reasonable and I recieved the product in 2 days!!&lt;br /&gt;I had one stop working and the return policy was super simple and buyer friendly. I will continue to purchase this product and I refer them to all my friends!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product.  The first one worked well.  My second one turns off almost immediately.  I am returning it and am reluctant to replace it.</li>
            <li> this seems to be a good one for the price, wish it would run a little longer but all in all I like it</li>
            <li> So awesome. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Its smaller than I expected, but it works and thats all that I care about.</li>
            <li> doesnt stay on very long but it does work and it doesnt change color i thought it did but nope</li>
            <li> Update:  We purchased a replacement disc for this diffuser (luckily my husband knows how to do this) and since replacing it, it has worked perfectly.  I still like the style and the mist comes out nicely!  So as long as your parts aren&#x27;t faulty, or you can replace it if needed, then this is a great diffuser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product since October 2013 and bought it to diffuse our essential oils (mainly eucalyptus for cold season).  It worked great for awhile and I only put distilled water in it hoping it would prevent any hard water build up and to help keep it cleaner.  I changed the water frequently but after about 4 months it started to shut off on its own.  Eventually I would turn it on and within 30 seconds it shut off automatically.  I&#x27;ve tried cleaning it several times, even though it&#x27;s already clean.  It seems to work here and there, but when I need it most it&#x27;s not working correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF your product works better than mine - then it should do its job nicely.  I closed our bedroom door to ensure the diffuser could fill our room and it works great.  My 4 yr old would ask for me to turn it on on days he woke up stuffy.</li>
            <li> I really liked this, while it lasted, which was a whole 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it every night, as directed, and i loved drifting off to the slight smell of lavendar. Whenever I came home, my apartment would still smell a little bit of lavendar. However, after two weeks, I went to turn it on just as I did every night, and it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I tried different outlets, taking out the water and putting a lesser amount in, messing with the cap/water comaprtment, and nothing. It just crapped out. I was really disappointed, and would NOT reccomend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> I loved it at first but I&#x27;ve only had it a month and it&#x27;s already started to have issues. It just works intermittently now. Thankfully, I bought it here because I called Amazon and they took good care of me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ours for about a month.  So far so good.  I use it daily, sometimes refilling it multiple times.  Love the automatic shut off which seems to always be when it is empty and not before.  The only drawback to this device is the small size of the water reservoir.</li>
            <li> I knew the risk based on all the 1-Star Reviews, but took a chance.  I used it a couple of times when I first purchased it in August and it worked fine.  Then last month I started using it again, and after a about 10-12 days (using it every couple of days) it abruptly stopped working today.  For the exorbitant price of $52.99 it should work for years and years and years.  It&#x27;s only a vaporizer, not rocket science.  Nice when it worked, but not worth the risk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a month. So far, I am pleased. It seems to work best when cleaned after each use, which is not too bad since it is easy to clean. It definitely spreads fragrance around well, but doesn&#x27;t humidify enough, at least for someone like me that suffers from winter dryness. The lighting is also quite nice and pretty bright.</li>
            <li> Perfect and beautiful! the best diffuser  i have ever owned. great gift idea.  Use at home or in a spa/yoga studio, etc.</li>
            <li> Really like this diffuser. Last s a long time, and very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Keep it in the kids rooms is great. I have 2 of them in my house!</li>
            <li> Great product.  It didn&#x27;t say in the instructions but it turns itself off when it gets too low on water. I makes gurgling sound too.  Safe and pretty too.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser and plan on ordering more to have in different rooms and to give as gifts to my adult children for their homes.  The price is great and it has worked perfectly since I&#x27;ve had it.  It is so easy to use, easy to clean.  I love the automatic shut off and the option of light on or off.  Can&#x27;t say enough about my ZAQ diffuser.  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I bought the Diffuser to use with DoTerra Oils.  I have had it for about 3 weeks now and so works well.  It shuts off automatically once the reservoir is empty.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for essential oils! No noise and you have the ability to leave the light on (which is a lovely calming blue) or shut it off which is a nice feature. Purchased one as a gift and we are both very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Just wish it lasted longer than 4 hours and that the unlighted mode didn&#x27;t have the button glowing. Other than that, love it!</li>
            <li> Super disappointed in this product. I was so excited to use this with my doterra essential oils. The day I received it, it started malfunctioning. It would run for an hour, then shut off. I would turn it back on and it would shut off again, sometimes in 5-10 minutes. I decided to try it the next day. It succeeded in running for a few hours, but then began to overheat. The water was boiling, which is NOT ok for essential oils. I will be moving on to a different diffuser.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my diffuser in the mail but that quickly turned to disappointment. It only stayed on for 10 minutes instead of the alleged 3-4 hours. I immediately sent it back, got a new one and it too only stayed on for about 10 minutes. I contacted Amazon and the company that makes them and Amazon had me send it back and overnighted me a new one. This one is staying on longer but not 3-4 hours. The manufacturing company emailed me and said I must have a faulty disc in the bottom and they&#x27;re sending me a new one. So far I&#x27;m not impressed with this machine. (I have a few friends that have it and LOVE it) The customer service has been helpful though. I just wish it worked like it claims! Let&#x27;s hope the new disc will solve all the problems.</li>
            <li> This particular diffuser was defective from the start.  It shut itself off randomly - sometimes after operating for only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> broke in a couple of months but when it worked it did it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I use my diffuser all day long, I am in love with it! It lets off a nice steam as well as a light scent from the oil. I have ran it up to six hours and it works great! So happy with my purchase, and I love the color as well :) It is a little on the smaller side but you can still smell the oils in other rooms.</li>
            <li> I really like this, subtle light and the mist makes for a lovely atmosphere.  Would recommend this to friends, thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these Units. About two months after the purchase, one has died. When they were working, I liked them. I would not recommend purchasing this unit</li>
            <li> Loved it, but now after having it a couple months it&#x27;s stopped working. Seriously unhappy.</li>
            <li> I started getting into essential oils and this diffuser is great!  It is simple to use and diffuses perfectly.  It is a great deal compared to other products that are near or over $100.  I have bought 1 for a gift and plan on buying another one just to have in another room in my house!</li>
            <li> I love this difusser, small enough to take with us on vacation. I use this one in the bedroom. You will not regret your purchase :)</li>
            <li> Did not work.  Waste of money. Quality is just not there and construction is flimsy at best.  Not a good value.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on October 7, 2013 and it worked great --- until it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s now December 2 and it no longer works. It turns on, but does not diffuse anymore. I am bummed. And of course, my return window has passed so I&#x27;m eating the $60 for the thing. Possibly, it needed better rinsing between uses, I don&#x27;t know. Hope everyone else has better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> I purchased one and loved it so purchased another despite reading some reviews that they broke after a few months. Well, sure enough one of the two no longer works after only 2 months of use (and only used about a dozen times).  Bummed because the return window is now shut.  My advice: spend the extra money on a more quality one with superb reviews.  I can&#x27;t be throwing about $30 + every time a diffuser breaks.</li>
            <li> I use this every night!  It distributes the oils into the air in an instant, it is very quiet and effective.  I like that it has no flame, and turns itself off after the oil and water evaporates. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a handy little diffuser. It works great, looks great, Is easy to maintain for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a year now. It was working great but it started leaking and the scent started smelling slightly burned or off.</li>
            <li> I love this defuser we have been using twice a day and works amazingly</li>
            <li> Excellent. Love running it in the bedroom before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I use this constantly and it is wonderful!  I am so glad I read reviews and chose this one to buy.  It was worth every penny!  Wonderful easy to use product of quality.</li>
            <li> This really works well.  We&#x27;ve had it now for about 8 months and use it frequently.  It is cute, takes up only a little room, and diffuses the oils nicely.  Far better price than some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li> This starts off great then becomes increasingly less effective. I tried to clean it out thinking it was clogged - and while it helped a little it still has lost it&#x27;s strength. My other feedback is the super bright blue light. When I use this with lavendar to help my insomnia the light is a killer. Wish they would have build an on-of switch. I have tried a few aromatherapy diffusers and I think the whole concept is too good to be true. Still hunting for the best one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a beautiful item, looks just like the photo with the steam shooting out immediately upon pushing the power button! BUT that steam - follow it down - it soaked my rattan/wood nightstand!!! It soaks whatever I place it on. I&#x27;m surprised I don&#x27;t see other reviews with this problem. It really boils frantically - maybe it&#x27;s a defect? Certainly a mold/mildew issue to develop if I keep using it. Otherwise, it had potential. It&#x27;s really attractive &amp; I love aromatherapy! Maybe another one of the ZAQs would not have this issue???</li>
            <li> Favorite diffuser for my kids rooms!</li>
            <li> This product is soothing to watch light up and quickly produces a mist that rolls out of the top. Control the level of scent with the amount of drops, I usually go heavier with about 10 drops. Press the button once to turn on, twice to turn off the light only, and three to completely turn off the machine. It is very quiet and relaxing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband was super unsure about oils but now he uses this thing more than me! Wipe it down every few uses, use tap water, and mix in 4- 6 drops of oils. It is pretty, every guest points it out for being cool looking. Buy it :)</li>
            <li> I can smell the oils I put in this in the air, so I guess it works fine. The vapor only seems to go about 6&amp;#34; above the unit, then falls towards the table, so I&#x27;m not sure that it gets the oil into the air as good as it could.</li>
            <li> This works well and I love the soft blue glow. The only issue is that it seems like the smell is more intense when you first turn it on and then dies down quickly. Wish it would disburse they oil scent a little more evenly.</li>
            <li> Works great but need new filters as time passes for full functionality.</li>
            <li> Good product, my daughter in law loves it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. I appreciate the fact that it shuts off automatically when it runs out of water, too.</li>
            <li> This is a gift but it looks like everything they said it would be.&lt;br /&gt;It even came by special messenger the next day.&lt;br /&gt;I can wait to see how well it works</li>
            <li> I have Young Living Essential Oils.  Gave my diffuser from Young Living to my daughter.  Young Living has been out of Diffusers for months.  I came to Amazon to find one.  I bought this one.  I like it better than Young Living&#x27;s.  I will be buying another one soon.  I used it once or twice a day!</li>
            <li> I bought a diffuser after experiencing one during a massage. Every so often I would get a little whiff of scent. Afterwards I found with a thin wisp of vapor curling out of the elegantly arched neck.  This unit has a much more robust stream of vapor, which I&#x27;m glad for because my bedroom is considerably larger than that massage room. I particularly like how long this one runs--at least 3-4 hours on average. I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a room freshener on the order of, say, a Glad plug in or aromatic candle.  The scent is more contained and would likely be lost in a large room.  It is, however, perfect for providing a gentle, relaxing send-off when placed on my nightstand. Even after several months it still feels nurturing and special when I crawl into bed, breathe deeply, and let the cares of the day melt away.</li>
            <li> My diffuser kept turning off and flashing it&#x27;s red lights so I emailed the company. The response was &amp;#34;are you using essential oils&amp;#34;? I replied that I was and his response was that it only works with water soluble oils which can easily be found on the internet. Well the point was to be able to use the essential oils I already own. Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> We love diffusers and this one is a keeper! It&#x27;s simple to use and clean. It&#x27;s silent and produces a nice mist. The light is soft enough to use even at night and not be too distracting to sleep with on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for the purpose of review. We use this item daily and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I own one and I&#x27;ve 3 purchased for family members. This is the best quality for the best price I could find.</li>
            <li> Bought 3 of these and everyone is happy with it including myself. Still working after almost a year.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast.Ordered two one for me and one for my friend.  We both very disappointed. It&#x27;s very small,you can smell it only when you sitting right next to it,  tried different kinds oils,nothing change.The best price for it maybe 19.99 . It&#x27;s super overpriced.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! I have purchased 2 and they work great and even shut off automatically for safety!</li>
            <li> I used this unit for 1 month and then it stopped working.  I emailed ZAQ.com and never got a response.  I&#x27;ve been using essential oils for years now and I will never buy this brand again.  I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product as well as their customer service.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little machine.&lt;br /&gt;  Having a timer with a schedule on and off would make it better.&lt;br /&gt;Cordless would be cool.</li>
            <li> I have two now and have not run into any issues.  I love that this doesn&#x27;t require any special water.  You can turn the light off that shines through the funnel, but you can&#x27;t turn off the light that glows around the front button.  This may bother some people if they have this in the bedroom.  This does not affect my sleep though.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is fantastic!  Auto stop when the water is out and it fills the room with whatever wonderful oil I&#x27;ve put in it!  Great value!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these diffusers, both have been a disappointment considering what I paid. One shuts itself off randomly, the other is leaking. The water comes out the holes in the bottom and from the back where the cord plugs in. At first I thought it was just a matter of being filled slightly too high, or one of my kids bumping into it, but that&#x27;s definitely not the issue. The water is leaking through the circle in the bottom that creates the vapor when turned on.</li>
            <li> This diffuser randomly turns off.  The first time I used it, it turned off within 40 minutes.  The second time I used it, it turned off after 20 minutes.  Then I&#x27;ve seen it turn off after 5 minutes.  Diffusers should continue to run until they are out of water.  I will be returning this device.</li>
            <li> ZAQ&#x27;s 80mL Essential Oil Diffuser diffuser is a wonderful choice to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Help with allergies&lt;br /&gt;2. Alter your mood&lt;br /&gt;3. Change your cognitive wellbeing&lt;br /&gt;4. Improve your physical wellbeing&lt;br /&gt;5. Create a beautiful smelling aroma throughout your house&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular diffuser is small, but powerful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Diffuser&lt;br /&gt;2. Power Cord&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to follow directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZAQ couldn&#x27;t have made the directions any easier to follow.  The picture illustrations, accompanied by text, makes it easy enough for everyone to understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation Procedure:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Simply remove the outer and inner covers that are attached to the base&lt;br /&gt;2. Fill the water tank up to max level line (this line is clearly defined in the instruction booklet)&lt;br /&gt;3. Add 3-5 drops of your favorite essential oil to the water&lt;br /&gt;4. Replace the inner cover&lt;br /&gt;5. Replace the outer cover&lt;br /&gt;6. Plug in the adapter and press the power button&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions state to ensure both the inner and outer lid are tightened.  However, neither of my lids feel secure despite my efforts to tighten.  They both just rest/sit right on of the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;2. The calming blue color&lt;br /&gt;3. Relatively silent when in use&lt;br /&gt;4. Wonderful and steady stream of mist while in operation. It&#x27;s pretty amazing that a relatively small amount of water can create hours and hours of mist.&lt;br /&gt;5. It doesn&#x27;t require batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does feel slightly cheap, but the functionality redeems it :)&lt;br /&gt;2. The lids don&#x27;t twist on/tighten.  Maybe I received a defective one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the ZAQ  Aromatherapy Diffuser works beautifully. It‚Äôs easy to set up and fills any area with a refreshing scent. I&#x27;m planning to buy 1 or 2 more to place in my daughter&#x27;s rooms, especially for the winter. I highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It worked the first day.  Second day it would only stay on 5/10 minutes at a time.  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these for myself as well as a gift! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome diffuser. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It leaves any scent of the oil you choose in the room for hours.</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser.  It works wonderfully. Looks like a volcano with lots of steam rising from it. I love that I have the option to enjoy the blue ambiance or not.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this diffuser. The light is a perfect glow if you want to keep it on at night. It&#x27;s super quiet and makes my Young Living diffuser sound really loud. We have the blue and the yellow one, my 5 year old loves having one in her bedroom. The aroma from the essential oils covers a large area. The unit isn&#x27;t as bag as I had expected it to be but it&#x27;s a perfect size to fit on an end table and not take up too much room.</li>
            <li> I put this behind some decorative glass bottles and it illuminates them beautifully.  People always ask what smalls so good.  Also love putting my thieves int he diffuser during cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!  Easy to use and makes my house smell lovely!</li>
            <li> I have 4  . This is my 2nd of 4. It is beautiful but hold a small amount so ur always messing with it. But hey it looks the part;)</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser to use with some DoTerra oil that I had started using. I read the previous reviews and they all seemed pretty good. It was a lot smaller than I expected. It doesn&#x27;t hold a lot of water but when full it lasts for about 3 hours which isn&#x27;t bad. It looks just like the picture when it is working. The air coming out of it looks like steam. The light up portion on top is nice but I rarely use it. I like that it has the option though. Overall works great.</li>
            <li> A beautiful diffuser, works well and the night light is awesome</li>
            <li> Instantly fills our bottom floor with scent.  The light glow is really nice at night as well and I like that you don&#x27;t need to have the light on if you choose not to.  It&#x27;s very quite and takes up little space.  I may order another for the upstairs!</li>
            <li> Looks cool. Works great!!</li>
            <li> Broke after about two weeks</li>
            <li> very good diffuser . it makes the whole room ,smell good .&lt;br /&gt;I am required to keep typing so I recommended</li>
            <li> This diffuser works really well at putting the aroma in the air and is really pretty when the light is on. Only have 2 complaints. 1) I wish it could hold more water and run longer. 2) I used this in my bedroom and was able to turn off the light on the top of the unit... but there was still a small bright light coming from the switch and it illuminated the room. For someone that likes the room pitch dark... this won&#x27;t work. I will only use this in another room now.</li>
            <li> Opened the box, reviewed the simple, easy to follow directions with my 93 year old mother. We had it working within the first few minutes we opened the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that it uses plain tap water. It does say to use water soluble essential oils. We used what we had. As our elderly mother lives with us, we have days that we do not feel the room is as fresh as we would like. We also appreciated that we could use a variety of essential oils, such as lavender for a calming feeling, or any other of the many and variety of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is colorful with a warm light, which gives the diffuser a nice glow. I would love to see it in the dark. It does not need to warm up, a gentle mist with the chosen scent started the moment we pressed the on button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our first diffuser gadget. I was pleased with the simplicity of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our first day, so far so good.</li>
            <li> We run this every night in my son&#x27;s room with lavender essential oil.  He sleeps much more peacefully with fewer nightmares.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser, works very well, aromatic and great</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift.  Personally, I was disappointed that it was plastic.  For the price, the base could be made of ceramic.</li>
            <li> perfectly awesome product..more than i expected. Works so simply but effective.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this to everyone. even if you dont know you need one.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ll say that they have great customer service, the first one that I owned only would run for like 15 minutes at a time and then shut off.  They promptly sent me a new one, with no hassle. However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this one is defective too, but there is no way this runs for 3-4 hours at one time. Maybe the reservoir holds enough water to do that, but mine runs for around 30-40 minutes tops. Also, there is little to no scent throw with this. I got it to use with lavendar essential oil at night, to help me sleep, and even with it sitting on the nightstand next to the bed, I&#x27;d only get an occasional whiff and then nothing. Doesn&#x27;t even scent the room. I have to wonder if these vapo-diffusers are really worth it. I have owned the air bubbler ones and you can scent a whole room. The water vapor, if you watch, comes out the top and just sinks, so maybe the scent goes with it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to someone and I have not heard any results yet.  Don&amp;#34;t know, do not know yet/</li>
            <li> This is the first diffuser I&#x27;ve purchased and I agonized over the choices.  Honestly, I could not be happier with the ZAQ Allay Litemist.  It&#x27;s everything I was hoping it would be.  Incredibly easy to use.  Just fill with water, add your EO, push the power button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shuts itself off once the water gets low so I feel comfortable running it in our bedrooms at night.  And it has a great soft and soothing blue glow.</li>
            <li> Might be a fine product if it worked!  First time I used it (followed directions exactly) it turned itself off while the water basin was still half full.  After that it would only stay on for a few minutes at a time.  Saw that some other reviewers had the same problem.  ZAQ apparently has a quality assurance issue.  Tried to contact Zaq.com directly to see what they would say/do but their website is giving and error:  \\&quot;Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress.\\&quot;  So, defective product is being returned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am trying to green-ify my life, one little thing at a time. The most recent hurdle I tackled was using plug-in air fresheners. I have a dog, and I used things like Febreeze Air Effects to help take away the dog smell. I learned that there are many chemicals in such items that should be avoided, and so I started searching for more natural ways to freshen the air of my apartment, especially in the winter months when it&#x27;s too cold for me to open windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a small candle oil diffuser ([[ASIN:B001BOHU6Q Gifts &amp; Decor A Woman&#x27;s Prayer Oil Warmer Burner Diffuser Fragrances]]) which was relatively inexpensive, but I don&#x27;t always like leaving a candle going. I also didn&#x27;t like that the oil (which I mixed with some water) would eventually boil away, and if you were not careful, it would scald the glass piece at the top. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still like the candle diffuser, but I just have to keep more of a watchful eye on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some searching around for an electric model, and I came across this one. I nearly had a heart attack at the price I paid for it, especially concerning it&#x27;s not very big (just under 9\\&quot; tall), but it had such high reviews compared to other similar models that cost less. Let me tell you...it is worth the price. I love this thing. It disassembles very easily, you fill the water chamber with water and 3-5 drops of the oil of your choice, plug it in, turn it on, and let it go. I got the blue model, and the light is very low-key and relaxing. The steam that comes out of the diffuser is constant and truly carries the oil with it. It lasts a few hours, and the best part- when the water runs out, it shuts itself off. That means you can put it in your bedroom with some lavender or other oil of your choice, and you can fall asleep to it without worrying about a candle burning your house down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another neat feature is that you can turn the lighted cone off. I love this feature for sleeping with the diffuser on. If you press the power button once, it turns the unit on, light + steam. Press it again, the light turns off, but the steam keeps coming out (great to sleep to!). The power button is still blue though...it might make a great night light for some, but I just turn the blue part to face away from my bed. Press the button again, and the unit shuts off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is very portable and easy to clean. The cord has a plug-in for both the wall and the unit. Therefore, to clean it, you can leave the cord behind and just take the unit to the sink. I dry it out and use a cotton ball to soak up any moisture (the instructions say to use a Q-tip, but I find that&#x27;s not a big enough absorbent area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously considering purchasing another diffuser in the future, even though this is so easy to take room to room (have to save up a little first!) because I would love to have one upstairs and one downstairs. I just hope that it lasts a long time because this really is a neat product, and I am very happy with my purchase. Yay for chemical-free fragrances in the home!ss the power button once, it turns the unit on, light + steam. Press it again, the light turns off, but the steam keeps coming out (great to sleep to!).

            <li> This is awesome! It gives off a really nice mist and my whole house smells amazing when I use this diffuser, it&#x27;s a very powerful little guy! I have several diffusers and I have to say this one is by far one of my favorites! Definitely a MUST buy!</li>
            <li> Have had many different diffusers but this one is the best. Now have three.</li>
            <li> Best air freshener ever. It freshens the air quickly. The aroma fills very large rooms quickly. Highly recommend. I like this much better than traditional plug in air fresheners. A few drops of essential oils go a long way.</li>
            <li> works simply, and I like the fact it shuts off by itself</li>
            <li> Pretty, too small for me , so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Simple set up. Quiet, with a pleasant trickling sound. Small but fills a large room with diffused scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good humidifier/diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty quiet and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I got one for myself and one for my mother.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help me relax. Works great. The water container inside is a bit small, so it only runs for an hour or so before turning off and needs to be filled up. Also, if there is no draft, the steam coming out will just fall around the machine and expect the area to be a bit damp.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great. It is a simple design and streams vapor for about 4 hours. It is easy to clean and has an option of lighting up the blue stem or not. Quiet and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> Bought for my assistant, who likes aroma therapy etc.  Sleek design, she was very happy with the gift.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product frequently for almost a year and I love it.  It has really increased my interest in essential oils and their healing/emotional qualities.  This diffuser can be used with the light which creates a soft blue glow or without.  Fairly quiet, although you can hear the water inside sloshing around, but I find that it sounds like a gentle stream so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, it just adds to the ambiance!  Recommend!</li>
            <li> I was worried by some of the one-star reviews, especially those mentioning the ones that quick working after a week.  That has not been the case with mine.  It is running everyday, M-F, all day.  I love it.  It&#x27;s perfect for my office.  It instantly fills my office with whatever oil blend I need.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but I had to return the first on because it did not work right. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance and ordered another one‚Ä¶ I love it. I have used it almost daily for over a month and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use every day. My neighbors are smokers (live in a condo) and running this w essential oil helps me from jumping out the window. Shuts off on its own when water runs out. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser for what I paid. I noticed that it started shutting off before the water would run out, but I have been using it without the light on and it runs longer. I think having the light on makes it too hot and it automatically shuts off. I&#x27;d still recommend it though! I love using it with my d≈çTERRA essential oils.</li>
            <li> this diffuser quit working within 2 months,DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.  Use it for my Young Living Essential Oils.  It has an automatic shutoff.  Can be diffused with the light off or on.  The perfect size for an office or room.  I use it with my kids when they are sick, and hubby takes it to the office sometimes.  I have the yellow one too, which I&#x27;ve had longer and LOVE it.  Never had a problem with that one, so got another!</li>
            <li> Love the look and function of this device. It&#x27;s a great way to deliver natural scents to a room while providing real health benefits!</li>
            <li> Update dec 2015: I ordered two more and one is already broken after using it for four weeks. I would like to get it replaced.   This works perfectly. It spreads the smell through the room. I ordered one just to see if I would like it and now I wished I ordered two instead. I keep moving them through the house from our bedroom to our living room. And although I thought I was fine with that. It is extra work in the morning and evening, especially when you have children as well. I was a bit worried, because I lost track of time. But it switched itself of. I am really happy about that.</li>
            <li> I had a Spa Vapor that quit after a month or so, then I found this.  Works great, I love it.  Would buy another!</li>
            <li> It works fine during the first week I got it and then not functional at all very soon at the 2nd week. Totally waste my money!</li>
            <li> I have had this little guy for a few months now and use it often. i love how it looks and everyone comments on it and the smell that it omits. It stays running for a long time, I have not timed it however it is a few hours at least.  There are so many of these out there and I am very happy with this one.&lt;br /&gt;You can turn the top light off it is is distracting and it automatically turns off when it runs out which is great.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best impulse buys I&#x27;ve ever indulged in! I&#x27;ve had my for over a year and LOVE it. Being an asthmatic I have to be extremely careful with the scents I have in my environment. Though I love sweetly scented candles, they can sometimes make my asthma flare. This diffuser is a god send. Delivering whatever blends of natural oils I choose into the air it not only doesn&#x27;t upset my asthma but soothes my body and mind. This tool makes for a great way to explore aromatherapy. Since it is diffused with water you don&#x27;t have to worry about open flames of the oils being changed by heat.&lt;br /&gt;Some of my personal favorite blends are:&lt;br /&gt;Lavender + Peppermint (before bend or to relax)&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus + Peppermint ( to soothe stress)&lt;br /&gt;Clove Oil + Eucalyptus +Lemon + Cinnamon + Rosemary ( for when I&#x27;m under the weather)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are looking for a natural way to scent your home, or a way to explore the wonderful world of aromatherapy this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I now own 3 because I like it so much. One for work (I&#x27;m a massage therapist) one for home and one for my friends house where I frequent.</li>
            <li> It works, and it looks good. I usually turn it on while I cook and it controls the smell really well. It works pretty decent for my small apartment. However, if you&#x27;ve a big house, this is not the product for you, unless you want one in every room.</li>
            <li> My family members fight over this diffuser ! It is the easiest of my 3 to use, load, and clean. It looks so cool misting away, I get lots of WOW comments!  Really like the auto shutoff when empty too.</li>
            <li> everything work fine, but maybe this one a little too small for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> I really really like the Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser! After receiving one as a gift, using it daily, and being exceedingly happy with how it automatically turns off and fills an approximately 15&#x27; x 10&#x27; space with a light essential oil aroma - I bought one for my brother who also loves it. There are lots of great things about the diffuser including that it can (1) free a home of candle or other artificial (and possibly toxic) methods to bring aromatherapy into your space, (2) offer novelty seekers a huge variety of aromas (each use of this device lasts about 3-4 hours) without having to clutter a home with individual candles or plug-ins (3) be a pretty accent to a room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While certain candles may fill a larger space with aroma, this seems to work in the area that I currently have it. I would guess that in large spaces or with high ceilings, this device would be less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each use, you are suggested to fill the base with water and 5 drops of an essential oil. You can put more for an increasingly potent aroma while the device is running, but I don&#x27;t find the aroma to last when the device is not in use.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I had pictured in my mind but it works amazingly well!  Great packaging, fast shipment.  This doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room so it can be used on small end tables &amp; night stands.  Have used this every day since I got it (4 days ago) &amp; it runs on average 3-4 hours with a fill.  The kids love the blue light it gives off &amp; I like the fact I can turn it off at night if I don&#x27;t want the ambiance (though note the blue power button is still lit, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overly bright).  Very satisfied &amp; will save up to get more so I don&#x27;t have to keep moving this around from living room to bedroom to bedroom to bedroom.</li>
            <li> First off to those who wrote a bad review about this diffuser, you most likely got a bad one or don&#x27;t know how to use it properly. Out of the box this thing works amazing. Produces a great amount of refreshing steam that fills your area with a great, clean scent. The steam lasts for about 3 hours when fully filled, and I usually put 5 drops of my choice of essential oils (3-5 drops is recommended). My room starting smelling fresh and clean within 5-10 min., and whats great about this diffuser is it has an auto shut-off feature when the water is fully depleted. This diffuser works great also if you use it to clear your sinuses by inhaling the steam, or just to feel refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this diffuser and will probably buy another one for my mom because she loves it so much &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Have had this little diffuser for 2 months, use it almost daily, and enjoy it immensely.  Very cute looking also.  Thought about buying a second one, but it is just a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!  I have 3 of them, and have never had a problem with an of them.  Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> It makes cool looking mist that has pleasant quite sound when it comes out. I wish this lamp would have a little more sophisticated appearance.</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser and was so excited to use it with my new oils.  It would stay on for 10-15 minutes and then shut off.  There was plenty of water in the base, so it wasn&#x27;t because the water was low.  I read on line and it was suggested that too much oil in the water caused it to go off.  Washed it out, let it dry throughly for 2 days, and still continued to shut off after 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am returning and looking for a different diffuser  Sorry.</li>
            <li> love this thing, I use it all the time, I have a head cold and it helps me breathe so much easier.</li>
            <li> Opened the diffuser, added the water and my choice of oil.... the diffuser worked for about 2 hours and then cut itself off.  Now it won&#x27;t stay on for more than 15 minutes.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Update &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Replacement piece fixed the diffuser!!  Works perfectly now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much enjoying this diffuser. It is just the right size and the blue light is pretty.  The shape is interesting and I get lots of comments from friends who see it. It runs for 30 min at a time .. I would like it to run until empty but not a big deal I just push the button again!  Try it using Thieves essential oil from Young Living..You will be hooked too!</li>
            <li> I loved the previous two I purchased, which is why I purchased a third, this one decided not to work however ;(</li>
            <li> Bought one of these for myself and love it....lots of choices for essential oils to use. Puts out a nice clean mist. Much better than burning insence and no dusty mess.Since I have bought 2 more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Great product! Perfect for using my Young Living essential oils at night on my night stand.</li>
            <li> I love it!! Works great !!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! Diffuses for hours, very easy to clean, and leaves a beautiful blue light for when you want a relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Have bought 2 of them for gifts.  They are effective, not big and bulky and attractive.</li>
            <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t last 3-4 hours, more like 2 hours, but it does work VERY well. I am extremely satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> I have had problems with this product since receiving it.  It does have a nice blue light, if you enjoy attractive lighting.  You also have the option to turn off the blue LED lighting, which I like.  However, the power button is always lit with a small LED light if it is on.  This is not ideal if you want it in your bedroom while sleeping and are sensitive to lights, like I am.  The main problem I had with this product is the fact that it does not stay on long before turning off automatically.  Sometimes it lasts seconds, sometimes it lasts half an hour.  I have read other reviews stating it just needs to be cleaned properly.  I did this, yet it still has problems.  The first time used, it only lasted several minutes.  I only use two or three drops of 100% essential oil.  After a month, I have decided to return this product.  I just purchased (for a second time) a different diffuser, which works very well (and emits no light).</li>
            <li> I have one in blue and one in pink.  I enjoy them both.</li>
            <li> Works really great, I use it every night!</li>
            <li> Bought one...loved it so much, bought a second for my daughter&#x27;s room.  Have been using them every night for about 6 weeks and they both work wonderfully!  I have to cover the power switch with a towel so that it&#x27;s not too bright, but my daughter uses it like a nightlight.  Shipping was fast and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Longest lasting diffuser I&#x27;ve had so far...we use it every night!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this. I even bought one for the grandson with autism and was so disappointed.  The units are set to run with automatic shut off in 3 to 4 hours.  They should have said 30 to 40 minutes if you are lucky.  I will return both diffusers for refund.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these.  Both stopped working.  This one only worked for about a month.  The other one lasted about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Love these diffusers. Works well</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Fill with regular tap water. Uses only few drops of essential oil. Runs very quietly and mists a very fine spray into the air and leaves a great scent. It&#x27;s very pretty with the blue light that automatically turns on when you run it . Automatic shut-off is perfect. It looks very pretty and appealing.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  Soothing and relaxing!  Great for creating a spa-like atmosphere.  Easy to set up and use.  (And I hate reading instructions).  Soft blue light.  Fine mist with gentle aromatherapy infused into the air when essential oils added.  Perfect size and design - not too large or obnoxious.  Automatic shut-off when water is depleted.  No mess.  No fuss.  Worth every penny and then some.  Does not come with essential oils, so be sure to have some on hand because you will want to try this out as soon as it arrives!</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser. It&#x27;s quiet and it puts out a nice amount of vapor.  The vessel is small so you have to fill it every couple of hours but it&#x27;s really not a problem.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I thought it would be. Easy to set up and work. Auto stop works well. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Best diffuser ever! Quiet, simple and auto shut off when water is done...delivers nice scent throughout the room and has a simple clean up.. Would definetly recommend</li>
            <li> Ran this a few times a day for 2 weeks, then stopped using it for about 3 weeks.  I tried to use the unit again and it will not longer power on.  The small blue leds where you fill up the water when turned on show a very faint flicker and that&#x27;s it.  It worked great when it was working but now its dead.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my diffuser. I bought several essential oils and use them nightly to help me relax, sleep, and stay asleep. I wish there were an option to turn out the light completely but I just wrap a towel around the base.</li>
            <li> Within moments of turning on the diffuser, scented (mist?) streams forth exactly as pictured.  The light through the semi-clear covering is a nice accent, and makes this item both functional and elegant.  Very easy to fill and use; simply remove the colored cover, and a small plastic framing piece, pour water and scent to the line, place covers back on and hit the power button.&lt;br /&gt;  My one complaint might be that the two cover pieces are in no way attached to the base making it more likely you lose them, or they get knocked off.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Aromatherapy Diffuser. I didn&#x27;t realize how small it was going to be, but I still love it!</li>
            <li> I love my new diffuser! Works great!</li>
            <li> Quiet, effective, pretty.</li>
            <li> Even in my daughters small room the diffuser seems to struggle with coverage. I also need to put lost of oil in to get a sent. I wish I could get my money back but I threw away the box.</li>
            <li> I wish is would hold more water, but is very nice</li>
            <li> A good product and a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I got this as a first time user of a diffuser, and I am very pleased with it!  It&#x27;s small and blends in well, but it gives off a nice glow and soft dripping sound.  Easy to move from room to room.  I purchased the blue one.  It lasts for a long time and turns off by itself.  It suggests three or four drops of oil but I like the scent to be stronger so I use about six drops.  I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This thing has really helped me sleep.  I used to have trouble falling asleep, but not anymore.  My only complaints are the light, even the one for the power switch, is way too bright (I cover it every night) and I wish it held more water so it would stay on longer.  Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night after it has already shut off, my troubles getting back to sleep return.</li>
            <li> was able to use it once and then it went dead. i tried all of the potential solutions in the Q &amp; A, and not a single one worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;returned to amazon</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this diffuser.  I think what I like the most about it is the fact that when it is out of water, it turns itself off.  That is a real bonus since I like to leave it on when I leave my house so it is smells great when I get home.  I add more than a few drops because I like stronger smells.  For the price it is great.  It arrived quickly and seems to be doing just fine.  No problems</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it and will be ordering a second one for my bedroom. The automatic shut off device is a great feature.</li>
            <li> I like it, just not a fan of the diffused air going straight up.  I&#x27;d prefer it to be at an angle to help circulate in the room.</li>
            <li> Special gift to myself, works wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks good!  Thank you!  Very quick ship too!</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser for the first 3 days, after that, it started to emit a high pitched noise which i couldn&#x27;t shut off. I tried to ignore it but it was just too loud. I really wanted to like this diffuser :(</li>
            <li> At first, I liked how much vapor was coming out of it but now, only a couple weeks later, there is hardly any vapor at all.  Very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> Love it... I use it every day... I like that it shuts off by itself.  It is very soothing to the soul..</li>
            <li> A friend had one of these so I had to purchase one for myself! I just love it &amp; love the feature it has to automatically shut off when it&#x27;s out of vapor.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very sensitive to scents. This oil diffuser has solved our problem. We can now have fresh scents in our home that are not empowering because we can now take control of how light or strong we&#x27;d like our home to smell</li>
            <li> Great at first. Stopped working after a month. Right when I got sick. Diffusers aren&#x27;t known to last forever - most I&#x27;ve had get to about 6 months. 1 month is ridiculous. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! Haven&#x27;t had any problems yet, and very easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first received it. I have used it for approximately 2 weeks and it stopped working out of no where. It is plugged in and all. Just will not power on. I emailed the ZAQ customer service department and have not heard anything back yet.</li>
            <li> I have three different diffusers...and I love this one!  Excellent purchase!</li>
            <li> love it!  works great</li>
            <li> It stopped working within two weeks</li>
            <li> Love, love, love my diffuser.  I bought a second one for my sister and she loves hers as well.  It is so easy to use and I love the fact that it has an automatic shut off feature.  I can start any blend I like depending on my mood and doze off and not worry about the diffuser shutting off when the water runs low.  Also, the fact that I can shut off the internal light within the diffuser or leave it on to relax with is a great feature. Great price too.  I&#x27;ve compared and this was money well spent.</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser.  Very easy to fill, use, and clean.  Diffuses for 3-4 hours.  Light can be turned off.  The best thing is the great price.  I have more expensive diffusers that do not work as wll as this one.  I now have 3 of these in my home.  Love them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great size and looks very nice in my living room. It works very well. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Great price and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is it a bit cheap looking.  However, for the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li> The best purchase I&#x27;ve made. The color is fascinating, the unit works instantly and it turns itself off when empty.  I am buying two more because my children want one in their rooms.  Shipped fast too</li>
            <li> Really does a great job, and I love the automatic shut-off!</li>
            <li> Nice look, diffuses very well, great price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Been using this daily and loving it. Easy to fill and no mess.  Fits on any shelf or counter</li>
            <li> Fantastic diffuser love it I just order another one:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this diffuser for a little over 1 month. So far so good. Every so often I wipe it out with a cotton ball or swab like directions recommend. I don&#x27;t use citrus oils in it as I&#x27;ve read that they can clog diffusers up. Works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> this little diffuser works amazingly well AND turns itself off when it&#x27;s empty! I use it in my son&#x27;s room with just a few (3 or so) drops of essential oils and this will fill the room in about a minute. I will only fill it 1/4 of the way if I intend to be asleep soon myself, knowing that it will not overheat or burn out... it&#x27;s awesome! Most often I fill it up run it for about 5 - 15 minutes tops and then turn it off. I highly recommend this product. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I might not be using it right. I went to a health food store and got some scents but maybe I don&#x27;t put enough into the little dish, I don&#x27;t think that aroma hangs around long enough. A friend of mine had one in her hospital room and it was wonderful so I&#x27;ll ask her how much to use of the essential oil. It&#x27;s very modern looking. Watching the steam coming out of the top of it is nice and calming. It&#x27;s very light weight, in fact too light weight, my cat has tipped it over so I know not to leave it unattended.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get a good 3 to 5 hours out of this product............not so it only has one setting and it may run for 1.5 to 2 hours,I will stay with the one I have purchase two of that has 2 setting and does give me 5 or so hours on the low setting.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Love that you can hit the button a second time to disable the light.</li>
            <li> The Allay LiteMist Aromatherapy is absolutely wonderful.  It was everything I expected and more. I plan to buy at least 3 more and give them as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get an atomizer.  We have been trying to move away from chemicals, but really like a fresh house. We have pets and need that extra boost. This unit is easy to fill and scents about half the house. My only complaint is I only get about 4 hours tops put of one tank of water, despite the claims of 8 hours. I use filtered water and a combo of oils. My favorite combo is grapefruit,  jasmine, and peppermint.  It is very easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it only burns about 3 hours. I use it during the day because it&#x27;s easy to refill and restart it. I use one that lasts 8 hours at night.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first got it, but as I am not home a lot, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it very much in the first month. By the time I had it 5 weeks, I had used it about 10 times. Now all of the sudden, it no longer turns on or responds at all! After reading other reviews, I tried filling it to different levels, but nothing works! -- apparently, you have only 30 days to return this item. So because I did not use this daily, it is now 1 &amp; 1/2 months since I purchased this and I cannot return it. I was hesitant to spend $40 on this small unit anyway, but heard good reviews. I would not buy anything from a company that will not stand by the product for more than 1 month.</li>
            <li> Awesome !!&lt;br /&gt;I been looking for a oil diffuser for a long time, I&#x27;m glad I purchase this one!&lt;br /&gt;Every time I feel stress or get go to sleep, I put my diffuser with my favorite oil , and awww works so good on me !!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I purchase this because even my doggies seem to enjoy it !!</li>
            <li> My spouse and I purchased this to place in our newborn daughter&#x27;s room.  We use lavendar at night to create a good sleep environment.  After about a month of use, we are exceptionally happy with the overall performance of this product and the vendor.  The light shuts off after a few hours, so this works great as a defacto night light for going to bed if don&#x27;t need the light all night.  This model is able to handle our master bedroom with ease and distributes the oil&#x27;s scent just a little ways down the hall.</li>
            <li> We love it just wish it was a little bigger and lasted all night :) thank you</li>
            <li> Totally enjoying this diffuser</li>
            <li> I like it! Working good for around 3hrs!</li>
            <li> Works like it should. Lights are a nice feature. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great for a small room!! Diffuses oils nicely, easy to use and small. Perfect on a bedside table.</li>
            <li> I use this diffuser every night.  It works well and looks cool!  It runs very quiet so its easy to forget it&#x27;s on.  It would be even better if it had a timer on it but for the cost I think it&#x27;s a pretty solid purchase.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  It worked as it should for about 6 weeks and now when I press the button to turn it on- it immediately turns off.  I tried cleaning the product and it still doesn&#x27;t work.  I will NOT be recommending this product to anyone and would really like to return it and be refunded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sadly,&lt;br /&gt;Julia Gallup</li>
            <li> I love this Oil Diffuser!  It&#x27;s small and very effective moving my selected fragrance throughout the house.  It also has an adjustable on/off light function.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for the bedroom or small room. Diffuses great and love the option for the light to be on or off. Super easy to clean which is a big deal. Will be buying more for my other bedrooms.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It filled the room with my scented oil immediately. I saw something similar at my massage therapist&#x27;s and decided to buy one. The blue has a nice calming glow but I&#x27;m Glad you can turn the light off if needed. Hoping I don&#x27;t have problems with it quitting like some of the other reviewers mentioned but I think cleaning the unit and letting it dry out will solve that according to the manufacturer.  This would also make a great gift with some oils!</li>
            <li> I love how easy this is to use. I travel with it and my eucalyptus oil.  I especially like that it emits just the right amount of humidity, turns off when it&#x27;s done, and it&#x27;s compact. Goodbye large humidifiers with filters that only use distilled water.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works great and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> Works great. Simple to use. Fills the room.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it would be like the others and just give a small puff here and there.  It arrived so fast I was shocked.  I put it together and turned it on and it worked immediately. I was so impressed and so happy. This product is awesome!! And it shuts itself off! I ordered two more. LOVE THIS!!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is awesome!</li>
            <li> Disappointed, after using this for only a few times it suddenly stopped working. I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> It totally relaxes you.  Put some lavender oil and unwind.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and use. There is an option to use without the light on which is nice. I&#x27;ve heard in the past that citrus oils can&#x27;t be used with these but it worked for me, just didn&#x27;t fill the entire room with the scent. Be cautious of where you place this if you have pets or children as it could tip over easy and spill. After comparing several oil diffusers online and reading blog recommendations/reviews this is one of the less expensive oil diffuser I&#x27;ve found that work just as good as the more expensive ones (per reviews I&#x27;ve read). I plan to buy another for my office soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an oil diffuser before but this is amazing. I had it smelling up my condo within about 30 seconds of having it out of the box. You really only need a few drops of oil to fill a large room (large by my big city living standards!) and if you fill the diffuser to its max capacity with water, I think it lasts about 4 hours. I am now busy compiling an arsenal of every essential oil known to man....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but doesn&#x27;t give off as much scent as expected.  Does work well though in a very small area.</li>
            <li> cool gadget, it works perfecly, i been running it dayly for a month now, havent even clean it and it just run and diffuse the oil pretty well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this!  It is like having a pure chemical free candle that infuses the room with whatever scent you choose.  It&#x27;s super easy to use, turns off automatically when the water runs out, and has a light on or off function so you can use it as a nightlight or not.  This is a MUCH more economical solution than candles and is much healthier. Unless you buy soy candles with a lead free wick, which are expensive, you are better off with this!  You can buy one jar of essential oil and it will last MUCH longer than any candle since a 3-4 hour cycle in the diffusser uses only 5 drops. I use this in my living room/kitchen area and when I have the ceiling fan on it circulates the scent to the whole area.  I bought this along with lavender oil and cinnamon oil. One for calming and one for the nice fall scent.  I also have eucalyptus oil in case anyone feels stuffy and look forward to buying balsam fir oil for the Christmas season. I am considering buying another one for my bedroom.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something low cost but not to the point that I was throwing away my money on something that didn&#x27;t work. When I found this and it seemed a match. I has worked great. I have had no complaints about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a few months use this item became fickle and would not stay on even after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I bought two diffusers around the same time.  This one was a little cheaper and, as such, it seems that it&#x27;s not as high of quality as the more expensive one.  I have no idea if it&#x27;s an element of getting what you pay for, but at first this one seemed to work great!  Then it started only running for a short time and turning off, even though it was still full.  I do clean it occasionally with rubbing alcohol as the packaging suggested and that seems to remedy the issue for a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser has no intermittent function (which, as it turns out, I really like on my other diffuser) and it emits quite a large amount of mist, making whatever surface it&#x27;s sitting on wet if run continuously!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this diffuser and think it works well.  I would prefer it to be able to run intermittently and emit a little less moisture.  This only runs for about 3 hours when completely full, which usually does the job but I&#x27;d prefer it to run longer for night time use.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has two of these and so does her friend and they love them.  I ordered one and was very excited to get it two days after I&#x27;d ordered it.  But when I filled it with water and oil it only ran for about half an hour before it shut off.  I kept turning it back on and it would run for a few minutes then shut off again.  I tried again today hoping it was just a fluke but same thing - it runs for a short time then totally shuts off.  So - am going to pack it up and return it.  If it had worked I would have loved it.  The blue is so pretty with the mist coming out - it was great if it would have just kept running.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to pay twice the price from an Essential Oil company.  It does great.  It runs for about 4-5 hours straight before needing a refill.</li>
            <li> Perfect amount of diffusion delivered by micro mist. It does not form condensation on surfaces. Very relaxing and quiet. Cuts off automatically.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time, you can use any kind of essential oil and it cleans well.  It also has a nice off button by depressing the on switch twice.  After having two doTerra misters that I returned after a month of having each one, this product won by a mile.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. I use doTerra essential oils and can smell them throughout the room with just a few drops in this diffuser. It runs for several hours, haven&#x27;t exactly timed the exact amount of time but it holds such a small amount of water it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would go for as long as it does. I can smell the oils in my entire room! So very happy with this diffuser I hope it last longer then the last one I had!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, we own four of these now because all of my kids wanted one too since they loved mine so much. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these - one for myself, and one for my parents. I had looked at a lot of them, and mistakenly ordered this one that doesn&#x27;t have the color changing. I was disappointed in that, though it was no fault of the seller, but my mom was happy about it, because she uses it in their room, and she is deaf, so the color changing probably would have made her wake up. It works perfectly, and mom really likes that it adds a little moisture to the room. We use it with Four Thieves oil most often, and it makes the room smell really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a lavender essential oil to help ease myself into sleep at night.  I just add tap water, 5 drops of oil, plug it in, and turn it on. Works instantly. The only issue I&#x27;ve been having is that the unit will sometimes shut itself off before the basin is empty. This actually happens more often than not and it seems to be an entirely random occurrence as I have tried in vain to replicate what might be causing it. I&#x27;ve tried adjusting the water and oil ratios and levels; but it&#x27;s the same results. Sometimes it works and other times I&#x27;ll have to restart it 3-4 times before it&#x27;s empty. This has been happening since I got the unit so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s something to do with the unit itself at this point.</li>
            <li> Have had this for 9 months and it works fabulous still. We use it almost daily!</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;m new to essential oils and diffusing but with the doterra oils it does the trick! The night light is great and having the option to shut it off and still have it run is a great option! I put my lavender in and am sleep soundly before it shuts off! :-)</li>
            <li> Using the essential oils have the room smelling fantastic.  Love the auto shut off.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Works Great!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is perfect for a small room.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, and has met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> love the quality of this little diffuser</li>
            <li> Have referred several people to you already!  I enjoy it daily!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! I&#x27;ve used it pretty much all day every day since I&#x27;ve bought it. Fill it up; place 3-5 drops of essential oils in it and let it run until it runs out of water and automatically shuts off--easy.    Update 11/5/14: My diffuser died last night! :( I can&#x27;t believe it--its only been 3 months! Not sure if it is worth trying to purchase a replacement kit for the ceramic piece or not--probably order another, of a different brand--because 3 months just isn&#x27;t going to cut it for me! I cleaned it regularly every day--sometimes more depending what oils I would diffuse! Not sure if anyone else has had this issue, but the unit won&#x27;t turn on at all currently.    Update 11/13/14: I have been in contact with the seller. They have agreed to replace the unit so long as I pay shipping and handling of $18.00. The seller has always responded quickly to my messages and has been nothing but helpful. Can&#x27;t wait to get my replacement unit, update this review one more time, and begin diffusing once again! Also, with being out of a diffuser for this amount of time has shown me how much I NEED my diffuser. I&#x27;ve been a sniffy, sneeze-filled, mess without it!    Update 11/20/14: My new diffuser came in the mail! The seller was so easy to work with and I appreciate their willingness to help. Already plugged in and going again. :)</li>
            <li> I have a young living diffuser and this one is way better! No clogging. Runs quietly. I like that you can shut the light off.</li>
            <li> Bought in Oct and it quit working last week.  Lasted about 6 weeks.  Now I can&#x27;t return it.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with this product. I like the fact I can turn on the light, or turn it off. Great little diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love love it. I have 2 of these and the lotus. The lotus diffuser is twice as expensive and works half as well. These rock!  Even my husband commented.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay....for a small area, wish i held more liquid.....</li>
            <li> We have used this diffuser for about a month now and really like it! It&#x27;s simple to use, easy to clean, and looks great in any room. We have the blue one which is currently used in our living room but we move it in to a bedroom at night. We are very pleased wth how the essential oils are diffused. There is very little noise, and it automatically shuts off after about three hours..  Because we have had such great results we will be buying my daughter the pink one for her bedroom:) Overall, this is a great product and has met all our basic needs. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This is way smaller than I was expecting and goes through the water/oil VERY quickly (sometimes under an hour). So, if you want something that provides longer term scent for a space, this is not the best option (unless you like filling it up once an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it works and has a nice shape. It just doesn&#x27;t do what I was hoping it would do.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.  Puts out a nice amount of mist. Auto cut off. For the price as good as other higher prices</li>
            <li> This little thing really works! I keep it on my nightstand and it puffs out scented oil for a good long time while I fall to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I read on line that a diffuser of natural jasmine oil would help one sleep better. I&#x27;m not sure if it works because of the oil or because of the placebo affect but I do know I&#x27;m sleeping much more soundly.  I especially like this because it is safer than a lit candle or candle powered diffuser.  I&#x27;m happy such simple remedies have such a positive effect. Sleep is a very good thing!</li>
            <li> This diffuser was fine while it lasted. It lasted almost exactly 4 months. I tried cleaning it as some reviews stated but with no success. I tried contacting the company but never heard from them. There are better diffusers out there for the money.</li>
            <li> nice compact size, works well, haven&#x27;t had any issues with it not working. once it turns itself off i clean it well simply by wiping it out with a clean cloth to get excess water and oils out. I haven&#x27;t used any lemon on it, directions didn&#x27;t say anything about using citrus oils. however, if i reeeeally want to use citrus, i have a normal electric and a candle burner for oils i can use.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great. It comes on quick, works until chamber empties and we love the blue glow in the evenings. We use a long list of Doterra essential oils in it and they all work great. After using it for a month we ordered a second one for a second room. We did not want to fight over who got to sleep with the diffuser any more.  There were no problems as reported in some of the reviews and we recommend this product. .</li>
            <li> I love this thing! That&#x27;s really all I have to say, I use a variety of essential oils and my room smells great. It puts me right to sleep too!</li>
            <li> It was a gift I gave someone so I&#x27;m not sure how it works but my sister was happy to receive it.</li>
            <li> My yoga studio had this and I loved it so I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> This product stopped working after 8 uses.  So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price.  I&#x27;m happy and would buy it again.  Easy to use.  Quiet.</li>
            <li> I like my home scents to be noticed. This is very faint for a small space. If you don&#x27;t like strong scents and have a small room, it would work.</li>
            <li> Thinking of ordering more!  My daughter loves this in her room.  I can think of so many people who need this</li>
            <li> I bought another one for my home and recently was adopting a baby so I didn&#x27;t open anything before the baby was here.  When I did I was a week out of my return policy and the thing shuts off within a couple minutes of using it.  It&#x27;s completely defective.  The other one still works great so it&#x27;s definitely not user error. Evidently once out of the return policy you can&#x27;t contact the seller about it just stuck with it.  I&#x27;m one for two on this so hopefully their quality is higher than that.  These things aren&#x27;t cheap for what they are.</li>
            <li> Just received this and was so excited to try it out.  I plugged it in and it worked for about 45 minutes and then shut off.  I turned it back on and it worked for about 3 minutes.  Kept trying, even tried turning the blue light off, but it still would only stay on for 3 minutes at the most.  Returning it. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> It smells so good when it&#x27;s on but mine will only stay on maybe fifteen minutes at the most!  I have to keep turning it back on.  that&#x27;s pretty annoying.  There were no instructions that came with it so I have no way of knowing if I am doing anything wrong!  I&#x27;ve tried everything!! BUT...while it&#x27;s working it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> This diffuser works very well with my essential oils, it was a great value too!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great! A great diffuser for the price!</li>
            <li> There are numerous good reviews on this product, so I&#x27;ll keep this short &amp; sweet.  I love the diffuser, it is easy to use, easy to clean, and has worked flawlessley for me for the last 7 months.  The only reason I took away 1 star is because of the glowing blue power button.  You can choose to have the nitelite on or off, but even with the light off, the button glows so brightly it keeps me awake. (I face it to the wall and cover the light with a book for now)  If you have a hard time with sleeping and lights, consider this before buying!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser and use it almost daily. It, with the essential oils, makes my house smell like a spa! It is so relaxing to turn it on and take in the relaxing aromas. It definitely needs to be cleaned after every three or so uses, otherwise it starts to smell funky. It is mildly tricky to clean--you need to use q-tips to get into some of the areas. Other than that, though, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have one at home and one at school.</li>
            <li> Use it nightly and it&#x27;s still going strong&lt;br /&gt;Emits good scent and the light is an added benefit</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the design of this. The mist goes straight up and then usually comes straight back down. If it&#x27;s where there is some air flow, the mist will go in the direction of the air which is not necessarily where you want it to go.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a xmas christmas and it works wonderfully!  I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked because some reviewers on similar products said it didn&#x27;t even fill up the room with scent.  This one definitely does and smells great.</li>
            <li> I  pushes out way  too much  of the  essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;Cost more to return than I wanted or I would have ret urned it.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine in August of 2014 and loved it. But unfortunately now not even 6 months later it is already starting to just turn off when it is not even empty yet. I clean it out all the time so I know it is not that. Really like the product just feel it should last longer then 6 months.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product - ordered 3 already! Great gifts!</li>
            <li> love that the light can be on or off, works great, great price</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Great value and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> had to send back,,,not all there!!!!!</li>
            <li> It only worked like 4 or 5 times .&lt;br /&gt;It just won&#x27;t turn ON, it jus died.</li>
            <li> This little thing is one of the best diffusers I have ever owned. It scents my entire bedroom and bathroom with only a couple of drops of oil, and runs for 4+ hours. It&#x27;s silent, which is perfect since I keep it in my office on days I work. No leaking, easy to clean...I could not be happier with this purchase. Come payday, I&#x27;m buying another for my son&#x27;s room!</li>
            <li> I purchased this 8 weeks ago and it stopped working last night! I am past the 30 day return mark so I&#x27;m out the $40 bucks I spent. Save your money and buy a better diffuser!!!!</li>
            <li> Best candle I bought ever</li>
            <li> Small but it does the job. Just doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> This came in super fast. It&#x27;s very easy to work. I&#x27;ve had mine and love it! It makes the house smell great. Thumbs up on this one.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE This item. Make my office smell amazing!</li>
            <li> Sent back because it was malfunctioned. Would&#x27;ve been nice if it actually worked though.</li>
            <li> Wonderful diffuser! Works great, and the fact that it turns off by itself when it runs out of water is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  Perfect size for the bedroom.  Simple to move to another room if you wish.  Easy to clean.  I use it every night.</li>
            <li> This Diffuser was exactly as described.  It has a colorful blue LED light display.  It holds quite a bit of water and runs for hours.  The motor is quiet. There is only one on/off button which makes the diffuser super simple to operate.  Practical and pretty.</li>
            <li> This operates perfectly to use with my essential oils,and I like the fact that it turns off when water is used up,it also looks good where ever you place it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this item and it broke. I love it when it works. As soon as you can not return it or replace it, it stops working. I purchased this for my wife and it stopped working after two months. I bought if for her again for Christmas hoping it was a fluke. The first week in February it stopped working again. The company will not replace it because it is passed the 30 day return policy. We purchased this product twice and it only lasted on average 6 weeks. It never dropped or fell. It just stopped working. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> This diffuser really puts out a lot of smokey, misty oil which makes the room smell great. Also great when you have a cold.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these, work great with essential oils</li>
            <li> This little diffuser is quiet, and it works alot better then the young living diffuser that my MIL has. I am currently purchaseing 3 more to put in my childrens rooms because of their allergys and just need right amout of moisture to help their sinus cavities.</li>
            <li> I love how easy to use these are! Perfect to enrich the air and make your home smell heavenly. I also love them with some peppermint oil for my son when he has a runny noise. Nice quality product that I purchased another one after I got this at a promotional price! **I received a free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> Love the diffuser and the price was a fraction of the other companies.</li>
            <li> This is the first aromatherapy oil diffuser that I have tried and I was not sure what to expect. I was quite impressed and pleasantly surprised. I loved the glowing blue light and the mist it gave out. You can use any essential oils in this device to give off the scent and help relieve stress, improve mood, or anything else they are supposed to do. I only had one essential oil at the time I got this, which was peppermint. So I used that. I was impressed with how well this gave off that scent in the room that I had this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you need to do is apply a few drops of the oil you want and you will be able to smell it as the diffuser gives off mist. I also liked the sound of the light bubbling that it was giving off. It was very relaxing and soothing. I cannot wait to try different oils now. This is perfect for your living room or an office to give a relaxing ambience when you have guests over. I use this for myself so I am going to try different oils to find which ones I like most. It was easy to put this device together and fill it with water. The only thing I did not like was the outer top, which is the blue cone part, does not snap or click onto the base. It fits perfectly but it can easily be knocked off since there is nothing holding it onto the base. That is the only thing I wish was different. I was excited to receive the blue one through a promotion for testing and quality purposes. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping for Works great! Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser along with the 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Basic Sampler Essential Oil Gift Set. We use it every night going to bed. You can have the option of the blue light on or off but the on/off switch stays blue. I like it!</li>
            <li> This product is good looking and works well. I use it in a large room and the aroma can be smelled all over the place. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> It is almost ridiculous how much we love this diffuser.  Having received it as a thank you gift from some houseguests back in December, we&#x27;ve used it every night since.  And sometimes multiple times throughout the day too.  Because of this gift, we are now regular haunts at the local healthy store&#x27;s essential oil aisle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Zaq Allay is a small Aromatherapy Diffuser.  This means that it takes water and essential oil and transforms it into a mist with the touch of a button.  The unit comes with a base, an unpluggable cord, an inner clear plastic cone, and the outer (in our case blue) plastic cone.  To operate, you unplug the cord from the unit, take off the plastic cones, and fill the reservoir with water to the inner rim.  Then you drop in a few drops of your choice of oils, replace the cones on top, and plug the unit back into the cord.  The first press of the button turns the unit on and mist immediately begins flowing, a light also lights up the power button and the colored cone at the top.  A second press of the button turns off the light on the cone, but the power button light still remains on.  A third press turns the unit off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that you can see the mist coming out of the machine.  It is fascinating to watch (at least the cats think so) and the fact that it happens immediately is pretty magical too.  If left turn on it will run for several hours (3-4) although once it ran the entire night and was still going when we woke up the next morning (there was still water in the reservoir, it wasn&#x27;t running dry).  Once the reservoir empties, it automatically shuts itself off.  So you can set it and forget about it or use it as a sleep aid without worrying.  I usually put about 5 drops into the machine and I can smell it pretty strongly on my entire 2nd floor (2 bedrooms, a hall and a bath) and sometimes I can even smell it downstairs in my living room when it&#x27;s been running upstairs so I feel like it does a great job scenting the air and providing moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy. I just use a damp cloth on the inside of the reservoir and I haven&#x27;t noticed any buildup of oil.  The only time I&#x27;ve ever had problems with the unit is when I overfilled the reservoir and it took awhile to get to a manageable level for the diffuser to operate correctly, but that was my fault, not the diffusers.  With the correct amount of water it has worked perfectly every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do love this thing and am now considering a bigger one from the same company for my downstairs.  They&#x27;re fun to place with, make the place smell great, and are neat to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2015viding moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanup is easy.

            <li> I think this diffuser is great! I bought 4 of them and use them often. The price was very reasonable and I would compare it to some of the more expensive diffusers.</li>
            <li> Works in perfect order simple steps add water then oil and turn on.... it turns off when the water runs out or after an extended time period and that&#x27;s great for me I am a forgetful person so all stars for this product</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser, it&#x27;s easy to set up, easy to travel with, and it really gets the job done. You can also decide to turn on or off the light. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I would love it a little more if it stayed on at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Fabulous diffuser! Works perfectly and was surprised to see how much the smell really moves around the room from such a small object. Just ordered a second one (a different brand because I wanted a larger capacity). Have recommended this to many people as I am actually using it in a  salon to help purify and freshen the air. My clients are LOVING it!</li>
            <li> Perfectly adequate little diffuser. Great for bedrooms or other smaller rooms. Not too powerful and doesn&#x27;t hold much water but works great.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser. It seems to run out sooner that 4 hours though.</li>
            <li> It seems to last about 3 hours. Very easy to operate. The blue light can be turned off, the power button will still be very bright at night but I put something in front and all is well again.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works GREAT!! I love that it can run with the light on, the light off, and it shuts off automatically when the water runs dry!!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the diffuser.  I wish the reservoir was larger.  It works well but more for smaller rooms and areas.  The light (I have blue) is soft and nice.  Perfect for a bathroom steam or in a bedroom.</li>
            <li> This was a decent enough diffuser except for the fact that it only lasted for 1-2.5 hours instead of 3-4. I paid an extra 10 bucks and got a diffuser 5 times this size.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! I bought it when two of my sons came down with whooping cough. I have had it running day and night since I recieved it weeks ago, and it&#x27;s worked great. The kids think it&#x27;s the coolest thing ever. My 11 year old likes it so much he&#x27;s considering spending his money to buy one of his own. The mist looks like a blue volcano. I like how you can have the light on or off. It makes a great nightlight for the younger kid and I can have the light off if it&#x27;s in the older kid&#x27;s room. I&#x27;ve found it really depends on the oil you choose how much you should put in. Most of the oils I can do 3-4 drops but a chamomile I have is so strong that any more than 2 drops is overpowering. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and a friend turned me on to this product. I&#x27;ve been looking for a silent essential oil diffuser for several years. This one is very quiet and as an added bonus shuts itself off automatically when the water level drops too low. It does get a little splashy toward the end, but that&#x27;s just a good signal to help me remember to refill it. I love the look of it in my home and will be purchasing another for my office.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great.  I have had no problems, it covers 1-2 rooms at least, depending on size of room.  Love the automatic shut-off since I use it to go to bed and it is easy to fill and lasts a few hrs on each filling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned with the light, but it is mellow and the orange is not obnoxious at all.  Not sure why the other colors cost more??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is that I need to buy a few more so I don&#x27;t have to carry it from room to room as I move throughout the work day. :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased two.  They work very well.  Although one of them shuts off prematurely.  It only operates for twenty minutes before shutting off.  The other one lasts about three hours before shutting off due to low water content.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this thing zero stars.  I bought it and used it for one day.  The next day I turned it on and ran it for about an hour, turned it off for a while and went to turn it back on and it didn&#x27;t work.  It would come on and then automatically shut back down.  Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife is very much into essential oils and their therapeutic properties so I wanted to get this for her for a gift.  Well, apparently I didn&#x27;t read everything well because I didn&#x27;t realize this was a water/oil diffuser.  So, it&#x27;s not as useful for the essential oil properties as it is for making a room/area smell great.  So, with that in mind - if you get this for making a room smell great, this is an awesome product.  If you&#x27;re looking for getting the healing/therapeutic properties of essential oils, there are other products out there that are better suited for the task.  With that in mind, we love this little thing - a few drops of essential oils and some water and you have the recipe for a relaxing environment.</li>
            <li> My second one.  Got the first as a present for Christmas.  Use both of them every day and keep refilling every 3 hours when I&#x27;m at home.  Makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> Three reasons I like this product:  1) light can be turned off; 2) runs 2 hours; 3) emits strong mist.</li>
            <li> Really love this - works great, easy to maintain simple to operate.  Only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 is it seems a bit overpriced.  If it lasts me for years, I may feel differently!  Run it nightly with some lavender essential oil - makes for relaxing sleep.  I like how it has automatic shutoff when empty and don&#x27;t need to worry about wasting energy.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser. I use every night and it works perfectly. It does not give lots of aroma, and it is not suppose to. It&#x27;s been really useful with the proper oils, even for therapeutic uses. I definitely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great, straight forward ordering and shipping.</li>
            <li> Loving this diffuser.......easy to clean and fill</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser. I do like it. The only draw back is that it doesn&#x27;t hold much water, therefore does not last long. Maybe 3 hrs, sometimes not that long. Maybe it depends on the type of oils I put in, I&#x27;m not sure. It is quiet and I like that it shuts off when it is empty. Wish it was the same design only would hold more water.</li>
            <li> I use it every nite and love it.  Wish I had one in every room!</li>
            <li> Bought this November 5, 2014. It only worked for about 2 months and then died. Lousy materials, would not be another. Beware of purchasing this unit!!!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  The color is beautiful and my boys use it as a night light each night while I diffuse essential oils.  I have been using the two I bought for over 2 months and they work great!  I plan on purchasing another to take to my classroom.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have purchased.  Was gift to my daughter.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on Feb 5 and it has quit working.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but what would make it better is if it had a bigger container to hold water. I can leave it on for a couple of hours, but then it goes empty. I really wish it was bigger so I could have it on all night to help me sleep and to work as sort of a humidifier, too. It is SUPER easy to assemble and use and I love the light. The other thing that would make me like it better is if it came in a neutral color. I got the blue, but I really wish it came in just white so it would match my house...I&#x27;d rather it just blend in.</li>
            <li> I only lasted two weeks is damaged not light</li>
            <li> Awful! Wish I never purchased.  I bought three in Oct 2014.  I put one in each bedroom.  I did not use it every day but did use it with a very small amount of essential oils when my kids were sick.  It&#x27;s now March and only one barely works.  One stopped all together in December, the second makes a loud buzzing noise and I don&#x27;t trust it to stay in my kids room.  The other one works intermittently. Buy something else.</li>
            <li> WE love our diffuser!!</li>
            <li> works well and humidifies at the same time, it gives a nice atmosphere to the room as well...easy care and quiet</li>
            <li> Worked well for the first few days, after that the aroma of my oils would die down pretty quickly. Works well for a small room, like 200 square feet or smaller. I returned it because I wanted a diffuser that filled my living room with amazing aromas.</li>
            <li> LOVE this thing! My family is super sensitive to scents! I love air fresheners and things to make the house smell great but they all complain and sneeze. With this no complaints! So easy to use. Just fill to the line with water and add a few drops of essential oil and you have a nice fresh clean organic scent! I really love to use lavender and orange! Relaxing and reaches almost the whole house. Very cute design too. I like that you can keep the light off.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Love this crazy little thing! I have it in my school clinic (K-8 school) All the kids love it as well.</li>
            <li> Loving this diffuser so far.  Have had this same one before.  Sometimes you have to change the disk out but then when you do it works like new.  I have not had to change the disk on this one yet :)</li>
            <li> Awesome aroma therapyüëç</li>
            <li> I bought it for the bedroom to go to sleep with. I&#x27;m sensitive to noise and it gurgles, to me that&#x27;s annoying to fall asleep too! Otherwise it works well.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Purchased two and works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser but it doesn&#x27;t last four hours as mentioned in one of the descriptions. I get, maybe, three hours. I like the fine mist and the color. It would be great if it offered another setting for intermittent diffusing. Also, it is the quietest diffuser I have ever used. Great product overall.</li>
            <li> Addicted. Use it every night. Can&#x27;t live without it. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and love it! The only downside is that this is for a smaller room - a really small room. Regardless, I have never had issues with this diffuser and even bought one for a friend, who loves it!</li>
            <li> the item looks cool and sleek, i was very excited when i got it. but less than two weeks using it it stopped turning off by itself. I had to manually turn it off every time. by day 11 of owning this little device, it would not turn on. I would press the button and 5 seconds later it turned off. Had to return it. It has a nice design and I was overall happy with it. I thought for the price I was paying it would be a no brainer. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Easy use, easy clean and good steam.  It works for longer time compared to other essential  oil diffuser.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It works great EXCEPT, when the light is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s not really off &amp; the power button is still lit up. I covered the power button on mine with cardstock and ducktape, but the light still gets through the top &amp; lights up my room at night. I did keep it, but I&#x27;m not entirely pleased since I wanted one that would be completely dark if I wanted it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make some sounds, they just sound like gurgling water, but I find them soothing after I have gotten used to them after a few nights.</li>
            <li> Will never buy this product again. I had one for six months and it stopped working so I decided to buy another one and it has only lasted a month and a half now is broke. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> turns off when the water runs out - which is my favorite part, because I turn it on and walk away and don&#x27;t have to remember anything.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a little workhorse...all my other diffusers went pfft but this one keeps on keepin&#x27; on</li>
            <li> This arrived just two days after I ordered it! It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful and it&#x27;s working wonderfully so far. A great product!</li>
            <li> I love this little thing. It&#x27;s quiet, super simple to use and works like a dream. I run it every night in my sons room who has trouble sleeping.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Love it :)</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and I think it&#x27;s pretty great. I use edens garden essential oils and have been experimenting with blends. I have had it for a couple months and it&#x27;s simple and easy to use and clean up. As other reviews have said, its one touch to turn on then the second touch turns off the blue light.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased and would recommend and may buy another but would maybe buy a different shape.</li>
            <li> We have used this almost every day since we got it  It works so well and I find the blue light soothing.  I bought one for a vift and she loves it as well.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it...bought another one for my daughter!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Awesome diffuser.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Puts out a lot of mist immediately. I like that it automatically shuts off when it&#x27;s out of water.</li>
            <li> Only wish it was a tiny bit bigger! Overall, however, I&#x27;m really enjoying this product. It&#x27;s cut short on me a couple times while there is still water left over, however, I think it was the particular oil I had been using (not water-soluble). It is working fine right now.</li>
            <li> Never worked right.  I bought two Smiley Daisy diffusers with this one and they are still going strong, as stated.  This diffuser never worked more than an hour, despite my care and cleaning as well as research for problem solving why it never worked.  The return policy is terrible, so basically we are stuck with this diffuser that works well for maybe 10-12 minutes then shuts off for no reason...</li>
            <li> This thing is great for relaxing, meditation, purifying a room, aromatherapy of any kind.  Way better than paying for generic deodorizers like glade plug ins or something.  It benefits the entire surrounding including any organic life forms.  It gets 5 stars for it&#x27;s function but it is not the better model of the 2 main types of ZAQ diffusers.  The other unit offers a better array of lights and operation ‚îÄ 3 modes (i.e. rotate color, fixed color, low-light), and there is only one piece or &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; to remove when you add oil.  This unit has 2 pieces to remove so if you&#x27;re holding oil in one hand you can&#x27;t just pop off the cap and add it.  It also only has one color (as opposed to various) and the 2 led&#x27;s clearly show through the plastic.  Despite these rather trivial differences both units are &amp;#34;5-star&amp;#34; products.  Excellent value!</li>
            <li> Love this item........well worth the money and works awesome..........better than the piece of garbage I paid 49.99 for.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller and nicer...</li>
            <li> great product.  4-5 drops of essential oil scents the entire room.  clean up very easy.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd oil diffuser. It works very well. The mist stays going for many hours, and scents the room nicely. The light (even in OFF mode) is a bit too bright to sleep near, so I have to put a cloth around it. I am completely satisfied with this product and am considering buying another one so that I dont have to keep bringing it from room to room.</li>
            <li> We use this every night in our infants room. I wish the reservoir were a little bigger works great with Doterra!</li>
            <li> Only been using it for about two weeks but I&#x27;m very happy with it thus far.  Extremely easy to use.  The second light setting works well for night time use</li>
            <li> I have been using this for around 4months now. I love it! It steams for about 4-5 hrs and then turns off. Super easy to fill and clean. The light turns off for day use. Good buy.Worth it. Just check room size and see if it&#x27;s recomended to your room size.</li>
            <li> This is a great little diffuser i use in my kitchen but keeps my whole house smelling amazing!  And its so easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a defuser.  It works very well and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This is a great compact diffuser.  I already owned a ZAQ Mirage, which has a huge &amp;#34;footprint&amp;#34; and takes up a lot of space.  I was pleased to find that the ZAQ Allay occupies less space on a table or shelf, and still fills my room with a great scent.  I find that I don&#x27;t need to use as much essential oil with the Allay since it holds less water than the Mirage.  It also runs for a shorter amount of time, which is good for daytime use when i might want to use one blend of oils in the morning and another later in the day.  The Allay has more parts than the Mirage. Under the blue cone there is another clear plastic cone. Both cones need to be cleaned now and then or else the odors from the oils start to collect, which isn&#x27;t pleasant if you change your oil blends routinely.  I use this in a large, open 20x20 room and have no problem with smelling the essential oil anywhere in the room.</li>
            <li> Works Great!! Exactly what I was looking for.. and the blue light is a soothing color!!</li>
            <li> Quit working after 2.5 months. Tried to return it and returns are not available. Lame piece of junk. Was cool when it worked.</li>
            <li> This does put out alot of smell if you use alot of oil in it or use pure scented liquid instead of mixing it with water. If you only use a few drops of oil with a full tank of water it doesn&#x27;t put out much scent at all. You can turn the glowing light on or off, which is nice for a nightlight if you want it. Also, don&#x27;t fill it to the tippy-top or it will cut off in about 2 minutes. Leave about 1/2 and inch space at the top and then it will run until it is empty!</li>
            <li> Love this! Works great, easy to wipe clean and the light is a fun element fir the kids.</li>
            <li> It didnt seem to run very long before cutting off!  Not so sure about this one!  I ended up ordering someting more pricey and have been completely satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> I rally like the colour and the smell is wonderful from Neals yard essential oils I got seperately</li>
            <li> Love it. The packaging looks so pretty and professional. It works great so far (we only started using it today). It&#x27;s a darker blue then in the picture.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser and it makes my whole downstairs smell awesome. It&#x27;s definitely a nice alternative to scented candles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s a few notes on maintenance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build-up around the metallic ring will lessen the diffuser&#x27;s efficacy and shorten it&#x27;s diffusing duration, to the point where the diffuser is unusable (only turns on for a few seconds and then turns off). This is easily solved, however, by cleaning it with rubbing alcohol. Instead of filling it up with water, I filled it up with rubbing alcohol and let it sit for about an hour. Afterwards, I dumped out the alcohol and scrubbed out the inside with some q-tips and paper towels to clean the metal ring. After that, it worked like new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as of recently, instead of tap water, I&#x27;ve been using distilled water that I got from the grocery store. I&#x27;m finding that the build-up from hard water as well as the oil interacting with the hard water is pretty much no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> Turns off on its own, works great but sometimes certain EO linger.</li>
            <li> Great product!  This diffuser emits a nice stream of mist for about 4 hours before it shuts itself off. During which time, you can have the option to have the low light on or off. Very easy to fill and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  It has been reliable and consistent.  I use it at night typically with a high quality essential oil mix known as &amp;#34;Breathe.&amp;#34;  No more stuffy nose in the morning.  No more post nasal drip and having to clear my throat all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using distilled water to avoid/prevent mineral buildup in the water reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase a 2nd unit and take it to my extremely stressful workplace.  I think lavender will be a good beginning oil!</li>
            <li> I love it!  Attractive and quiet, diffuses water based great, oil based not as well, I enjoy it every night at bedtime. Set in a stable spot it is sensitive to movement because the water is very hot.I am stressed a lot so this has been a dream literally for me :-}.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Bought 2!  Use it every night for sleeping....use it for my son for asthma with eucalyptus oil....can&#x27;t live without it now!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long, not much of a water reservoir . Love the light tho</li>
            <li> Just got this and have used it 3 times. First, it&#x27;s a very attractive unit, u can really smell the essential oils put in it, &amp; very quiet. I originally got this for my massage room at work but have used it every night in my bedroom. It&#x27;s so soothing, I know my clients will love it. I think I&#x27;ll just have to buy another because my fianc√© wants to keep it in the bedroom. It also shuts off after the water is used up so it&#x27;s very easy to use. Just fill, drop a few drops, and turn it on.</li>
            <li> UPDATED from 2 stars to 4 stars!  ***Update***  I think that when I wrote the review below, I must have gotten diffusers from a production run that was sub-par, because my later ZAQ Allay diffusers have run for many months trouble-free, the disks do not need changing as often (4-6 months between disks!), and the diffuser runs for much longer (2-3 hours instead of 30-60 minutes). I&#x27;m very pleased that these have worked so well in the long run. They are definitely my preferred diffuser, especially for the price!  I have also had one repaired under warranty. Bombay Electronics was very fast and courteous in honoring the 1-year warranty that these come with. **************  V V V *Original Review Below* V V V  Short review: - This diffuser is quite nice, when it works. - Very easy to use. - These do eventually fail (1yr or less by my experience). - ZAQ has *NO* customer service at all. - Plan to pay a couple extra bucks every few months for a new disc to keep it running. - Plan to buy a new one when the discs are no longer are the problem.  Full story: I bought one of these and loved it. It does exactly what it advertised and I wanted -- quietly diffuses essential oils into the air, refreshing my house and those in it. I like the slight gurgly sound from the water when it runs (you can hear it in a quiet room, but I don&#x27;t find it to be intrusively loud). It works for one mid-sized room. Runs about 30-45 minutes for me (dry environment). Pretty, quiet, hassle-free. I used it often for three months and really liked it, so I ordered a second one for another room.   Then the first one stopped working. I had rinsed it regularly as recommended to prevent buildup. But it had the problem covered in a lot of reviews where the unit still turns on but doesn&#x27;t mist/diffuse and shuts off prematurely. Nothing could make it revive. But hey, I already had a second unit, so I just used that.  The second one worked just as well, but it had a brown grime in the bottom by about the seconduse, so it got rinsed after most uses to prevent any buildup. I contacted ZAQ through their website about both problems, but never got a response. I saw their video about replacing the ceramic disc, but since you can&#x27;t order it through the website and there was no link to purchase it elsewhere, I didn&#x27;t pursue it further at the time. Sadly, 2 months after I got the second unit, it too met its demise in the same manner as the first.  I&#x27;d read the reviews about this problem before purchasing these, so I was disappointed but not surprised. Clearly it&#x27;s a consistent problem with this product if both of mine failed in the same way at about the same usage point, and it&#x27;s happening to a lot of other users. Therefore, I went back to ZAQ&#x27;s website, which has a link to contact them, along with a video about this common problem. I contacted them again through the website, and also mailed a paper copy since there is no option for phone contact. I waited a week, then emailed them again. I have never gotten any response to any contact attempt, in spite of including my contact information on each message.  Since there is no way through their website to buy the part, no link to an external seller, and no product name to search for, I searched around and found the part here on Amazon. http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00JK0UVUU  The only good news here is that the repair part immediately got my diffuser working just like new! Bad news is that the part came with no instructions, and even though I&#x27;d watched the how-to video, it took two tries to get the disc installed correctly. I&#x27;m waiting for the second disc to arrive to see if it repairs the second diffuser that&#x27;s currently a paperweight. Update: The second replacement disc got the second diffuser working just fine right away, and it DOES have instructions on the back of the package, along with an aftermarket UPC label, so I think the first one just had the directions covered up.  I&#x27;m disappointed that there is no customer service, or better information for customers. I&#x27;m disappointed that the diffuser only works to a point. I&#x27;m disappointed that ZAQ knows this is a problem, but doesn&#x27;t include a spare disk with their products or make any effort to resolve the problem for the consumer. I&#x27;m disappointed that I have to pay for a repair part in such a short time. I&#x27;m pleased that the diffuser is working again, that it looks nice, and that it does what it says it should -- when it&#x27;s working.  In short, assuming I have to replace the disc on each unit every two months, that&#x27;s $5-6 a month to run them after the purchase price. I&#x27;m ok with that price point, and I&#x27;m ok with how the diffuser works when it&#x27;s working. If you&#x27;re not, this might not be the droi.... diffuser you&#x27;re looking for. Move along.  Update July 2015: I downrated this from 3 stars to 2 stars this time, and here&#x27;s why: 2 months after replacing the discs, one of the diffusers quit working, permanently. The motor made a dreadful sound and it never ran again. It had been cared for well, so it seems the motor goes bad. The other diffuser worked for 6 more months (and needed two replacement discs during that time) and then that motor died as well. Assuming you pay $30 for this, that&#x27;s $75 a year for new diffusers and discs. Seems you might as well buy an expensive one!  Considering that I cleaned these regularly and they did nothing more than sit on a shelf and run, I&#x27;m disappointed in the quality of this product. But I&#x27;m more disappointed in the utter failure of ZAQ to properly address these issues in this product and their failure to provide any customer service. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  Update Nov 2015: I added stars to this! It seems whatever issues they had with the diffusers have been better addressed. The dead unit in which the motor failed was repaired under warranty by Bombay Electronics. I now own three of these. They work great and I love them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but is only good for small spaces such as the bathroom :(</li>
            <li> Works great, just fill up the bottom chamber with water add a few drops of essential oil and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;Automatically shuts off once the water in the chamber is empty.&lt;br /&gt;Also functions as a night light (not overly bright either).&lt;br /&gt;Overall works exactly as I hoped it would, I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> My mother took it from me!</li>
            <li> Love it. It works perfectly so far!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome little machine  that does its job very well love it</li>
            <li> I have used three different types of essential oils diffusers, and this is my favorite by far. I have since purchased another one. It runs for a long time. It is very soothing and distributes the aroma well throughput the room.</li>
            <li> My sister had this and I thought it was not only mesmerizing to look at but I loved the fragrance. Ive always been a candle person but this has replaced my candles. I use it every night with the lavender oil and it helps to relax me to sleep. I would have given it 5 stars if it was bigger so it could hold more water.</li>
            <li> Very efficient, easy to operate!  Love it!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Very easy to operate, my kids even help to set this up! We use this every day and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it (purchased in March), works well with all oils we&#x27;ve used so far (Young Living, Doterra, Veriditas Botanicals). Will probably buy another for our downstairs. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about it is the top comes off rather easily and my 3 year old has knocked it off a couple times. But other than that I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great product, wonderful service too!</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser.  I love it.  I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but I&#x27;ve been using it almost daily for several weeks and it&#x27;s working great.  It&#x27;s easy to fill, easy to clean, and really quiet.  As long as it holds up, I&#x27;ll be recommending these to friends.</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with the defuser.  No problems ordering or receiving the product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I had my diffuser for 5 months and it, suddenly, quit working. I&#x27;ve contacted the company and asked them what to do. Their advice was to clean it and let it dry before using again. I did that twice and, now, it won&#x27;t even stay on! Loved it while it worked, but not so much any more!</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve only had this item one day and I&#x27;ve been meaning to go through the q&amp;a above because I&#x27;ve heard rumored that citrus essential oils can ruin these things. For my experiment I used peppermint essential oil and let it run. First, it&#x27;s probably a touch smaller than you are expecting, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has more throw (the carry of scent) than a single wick candle, easily delivering smell to most my downstairs. And it looks cool. Can&#x27;t wait to try more scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just hoping it lasts, since this is day one after all.</li>
            <li> I love this product for a few reasons. Its good quality and feels like quality. It is super innovative and intuitive in design. Very simple and very effective. Plus it looks awesome.</li>
            <li> This was the second diffuser I ordered since the first one didn&#x27;t work( different brand). I ordered this one because of the great reviews. When I received item I loved the look of it, I filled it with water and added essential oil but it only ran for 20 minutes? Checked water was still full, turned it on and it shut off after 10 minutes. I contacted amazon and was told I could return. I was really disappointed since this was my second diffuser and both didn&#x27;t work. I returned and ordered a different brand and was very happy with that one</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser to disperse essential oil.  I use it in our bedroom.  I love the steady stream of mist infused with the essential oil that adds a wonderful healing aroma with just the right amount of humidity to our room.  Plus, there is an automatic shut off so you can fall asleep while it&#x27;s misting.  There is also an internal light that can turned on or off.  I&#x27;ve used my diffuser every night since I received it about 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> When thing works, it works great, however it&#x27;s a hit and miss.  Some days it&#x27;s good and other days no mist comes out of it.  I am going to take the advice from some of the q&amp;a&#x27;s here and clean it out and start over again.  Maybe I am putting to much oil in it.</li>
            <li> Humidifies and makes the room smell wonderful. We use it all over the house.&lt;br /&gt;Lavender is nice in bedroom, pine and/or lemongrass I like in kitchen area.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be probably be buying another soon, although it&#x27;s easy to move around.&lt;br /&gt;Essential oils are believed to effect certain glands, and are beneficial heathwise.</li>
            <li> I love my essential oil diffuser. It works great &amp; it is easy to use. I definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> vERY GOOD . hAPPY WITH WHT i GOT AND WORKS WELL.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 and love it! Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  Doesn&#x27;t over power with too much moisture, the light is beautiful (blue).  2 drops of your favorite essential oil is all it takes to have a light mist to freshen the air.  I use on my bedside table every night.  I bought 2 of these, one for myself and one for my DIL.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just ordered a second one. Love this diffuser!</li>
            <li> A great little diffuser that really puts out a strong steady mist!  This is a small sized diffuser that would be perfect for a small/medium sized room.  The water will last several hours and it turns itself off once the water runs dry. I find that I don&#x27;t want to put too much oil in at once or it will be way too strong. Just a drop or two is all it takes.  Easy to assemble and add water to. I would recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. I use it in my office.</li>
            <li> I LOVE-LOVE this difuser!!! I is not too small or to large, it is wonderful in my kitchen!!!  (or any room)</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser and use it just about everyday while I sleep.  It fills the room with a lovely lavender scent and it is so relaxing.  If you like essential oils, you will love the way this diffuser makes your house smell.  It&#x27;s easy to use and also beautiful when it is lit up.</li>
            <li> This diffuser has worked perfectly and it seems to put enough steam/oils into the air.  We have used it every night and some days since receiving and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am new to using essential oils and found that warmers just seem to make the oils too hot and the oils smell burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser is good at being gentle with the oils. The product insert covers the function, specifications, operation procedure, maintenance and troubleshooting. I like that the power cord unplugs from the unit itself, so that i don&#x27;t have a cord dragging along with the unit. When I wish to move the unit, I unplug it from the unit, move the unit, come back for the cord and plug it back in.Although if one wanted to carry the unit and plug together, you could just keep the cord attached the whole time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like the mood the diffuser creates: it has a (low) &#x27;hum&#x27; when running, the flow of the &#x27;steam&#x27; is relaxing, the blue light is not obnoxious- it&#x27;s calming. I like that the light can be turned on or off. It is awesome that the diffuser will turn off on it&#x27;s own when *empty* (about a couple of hours). When it first arrived, I was a little disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t a little bigger. Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks, I&#x27;m finding it&#x27;s size to be very convenient- and I really wouldn&#x27;t want a bigger one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied is that there is still a small puddle at the bottom of the bowl when it&#x27;s *empty*, even when the unit is absolutely level. I&#x27;ll have to see if I can save that little bit of water and oil in a small bottle because I don&#x27;t want a scent or blended scent to mix in with a totally different scent and I don&#x27;t want to waste it. There are instructions on how to properly (and improperly) remove any water from the bowl. I am using distilled water, because I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a possibility that anything in tap water will mess with the diffuser&#x27;s mechanisms... the product guide does not specify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like it a lot, though! I wish I had a couple more just like it!</li>
            <li> Im using it for a week till now. It is flawless. built quality is very good. I recommend it for every one</li>
            <li> I loved this item but after a week it just stopped working</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good, less expensive diffuser that would work well enough to fill a room with the wonderful aroma of essential oil. This diffuser fits the bill. It is simple to operate, quiet, and turns itself off when out of water. There are 2 settings, one with the light on and one without if you prefer not to have the light on. I have an aroma ace diffuser and it is very loud, so I really appreciate how quiet this one is. Very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Works really well! I love it!</li>
            <li> Studied for days. Have owned for months.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect. No flaws. Fits needs. Save yourself looking at others, I&#x27;ve bought these before. This is the one I will buy for friends.</li>
            <li> Works great in my small apartment. I love the auto off feature and my son loves the colored light.</li>
            <li> I now have 2 of these and have been very pleased with them. They don&#x27;t take up a lot of space and are very easy to use. I like how you can use it with or without the night light. My kids love using it in their rooms for the essential oils benefit and the blue glow it gives off. I can set it up in their rooms and not worry about it. They shut off on their own.</li>
            <li> Love these diffusers. I now own 3. They work great with Young Living Essential Oils. I recommend these to all my friends.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is easy to use. It even turns off when the water is used up. Slick. The power button cycles through &amp;#34;on, light off, off&amp;#34;.  Simple, but works as expected. I&#x27;m very happy with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every night!  I even change the oils (But I clean it first)and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  I enjoy it a lot!</li>
            <li> I just got this today so this review might be irrelevant but I was so excited I just had to say something. This is my first diffuser and I love it. The directions were ridiculously easy to follow, just a few steps. Then you turn it on, it lights up, and immediately starts working (I mean that seconds you see mist) and the flavor filled my moderately sized room in 15 min!!!! If it stays this good for more than a year (which is what the warranty covers) I&#x27;ll be more than happy!! I got the orange, is so cute. There light bubbling but it&#x27;s soothing more than annoying.  I&#x27;m editing now, it&#x27;s been a couple days. I just want to say after a couple hours you will need to put another 5 drops in for essential oils, even though it&#x27;s still half full.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I love that it takes a little water, a drop or two of your favorite essential oil. Turn it on and automatic shut off in three hours. I run it 2-3 times a day. I have bought my grandkids and they love the night lights at night. I have recommended to friends too. Easier to clean. A cap full of vinegar and water and run it. Ready to use again.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised though the blue light doesn&#x27;t turn off my more. After two weeks of use, blue light just stays on even when the machine is off. Otherwise works as expected.</li>
            <li> Good product very quiet, but not reliable every use. Sometimes the auto off does no work and if you slightly over fill it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> love this. use it in my bedroom</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser 2 and a half months ago.  Used it approximately once a day.  Overall the diffuser was great, has a nice light to it with the option to not omit light and diffuses nicely.  I give it one star because after this short of time it stopped working!  There wasn&#x27;t any damage to the diffuser.  At this point I can&#x27;t return or exchange it.  Very Lame!</li>
            <li> This is the second diffuser of this style I have. Works very well in my office.</li>
            <li> Works great but wish it was bigger and lasted longer</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and it is excellent! I use Eternal Essence oils in it and it works amazingly well. One chamberful of water and a few drops of oil lasts about 2-3 hours. Plus the blue looks very cool in a dimly lit room!</li>
            <li> LOVED it until it quit working after a month!</li>
            <li> I have several defussers this one is a gem.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the diffuser so far.  I like the auto shut off feature, and the fact that you can turn the top blue light off by clicking the power button again.  It&#x27;s really bright in a dark room!  Shipping was fast too.  This is my first diffuser, and if it continues to work this good, I&#x27;ll probably buy another one from this company.</li>
            <li> works great and lasts a good time period before being empty and shutting off</li>
            <li> Works great... I still buy these for my spa - but check out ...  MIU COLOR¬Æ 500ml Aroma Diffuser Ultrasonic Humidifier LED Color Changing... if you are looking for a more mood enhancing one - this is a great option. They both last and are quality products - very simple to use. Purchase essential oils separately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with my diffuser so far.  I use it every night. I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife, and when she went to use it was broken. So it was not a very good product at all.</li>
            <li> I give these as gifts now....works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never posted a review before but I love this so much that I just had to break down and do it. I&#x27;ve tried other aromatherapy diffusers, but they were all difficult to clean or didn&#x27;t run well. This diffuser has a ceramic disc which is very easy to clean with just a Q-tip and water. No running through a cleaning cycle every 2 or 3 times you use the thing, and no citric acid needed either. Where do you find that anyway? You just fill it to the line with tap water, add a few drops of essential oil, and it starts right up every time. My husband can&#x27;t figure out how the mist starts immediately with no warming up time. There&#x27;s a nice light that&#x27;s not too bright to sleep with or you can turn the light off if you want to. I love using about 3 drops of lavender to help me sleep, or 3-5 drops of peppermint, lemon, or orange to freshen a room if the dogs come in wet. I&#x27;ve bought several of these for gifts and they&#x27;re always a big hit. Everybody loves them! Get one!</li>
            <li> It works great. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold much water. It runs out in a couple hours. I love the automatic shut off feature.</li>
            <li> I move this from room to room.  Great at night and during the day at my desk.  Easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> I have this in my classroom.  I appreciate that it is a cool mist. It freshens the air and seems to help with asthma.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. It looks super cool and starts diffusing the water/essential oils the moment it is turned on. We LOVE it. My wife and I actually brought it with us to the hospital when we had our baby and it filled the room with the relaxing scent of lavender and everyone that came in commented on how cool it looked. Tremendous product, we&#x27;ll probably end up purchasing a few more as well! Remember, essential oils sold separately.</li>
            <li> I love it! I had a more expensive one but this one is great and has an auto shut off when the water turns off, I love that part this way you dont ever have to worry about burning  motor out.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Adds a nice smelling moisture to the air at night.  It seems to have rid my husband&#x27;s snoring - bonus!</li>
            <li> Love this machine! I run this three to four times a day with my essential oils. I used to go through tea light candles like water. I figure this will pay for itself in a couple months time. It fills the room immediately with aroma. Much easier to use than candle oil warmers.</li>
            <li> My 14 yr old recently began having insomnia. After several trips to the Dr. and allergy specialist for other bizarre and unexplainable symptoms we have found she suffers from many types of allergies and that insomnia is one of the effects on her body. I use diffusers routinely in my bathrooms, etc but had never purchased anything that plugged in. This diffuser is great. I bought a blend of sleep essential oils. I add to the diffuser at bedtime and it will run for about 4 hours and then shuts itself off. My daughter noticed a considerable change after the first night of usage. It also serves as a night light which is pretty cool. We have used it for about 3 full weeks now and she has consistently reported better sleep since we implemented this. Along with this we have dust proofed our home and changed her diet and have had great success without the use of medication. I am a very pleased mama.</li>
            <li> A little on the small side.</li>
            <li> Bought 3. one for me and 2 for gifts! We all love it. Wish they made one that lasted longer than 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get so many complements on this in my business waiting room.</li>
            <li> There are so many great points to this diffuser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Unplugs from the unit so it can be transported easily to refill.&lt;br /&gt;2) Has a light that makes it very attractive and relaxing, especially if the lights are low.&lt;br /&gt;3) The light can be turned off if you don&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;4) The light shuts off automatically when the unit is empty&lt;br /&gt;5) Top comes off in two pieces and can easily be wiped down as can the main reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;6) Good price when on sale.&lt;br /&gt;7) Most importantly, it diffuses very well!&lt;br /&gt;8) Comes in several colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is small and only runs 3-4 hours, but this is not a gripe. I think this is standard for most diffusers and keeps the product compact.</li>
            <li> Worked well when I first got it but only had it less than a month before it stopped misting. Would come on then shut itself off. I cleaned it, did everything the trouble shooting page said but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> These in blue keep turning off. The blue ones don&#x27;t seem to work. however, I&#x27;d give 5 stars to my orange one. It works perfectly...which is why I bought 2 more. Sadly, I&#x27;ll probably have to return the blue ones.</li>
            <li> Worked for almost a year and now it won&#x27;t diffuse at all. Great job ZAQ. It worked well while it...worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried cleaning it, now I&#x27;m going to take it apart and see whats up.</li>
            <li> I feel like my oils are wasting in this. You can smell them the first few min but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this diffuser.  The mist released is just as the pictures show.  It is easy to use and pretty to look at</li>
            <li> I have multiple diffusers and by far this is still my favorite.  For the past two years I have used this almost daily.  I purchased this in orange.  When lit up the color is more red.  It is very pretty and have even used it in my daughter&#x27;s room as a night light when she was sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just a few drops of oil, this thing can really make the area smell good!  It is small so you do have to move it from room to room for maximum effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came down with a little virus and ran it every night by my bed with orange and peppermint oil.  I avoided getting full on sick and I believe in part it was from this little thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The auto turn off feature is great.  Do not overfill!  It will not work.  One night it ran all night with water still left in the morning.  I realized I had overfilled it and the diffuser did not work properly.  Now I am very careful to stay under the line.  Still runs for hours at a time.</li>
            <li> This is the fourth ZAQ Allay diffuser I have purchased. I originally purchased one for a Christmas gift, then one for myself, one for a birthday gift and now this fourth one for me again. My daughter also purchased one after seeing mine. I use mine every night in my bedroom with some drops of lavender essential oils in it with the water. I&#x27;ve used it to diffuse other essential oils in it to ward off sickness. It works great, looks so pretty with the blue light and the mist flowing out softly, quietly. Very soothing. You can either have the light on as shown in the picture or off during the operation. One great feature is that it shuts off automatically when the water runs out. I love this diffuser!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Cute design, good price. This one is in my son&#x27;s room and he uses it for naps and sleep.</li>
            <li> I initially liked this diffuser because it didn&#x27;t light up the bedroom while I was using oils for sleep and relaxation, and because it would turn off automatically after about 3 hours of use. That was short lived. After about a month of use, the diffuser now stops when the reservoir is over half full. It also seems like the vapor output is reduced. I use distilled water and quality YL essential oils, usually 3 drops in a full reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this item only has a 30 day warrantee. I never really paid attention to that, since I assumed I would not have a problem. Now that I have a non functional item, I wish it had broken a few weeks sooner, or held up to justify the price I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed that I wasted my hard earned money on this poor quality diffuser that no longer works. I hope you don&#x27;t make the same mistake! My advice, don&#x27;t even consider it!!</li>
            <li> When I first started using the diffuser it had a high pitched hum which was very annoying; however, after running it for a while it stopped and is now working like a charm.  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s attractive, it&#x27;s calming, it lights up, and it makes the most of your oils.  It shuts itself off, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting about it. I Love the way it diffuses the oils in the air and uses the water to do so. I wish I could have 10 of these all over my house!  My sister-in-law ordered one, and when I saw hers in action I just had to have one. And then when I got mine, I had to get another friend one. I have seen all three colors and they&#x27;re all very nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally leave reviews. But, we ordered another diffuser that broke in 2 weeks and it cost more than this one. My wife loves this one. Super easy and works great.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great!  Quiet and with a calming blue color, this diffuser is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had.  Without the blue light, I&#x27;d have been slightly less impressed since it really sets a relaxing mood at night.  Used it with peppermint, lavender, orange and grapefruit essential oils the first time and it did a great job of filling our quite large kitchen with fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At bedtime I moved it next to my bed and the soft blue glow of light really gave it a relaxing ambiance.  Frankincense, myrrh and lavender at bedtime was amazing.  Took it to work with me today and did lavender, peppermint, and orange while seeing patients and it was invigorating.  Everyone was in a good mood, and my mind felt clear all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to fill and refill, and clean - doesn&#x27;t get hot, and I just love it.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is so cool, it lights up when you turn it on. I always wanted one because you can put it in your room and it can help you relax depending on oil you use. Some oils are for relaxing like jasmine, musk is to mask odors and mint is to help you if you have a cold. This is cool because you can help your body in a better way without taking medicine. It works really well and it makes your whole room smell really good. I like to turn it on before I go to sleep so I can fall sleep faster and be at ease.&lt;br /&gt; I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t  be more pleased with this purchase.  The diffuser works much better than I thought it would.  It fills the air with fragance unlike my soapstone and tealight diffuser.</li>
            <li> cool looking and like the ability to turn off light and still diffuse</li>
            <li> This is our first difuser, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it seems to work great. I didn&#x27;t see anything on the packaging about automatic shut-off, but it does shut off when all the water is used up, which is perfect.</li>
            <li> The Best BUY For Health/Wellness EVER !!!  I Am Using The doTERRA Essential Oils, And Am Loving The Benefits ... Thank You &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 MUAH</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!  Steam shoots up a bit higher so scent spreads throughout the house.  I do use distiller water in mine and 3-4 drops of essential oil.  The blue light is soft and soothing.  Can also choose the option of steam with no light glowing.  Last about 5 hours steadily.  I have used other diffusers in the past but this surpasses them in quality.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. My daughter-in-law loves it! She has had different essential oils for different purposes flowing in all the rooms of her house. It works very well, and is pretty as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, soothing and quiet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thru ebay, &amp; i like it!, add fragrance or essential oil 3-4 drops, &amp; water, &amp; it vapors,filling the room with scent &amp; humidity...its pretty cool, has a blue light in it too!  i recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great with my Doterra oils.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to operate and works great.</li>
            <li> Worked great until the on/off button fell inside the unit.  Could be fixed(not that you should have to) but it&#x27;s molded plastic so no way to access control panel without cutting the thing open. Chinese crap.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these as gifts as I have a larger model that I have been very pleased with. These smaller versions are excellent as well. They produce a heavy stream of cool mist. In my opinion they are perfect for small rooms (home office, nursery, etc). No problems operating any of the 3 I gave as gifts.</li>
            <li> love my diffuser, would purchase another one if I could. Easy to use and works immediately.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser...it&#x27;s small and quiet, super easy to refill and clean.  Delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> I use it in my holistic health spa and it is absolutely fabulous! When the lights are low for facials it looks really soothing as well.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I initially purchased the ZAQ Dew diffuser, and then right after I purchased mine, it was no longer available. I wanted to buy two more for gifts and my daughter saw the blue one and said she really wanted that one, so I bought her one, and the same one for my daughter in law, then I bought a second one for myself, and it worked ok for awhile, but then it would automatically shut itself off after about 10 minutes, so I thought maybe I needed to clean it out so I wiped it out and tried it again and it worked a little better but would still shut off before it ran out of water, so today I got tired of dealing with it and am sending it back while I still can. I bought all 3 in blue and they ended up being from 3 different companies selling through Amazon. My defective one came from Bombay Electronics I&#x27;ve checked with my daughter and daughter in law as to how their diffusers are working and they seem to be fine so far, so perhaps mine must be defective, although it seems several others are having the same problem, so maybe it was a bad batch?  I&#x27;m unsure if I want to buy another one of these or not. I was frustrated that more expensive diffusers seem to quit working after about 6 months, but this one didn&#x27;t even last 1 month. I really hope that the other 2 that I bought as gifts continue to work. I liked this while it worked, but can&#x27;t rate it as high as I&#x27;d hoped to since it didn&#x27;t last. I paid $52.00 each for the ones I bought. I likely will wait to see if the others I bought end up lasting before I try purchasing another one to replace mine...</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this diffuser</li>
            <li> Great article. Come as expected.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the comforting aromas while resting for the evening.  Seems like relaxing and soothing therapy. With bad sinus problems this diffuser allows easier breathing, opening up the sinus passages with a slight aroma.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like it distributes throughout the room at all. It is fine, but I wish I would have paid a little bit more for a better diffuser. I have had this for 8 months.</li>
            <li> Puts out a lot of mist, immediately.  Uses all the water before it shuts off (unlike another brand I tried), and has a light on/off option.  I like the fact that even with the light off (which is how I prefer it), there is still a tiny light that remains, because that lets me know it&#x27;s on...and when I wake up in the night to go to the bathroom, I can tell by a glance whether it&#x27;s still on or has gone to auto shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying this one, I tried another brand (wanted a second diffuser for my son&#x27;s room), and it didn&#x27;t work as well.  I returned it and ordered another of these.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the recommendation of a friend. It is easy to use &amp; the price was fantastic ($35.00 at the time I purchased it). My main reason for purchasing was to add essential oils to help with congestion while I slept.  It works so well I ordered 2 more as gifts.  I would say the only drawback is that it only last for 4 hours then automatically shuts off - but I only seem to need the 4 hours, so is it really a drawback? I had a different &amp;#34;infuser&amp;#34; that after a year of use was so loud I could not sleep due to the noise - it was much larger than this, so I will take the small size over noise any day. Even when I do not have congestion - I enjoy the soothing smells to help lull me to sleep. It is quiet &amp; you can either use it with the light or without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this if this ends up being noisy after repeated uses &amp; I use it every night!</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day for the past three weeks and I love it. It is practical and functional. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this diffuser only lasted a couple of months. First, the light went out, and then the automatic shut off feature stopped working, which could be dangerous if left on unattended.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed the lamp while it lasted although it would only hold a very small amount of water.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great. Automatic shut off too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mom because she&#x27;s not allowed to have lit candles where&#x27;s she living.... purchased the aromatherapy scents and she loves it.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> Great Product... Fast Shipping...</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. We have been using in for a few months and haven&#x27;t had any issues. I&#x27;ve learned I do prefer  a difissuer that propels the droplets out into the room rather than straight up like this one. But overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> OMG I love this thing. I got this about a couple of months ago and I use it every day. After doing much research, I found this to be one of the most reliable brands...and one of the few that is backed by a one year warranty. I also like that it does not burn/heat the oils, so the oils keep their natural aromatherapy benefits when diffusing. I know this sounds crazy, but my living room is about 900 square feet with 20 foot ceilings, and this diffuser fills up the entire room with a the diffused scent....especially if it is a strong blend like Juniper Berry or Cedarwood. For scents that are more delicate, like lavender, it will smell the entire room but the scent goes away as soon as it is no longer diffusing. This is one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made for my home. I love that it has aromatherapy benefits to diffuse certain oils, plus it makes everything smell great! It also proves to be a cheaper alternative to burning candles (especially if you care about buying soy, cotton wick candles that burn clean). I use this thing every day, sometimes twice or three times and it works great. I also love that it has a night light that you can turn off if you want to.</li>
            <li> Love it.  This is the 3rd one i have purchased.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great. It&#x27;s my first time buying and using a diffuser. I&#x27;ve seen many and this one is my best fit. It&#x27;s easy to operate and clean. The shape is beautiful and I think the price you pay for it, is fair. It is dual voltage so I can bring it with me when I travel, I love this option. Many diffusers don&#x27;t have that. Update review: Unfortunately I have to add that it stopped working after not even 6 months. I did not even use it on a daily basis. Luckily, Amazon Prime&#x27;s excellent customer service let me return it.</li>
            <li> This diffuser didn&#x27;t last longer than 3 months before it stopped working. It was gently used. After contacting the seller they sent me a replacement kit to replace the ceramic disc inside the diffuser. The diffuser still doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve purchased better diffusers for less money and WOULD NEVER buy this product again. Do NOT waste your money. It is worth it to buy a quality diffuser.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Works well in my room!</li>
            <li> Loved it till it stopped working.  So officially had it for 3 months before it quit.  Used it everyday in the morning to diffuse.  Go buy another product this is definitely not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser! It looked cool and smelled nice. Very relaxing and nice to watch.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would run 3-4 hours straight but it has maybe once in 12 runs. I check the tank but there is still plenty of water so I have to press the on button again, it is kind of annoying. Otherwise it look great, quiet, aroma from oils is nice, 2-3 drops are enough.</li>
            <li> I absolutely looooooove this little thing!!! And so does my son! I purchased as an aroma therapy diffuser, and it does exactly what is supposed to to.  On top of that I call it a little humidifier cause it make that cool mist and it looks so original and it&#x27;s so tranquil having it run at night with the soft light ambiance it offers! I like the fact it has the feature to shut the light off in case you run it during the day and you don&#x27;t the light, and it also shuts off on its own when the reservoir is empty! It&#x27;s pretty small but delivers the scents for quite a while, and it&#x27;s super easy to use and refill! Thank you, you&#x27;ve invented a great little machine! :)</li>
            <li> Inasmuch as I really liked this diffuser, it had a wonderful stream, and was nice looking, and even the company was willing to help when the diffuser kept shutting off from day one.  However, I&#x27;m not very mechanically inclined to replace parts even if they are simple in nature.  If they fixed this defect from the factory, I would consider buying another one.</li>
            <li> Great value for a great little diffuser. It does exactly as we want and lasts a sufficient amount of time.</li>
            <li> LOVE this diffuser. My 3 year old can mess with it all day and not get hurt or break it.</li>
            <li> This was my first diffuser purchase.  After borrowing a friend&#x27;s Y.L. diffuser and oils I decided not to join the MLM but started researching essential oils and I found great oil and diffuser prices here on Amazon!  This diffuser is the perfect size for a bathroom or child&#x27;s room.  I have been using it nightly in my five year old daughter&#x27;s room with Plant Therapy oils and she is falling asleep much more quickly.  I am back to buy two more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using essential oils so I didn&#x27;t know anything about diffusers. I still don&#x27;t. With this one I don&#x27;t need to know much about them since this one works right out of the box since it&#x27;s so simple to use.</li>
            <li> I regret purchasing this product.  It works for 2 minutes/ then shuts off.  I have tried to get a refund from the company with no luck!  I paid a lot for this and it doesn&#x27;t work for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> The only thing I love more than the soft blue glow and puffy clouds of steam is knowing my family is being treated with therapeutic grade essential oils.  Thank you - this is a lovely and very functional product!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned this diffuser for about 3 months now and we absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve purchased various different brands of diffusers but this one was the only one I really liked because of the consistency in the mist and easy clean-up. We ended up buying several of these for family members (birthdays, anniversary presents, etc.).</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:ec6f743e38decdf2f32e2b5cbedeb4d]] I absolutely love my ZAQ Allay Diffuser. It is exactly what I needed for my home. I was using an oil warmer and a tealight candle but I had to constantly add water so that the tempreture wouldn&#x27;t get too hot and boil the oils causing a huge mess on my walls and table. This unit is easy to use and lasts me about 4-5 hours before needing to be refilled. The auto shutoff feature is great for diffusing overnight.It has a compact design that looks very nice for home or office use and would be a great gift if you know someone that uses essential oils or is looking to dabble in them some. There is a nightlight that shines a pretty blue )I ordered the blue model though there are other colors available) and I find the light adds to the calming effect of the oils. You can also use the diffuser without the light if you prefer. I did receive my unit at promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mom as a birthday present and it only worked for her for FOUR months. One day she went to use it and it would not turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my diffuser. Such a wonderful item, makes my room smell absolutely heavenly! I would highly recommend getting one</li>
            <li> I love the look of this when the light is on and the &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; is coming out the top. There are 2 different settings on this -- one is the top is lit up and gives a soft, glowing look as the mist pours out the top. The second setting is just the mist, and the top portion is not lit. (Then there is the obvious on/off setting) -- I use this with water and essential oils -- it works great, smells great -- I only wish it lasted more than 4 hours at a time.</li>
            <li> stopped working after a couple minutes.  Really looks cool when it does work.  My doctor&#x27;s office has one, and I was impressed with theirs.  I just got a bum one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser despite the problems that others had with it randomly shutting off.  Sadly enough the same thing happened to me.  Rather than send it back, I contacted Bombay Electronics site directly.  They sent me a ceramic disc replacement kit with the You Tube video link on how to repair it.  Replacement of the disc took about 2 minutes and now it works like it should.&lt;br /&gt;Bombay Electronics &amp;#60;info@bombayelectronics.com&amp;#62;.  I like the way it looks compared to others that I have seen that are more expensive and in many cases not as pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li> This is a great little device. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Quiet operation. Add some water and a few drops of essential oil and the scent quickly fills the room. I also use it in our bedrooms at night if someone is ill, great was to help deliver therapeutic scents like eucalyptus to the sinuses.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love it!!! I&#x27;m getting 3 more next pay day!</li>
            <li> Have been using this since it came in the door and absolutely love it. Works like a charm and no nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser, but it makes a little more noise than I care for and it seems to run out of water fairly quickly.  Good for small room.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these diffusers for myself and a friend and found the diffusers work well and of good quality, although I did have a defective ceramic disc in one. I contacted the seller and it was taken care of right away without a problem. I also had my dog chew the top cone part and it was replaced without charge. I am happy with the product and service.</li>
            <li> When it came, it literally weighed ounces with the whole package and I thought it was going to be some cheap crap. Not the case, it works great and continues to keep me happy and zen-ful.. I highly recommend getting good pure essential oils. Great on a desk.</li>
            <li> The color, the way it works, the light. Diffuses a really nice amount of essential oil aroma into your space. I just bought a second one to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> When this arrived I was a little surprised at the size, it was a little smaller than I thought it would be. But it&#x27;s still a decent size and works great for a bedroom, not in a large living room, etc. It doesn&#x27;t take much water, maybe a half a cup and just a few drops of EO. I LOVE it! It diffuses terrifically, and it&#x27;s easy to disconnect quickly to refill. If anyone in the house is sick, I diffuse lavender and tea tree EO and helps clear us up quickly! This would be a Perfect gift for teacher or daycare provider to help kill germs &amp; keep the scent nice. The only down side is the price is a little high for what it is. But I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year and it&#x27;s has held up great! I love it! If it were a little less expensive I would buy one for every room. :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure which diffuser to get. They vary in price and I wasn&#x27;t ready to commmit to spening a small fortune on one. THis was a perfect fit for me. We have been using it every single night without any problems !</li>
            <li> Bought this diffuser for my sons bedroom to diffuse oils at bedtime.  LOVE how it is perfect for a smaller room and also lights up.  My son is scared of the dark so it doubles as a night light.  Very pleased with this diffuser!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I purchased.  After reviewing all of the options, I chose this one based on the reviews.  It died after 3 months.  I performed all of the suggestions to revive the diffuser but to no avail.  It is dead.</li>
            <li> Affordable!! Some of these diffusers get really expensive and this is a great value. You can smell the oils as soon as you turn it on. Runs for several hours before it shuts off. Love to use it when my kiddos are sick and can&#x27;t sleep!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. Very easy and quiet. Doubles as a night light in my sons room too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it&#x27;s still working well.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love it so far! I will order a second one</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great. I use it each night as I go to bed. It runs for 3-4 hours. It was affordable, looks great. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Liked the way it worked, but only worked for less than four months.  Beware don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This arrived dead out of the box. It had a very strong smell of orange essential oil. The &amp;#34;qc passed&amp;#34; sticker had been removed from somewhere else on the box and placed over a slot that prevented a tab on the packaging from being inserted into it. This was obviously a defective return. Will be returned again.</li>
            <li> Works well, my family loves using it for eucalyptus when we have colds in the winter. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great, looks beautiful at night with the steam and blue light.  I use it with a calming essential oil and you can smell the aroma throughout most of the first floor of our house.  Definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> This should be described as it is a heat diffuser.  It did not say that in the description. Heat destroys essential oils. It may be fine for someone who just wants to scent their air, but not for the benefits I thought it wiuld give me. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have three of these diffusers, love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  It works perfect, and the blue light is nice and relaxing :)  Works just as well as the more expensive (over priced) diffusers</li>
            <li> Excellent diffuser.  I&#x27;ve purchased a couple of the Allay and I love them.  I also had purchased other brands of diffusers and they often stop working fairly soon after getting them.  This brand has not disappointed.  Sometimes too much oil builds up on the bottom, and I must clean it out with paper towels.  Once I&#x27;ve done that, it is back to business as usual.  Good purchase!</li>
            <li> I have have three of these diffusers. Very reliable, low maintenance and easy to use. Have had these for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! We have used many different oils and they have helped us both!</li>
            <li> Seller please contact me if you can help!  I bought this just barely over 30 days ago and loved it!!!  But suddenly stopped working 3 days after return window expired ;(  I made sure no water got in the vent, turned upside down and left 2 days in warm dry weather (I live in Southern California and it has been much warmer than normal).  The light won&#x27;t even turn on when I push the button.  I am so disappointed.  I would be happy to send back for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Wished it would last a little longer</li>
            <li> Item did not even work properly right out of the box.  When it did work it was ok, it did not seem to put out alot of aroma from the oils (DoTERRA brand)  The unit kept shutting off every couple of minutes.  Will not buy again</li>
            <li> I have a few others but I love this one!  The only issue I have with it is that I need to refill it about every 5 hours.</li>
            <li> Even with cold water, I find that this starts diffusing immediately and does so for hours.  Nice that you have the option to keep it lit up or not.</li>
            <li> We use these at the spa and they are a very nice touch of aromatherapy</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE LARGER</li>
            <li> It worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> works perfect....this is awesome.  house smells beautiful!!  the only con is that it only lasts about 3 hours.  i have since found some that last at least 10 hours.  but i do still love this one!</li>
            <li> I had to return my ZAQ Allay Diffuser only after having it for 3 days.  The issue I had was that it would only run 30 min to an hour before cutting off, leaving almost a full tank of water in it.  The specifications say this would run 3 - 4 hours before cutting off &amp; by that time all the water/essential oil would be used up.  I gave it a try for 3 days getting the same results, before returning it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very attractive diffuser, the lights are nice, but it just wouldn&#x27;t work the way it was supposed to.  I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering another one like it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this. I love it. You can use tap water.  The first diffuser I bought wanted De-mineralized water. The only thing I miss is that my first diffuser would alternate with 4-5 different colors and this one only glows with one color.  But overall, I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have 2 diffusers for different rooms and am recommending them to people.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to purchase this based on some negative reviews, but I am happy to report that I love my diffuser! I set it on a low table in my room next to my bed and the blue light doesn&#x27;t bother me. Mine has the option to turn the light off as well. This diffuser is very easy to use. I can very easily unplug the cord from the unit to take to the bathroom to refill. I love to use it with vanilla and lavender at night! I plan to purchase several more at Christmastime.</li>
            <li> This diffuser does not hold much water so it doesn&#x27;t last a long time between refills, but other than that I have no complaints. It is easy to refill and the blue light sends a peaceful vibe into the room.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  I&#x27;ve had I&#x27;ve for a few years and decided I needed another couple for my office and living room.  I went with another brand of oil diffuser and it broke within a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another ZAQ and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Streamline and elegant.  Read many negative reviews but the overwhelming positive response was what sold it for me.  The most common complaint was it shut off or stopped working.  I believe using distilled water is very important.  Spring water and tap water have minerals that may corrode the elements in the diffuser.  100% essential oils should be used, not fragrance but oils that disperse well mixed in water.  I bought two and so far they work fine.  I use them every day and refill them a couple of times during the day.</li>
            <li> I am an aromatherapist and offer this product to my clients to use with essential oil blends. My clients love the simplicity of this diffuser and the surprisingly large quantity of diffused air it omits.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, just as described....adds so much to my massage sessions or just to refresh my home!</li>
            <li> Using it in a bedroom right now. It is quiet and diffuses throughout the room. Easy to use and clean. I like that I have the option for light on or off. I&#x27;m  very impressed for the price. Just wish it came in a more neutral color.</li>
            <li> I love this mister and find it very easy to use.  The only issue I have is that it gets oily over time and if you put it close to a wall it will leave water there, so be sure to keep it away and in the middle of a table in a room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans up nicely too and is very lightweight.  Puts out a great smell and lasts 3-4 hours.  I already want to purchase another one for a different room in our home.</li>
            <li> i have enjoyed using these! They are working great!</li>
            <li> This is great for essential oils. I have several and buy them as gifts for family members and friends as well. I use one all winter in my daughters room with the On Guard essential oil to help through flu season. A must have!</li>
            <li> For $35, this thing is a steal!  The auto shutoff is great for times I forget at the end of the day.  My only complaint is that it seems to cycle through the water/oil within 3 hours.  I wish it misted slower and lasted longer!</li>
            <li> The diffuser is amazing, I love how stong the scent is and that it automatically turns off when the water levels get too low. When you put the water and oil in and turn it on it lasts for 4 - 5 hours, which I love because I can change out the scent several times a day.  We love it so much we&#x27;re buying a second one for the other part of the house.</li>
            <li> I have a much more expensive diffuser in addition to this one and this one is absolutely incredible. Although the other one will run on a timer, I feel like this one does more in the 3-4 hours it runs than the other one will in 24 hours. I love everything about it! I will eventually have one in every room!</li>
            <li> I bought two, neither worked after a few months</li>
            <li> My first diffuser, so I have nothing to compare it to. I will say it does an excellent job of diffusing my oils. It seems maybe a little more of a mist, than a diffuser. The area surrounding the machine gets a damp/oil residue. Nothing terrible, but the one I saw in use in a friends home, seemed to be a finer mist.</li>
            <li> I have bought many of these and given them as gifts. Has lasted well over one year with daily use.</li>
            <li> i love it its good work well good quality. im using it in my massage room, its really help</li>
            <li> Works great!! I only wish it could hold more liquid so it would run longer, but it does run for a couple of hours before the liquid and essential oils dissipate. Really glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> My daughter took this to her work place and uses it in the loby, and and has not been sick since, where as before she was catching everyones sickness</li>
            <li> Loving this diffuser. I bought it to diffuse lavendar to help my toddler sleep. Her room smells so good, and I think the nightlight effect and gentle bubbling sounds are definitely helping. It&#x27;s mesmerizing! When it lighs up, the pink is a bit red, but it fades to pink. She&#x27;s a baby, so she doesn&#x27;t care at all. I&#x27;m actually about to buy two more... 1 for the master bedroom and one for the living room.  I looked at MANY options, but ultimately, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a diffuser. I&#x27;m glad I chose this one. It won&#x27;t last forever and it does shut off after 3-4 hours, but the scent lasts long after, and I think it does a great job for the price.  UPDATE ~~~~~~~ It has been a year or more, and this diffuser is still going strong! I bought a cuter one for the living room which never worked at all. I returned it and purchased this same one instead. It was cheaper and works great. The blue is very pretty and soothing. I recommend the blue version over the pink version. This will continue to be my go to diffuser anytime I want to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Great product and great transaction!</li>
            <li> Essential oil enthusiast? This a fabulous one room diffuser, the self-turn off is great too. I have used it for hours straight and still working great!</li>
            <li> Product did not work.  Broken.</li>
            <li> I really like the Diffuser. However, in my opinion it is way overpriced! I do not think it should cost more than $25. For the price it costs, it should at least come with a sampling of some Essential Oils. A friend of mine got it much cheaper with a Groupon. So I would say that if you don&#x27;t care that it is overpriced then get it. Otherwise, I would look for a better buy.</li>
            <li> This was great for 8 weeks using it only 15-30 minutes a day. Then I completely broke and I&#x27;m contacting the company now. Will follow up!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I am new to the world of aroma therapy and I am enjoying learning about the oils and what they can do. This defuser is in my bedroom, I have severe insomnia. I put good night oil on my feet, relaxation oils in the defuser, and relaxation music on the computer and get the best sleep I&#x27;ve had in years. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Really puts out a good quantity for a long time.  I&#x27;ve used different essential oils and live in a very open concept.  This has worked better than anything else that I&#x27;ve used.  Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> My very first one!!! I love using it! I&#x27;ve been able to experience my oils in a completely new and amazing way.</li>
            <li> Awesome defuser! I ended up buying a second and one for my mom! And it&#x27;s such an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  I use it every night.  It&#x27;s so easy to use and clean and runs for about 5 hours until it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in October 2014 and it worked great...for about 4 months. It continuously sat in the nursery at my home, and was well taken care of. It no longer turns on, whatsoever. I didn&#x27;t over-fill the reservoir, always took care of it. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t return this item because it&#x27;s been longer than 30 days. I guess you get what you pay for. I should have gone with a nicer one. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item!</li>
            <li> This is a very quiet diffuser.  I use a diffuser every night and this is the best one I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I recently developed interest in aromatherapy. I have been using oils to cleanse my face and as moisturizer. I also don‚Äôt like the smell of commercial air freshener, they always have this chemically smell, never fresh or light. I had a diffuser but my daughter took it and I was looking to get one since I liked the way it smelled. So when I was offered to review this diffuser for a promotional price, I was more than happy to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ZAQ Allay Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil diffuser is of decent size-80 ml. I like the blue color. When I got this I filled the bottom part with water as instructed and added a few drops of frankincense oil and turned it on. It started immediately with a steady stream of steam and the beautiful aroma of frankincense filled the room. I like the fact that it doesn‚Äôt take much time to make it work and it lasts for up to 4 hours of constant use. The light of the cone can be turned off and you can still have the mist on and enjoy the aroma. Use any essential oil you like. Lavender will be good for a restful sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is not bulky so you can move it from room to room. I also like it to be in the kitchen to take over the smell of foods. Leave it on for a couple of hours and the whole house smell so nice. It has a long cord. Easy to use and clean also. I wiped the inner side with small piece of paper towel to absorb the moister. Leave the two units separate for a while to dry. I am going to try different oils to see which one I like the most.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to write a review on something like this but I felt the need to in order to describe the durability of the machine. At first I really loved it. I use 100% pure essential oils with it, and I have always used the recommended amount of drops in it. Sometimes I was lax on cleaning it, but overall I tried to remember to clean it after a few uses. But eventually the oil stains the inside so bad that no amount of cleaning with alcohol is going to get it clean, kind of like how coffee stains your plastic insulated coffee mugs, you will never get them clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will admit that I got a lot of use out of this machine, I ran it every day, sometimes 3 times per day. But there were also some days that I did not run the machine, sometimes a week, 2 weeks, maybe even a month went by between use. I seem to have noticed that I was using this more in the winter time then in the summer time. It was really easy to use, fill using filtered water to the full line, add 3 to 5 drops of essential oil, put the lid back on, hit the button, and wala, room fills with a fresh scent in only 1 minute for small rooms, 3 to 5 minutes for large rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disapointed in the fact that it only had a 3-hour run time, this thing holds less then a cup of water, so thats probably why. If your sick, you need something that will run all night to help you breath, don&#x27;t count on this thing to provide. And like some other reviewers have stated, I too had the issue where it would turn off early sometimes when it was still full. It has a poor sensor inside, it can&#x27;t tell the difference between water and oil, so I guess if too much oil collects in the bottom, its going to go off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats not a good thing when you set this thing to run during the night and you go to bed, not realizing that the unit turned off, only to wake up later to find that the unit once again was unreliable. I am not expecting this to be built like a tank, but for the price I paid, I expect the sucker to work right. And furthermore for 50 bucks, I expect a machine that will last longer then a year. I bought this in Augest of 2014, its not middle of July 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an aroma therapy machine that is reliable, do yourself a favor and pass on this one.ect the sucker to work right.

            <li> I really like this diffuser.  The color is calming, and it works really well.  It&#x27;s quiet too.</li>
            <li> excellent!! i have bought 3! perfect amount of mist, love the light (or it will run without the light) and has auto shut off when it&#x27;s out of wate so you can go to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not smelling anything with this. I like my young living diffuser much more. I&#x27;m going to order another one that is less than this and others have rated highly to try.</li>
            <li> Got it for Xmas,  and it&#x27;s dead...cleaned...nothing, worked great while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Product quick working today. 35 days after receipt. Unable to find any return information.</li>
            <li> I love this little glowing essential oils diffuser!  Add 1/3 cup tap water (I use bottled) + 5 drops of your favorite essential oil, turn it on and let it go!  I had amazing sleep the last two nights and am using it on a Saturday to help me with a migraine.  I&#x27;m going to buy a second so that I don&#x27;t have to move it from the living room to my bedroom and back again.</li>
            <li> Creates a very thick mist.</li>
            <li> Works great, never had a problem with it. I use it every single day. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item if you want it for longterm use.  Functioned well initially, but it only worked for 2 1/2 months!!  Won&#x27;t turn on at all now.  Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I have this diffuser in my kitchen and it works perfectly to diffuse the oils I choose.  It is quiet and attractive.  I like that you can choose whether to have the light on or not.  This seems to run for about 4 hours with the recommended amount of water and oil.</li>
            <li> A great, reasonably priced oil diffuser.</li>
            <li> It stopped working for me, I changed the disc and made sure it was cleaned out good and it still does not work.</li>
            <li> Love it so much, I have ordered several as gifts for family members :)</li>
            <li> Works very well. Only wish the light was a bit dimmer. Really like that it shuts it&#x27;s self off when water is gone.</li>
            <li> I actually had to return this . Not sure if I got a defective one or if it is just the brand but it did not diffuse my oils well. I was having to add at least 8-10 drops of oil to get the faintest smell when using my other diffuser and same oils I only had to use 4. Would not repurchase!</li>
            <li> best aromatherapy out there!! I have bought several different kinds and this is the most amazing one made.  I use it every day and night and bought 2 for 2 different rooms.</li>
            <li> I loved this diffuser when it worked. After about 6 weeks of nightly use and weekly cleaning, it died. We replaced the disc as others have suggested but it didn&#x27;t do the trick. Sad. Would be willing to buy again if the product lasted longer.</li>
            <li> At first, this would shut off after just an hour.  Then, I realized that I was using too much essential oil.  It only takes about 3 drops and water filled up to the max line or it doesn&#x27;t run the full time.  Now, it easily runs for 3 hours until the reservoir is empty every time.  I use different brands of oils and it works great.  I move it from the bedroom at night, into the living room during the day. This was a great alternative to the pricey Young Living diffuser and works well for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. In Arizona, it is needed at night.</li>
            <li> Nice product fast delivery</li>
            <li> I like the oil diffuser...I just wish it had a little more power behind it.  The mist lingers around the diffuser rather than going upwards, causing the surface it sits on to become damp.</li>
            <li> I bought this diffuser a few months ago and I love it! I have not had any problems with it use it daily!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:839056d27eb3f99d495d7f68e331f9fa]]There is a great video on Youtube that shows this Oil Diffuser in use and how easy it is to operate check it out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to Use a ZAQ allay Ultransmit Oil Diffuser for Essential Oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://youtu.be/KEZUYI52Pj8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copy and Paste Link to see Entire Video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this Review Was Helpful Please Give it a THUMBS UP :)</li>
            <li> works great. starts diffusing instantly. has a shutoff when liquid runs dry. uses very little essential oil (3 drops is enough) lasts for a few hours. Very efficient. Much better than using a candle below pure oil method. Has a nice  appearance with a soothing light that can can be turned off while diffuser is still running.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and I love the soft blue glow.  Shipped quickly too and at a great price.  Thanks!! :)</li>
            <li> So I bought a couple back in March and 1 of them has already died. I&#x27;ve tried to get in touch with the company and haven&#x27;t ever got a response. Wrote twice about it. I did now buy these 2 for my daughters, bought them the week before mine died. I&#x27;m so frustrated with no response. I really like them when they&#x27;re working tho. Really helpful with the oils and small enough to take with when we travel.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great.  It is powerful enough to fill a standard bedroom with the aromatherapy oil I use for my kiddos.  I love the fact that it has an automatic shut off once the water is diffused out.  Not only does it serve it&#x27;s purpose it also doubles up as a night light; perfect for my toddler.  I now have bought a second one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain about this product. It&#x27;s perfect for diffusing essential oils. I love that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;tall&amp;#34; verses &amp;#34;short and wide,&amp;#34; like some other diffusers out there. It seems to disperse the oils well. Very easy to maintain and clean. GREAT purchase for the price!&lt;br /&gt;And I have a diffuser that can run from 8-10hours - but I prefer this one that runs from 3-4hrs, because after 4 hours, the aroma of the oils is practically gone anyways. It&#x27;s perfect as far as timing goes. I know it seems like it&#x27;d be nice to have a product that runs for a longer period of time - but trust me on this - it&#x27;s not better! The 3-4hr range is perfect for how long it takes for the oils (in general) to run out as far as the aroma goes. Anything much beyond that, is just pointless for the sake of aromatherapy.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me - I have both and have tried both. A diffuser that runs for a shorter period of time is better also, because you&#x27;re using less oils. A larger diffuser requires more oils, even though the aroma still runs out after a certain period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Very cost effective. Made of quality materials. And GREAT customer service from this company.</li>
            <li> Great product. Releases just the right amount of scent which you choose be adding a few drops of essential oil. There is no messy wax to melt or clean up. It turns itself off when the reservoir is empty. My daughter has one and I had to have one too.</li>
            <li> Love it just what I wanted Used it everyday all winter with essential oil to keep flu away. No one got sick all winter! Good Quality love that it turns off by itself when water is gone.</li>
            <li> Love this product. We own two</li>
            <li> It worked great for a couple months, now it glitches and just turns off seconds after turning it on. I&#x27;d reccommend looking at a nicer one. I&#x27;m stuck with this now since the return period has conveniently expired.</li>
            <li> I love these misters I have a few and have given as gifts they are reasonably priced and have a light like a night light. They automatically turn off when empty which is great thanks so much</li>
            <li> Love this one! It looks and mists very similar to the Doterra mister at a third of the cost!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Well I didn&#x27;t know there was such a device, but when I had received an opportunity to give the Allay Aromatherapy defused a try for free, try it for a while and then give my feedback and a very honest informative review so that all purchasers could find out detailed information about the product so that they can decide and make a informed purchase of the Allay Defuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So first of I was very excited since I love the smell of the vitamin store and an very relaxed after shipping, so I picked up a healing essential oil, I&#x27;ve been suffering with sinus problems.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to assemble the base has a line so that you know how much water to add, you only put a few maybe 3 out 4 drips of essential oil in then there is a cone that goes on after that then you apply the cone top, which comes in 3 beautiful colors.  I was very excited that mine came in the blue which ironically matches my living room.  The plug which is not attached so that about every 3 used you wipe the fluid base out with a soft cotton or tissue easily,  then Plug it in and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;So Allay breaks the oil up into millions of particles so that there is no condonsation and can be placed on any surface , so there is no worry it will ruin your furniture.&lt;br /&gt;The Allay has 3 settings, on with color, on with no color and off.  The smell will envelop you into relaxation and infuse your home with a beautiful smell, I have enjoyed the Allay Litemist Aromatherapy Essential Oil since I recorded it and with using it I have felt so much better, and in a more relaxed frame of mind.  Essential Oils can really change your mood.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so very happy that I had  the opportunity to try this product, it has really changed the way I feel &amp; wanted to take the time to let you know how enjoyable it is so you can also have the opportunity to try it as well.</li>
            <li> It shuts off after about 15 minutes.  I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> It arrived in timely manner, well packaged for protection. Packaged misspelled on sides, it says &amp;#34;aromaherapy&amp;#34;. Works great for diffusing essential oils. I like the blue light. When the water gets to very low levels, the diffuser turns itself off. I just rinse it with water when I change the scent.</li>
            <li> Lovely diffuser. Lots of moisture in the air, functions good too. Option to run off the light at night or leave it on. Do sound, very quite. Great with any oils.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I&#x27;ve now got all my friends using (and loving) one too. Excellent product! Used mine almost every day for the last year and a half. Purchased this one for a friend&#x27;s bday and I have also given them as client (massage) gifts....they are always loved :)</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase of the ZAQ lite mist diffuser. My only dislike is the appearance, as I saw some that look like pottery...it looks a bit industrial in my living room. I was first introduced to this product by my daughter&#x27;s second grade teacher. I help in the classroom once a week and have always been amazed by how fresh and clean their room smells. She showed me this diffuser that she has in a corner of the room. She said she uses the lavender oils to help promote a sense of calmness. I see that too, but always credited it to her excellent teaching skills. Nevertheless, I purchased one for both the fresh smell and sense of calmness in my house. One out of two is not bad. Don&#x27;t judge me, I have 4 kids!!</li>
            <li> was skeptical at purchasing based on reviews, however, this has been working well for me for three months.  update - 2 years later (1/17): still works like a charm:)</li>
            <li> I  put this thing on as I sleep and its great. It also turns off automatically. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  I&#x27;ve bought 2 as gifts once I had used mine for awhile.  Recently I tried a different brand and realized I was spoiled by the simplicity, ease of use and reliability of the ZAQ Allay Litemist. I&#x27;ll be buying myself another soon, because who wants to move the diffuser all over the house.  I would like one for each room!  (Oh, if I had a request it&#x27;s that one would be offered with a white cone and one with a green cone. Personal preference only.)  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> After doing a little research, I bought this as a gift for my elderly parents and one for my son at Christmas.  The first one quit running after a month, but the seller replaced immediately under warranty without any hassle.  The diffuser is easy to use, and is quiet.  I don&#x27;t hear it humming like the diffuser I have from Young Living. Essential oils have kept my family healthier this past winter, no colds, and more importantly, no flu!</li>
            <li> Excellent diffuser. Fast shopping</li>
            <li> So far it has been a good investment being my first diffuser. It really &#x27;puts&#x27; out the oil. The only thing I would love is one that can handle a larger room.</li>
            <li> Such a great buy - I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Perfect; just as it should be. We love this diffuser the best out of all we&#x27;ve tried. We have three of these now! (not sure why the orange one is more expensive?)</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser so much!  My Mom and Sister bought the same one after seeing it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, diffuses nicely for several hours and shuts off when it is empty. It has two settings, one with the top lighting up beautifully, and one with out it in case you don&#x27;t want that bright light in your room at night.</li>
            <li> easy to use. easy to clean. I&#x27;m going to buy another very soon</li>
            <li> Zero stars if I could. Worked great until 2 weeks after the 30 day return period. Doesn&#x27;t turn on at all now. A complete waste of my time and money. Find a different product to buy.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter loves it and I am thinking of getting another for my youngest daughter too.  It is easy to work and adds a calm light for their room too.</li>
            <li> Received on Oct. 8, stopped working Nov. 24. Used lightly, not even everyday, during that time period.</li>
            <li> Seemed great for the first two days then died. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! Save yourself the time and frustration and buy the more expensive ceramic one that will actually last.</li>
            <li> Love it. Diffuser is working great in nursery with thieves oil.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Easy to set up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to aromatherapy and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a diffuser, so I chose this one. It works perfectly! It starts diffusing instantly, with no delay. I like how you can use it with the blue light or without the blue light. I have a very large open loft (over 1200 sqft), and I can smell the essential oils with no problem in most of the loft.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it lasts for hours. I haven&#x27;t timed it, but when it&#x27;s full of water, I would estimate that it lasts at least 6 hours or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother uses it mostly at night while she sleeps beside her bed. So I&#x27;m going to buy another one for my personal use that I can use beside my bed and during my hypnotherapy sessions with my clients.</li>
            <li> Have had it for about 4 days now and have used it every single day and it works beautifully!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly whT I was looking for</li>
            <li> Garbage. Used it 3 times and it just stopped. Read Q&amp;A and tried to clean it and still doesn&#x27;t work. I rarely by things on Amazon that I am this disappointed with. Not eligible for return even after a couple weeks. Absolutely don&#x27;t buy. We also have a diffuser from Young Living essential oils that has worked better and held up longer. Another case of get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with how this works.  I love that you can choose whether or not the light shines.  With that being said though, I won&#x27;t be able to use it in my bedroom as planned without some modification.  While you can choose to turn the light off it still glows around the on/off button and would be enough to disrupt my sleep.  A simple fix for all other glowing things in my bedroom has been to cover it with black electrical tape so I can&#x27;t see it.  I&#x27;m not sure it will work on this though since it would limit the function of the button; will have to try it and see.  Maybe tape down a dark piece of fabric around it would work....I&#x27;ll have to try that and feel almost 100% sure it will work.&lt;br /&gt;I love the other fact that it shuts itself off when it runs out of water.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is larger than I anticipated it being for this price so I was pleasantly pleased with that also.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be made with high quality parts and doesn&#x27;t appear flimsy or cheaply made either - another plus!</li>
            <li> Great diffuser. Ease to use and lasts a long time before having to fill the tank.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.  It has a small footprint, very effectively diffuses essential oil throughout a large room in my home.  Great to also put a bit of moisture back in the air as we are coming into the dry weather season.</li>
            <li> This one gets a lot of use with our essential oils. Works great. We even bought others for gifts.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw this at my daughter-in-laws house I knew I had to have it! The tranquil blue color combines with the swirls of misty fog as it sits directly next to me on my coffee table. With the dry winter air filling the house, this adds just the right amount of humidity to keep my sinuses happy. It arrived super fast, in an easy to open box, and set-up was a breeze! My only disappointment is that when it is filled to capacity with room temp. tap water, it runs for approximately 3 to 3 and a half hours, so I find myself filling it several times daily. This just confirms the fact that it  adds the perfect ambiance that is so enjoyable I use it constantly! Built very sturdy and a breeze to wipe dry and refill it is well worth the cost. I plan on buying a second one for my bedroom also. I highly recommend this not only for it&#x27;s calming therapy, but the warmth it adds to the dry winter air.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and I want it in every color!  It is very quiet and the faint noise actually puts me to sleep.  The mist fills our entire bedroom easily, but you definitely need more than one for an entire house.  I move mine from room to room which is fine for now.  This is a great affordable option compared to the crazy expensive models.  This diffuser is easy to clean since all the parts come off. I like that you can turn the light off, but keep the diffuser on too!</li>
            <li> Packaging, shipping, appearance of product were all great.  I&#x27;m not sure if the area covered is what I hoped it to be, but for a small space I believe it would work great.</li>
            <li> Worked great...once...then stopped working! DO NOT waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Loved this items so much, I purchased one for my mom, sister AND friend! Add a couple drops of cinnamon oil to the water and MMMMMM...my apartment smells DELISH!</li>
            <li> Easy to fill, great price, works wonderfully</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser so much that I had to purchase two additional for other rooms!</li>
            <li> I own 2 of these along with a larger diffuser from a different company .  I love this one!!!! Works great no problems, use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. Works great.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a diffuser. I have been wanting one for awhile but finally got around to ordering one when my family had a bad cold on Christmas. Amazon got it to us the next day which was awesome! I&#x27;ve used this diffuser in various rooms around the house and I really like it. It&#x27;s very easy to use, quick to set up, and I really like the way it looks. My toddler loves to watch it. The blue glowing light can be on or off. It lasts for about 4 hours. I usually use 5 drops of doTerra essential oils. We&#x27;ve mostly used Breathe to help us sleep at night. What I really like is that when the water runs out, it automatically turns itself off so we don&#x27;t have to worry about anything. The quality is great. I highly recommend this diffuser and I will definitely be using mine often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (8/6/15): I never updated this review: It worked well but only for 2 weeks. I did use it a lot (I left it on all night) but I still expected it to last at least a year. What a huge disappointment. Now I&#x27;ve seen that this is a common issue with these diffusers.</li>
            <li> So easy to use! I just wish the top attached better to the base, it doesn&#x27;t seal at all and just sits on top so it kind of makes me nervous since it can be damaging to knock it over and let water get into the mechanism.  But.. I really do love how you can choose your own oils and the scent lasts for a few hours with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a couple months now and love it! It&#x27;s not huge but puts out a good amount which is exactly what I was looking for. If I put stronger smelling oils in it, I can smell it through most of my main floor.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law had one of these and my husband even commented on the nice fragrance the house had. Got mine today and it is already running with lavender. Just lovely and the light display is unexpected</li>
            <li> best little diffuser I have ever used. So easy and works great. Been using it almost daily. It gets the room smelling great with healthy oils I use like lavender and balsam.</li>
            <li> This is a great value....the machine cuts off automatically when the water runs out...we use it all the time and it really scents a medium size room</li>
            <li> Last only a 1 or 2 hrs max, expected an intermitent mode but only has 3 (off/On w/light &amp; On no/light)</li>
            <li> Use it every day....would recommend.  We use in a bedroom</li>
            <li> I like this product, I have had it for 3 months. It has a little bit of a smaller well than what I am used to, so it doesn&#x27;t last as long as others.... But I still would buy another for a small room.</li>
            <li> My daughter raved about this diffuser, so I bought one for my daugher-in-law who absolutely loves it!!  So I bought one for me too!!  Great product; great seller!  Five stars all the way!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser about a year ago. It has been working perfectly ever since. We loved it so much I bought another one about 6 months later for our bedroom. It too is working perfectly. (I only use distilled water and undiluted oils)&lt;br /&gt;My 9 year old son asked for one for Christmas, to put in his room. Now I am looking to purchase my 4th ZAQ Allay diffuser for my daughter&#x27;s room. I love that it&#x27;s an ultrasonic diffuser and doesn&#x27;t heat the oil. It is very quite and shuts off automatically when it is out of water. My only complaint would be the brightness of the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button but I like to sleep in a very dark room so maybe this wouldn&#x27;t bother others. Overall, a very affordable diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little diffuser, but it doesn&#x27;t cover a very large area.</li>
            <li> This diffuser got 5 stars for the first two months. Now it doesn&#x27;t even turn on so I give it zero stars. I&#x27;ve tried calling the seller but it goes to a mobile generic voicemail and I&#x27;ve missed the Amazon return policy window.</li>
            <li> Works well so far.  The only drawback is the small resevoir for water.  I would like it to run longer before having to refill.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I&#x27;ve used this daily for months and have had no problems.  Does the job for a great price!</li>
            <li> Love this....I use it everyday!  Runs for 4 hours at a time!</li>
            <li> loved it till it stopped working after 4 months - could not return it - so stuck with it</li>
            <li> Fills the room with scent.  Works really and the light feature is great.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple of months. Easy to use and works well. I will be buying another one or two for other rooms in the house. It&#x27;s kind of like a cool mist humidifier.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my machine!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this diffuser. It came in 3 days. And it&#x27;s super quiet. Highly recommend üëç</li>
            <li> Great product. My first diffuser, so read a lot of reviews on many products.  Very happy with this decision.  It is so simple to use, looks attractive sitting out and (now that I think about it ... needs to be cranked up right now!) makes such a difference in my overall atmosphere.  As advised, it only runs about 3+ hours, so at night I start it when I go to bed and a few hours later it auto shuts off.  The comments about the blue light are accurate.  It is bright, even on the &amp;#34;light off&amp;#34; setting, the glow around the button is still bright.  That said, it is not a problem for me because I am in a 700 sq ft apartment so it is not in my bedroom.  It is in my writing/craft nook which has a ceiling fan on ... helping to disburse the vapor throughout my apartment. Honestly, even without the light, I think it might be too intense for me to have only a few feet away.  I am careful to wipe it out after each use, checking to see no residue is building on the ceramic plate.  It has sold me on diffusers, to the end I&#x27;m contemplating moving this to my enclosed office at work and getting another larger one for home that would go through the night.  As for fragrance, some reviewers (on some models) commented the fragrance was stronger initially and then diminished as time passed.  My thought is oil and water don&#x27;t mix.  The oil sit on top so it makes sense to me the oil is diffusing &amp;#34;faster&amp;#34; as that&#x27;s the area closest to the funnel where the vapor passes out.  Just my own theory.  :-)</li>
            <li> it was a gift for Christmas! It will not work after 2 months, of course that is past the return date so....left w/o a gift for them and feeling embarrassed</li>
            <li> Bought this 8months ago Still works great! Have used citrus and other oils with it. Love that you have the option of turning the light on or off.</li>
            <li> easy to use and works good....... love the color</li>
