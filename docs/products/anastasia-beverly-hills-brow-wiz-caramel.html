            <li>It just rolls up &amp; it has its own brush.</li>
            <li>I use the caramel shade which is just lighter than my own eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Its just not as nice to put on.</li>
            <li>Best EYE BROW PENCIL by far!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with how nice the end result comes out and</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I have Auburn hair and the Caramel color is perfect, blends easily and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Caramel color is great for my coloring - a strawberry blonde with fair brows.</li>

            <li>Love that you don&#x27;t have to sharpen.</li>

            <li>Love the teensie-weensie tip and the attached spoolie brush.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>He is a great guy and really cares about his customers.  </li>
            <li>They could have done better by their customers, in my estimation.  </li>
            <li>Love these brow pencils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It fell out too many times</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>It is my second pencil, they are my best solution ever regarding my scarcely hairy eyebrows.</li>
            <li>In summer to fall I go from golden blond  to brunette and the soft brown and caramel are perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>Makes my brows two shades - easy to control shade with light or heavier strokes or gradually building.</li>
            <li>This is a top-3 beauty must-have for me, next to my BB cream and great mascara.</li>
            <li>I am a salt and pepper with light brown undertones.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li>Love this product for natural looking brows!!!</li>
            <li>Great sharp tip and color, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine other wise.</li>
            <li>It is much firmer than most pencils, but that enables you to put in fine marks that resemble hairs, so it is very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>If you are gentle then you should be fine</li>
            <li>Great brow pencil little pricey but worth it for the look.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny...</li>
            <li>In any event, I really do prefer to use healthy cosmetics that have quality ingredients because some really do have harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised and pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite brow pencil so far</li>
            <li>It comes in many perfectly natural appearing colors.</li>
            <li>But, I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have golden brown hair s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>My brows are pretty full, but they need shape definition and their almost invisible without this.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>I am very picky and thought I would never be able to find anything I could live with.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use,looks natural, and lasts.</li>
            <li>no one has that large of a brow....</li>
            <li>I am a red head with red/gold coppery color hair and this actually looks good on me, very natural.</li>
            <li>I love these brow pencils, but I received an empty tube.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made very well and will stand up to use.</li>
            <li>The brow brush on the end is very convenient and  the pencil never needs sharpening.</li>
            <li>The pencil seems &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t want to color very well.  </li>
            <li>Others I&#x27;ve tried just never looked right or natural.</li>
            <li>Kind of dry and brittle compared to the last one i bought from sephora.</li>
            <li>I was dubious about the fine tip initially, but it makes it easy to apply precisely and the end result - once you&#x27;ve brushed through using the brush at the other end of the pencil - looks professional.</li>
            <li>but the dark one isuits my brow colour even better.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I just received this, and I like it, but I have to say the main reason is because of the color \\&quot;Caramel\\</li>
            <li>You can mark little hairs as if natural, it is easy to apply and slide, the caramel colour was all right</li>
            <li>I am surprised I didn&#x27;t start there in the very beginning, but sometimes we get hooked on a color.  </li>
            <li>And you will also be putting something healthier near your eyes!  </li>
            <li>I just looks so natural!</li>
            <li>Most are too red or too dark.</li>
            <li>I am really upset because I cannot return it since I live outside of USA.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look as natural as the pencil</li>
            <li>The brush at the end is really stiff, which I like for blending the product into my natural brows and using to put clear brow gel over my brows to give a really refined natural look and keep everything in place in the hot Texas heat.</li>
            <li>The point on this is so thin that it is really easy to work with and creates a natural light look and doesn&#x27;t come off as heavy.</li>
            <li>I use it with Anastasia clear brow gel if I need some extra staying power.</li>
            <li>I have rather sparse brows from years of over-plucking, and this is the only thing that fills them in and still looks natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, although the \\&quot;lead\\&quot; part of the pencil worked nicely when you could get it to come out, getting it to come out without FALLING out was quite difficult.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not waxy which i love because you can give it a natural look, especially since the tip is so thin.</li>
            <li>I got caramel and it goes really well with dark hair and olive skin tone.</li>
            <li>and they all look pretty stark</li>
            <li>Well, sometimes good can come from bad, and it sent me looking for a replacement.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this is a real product.</li>
            <li> The narrow “lead” give you the option of solid brows or the illusion of individual hairs.</li>
            <li> Then if you held it upside down, the entire \\&quot;lead\\&quot; part would come out in one long piece..</li>
            <li> I only have about half of my eyebrows left (due to a health condition)</li>
            <li> I had to carefully put it back in, and now I have to be very careful when I try to use it.</li>
            <li> and I also bought three other products from Anastasia.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is not waterproof...</li>
            <li> My only complaint was I didn&#x27;t feel it lasted all day with out having to buy the brow gel or wax.</li>
            <li> and I got tired of getting brow pencil marks on my fingers from having to pick it back up and re-fill it, so</li>
            <li> so that was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> that I found it on Amazon at a slight discount from what I usually pay.</li>
            <li> My main disappointment has been that both brow pencils that I ordered, the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; does not stay contained in the &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I already used Gabriel Cosmetics and had even spoken to Gabriel myself in the past.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say that for Anastasia to discontinue this and try to pass off &amp;#34;caramel&amp;#34; as the same thing as &amp;#34;strawburn&amp;#34; ... um, I don&#x27;t think so.  </li>
            <li> this one will smudge or wipe off if you wipe tooo hard.</li>
            <li> the pen was hard to get working.</li>
            <li> Five stars for the product, one for the poor customer service practices of this seller.</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to this product!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin brows, and I just use this to darken my brows and fill in the sparse spots.  </li>
            <li> Maybe its a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I was sooo disappointed when Anastasia discontinued their &amp;#34;strawburn&amp;#34; color.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather annoying.  </li>

            <li> I was dubious about the fine tip initially, but it makes it easy to apply precisely and the end result - once you&#x27;ve brushed through using the brush at the other end of the pencil - looks professional. No need to sharpen it and the eyebrow brush make it perfect for travel. Caramel color is great for my coloring - a strawberry blonde with fair brows. Makes my brows two shades - easy to control shade with light or heavier strokes or gradually building.</li>
            <li> I love these brow pencils, but I received an empty tube. Five stars for the product, one for the poor customer service practices of this seller.</li>
            <li> Kind of dry and brittle compared to the last one i bought from sephora. Still using it though.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite eyebrow pencil. Others I&#x27;ve tried just never looked right or natural. Love that you don&#x27;t have to sharpen. It just rolls up &amp; it has its own brush. I use the caramel shade which is just lighter than my own eyebrows. I use it with Anastasia clear brow gel if I need some extra staying power.

            <li> Best eyebrow pencil ever. I have Auburn hair and the Caramel color is perfect, blends easily and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny... It applies on esay and it last all day.</li>
            <li> This is a top-3 beauty must-have for me, next to my BB cream and great mascara. I have rather sparse brows from years of over-plucking, and this is the only thing that fills them in and still looks natural. Love the teensie-weensie tip and the attached spoolie brush. It&#x27;s just perfection! Caramel is actually a cooler brown, and compliments my olive complexion and golden-brown hair color well. Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It works. The price is right. It&#x27;s made very well and will stand up to use.Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> This is the first brow pencil that is the perfect color for me in caramel. Most are too red or too dark. It is easy to use,looks natural, and lasts. I am now addicted to this product!</li>
            <li> Best EYE BROW PENCIL by far!! LOVE this brand works awesome!!! My only complaint is it is not waterproof... so if you have ever used the Sephora brand you can rub on your face and its not going anywhere well this one will smudge or wipe off if you wipe tooo hard. If you are gentle then you should be fine</li>

I am surprised I didn&#x27;t start there in the very beginning, but sometimes we get hooked on a color.  He is a great guy and really cares about his customers.  Sorry to say that for Anastasia to discontinue this and try to pass off &amp;#34;caramel&amp;#34; as the same thing as &amp;#34;strawburn&amp;#34; ... um, I don&#x27;t think so.  They could have done better by their customers, in my estimation.  The color is not even close!  In any event, I really do prefer to use healthy cosmetics that have quality ingredients because some really do have harmful chemicals.  The eyebrow pencil made by Gabriel&#x27;s &amp;#34;ZuZu&amp;#34; line in the &amp;#34;flax&amp;#34; color is the best substitute ever!  I was so surprised and pleased.  It has an even better brush on the tip!  If you are looking for a &amp;#34;strawburn&amp;#34; replacement, try this.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  And you will also be putting something healthier near your eyes!  It&#x27;s gluten-free, too.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I bought this pencil, but when I was about to use it the tip came off!!!! I had to carefully put it back in, and now I have to be very careful when I try to use it. I am really upset because I cannot return it since I live outside of USA.</li>
            <li> Love these brow pencils. In summer to fall I go from golden blond  to brunette and the soft brown and caramel are perfect!</li>
            <li> I tried anastasia Beverly Hills brow pencil after seeing it online. I have tried the dip broke but it doesn&#x27;t look as natural as the pencil and it it faster and easier to use on the go. I got caramel and it goes really well with dark hair and olive skin tone. This is my favorite brow pencil so far and I will continue purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> I just looks so natural! amazing</li>
            <li> Great sharp tip and color, but the pen was hard to get working. You could twist the bottom part continuously and nothing would come out. Then if you held it upside down, the entire \\&quot;lead\\&quot; part would come out in one long piece..so that you&#x27;d have to try to put it back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fell out too many times and I got tired of getting brow pencil marks on my fingers from having to pick it back up and re-fill it, so in the trash it went. I think it lasted about two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, although the \\&quot;lead\\&quot; part of the pencil worked nicely when you could get it to come out, getting it to come out without FALLING out was quite difficult. I&#x27;ll stick to the pens and the NON-self-sharpening pencils from now on.</li>
            <li> This is a great color for me. I am a salt and pepper with light brown undertones. I only have about half of my eyebrows left (due to a health condition) so this fills in great for me, and it stays put until I take it off.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil!!!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY eyebrow wax/pencil I&#x27;ll ever use! It doesn&#x27;t rub off!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Anastasia for a while  I like the convenience of a automatic pencil. The narrow “lead” give you the option of solid brows or the illusion of individual hairs. It comes in many perfectly natural appearing colors. I use Carmel or brunette depending on the season or my hair color. The brow brush on the end is very convenient and  the pencil never needs sharpening. It&#x27;s easy to use. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great color and brusg</li>
            <li> Love this product for natural looking brows!!! My only complaint was I didn&#x27;t feel it lasted all day with out having to buy the brow gel or wax.</li>
            <li> My main disappointment has been that both brow pencils that I ordered, the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; does not stay contained in the &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34;.  Sometimes while using it the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; will push back into the &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s rather annoying.  I would like to order this way again--it&#x27;s so convenient, but I might be hesitant to do so.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just a fluke--or the company that sends these out only has the rejects that don&#x27;t make it to the stores?</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is absolutely amazing. I&#x27;m in love with how nice the end result comes out and how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific eyebrow pencil, and it should be for the price!  But, I think it&#x27;s worth it.  I have very thin brows, and I just use this to darken my brows and fill in the sparse spots.  It is much firmer than most pencils, but that enables you to put in fine marks that resemble hairs, so it is very natural looking.  Overall, a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Best brow pencil I have ever used!! Love the caramel color!! Perfect!</li>
            <li> The pencil seems &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t want to color very well.  Too spendy for what I got. I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The best pencil I have tried,  I&#x27;m fair skinned and they all look pretty stark, this blends and the color is great.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have golden brown hair s the color Caramel is a great match. This eyebrow tool works wonders. It&#x27;s not waxy which i love because you can give it a natural look, especially since the tip is so thin. This is a staple product in my makeup bag. Love it</li>
            <li> Great brow pencil little pricey but worth it for the look.</li>
            <li> I just received this, and I like it, but I have to say the main reason is because of the color \\&quot;Caramel\\&quot; and I also bought three other products from Anastasia.  Now I will say I fell for the templates to shape my brows and only the petite one is even close....all gthe others are for amazon women!!  no one has that large of a brow....so that was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recomendation of the make up artist on you tube Jaclyn Hill. I am in love with this product. I am a red head with red/gold coppery color hair and this actually looks good on me, very natural. The point on this is so thin that it is really easy to work with and creates a natural light look and doesn&#x27;t come off as heavy. The brush at the end is really stiff, which I like for blending the product into my natural brows and using to put clear brow gel over my brows to give a really refined natural look and keep everything in place in the hot Texas heat. Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this is a real product. Its almost like its a different formula than ones i&#x27;ve bought in stores. It&#x27;s fine other wise. Its just not as nice to put on. Maybe its a bad batch.</li>
            <li> tHIS IS THE BEST BROW PENCIL EVER. You can mark little hairs as if natural, it is easy to apply and slide, the caramel colour was all right but the dark one isuits my brow colour even better. It is my second pencil, they are my best solution ever regarding my scarcely hairy eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this in my life sooner!</li>
            <li> I have been using this pencil for about a year.  It&#x27;s well worth the price.  My brows are pretty full, but they need shape definition and their almost invisible without this.&lt;br /&gt;Love that I found it on Amazon at a slight discount from what I usually pay.</li>
