            <li>Very good for the money conscious make-up lover or colorful college student.</li>
            <li>but they are much more pigmented than I was expecting.its great for practice,beginners or just daily use</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t secure the packaging if its being shipped to the U.S.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t even enjoy it now.</li>
            <li>The colors go on SO LIGHT , it looks like I don&#x27;t have any on.</li>
            <li>but they came fast and not damaged at all!!!</li>
            <li>While the shadows may be small, they are nicely pigmented and when used with a primer they are great.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this pallet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having fun doing my eye shadows again!</li>
            <li>this is good for a teen just getting into the make up world...</li>
            <li>I like the low price and good quality eye shadows.</li>
            <li>hope you like it as much as I do:)</li>
            <li>Came late but it works perfect !</li>
            <li>But the eye shadow it not bad.</li>
            <li>I love the colors witch are super pigmented and easy to bland making it  easy to go from day to night makeup!  </li>
            <li>They arrived in good condition and they have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Good variety of color but not very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I showed my boyfriends cousins and 4 of them actually ordered a pallets for themselves !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday palette!</li>
            <li>and she absolutely LOVES it !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving these colors, which are all in the mocha, cream, pink, brown family.</li>
            <li>It was absolutely everythingggg!</li>
            <li>Pretty good considering it was shipped from half way around the world!</li>
            <li>I was worried because of the price that these would be made cheaply , but I was wrong they are Great</li>
            <li>(i usually use becca, mac, bobbi brown, sometimes Dior) than what i&#x27;m used to buying and the reviews where good</li>
            <li>I received it and only one of the colors was kind of crushed, not o bad for how it was packaged (one piece of bubble wrap inside the compact, stuffed in a regular FedEx packing bag) there are a lot of matte colors, which I LOVE,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had a multitude of colors for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>but you do really have to work to pack the colors in.</li>
            <li>the case feels really breakable &amp; the pigment nuff said</li>
            <li>Even with an eyelid primer the colors don&#x27;t really shine through.</li>
            <li>They do package it really well.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this pallet was the dark colors.</li>
            <li>The black is more intense than M.A.C.&#x27;s Carbon.</li>
            <li>The colors are good overall, easy to use, and luckily the two eye shadows that came broken are the ones that I probably wouldn&#x27;t be using in the future.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sooooo pigmented (except the light light colors because it&#x27;s really hard to have pigmented beiges and whites).</li>
            <li>Reminder that we using this product , you got to get a decent amount onto the brush(or whatever you may use) for it to truly show up .</li>
            <li>the pallete isn&#x27;t highly pigmented AT ALL...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this palette.</li>
            <li>To top it all off, it was less than $10!</li>
            <li>The only draw back is it doesn&#x27;t fit in my make up bag.</li>
            <li>maybe package more carefully for other customer!</li>
            <li>Great pigmentation, black is not super dark</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first because of the price but this eye shadow is amazing!</li>
            <li>Only con is that the packaging is a little on the cheap side so be carful not to drop it.</li>
            <li>Not pigmented enough I have to reapply a few layers to see any of the light colors .</li>

            <li> the only minor issue is that there is no pinkish color like there is in the picture , but she doesn&#x27;t mind it .</li>
            <li> I proceed to open the actual eyeshadow palette to find loose eyeshadow everywhere.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the variety without many crazy colors.</li>
            <li> I had to wipe it down with makeup remover wipes before I could even open the damn thing!</li>
            <li> I add NYX black shadow to further contour or add depth to eyes.</li>
            <li> the only color that i use in this pallete is the black one THAT&#x27;S IT...</li>
            <li> have blue eyes, so carefully putting together a few brownish shades just make my eyes pop.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was packaged in a black box and inside of</li>
            <li> I find the black the nicest, even though I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I received it with colors missing and broke up, thank God it was colors I didnt need.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Corrupt is next if I can find it.</li>
            <li> As expected when it arrived in the mail, some eye shadows came broken.</li>
            <li> I received my product completely damaged I am truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is not good.</li>
            <li> the pallet came secured in a box and then wrapped in bubble wrap none of the eyeshadows delivered broken</li>
            <li> one of the eye shadows came broken.</li>
            <li> I also found about 6 of the eyeshadows broken.</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;It came a bit dusty and one of the eyeshadows seemed to be used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it said I would receive and no eyeshadows were broken.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the product was not the 28 colors and was broken.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected sorry :(</li>
            <li> Over all, not to bad just wish it was easier to apply colors.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> The case is terribly flimsy and it arrived with brown eyeshadow caked all over it.</li>

            <li> i bought this for my daughter for back to school usage and she absolutely LOVES it ! it was packaged in a black box and inside of it was the eyeshadow palette wrapped in bubble wrap and came in the mail in ONLY A WEEK ! the only minor issue is that there is no pinkish color like there is in the picture , but she doesn&#x27;t mind it . Reminder that we using this product , you got to get a decent amount onto the brush(or whatever you may use) for it to truly show up . ooohh and some of the colors have a hint of sparkles in it (: VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PALETTE !</li>
            <li> I love this pallette, great for earthy tones and even contouring. Great pigmentation, black is not super dark but it does the trick. I add NYX black shadow to further contour or add depth to eyes. Corrupt is next if I can find it.</li>
            <li> Not pigmented enough I have to reapply a few layers to see any of the light colors .</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because of the price but this eye shadow is amazing! perfect pigment it lasts all day and I can layer it to create my own look. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> colors are great, very mixable, good going on. great product for the money. I would recommend to others. love it.</li>
            <li> I was worried because of the price that these would be made cheaply , but I was wrong they are Great and I will be ordering these for Christmas Presents!</li>
            <li> Loved this pallet.  Great mix of colors and high in pigment as well.  The black is more intense than M.A.C.&#x27;s Carbon. ★★★★★&lt;br /&gt;Five stars and five hearts.  ♥♥♥♥♥</li>
            <li> I received my palette today it is great for the price the colors repeat but they are much more pigmented than I was expecting.its great for practice,beginners or just daily use I used it today and it still looks the same as it did 8 hrs ago and I didn&#x27;t even prime.great buy for the price</li>
            <li> MUST BUY!!! This pallet came in a couple weeks after purchasing the colors are absolutely amazing almost all warm colors warm Browns and just fantastic colors the pallet came secured in a box and then wrapped in bubble wrap none of the eyeshadows delivered broken this is a great product and I highly reccomend this!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this pallete for anyone who uses make up on a day to day basis...this is good for a teen just getting into the make up world...the pallete isn&#x27;t highly pigmented AT ALL...the only color that i use in this pallete is the black one THAT&#x27;S IT...i called myself trying to go cheaper (i usually use becca, mac, bobbi brown, sometimes Dior) than what i&#x27;m used to buying and the reviews where good but i guess the people that wrote the reviews where non factors in the makeup world or teens (no pun intended) anyhow i this pallete is now a dust collector.</li>
            <li> when I was buying this, I wasn&#x27;t so sure that if all of the eye shadows would come unbroken. As expected when it arrived in the mail, some eye shadows came broken. The colors are good overall, easy to use, and luckily the two eye shadows that came broken are the ones that I probably wouldn&#x27;t be using in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had a multitude of colors for such a cheap price. While the shadows may be small, they are nicely pigmented and when used with a primer they are great. Very good for the money conscious make-up lover or colorful college student.</li>
            <li> I love how the colors are picked up perfectly with just a touch of primer, underneath! The product doesn&#x27;t clump and stays put for HOURS!</li>
            <li> one of the eye shadows came broken. it was one I would have used  too. maybe package more carefully for other customer!</li>
            <li> For the price, these are excellent eye colors. They arrived in good condition and they have lasted a long time. I appreciate the variety without many crazy colors.</li>
            <li> I got these eye shadows in to give as a gift, but when I saw them I kept them for myself!!! Great colors, and the powder shadows go on very nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these colors, which are all in the mocha, cream, pink, brown family. The only draw back is it doesn&#x27;t fit in my make up bag. I like the low price and good quality eye shadows.</li>
            <li> i love this product it did not come cracked i think the pigmentation is wonderful . OMG i just LOVE IT !! colors are perfect and warm .</li>
            <li> The colors are very nice and pigmented. I find the black the nicest, even though I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some shades are shimmery, but once applied it seems it disappears, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blue eyes, so carefully putting together a few brownish shades just make my eyes pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will repurchase and reccomend.</li>
            <li> There was only one review when I brought this product, so I was nervous about ordering it. But I&#x27;m glad I did! Great pigment and great for Asian hooded eyes. (Like my eyes). And it came 10 DAYS EARLY than expected. Pretty good considering it was shipped from half way around the world! To top it all off, it was less than $10!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great everyday palette! I love the colors witch are super pigmented and easy to bland making it  easy to go from day to night makeup!  Only con is that the packaging is a little on the cheap side so be carful not to drop it. hope you like it as much as I do:)</li>
            <li> I just revieved this product in the mail. I was so excited when I got the product because the reviews were pretty good. I opened the package to find eyeshadow all over the box. I proceed to open the actual eyeshadow palette to find loose eyeshadow everywhere. I also found about 6 of the eyeshadows broken. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> The product quality is good.  Great for the price if your looking for a bargain! I received the product on time unfortunately the product was not the 28 colors and was broken. I had emailed the seller and got a prompt, polite reply with their apologies about the mix up. They refunded my money and told me I could keep what I had received! I will definitely buy from them again as we&#x27;ll as recommend! Again,  great product and great people behind the scenes and best priced!</li>
            <li> None of the eyeshadows cracked.. It was absolutely everythingggg! I think my aunt will love it as a gift. Great buy!</li>
            <li> The case is terribly flimsy and it arrived with brown eyeshadow caked all over it. I had to wipe it down with makeup remover wipes before I could even open the damn thing! I know that probably happened during shipping... But it was not packaged well. The shadows themselves are ok. Good variety of color but not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I received my product completely damaged I am truly disappointed. My friend just ordered this a couple of weeks ago and same thing happened to her. They don&#x27;t secure the packaging if its being shipped to the U.S. I was really excited about this pallet and I can&#x27;t even enjoy it now. Bummer</li>
            <li> I received it and only one of the colors was kind of crushed, not o bad for how it was packaged (one piece of bubble wrap inside the compact, stuffed in a regular FedEx packing bag) there are a lot of matte colors, which I LOVE, but you do really have to work to pack the colors in. Over all, not to bad just wish it was easier to apply colors.</li>
            <li> It feels so sheap Not what I expected sorry :( the case feels really breakable &amp; the pigment nuff said</li>
            <li> So many colors to choose from!! I&#x27;m having fun doing my eye shadows again! I highly recommend this palette. Great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love warm colors and it was perfect, i will be buying on for my niece</li>
            <li> I love this palette but I received it with colors missing and broke up, thank God it was colors I didnt need.</li>
            <li> Had this pallet for about a year now and all I can say is great quality! I loved it so much I showed my boyfriends cousins and 4 of them actually ordered a pallets for themselves !</li>
            <li> This product is not good. It was a waste of my money. The colors go on SO LIGHT , it looks like I don&#x27;t have any on. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> This product is not pigmented at all. Even with an eyelid primer the colors don&#x27;t really shine through. The only good thing about this pallet was the dark colors. I don&#x27;t suggest wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li> Some color are not that great in terms of pigmentation</li>
            <li> I got the palette and I love the colors but not all of them are THAT pigmented. Some are better and some are just.. bad.&lt;br /&gt;It came a bit dusty and one of the eyeshadows seemed to be used before.&lt;br /&gt;So I emailed the seller and he kindly offered me a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great costumer service. The palette- not that great BUT it&#x27;s AMAZING FOR THE PRICE!</li>
            <li> Great product the colors are rich and vibrant i would recommend to a friend for sure. you do not need primer</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. I got it before or on the day it said I would receive and no eyeshadows were broken. They&#x27;re sooooo pigmented (except the light light colors because it&#x27;s really hard to have pigmented beiges and whites). I am in love with this palette and would buy again. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it. :-)</li>
            <li> This is just as good as M.A.C. the only thing about this seller is that it takes a month for it to arrive. They do package it really well. But the eye shadow it not bad.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Came late but it works perfect !</li>
            <li> Awesome colors!! I thought I would receive it damaged but they came fast and not damaged at all!!!</li>
