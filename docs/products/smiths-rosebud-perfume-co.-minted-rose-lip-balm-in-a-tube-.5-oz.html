            <li>I was hoping for the best balm ever, but it was a lot like all the others, ok.  </li>
            <li>This is good for on the go.</li>
            <li>It is basically petroleum, which is good for your lips, so you may like it if the peppermint flavor does not bother you.</li>
            <li>I do have to reapply plenty, but works good.</li>
            <li>The mint is pleasant, the lip balm feels nice to wear, and it lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely almost like a lip butter and has a nice rose tint shade on the lips.</li>
            <li>Great lip balm been using for years, glad it&#x27;s in a tube, though I wish Sephora carried this version of the product.</li>

            <li>This stuff feels amazing and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>So handy to have.</li>
            <li>The description and image of the item is, after all, &amp;#34;Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Perfume Co. Minted Rose Lip Balm in a TUBE.&amp;#34; Not what I recieved.</li>
            <li>All in all a nice purchasing experience.</li>
            <li>I had about given up when I discovered Smith&#x27;s Minted Rose.  </li>
            <li>Cooling on the lips, rose water smell, very light, doesn&#x27;t wear sticky.</li>
            <li>i love my rosebud minted rose balm.  </li>
            <li>and you do get more product in that</li>
            <li>Its smooth and after exfoliating with a lip scrub it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips moist most of the night.</li>
            <li>Not greasy or waxy - just smooth &amp; kissable!</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does it job with keeping my lips moisturized &amp; healthy</li>
            <li>Leaves my lips smooth even in the coldest of winters.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, but wears off, and has not improved the softness of my lips as the colder weather is here.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of, Smooth and Minty&#x27;s petite mint chips that I always had around the holidays when I was in grade school..  </li>
            <li>, you will enjoy this.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the tube original one either.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely one of my favorite lip balms and was so excited to see it in a squeezable tube.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about product.</li>
            <li>The idea is good, but the peppermint flavor actually stings on your lips.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey for lip balm but its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It still keeps my lips soft so, overall, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>- you&#x27;ll feel the sensation right away.</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this stuff- for the first time in my life, i can wear lipstick without it drying out my lips.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>I use it all the  very often.............</li>
            <li>but this is so much easier to handle.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this lip balm.</li>
            <li>Now my lips look and feel soft and normal.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it seems like the scent of the mint in this form is not as strong as the original.  </li>
            <li>It makes your lips so soft.</li>
            <li>I have an entire ziplock bag full of partially used lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for it</li>
            <li>This is the only way I could get my hands on this balm in a tube, and it was only available as an add-on, but luckily I had a few other things to purchase as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with this product, and was looking forward to receiving the tube version, so I don&#x27;t have to dip my finger in the usual metal pot.</li>
            <li>and the next morning- helllooo soft lips!</li>
            <li>I usually use the one I have in a tin at night because my hands are clean but now I can use the tube wherever I go</li>
            <li>With other brands, my lips dry out quickly unless I use them quite often throughout the day.  </li>

            <li> The best lip balm on the planet. I&#x27;ve used the one in the metal tin and you do get more product in that but I like this one because I dont have to stick my finger in the tin. This is good for on the go. It is a bit pricey for lip balm but its worth every penny. Its smooth and after exfoliating with a lip scrub it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It is the best of the collection!</li>
            <li> i love my rosebud minted rose balm.  i have always carried it in the little tin but when i found out i could get it in a tube, i had to give it a go. same exact stuff, just less messy and less germy.  i highly recommend this stuff- for the first time in my life, i can wear lipstick without it drying out my lips.</li>
            <li> Yes! Finally smith&#x27;s lip balm in a tube. This is my favorite lip balm. It makes your lips so soft. I usually use the one I have in a tin at night because my hands are clean but now I can use the tube wherever I go so I bought 2 one for my purse and one for my backpack. So handy to have. The shipping was really fast. I got it in 2 days after purchase.</li>
            <li> This product lasts all night.  I use the tin container for years now and have wanted to carry it in my purse.  I have looked high and low for it and so grateful to have found it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this lip balm. I use it at night before turning out the lights. Keeps my lips moist most of the night. Refresh when I wake up, then lasts till morning. Leaves my lips smooth even in the coldest of winters. The mint instantly &#x27;cools&#x27; your lips - you&#x27;ll feel the sensation right away. Totally recommend if you tend to get chapped lips in cold weather - Smith&#x27;s will smooth them out immediately. Not greasy or waxy - just smooth &amp; kissable!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t&#x27; see all the excitement sadly about this lip balm.  I was hoping for the best balm ever, but it was a lot like all the others, ok.  It goes on smooth, but wears off, and has not improved the softness of my lips as the colder weather is here.  Bummed.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels amazing and smells amazing. My lips usually peel, but this solved that problem within a day. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used.  Love the way it feels.

            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the tube original one either. I tend to favor mint lip balms. I like the minty smell and feel. This just felt like slippery petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> The idea is good, but the peppermint flavor actually stings on your lips.  It is basically petroleum, which is good for your lips, so you may like it if the peppermint flavor does not bother you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar with this product, and was looking forward to receiving the tube version, so I don&#x27;t have to dip my finger in the usual metal pot.

            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of Smith&#x27;s Rosebud lip balm!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: moisturizes well and I don&#x27;t mind the smell (in fact, I like the mintiness!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it makes your lips shiny (but that&#x27;s the cost you pay to have a protective lip balm, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to wear it overnight and the next morning- helllooo soft lips!</li>
            <li> Perfect : nice pretty packaging . Does it job with keeping my lips moisturized &amp; healthy looking ☺️. Plus if you like minty scents this item is for you ! 👍🏻</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of my favorite lip balms and was so excited to see it in a squeezable tube.  Unfortunately, it seems like the scent of the mint in this form is not as strong as the original.  It still keeps my lips soft so, overall, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This arrived in a timely nature. I purchased 6 of the salves in tube form and this is one of my favourites (preceding the Eucalyptus Menthol one and Brambleberry). It you like peppermint salves with a slight floral note, you will enjoy this. It is as moisturizing as one would expect a petroleum based salve to be. All in all a nice purchasing experience.</li>
            <li> petroleum based product.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm been using for years, glad it&#x27;s in a tube, though I wish Sephora carried this version of the product.</li>
            <li> saw this on Southern Living&lt;br /&gt;Thought i would like it, its glorified petroleum jelly in a lip tube.... with scent&lt;br /&gt;not so moisturizing , but it works</li>
            <li> Love Smith&#x27;s Rosebud glosses!</li>
            <li> The mint is pleasant, the lip balm feels nice to wear, and it lasts quite a while.  I would recommend this as a glossy lip balm.</li>
            <li> I like the product, works great. I do have to reapply plenty, but works good. Still not THE ONE, though...still searching.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used them all.  Desperate to find something that would stop the papery peeling of my lips at all seasons of the year I tried everything.  I have an entire ziplock bag full of partially used lip balm.  Everything from a couple of dollars to twenty and thirty dollars.  I had about given up when I discovered Smith&#x27;s Minted Rose.  This stuff is wonderful.  It feels luscious, smells nice, and best of all it works!  I no longer worry my peeling lips by picking at them because they are not peeling like they were.  Now my lips look and feel soft and normal.  This lip balm is just the best.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for addicting Carmex! I use it all the  very often.............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you just let me put the amount of words I want!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of lip gloss!!!</li>
            <li> It is great! Cooling on the lips, rose water smell, very light, doesn&#x27;t wear sticky. Love it!</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the small tin can of smiths rosebud salve but this is so much easier to handle. Goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t sticky. Keeps my lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the only way I could get my hands on this balm in a tube, and it was only available as an add-on, but luckily I had a few other things to purchase as well.</li>
