            <li>I like the color and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>This is the best nude color I&#x27;ve yet to find!</li>
            <li>Matches my skin tone almost perfectly</li>
            <li>Sensationail products are great!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the color and quality.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use!</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The polish quality is good.</li>
            <li>Love love love this color!!!!</li>
            <li>I will say the product is cheap and it went on great.</li>
            <li>but I still liked it.</li>
            <li>but I still liked the shade</li>
            <li>If your looking for a nice neutral get something else.</li>
            <li>I love the sensational gel polishes.</li>
            <li>Both are nice, but I was hoping for something closer to the nude shade, so I&#x27;ll most often be using one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, unobtrusive nude shade if you use one coat and more of a brown if you use two coats.</li>
            <li>Love this color although it does not look like the photo on the box.</li>
            <li>More like a gray-beige.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay on my fingers more than a day.</li>
            <li>DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO SPEND MORE ON RETURNING..</li>
            <li>I found that if I put on one coat, the polish is semi-translucent and appears to be a lovely peachy nude, whereas if I use two coats, it turns out to be an opaque \\&quot;greige\\&quot; (</li>
            <li>Elegant color that is a statement of understated, glossy class on my fingernails.</li>
            <li>This color is actually more gray than taupe.  </li>
            <li>the Taupe Tulip is more faded gray sweatshirt.  </li>
            <li>I got many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>so i can easily get 3 weeks out of a manicure.</li>
            <li>A BEAUTIFUL TAUPE COLOR THAT IS NOT IN THESE  TINY .25OZ BOTTLES.</li>
            <li>Be sure to cure under the light fairly quickly, so that the polish doesn&#x27;t pool around the edges of the nail and make it prone to peeling.</li>
            <li>Fabulous color.</li>
            <li>I ended up using more dry time under the lamps but it turned it good after they set.</li>
            <li>Manicures are easy (challenge to remove previous polish... still working on that, LOL).Results are beautiful, and my kit has paid for itself as I&#x27;m on my 3rd beautiful manicure and my nails are strong, long, and healthy!</li>
            <li>I Have other polishes by sensationail, and they usually have good staying power and good  coverage, but this one wasn&#x27;t great on either.</li>
            <li>I use the special gel remover and soak cotton balls and wrap with foil.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I love SensatioNail Gel polishes because of their high sheen and the quick drying method.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S REALLY WORTH</li>
            <li>It peals right off.</li>
            <li>I was nice in my 3 stars because of price, application and wear time, but not worth it when there are tons of other brands of gel out there that are just as cheap, easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li>the color is more white than show on the pic.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>ONLY $7.99 AND more</li>
            <li>fast shipper!</li>
            <li>I have used Taupe Tulips previously and liked the shade.</li>
            <li>I have experienced some peeling and chipping, but it is minimal and probably partially because I pick at my nails</li>
            <li>VERY DECEPTIVE TO SELL WITHOUT NOTING  OR IMPLYING SOMETHING TO COLOR</li>
            <li>REAL TAUPE NAIL GEL POLISH @</li>
            <li>Stays on for two weeks very glossy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once, but don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll really use it again.</li>
            <li>Hope to do business again, thanks again.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>I think it is lighter in real life than the picture shows.</li>
            <li>If you are very tan this might be the color for you.</li>
            <li>with many light colored polishes, this one does tend to streak a little, but if you let it settle on your nails and do minimal touch-up with the brush, you can get a pretty uniform color.</li>
            <li>Love the color..lasted about a week and a half..</li>
            <li>The color is not as vibrant as the box</li>
            <li>IS NOTHING MORE THAN PALE GRAY.</li>
            <li>I wasnt satisfied with the color for I expected to be different.</li>
            <li>particular color is NOT pink like the color shown in the picture, but is rather, as the name suggests, a taupe.</li>
            <li>very simple and professional!</li>

            <li> First the picture product is wrong.  </li>
            <li> Just takes a little while to actually dry.</li>

            <li> I have used other gel polishes, like IBD, Gelish and Red Carpet and this was by far the worst to take off.</li>
            <li> and I had to scrap and file my actually surface nail which made them thin and weak.</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t need to use so much primer; use primer only on the cuticle area and at the tips to minimize peeling, otherwise you will have a terrible time getting this (or any gel nail polish) off without damaging your nails.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> course, this polish has to be used with a curing lamp, so don&#x27;t buy it unless you have a gel polish starter kit or at least a gel curing lamp.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say I will never use this brand again.</li>

            <li> A great polish! Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is the best nude color I&#x27;ve yet to find!</li>
            <li> The color is not as vibrant as the box but I still liked it. However, I have used it twice now and both times it has chipped and peeled up in a week. I&#x27;ve used 3 other colors with absolutely no problem, it&#x27;s just this one that I keep having trouble with.</li>
            <li> Love this color although it does not look like the photo on the box. Previous reviewers have mentioned this... More like a gray-beige. Similar to the OPI color &amp;#34;did you ear&#x27; about Van Gogh&amp;#34; If you happen to have that. I love the sensational gel polishes. Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> the color is more white than show on the pic. I wasnt satisfied with the color for I expected to be different.</li>
            <li> Good product. Just takes a little while to actually dry. I ended up using more dry time under the lamps but it turned it good after they set.</li>
            <li> Fabulous color. Matches my skin tone almost perfectly so i can easily get 3 weeks out of a manicure. Sensationail products are great! I&#x27;ve been wearing gels for about a year now, and recently bought the starter kit from this company with this as my extra color. I&#x27;m hooked. Manicures are easy (challenge to remove previous polish... still working on that, LOL).Results are beautiful, and my kit has paid for itself as I&#x27;m on my 3rd beautiful manicure and my nails are strong, long, and healthy!</li>
            <li> Good product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on my fingers more than a day. I don&#x27;t need nail polish remover. It peals right off.</li>
            <li> I bought the Purple Orchid color. I will say the product is cheap and it went on great. It also lasted 2 weeks with no chips, but I could not get this brand of gel off to save my life. I have used other gel polishes, like IBD, Gelish and Red Carpet and this was by far the worst to take off. The others I have used were simple to take off. I use the special gel remover and soak cotton balls and wrap with foil. I never have a problem with removal with the other brands. I am sorry to say I will never use this brand again. It ruined my nails and I had to scrap and file my actually surface nail which made them thin and weak. I was nice in my 3 stars because of price, application and wear time, but not worth it when there are tons of other brands of gel out there that are just as cheap, easy on and easy off.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. TAUPE TULIP... IS NOTHING MORE THAN PALE GRAY. NOT AS SEEN ON BOX AT ALL. VERY DECEPTIVE TO SELL WITHOUT NOTING  OR IMPLYING SOMETHING TO COLOR AFFECT ON DESCRIPTION.  I  DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO SPEND MORE ON RETURNING.. I PURRCHASED FROM  &#x27;STEVENGKINGSPORT&amp;#34;  SELLER DOESN&#x27;T PROVIDE COMPENSATION FOR RETURNING. CUSTOMER MUST PAY AGAIN...LACKS LOYALTY WITHIN THIS COMPANY SO I&#x27;M STUCK WITH 2 SLATE GRAY POLISHES ...NOT CHEAP. THE BOX DISPLAYS A BEAUTIFUL TAUPE COLOR THAT IS NOT IN THESE  TINY .25OZ BOTTLES. SEVERAL COMPLAINTS IN REVIEWS IN REFERENCE  TO COLOR ISSUES....REAL TAUPE NAIL GEL POLISH @ WALGREENS...ONLY $7.99 AND more CONTENTS  .. IT&#x27;S REALLY WORTH IT TO GET WHAT  YOU WANT &amp; WHAT YOU&#x27;RE PAYING FOR....HONESTLY..</li>
            <li> Stays on for two weeks very glossy</li>
            <li> I love SensatioNail Gel polishes because of their high sheen and the quick drying method. I always smudge with regular polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular color is NOT pink like the color shown in the picture, but is rather, as the name suggests, a taupe. I found that if I put on one coat, the polish is semi-translucent and appears to be a lovely peachy nude, whereas if I use two coats, it turns out to be an opaque \\&quot;greige\\&quot; (gray-beige) color. Both are nice, but I was hoping for something closer to the nude shade, so I&#x27;ll most often be using one coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with many light colored polishes, this one does tend to streak a little, but if you let it settle on your nails and do minimal touch-up with the brush, you can get a pretty uniform color. Be sure to cure under the light fairly quickly, so that the polish doesn&#x27;t pool around the edges of the nail and make it prone to peeling. I have experienced some peeling and chipping, but it is minimal and probably partially because I pick at my nails sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this polish has to be used with a curing lamp, so don&#x27;t buy it unless you have a gel polish starter kit or at least a gel curing lamp. I like to use it with the SensatioNail primer, and clear base and top coat that come in the starter kit.</li>
            <li> Elegant color that is a statement of understated, glossy class on my fingernails.</li>
            <li> very simple and professional!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the color and quality. I Have other polishes by sensationail, and they usually have good staying power and good  coverage, but this one wasn&#x27;t great on either. I&#x27;ve used it once, but don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll really use it again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this color!!!!</li>
            <li> Product was a different color than box, exchanged with no problem. Hope to do business again, thanks again. fast shipper!</li>
            <li> The polish quality is good. The color on my nails sort of resembles a nail fungus though so I don&#x27;t really care for it. I think it is lighter in real life than the picture shows. If you are very tan this might be the color for you.</li>
            <li> Love the color..lasted about a week and a half..but I&#x27;m hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> Color not the same as pic but I still liked the shade</li>
            <li> This color is actually more gray than taupe.  Like not taupe at all.  Just gray.</li>
            <li> First the picture product is wrong.  Second the Taupe Tulip is more faded gray sweatshirt.  If your looking for a nice neutral get something else.</li>
            <li> I have used Taupe Tulips previously and liked the shade. I got many compliments on it. It&#x27;s a nice, unobtrusive nude shade if you use one coat and more of a brown if you use two coats. I had no difficulty in removing it because I used the foil soak-off method the manufacturer recommends. Also, you don&#x27;t need to use so much primer; use primer only on the cuticle area and at the tips to minimize peeling, otherwise you will have a terrible time getting this (or any gel nail polish) off without damaging your nails.</li>
