            <li>and yep... well done Paris :)</li>
            <li>absolutely love woodsy scents.</li>
            <li>And it is quite strong.</li>
            <li>strong , dont need much but smells nice</li>
            <li>This scent is &#x27;clean&#x27; &amp; almost smells like a cheap air-freshner.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick with her original perfume</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not an original perfume&lt;br /&gt;Expected to have original product</li>
            <li>I love the design of the bottle, its very feminine.</li>
            <li>I never use it anymore, and it&#x27;s nearly full.</li>
            <li>im a picky individual when it comes to perfumes and certain smells, but this one is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different and smells like it could be for someone older but in a good way.</li>
            <li>Well this particular perfume was not my favorite, for a musky smelling perfume, its decent.</li>
            <li>It smells almost like Gucci \\&quot;Envy\\&quot; &amp; Sarah Jessica Parker \\&quot;Covet\\&quot; mixed together with a very cheap, old fragrance.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smell very good,awsome</li>
            <li>The price is also very affordable.</li>
            <li>Its not really for me, but If you like the sound of it, just give it a try!</li>
            <li>Yes I would recommend this scent  Thanks again.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>i love putting it on everyday</li>
            <li>The company also shipped the order on time, and with the order I received free samples of other items.</li>
            <li>Smells very old lady-ish.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a second perfume I tried from Paris Hilton (first one was tease)  </li>
            <li>The only positive that came out of this is now I don&#x27;t have to go birthday shopping for my grandma.</li>
            <li>I know she is in the news , but over look that and give fairy dust a try you will not be disappointed I love it!!!</li>
            <li>Its sad to say that I diddnt like it as much as I thought I would, because the box an packaging is absolutely gorgeous!!!!!!Picture does not do justice!:)</li>
            <li>Paris hilton- Fairy has a light and woody aroma, with a little musk.  </li>
            <li>like old ladies</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife who&#x27;s 30 yrs old.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like my 75 year old grandma.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, I got an old batch of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s a perfume for old ladies, not an 18 year old.</li>
            <li>Of course it starts to die down after a bit , but not as fast as a lot of others!  </li>
            <li>Way too strong not good</li>

            <li> I was not expected to have a fake product&lt;</li>
            <li> It smells awful, the scent is wayyy to strong and smells like something a granny would wear.</li>
            <li> It has a horrid musky floral smell that made my wife nauseated.  </li>
            <li> It smells expensive to me.</li>
            <li> This perfume stinks....</li>
            <li> This fragrance smelled musty and generally bad like bad breath--yuk.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> im a picky individual when it comes to perfumes and certain smells, but this one is amazing! i love putting it on everyday, my fiance just cant stop smelling me and cuddling with me! it smells soooooooooooo GOOD!!</li>
            <li> Order came on time as scheduled. I like  the  product and  would  recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it has great fragrance. I love the design of the bottle, its very feminine. its great gift to give to a woman.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells so amazing. I&#x27;m buying again in a bigger bottle next time. The smell stays on me all day along at work. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> great product. fast delivery. very good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This scent is &#x27;clean&#x27; &amp; almost smells like a cheap air-freshner. I smell a lot of musk &amp; pachouli. Its more on the floral side. A lot of people say it smells like something your grandma would wear &amp; I agree. It smells almost like Gucci \\&quot;Envy\\&quot; &amp; Sarah Jessica Parker \\&quot;Covet\\&quot; mixed together with a very cheap, old fragrance. This perfume smells very cheap. I notice this perfume is either a hit or miss for most people. Not the best or the very worst. But I won&#x27;t be repurchasing it. Also, this perfume lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Were given as a gift to family member.</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s smell very good,awsome</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely wonderful !</li>
            <li> Dont like the scent and its still sitting on the counter in the box. I think I&#x27;ll stick with her original perfume</li>
            <li> not so long lasting smell but still I liked it</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and lingers all throughout the day. The price is also very affordable. The company also shipped the order on time, and with the order I received free samples of other items. Will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> got this for my niece..she likes it a lot. its especially great for teenage girls, the brand and all works great for them</li>
            <li> .I just recieved this today.I noticed people have mixed feelings on it.People seem to say its either a younger scent,or they say its typical &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;.Im 23 an I feel like its defiantly a &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; smell.On me, its verry floral, musky,woodsey, but still fresh,and has little to no sweetnees. Its not really for me, but If you like the sound of it, just give it a try! It doesn&#x27;t disappoint. On the positives, its great quality! A little goes a long way.And it is quite strong.Of course it starts to die down after a bit , but not as fast as a lot of others!  It&#x27;s well worth the price! Its sad to say that I diddnt like it as much as I thought I would, because the box an packaging is absolutely gorgeous!!!!!!Picture does not do justice!:)</li>
            <li> Way too strong not good gives me headache</li>
            <li> I love the scent. I have brought a few colognes from Paris as we&#x27;ll for my boyfriend.  Yes I would recommend this scent  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my foster daughter as one of her  wedding present. My wife uses it and she always calls it by name everytime she smells it. So we got her one of her own..</li>
            <li> I just have to say that the perfume smells so lady like. I know she is in the news , but over look that and give fairy dust a try you will not be disappointed I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume stinks....like old ladies</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and the price was great! I will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Paris hilton- Fairy has a light and woody aroma, with a little musk.  Well this particular perfume was not my favorite, for a musky smelling perfume, its decent.</li>
            <li> I was not expected to have a fake product&lt;br /&gt;It was not an original perfume&lt;br /&gt;Expected to have original product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who&#x27;s 30 yrs old. Since it is made by Paris Hilton (same age) I figured that it would be great. My wife has her Heiress perfume and it&#x27;s wonderful. This Fairy Dust stuff is nothing like the Heiress one...and I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way. This stuff smells like my 75 year old grandma. It has a horrid musky floral smell that made my wife nauseated.  The worst part is that even after only one use we weren&#x27;t able to return it due to perfume&#x27;s flammable nature. So now I have perfume my wife will not wear (nor would I allow her to). The only positive that came out of this is now I don&#x27;t have to go birthday shopping for my grandma.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> My bf got me this for Christmas because I had always wanted to try it. I was extremely disappointed with it. It smells awful, the scent is wayyy to strong and smells like something a granny would wear. Avoid this one.</li>
            <li> I honestly love the smell. It&#x27;s different and smells like it could be for someone older but in a good way. It smells expensive to me.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smelled musty and generally bad like bad breath--yuk.  Perhaps, I got an old batch of this stuff.  The reviews are great.  However, I just want to toss this one or give it away?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter! She loves it. The box is beautiful and she loves the Disney Fairies so this went well with that theme, no offense to Paris. It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Smells very old lady-ish. Kind of powdery, I wish I would&#x27;ve smelled it in a store instead of going by reviews.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, Its one of the best perfumes of Paris Hilton and I always keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Love this. It&#x27;s my second bottle. Awesome deal. And when it arrived there were some sample perfumes which were all great and a chapstick and coupons.  So happy I didn&#x27;t expect all that .</li>
            <li> I bought it simply on a whim. It seems like it&#x27;s a perfume for old ladies, not an 18 year old. I never use it anymore, and it&#x27;s nearly full. I&#x27;m giving it away actually. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> Love d smell&lt;br /&gt;Of this perfume</li>
            <li> strong , dont need much but smells nice</li>
            <li> I bought two as presents and it smells OK - for the price I paid it&#x27;s a nice gift, it&#x27;s a second perfume I tried from Paris Hilton (first one was tease)  and yep... well done Paris :)&lt;br /&gt;Nice, floral scent. can be used from spring to summer...</li>
            <li> Twice I have ordered this. absolutely love woodsy scents.</li>
