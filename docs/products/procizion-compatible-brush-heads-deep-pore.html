            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I purchased these brushes during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>I was given the offer to try these brush heads at a discount rate for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li>It feels as nice on my face as the Clarisonic head.  </li>
            <li>What I am about to write is a testament how nicely Procizion handled a shipping mishap that happened to me.</li>
            <li>After trying these replacement brush heads today, I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t notice any difference between these and the originals.</li>
            <li>Excellent, thanks for the speedy shiment.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, fast shipping (Amazon prime UPS)</li>
            <li>tried a lot of replacements head for my Clarisonic Mia, in all prices range : these are not the cheaper, but they sure are the very best I tried, and to me these one really worth</li>
            <li>Kind of a shame since I liked the quality of the brush itself.</li>
            <li>, I honestly cannot tell any difference in quality.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the name brand and much much more affordable.</li>
            <li>The difference between the two is astounding.  </li>
            <li>These brushes fit perfectly and are full and sift.</li>
            <li>I love the brushheads! :)</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly on my Mia 2, clicked right in.</li>
            <li>This is a great product line, and am enjoying using these to get really clean skin.  </li>
            <li>But with these brushes, my skin has cleared up and had the most amazing texture.</li>
            <li>Good  substitute for original Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as good as the original Clarisonic brush, but you get what you pay.</li>
            <li>Great value and works really well!</li>
            <li>I bought these instead of the higher priced brushes and these are way better!!</li>
            <li>Works great, skin feels smooth and fresh after use.</li>
            <li>ok I guess for the money.  </li>
            <li>this is surely one of those products.</li>
            <li>Wish had more bushels on brush head..</li>
            <li>After two months of using this brush, I had more blackheads, cystic acne and whiteheads than before.  </li>
            <li>the better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this choice in purchasing it.</li>
            <li>and they are more affordable, so</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for sure :)</li>
            <li>I have been using the Clarisonic Mia 2 for about 3 years now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the price and quality of this.</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the cleaning heads.  </li>
            <li>The cost is wonderful compared to getting the actual clarisonic ones</li>
            <li>As I was debating if I want to order from Procizion again I received email from Procizion asking the reason for requesting refund and if they can do anything to make my experience better.</li>
            <li>the quality of the product and customer service made me a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the deeper cleansing motion of these pads.</li>
            <li>Thry work better thsn my name brand heads and cost 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t quite confident in the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am using these with my mother&#x27;s Clarisonic and I love it.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>Better price,</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Before spending the money for the brand name brush heads I found these, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>These brush heads have gotten rid of most of my blackheads, and as a result, my complexion is smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this brand.</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>Even if the name brand were slightly better</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes feel more substantial and seem to work better than the originals.</li>
            <li>This in itself was a life saver because I didn&#x27;t want to get stuck with more unusable brush heads.</li>
            <li>Glad I found a cheap replacement!</li>
            <li>This brush is more of a hum, with no movement of the brush to speak of.  </li>
            <li>Their customer service was outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>The price is certainly better than for the original replacement brush heads!</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise I found that these brushes are AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Just like the original at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>When my Grandma gave me a Clarisonic Mia 2 for Christmas, I was so excited!</li>
            <li>I was able to easily twist these heads onto the device.</li>
            <li>These feel the same as the clairsonic brush heads and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>These brush heads fit my Mia 2 perfectly, although one of them did not seem to be working properly.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and the bristles are just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>so far I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li>Well made, on time shipping, very good product I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>and I was too scared to buy knock offs because I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would fit.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel like they do as good a job.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was too good to be true, but I love this brush head.  </li>
            <li>These work wonderfully for half the cost :)</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit softer than the Clarisonic ones, but the cleaning effect is exactly the same...and a much better price!</li>
            <li>Such a good deal!</li>
            <li>it is ok but not what the original one is.</li>
            <li>but they say these are actually better than the original cartridge that came with the device.  </li>
            <li>These are better than the original ones that came with the unit.  </li>
            <li>They were softer and come off easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than buying the Clarisonic brand, fits my Clarisonic easily and after about 4 weeks of use</li>
            <li>I received the brush heads very quickly and compared them to the Groupon brush heads.</li>
            <li>They fit perfect, the center part oscillates just like the Clarisonic brand brushes.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical b.c these are cheaper than the Clarisonic brand, but they fit my Clarisonic device perfectly and seem to work great.</li>
            <li>Works very well - as good as the original.</li>
            <li>They fit my Clarisonic better than the original brush heads.</li>
            <li>The heads seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>and they are exactly as described, but they followed up with an email to make sure I had received them and was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have the Mia 2, and they work with it just fine.</li>
            <li>It fit on there</li>
            <li>They &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; in the sense that they attach, but they do not spin like genuine clarisonic brush heads.  </li>
            <li>These are great alternative replacement brushes for my Clarisonic facial cleaning system.</li>
            <li>It fit and rotated</li>
            <li>Received the heads today and my skin is glowing and flake free.</li>
            <li>They fit snugly on head &amp; get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Cheap design.</li>
            <li>It did fit my brush</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>They fit .  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>They look the same as the intended brand name replacements and seem to work just as great.</li>
            <li>When I attached it to my Mia clarisonic, it just made a buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Why would anyone pay 44.00 for a brush replacement when you can get such a great deal?</li>
            <li>Price is fabulous, and I cannot tell a difference between the Sonic brush and these.</li>
            <li>Great replacement heads for my Clarisonic facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>They arrived in a timely manner and I am so glad I found them because they are such a good price as compare to the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good choice to replace your old clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>They fit just like the original.</li>
            <li>I am more then happy with these brush heads, they work exactly like the brand name ones with the exception that they are a little bit softer which is fine with me :).</li>
            <li>Awesome dupe for the real thing - long overdue!</li>
            <li>These fit great and are nearly identical to the ones by Clairisonic but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>my Mia 2 just like the original Clarisonic brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works just like the original as well, my face feels cleaner than ever</li>
            <li>my original Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t shed any bristles.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I found what looked like a comparable brush head for my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Seems like the original.</li>
            <li>I love these more than the caledonia brushes, they are so soft but still get the job done!</li>
            <li>I had to order the original brushes.</li>
            <li>Fits my Mia 2 and works just like the original brush head.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>My original brushes are still stiffer than these are.</li>
            <li>I removed an original Clairsonic brush and installed this one.  </li>
            <li>face felt amount of clean as the original brush would</li>
            <li>I am such a surprised and happy consumer!</li>
            <li>I put them in the dishwasher to clean them.  </li>
            <li>They leave my skin feeling clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>They are just soft enough and work perfectly with my Clarisonic Aria.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found a far more affordable alternative!</li>
            <li>Fit is good and performs similar to others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I went with it after reading so many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I really like this brush more than the original I got with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>As many people wrote these fit the machine and feel good for a lot less.</li>
            <li>It is a really pleasant surprise when a generic is better than the original, high priced item.</li>
            <li>A third of the cost of the name brand ones, yet works just as good.</li>
            <li>but these are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>such a good deal compared to the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li>I buy brush heads for delicate skin and these were perfect.</li>
            <li>Returned the item for full refund without a problem.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are much softer than the bristles on the authentic brushes.</li>
            <li>After repeatedly attempting to get the brush head to oscillate, I gave up and began searching here for a true replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>They fit just fine, but doesn&#x27;t seem to vibrate/rotate as much as with the original clairsonic brush heads.</li>
            <li>This brush is nice and soft and my face feels great after I use it unlike the other replacement brushes I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This brush works great and actually feels much nicer on my skin.</li>
            <li>Sure enough I ordered from them again and love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t see &amp; feel any different from original......</li>
            <li>The bristles held up beautifully and did not leave any harsh abrasion feeling when I completed the cleansing.</li>
            <li>I clean it often with warm soapy water and alcohol, but as soon as I saw it again with the second one, I threw it out.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Clarisonic Refreshing Foaming Gel as well as an off brand cleanser I got at my local grocery store and my skin has been so clean since I&#x27;ve bought it!</li>
            <li>Happy with this purchase, two brushes for less than the cost of one of the Clarisonic brand replacement brush.</li>
            <li>Works just as great as the Clarisonic ones for half the price.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectily and are holding up very well.</li>
            <li>There is no wobbling or unusual sound.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok although it doesn&#x27;t soft as i think it is.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the additional money to get heads that work.</li>
            <li>but it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my Clairsonic for a few years now and these by far are the best replacement heads for the money.</li>
            <li>wanted the brush heads to be alright considering the price, but they just aren&#x27;t worth the sacrifice.</li>
            <li>A lot softer than the Clarisonic replacement heads but for the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it,</li>
            <li>I bought the sensitive ones instead, and they seem better.</li>
            <li>Compatible as far as fitting onto the machine</li>
            <li>If your brush head does not oscillate, be sure to apply light pressure on the middle portion of the brush head.</li>
            <li>There are compatible and worth the price.</li>
            <li>The bristles felt perfect and were not too stiff or too soft.  </li>
            <li>I went through the two \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush heads that came with my Clarisonic Mia 2, and while that did clean better than my CVS brush, it still wasn&#x27;t enough to get rid of the blackheads I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find an inexpensive replacement head, but they went straight into the trash can.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for the past 2 days and so far it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and break out very easy and was concerned this might bring up some unwanted pimples, but none so far!</li>
            <li>When I first started using the Clairsonic, it was so powerful that it almost hurt when I used it around my eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li>When I first received the replacement brush heads I was excited as they arrived extremely fast.</li>
            <li>they fit on the Clarisonic perfectly and the deep pore cleaning heads are even softer than my delicate skin heads from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft, smooth and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>They spray all over the place when used, are really soft, and the fibers fall out easily.  </li>
            <li>Just as good as the name brand, for half the price.</li>
            <li>Great substitute for more expensive replacements.</li>
            <li>have a couple old ones that I use on my feet and they work just fine despite their age.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>the bristles are softer, and don&#x27;t give me the same baby smooth clean feeling as the clarisonic brand brushes.  </li>
            <li>but it did not spin at all, which is the whole point of using a Clarisonic!</li>
            <li>i feel like the head makes more rattling noise than the brand name head, but not that big of a deal.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t spin well enough to even be an OK product.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So much better in price and its the same brushes!</li>
            <li>These brush heads leave my skin feeling very cleaned and looking radiant!</li>
            <li>I was one of first people who bought one when it first came out.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>brand Clarsonic are better and last longer.  </li>
            <li>coincidentally i broke out for the first time in months and months upon use of this brush.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I always wash my make-up first, then re-wash my face using my Mia 2.</li>
            <li>These brushes made it much cheaper and easier to replace them and to start using my Clarisonic again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Awesome deal &amp; actually does feel better than the expensive clarisonic refills</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Just like the real ones!</li>
            <li>Clean and soft!</li>
            <li>Not as soft as the original heads, they feel scratchy on my face.</li>
            <li>By the way, I  compared with a 2 month old original, so that may be</li>
            <li>brushes are too soft and don&#x27;t clean my skin well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;&#x27;m certain that after making my Daughter-in-law aware of this product, I&#x27;ll be having to purchase my own Clarisonic in the near future!</li>
            <li>But, they are super soft!</li>
            <li>All were helpful, and positive also.</li>
            <li>But even though the price point is amazing they are just not worth it.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing or not</li>
            <li>These heads work just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>I chose this brand because it had good reviews although very few</li>
            <li>They give off an odd rattle, and within a month of use, I&#x27;m noticing some kind of rust stain?  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and large pores</li>
            <li>Will certainly be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t purchased the sonicare brand&#x27;s deep pore brush, u gotta say this has been working just fine</li>
            <li>This experiment with the generic brush justified the cost of the real thing to me.</li>
            <li>you really have to follow the instructions when putting the head on.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than clarsonic brush heads</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very comparable to the Clarisonic brand brushes.  </li>
            <li>Nothing like the real Clarisonic Mia heads.  </li>
            <li>I stuck with it for about two weeks and then went to the store to buy the real ones.  </li>
            <li>I really need to use for a while to see how well it holds up.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy the real Clarisonic replacement heads.</li>
            <li>they are nothing like the real clarisonic brushes in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>Works like the real Clarisonic replacement heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use these, especially since they&#x27;re so cheap.  </li>
            <li>They offered refund and gave me a free 1 day shipping to order the same product again.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The one thing about it that I&#x27;m NOT addicted to is the pricey replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Work just as well as the name brand price twice as much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>figured $15.00 for two wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a loss.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Brushes came extremely fast and as promised.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You will always wonder why the heck you paid so much for ONE Clarisonic brush head.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work.</li>
            <li>Just as nice as name brand and half the cost!</li>
            <li>I think the price is great as the price of the brand name is ridiculous!</li>
            <li>After shopping Amazon and paying close attention to ratings, I decided to purchase both the Procizion and the original Clarisonic brush replacement heads in the same order.  </li>
            <li>feels same as the original brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Maybe the other types are better?</li>
            <li>Works as well as expensive brand, fit was great on my ciarisonic Mia, I will definitely buy these for now on!</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitate to try generic brushes, but the price was so good</li>
            <li>This is my new brand!</li>
            <li>I will say that I emailed the company to address my concerns and the response was quick, but it also implied that the head smelled because of storing it in the shower, which I don&#x27;t do (I store it the same way I did with the originals that never smelled).I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to say that Procizion not only shipped the brushes quickly</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a more cost-effective method to replace facial cleansing replacement brush heads, look no further!</li>
            <li>I just received my 2nd purchase of these and could not be happier with this product :) , I plan on ordering from this company for all my future orders.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only difference from the leading brand is that they are softer so the Deep Pore Cleaning brush head is more like the Normal brush head by Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brand of brush heads for their quality and ability to deliver the cleansing you are seeking.</li>
            <li>They are what I expected at a fraction of the price and, in today&#x27;s economy,  it&#x27;s important to save where you can.  </li>
            <li>I washed the brush head and did not experience any issues where any portion of the head was not secure to the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I retested them again this morning - just to be sure I wasn&#x27;t being over hopeful.</li>
            <li>other than that it looks identical to the brand name head and the bristles feel just fine</li>
            <li>work very well and clean my face like the more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li>This brush isn&#x27;t overly harsh, its actually a little softer than I prefer but it cleans great and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other compatible brushes, but none like these as they fit and work 100% like the originals</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it fit properly onto the device and also sounded normal.  </li>
            <li>These did not work with my new Mia 2.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new user of the Clarisonic Mia.  </li>
            <li>, These are high quality brushes, the center part vibrate well, and it is most comparable to Clarisonic original brush, maybe just a tiny winy less stiffer) but  very lightly, in fact this is imperceptible.</li>
            <li>I love things that are cheap but work just like the expensive ones..</li>
            <li>I guess it doesn&#x27;t properly fit the Mia 2 cause the middle portion of bristles that are supposed to rotate with the motor only just vibrate.</li>
            <li>Is very loud on the mia2</li>
            <li>They work the exact same as well.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time with this product if you are looking for a cheaper solution for your clarisonic!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
            <li>Only problem is the head didn&#x27;t work correctly at first</li>
            <li>They appear to function exactly the same</li>
            <li>Only difference I can see between these reasonably priced brushes and the name brand is bristle length, these are the tiniest bit longer, but I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference using it!</li>
            <li>Guess what I&#x27;m not doing... purchasing the exact same heads from the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>You only have to do this when you first install the brush head.</li>
            <li>Worse than the original brush that came on the original Mia.</li>
            <li>Plus, my old ones are about two years old!</li>
            <li>I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!  </li>
            <li>When they first arrived I thought they bristles felt much softer than my other one (which came with my Mia2), so I worried they wouldn&#x27;t give the thorough cleaning I had grown to expect from my device.</li>
            <li>I have allergies and very sensitive skin, even more so from being on Retin-A, so I have to be especially careful with facial products.</li>
            <li>Most people are looking for in a solid deep pore brush with bristles that are not so thick or super soft.</li>
            <li>I actually like them a little better.</li>
            <li>it may irritate those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and so far cannot tell any difference from the name brand.</li>
            <li>I have a bit of rosacea and these brushes are gentle enough for my skin.  </li>
            <li>These were flimsy and Way to soft.</li>
            <li>I purchased the acne prone skin heads and immediately noticed the difference they are way too soft.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t connect very well to my ClarisImpact and the brush motion wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>Too soft.</li>
            <li>and my skin is not dried out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone (nearly everyone) rinses toothbrushes after each use...</li>
            <li>The brush really gets deep into your pores and makes my skin feel softer than I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
            <li>The oscillating wasn&#x27;t loud nor did I feel my device was working &amp;#34;overtime&amp;#34; to do its job.</li>
            <li>I am glad I don&#x27;t have to waste extra time on this</li>
            <li>She informed me that she really liked it but was tired of the cost of replacement brushes, so she was no longer using it.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little softer than the original.</li>
            <li>It feels a little softer than my original Clarisonic brush</li>
            <li>Within a day I noticed a return of the dry flaky skin that prompted me to buy my Clarisonic Mia 2 in the first place.</li>
            <li>If anything it has slightly softer bristles and is more reminiscent of the sensitive heads than the regular.  </li>
            <li>I admit I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering these due to how much LESS they cost than the replacement brushes directly from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>They work well with my clarisonic, and though they informed me that the listing mentions that the heads are softer than the normal Clarisonic deep pore cleansing heads, I still wish they had a stiffer option.</li>
            <li>I also tested the brush heads with the Medisonic device last night using my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I received an email from  Procizion following up to make sure everything was working out well that I learned that you had to push down in the middle of the brush once connected in order for it to work properly.</li>
            <li>For me, it is easily solved by pushing down on the center of the brush head.</li>
            <li>so not sure how it intends to clean the pores.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t compare to clarisonic, bristles are way too soft for deep pore cleansing.</li>
            <li>The bristles of the brushes are soft enough that I don&#x27;t feel them scratching or tearing my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s miles and miles ahead of the sensitive brush head that came standard with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>They barely pulsed on my Clarisonic, and there was a major difference in the degree of movement between these and the actual Clarisonic brand heads.  </li>
            <li>I put my old clarisonic one back on and finally cleaned my face</li>
            <li>I can honestly say, I have been throwing away money the last 3 years by buying the expensive clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li>Let me just say, when I first bought my Clarisonic, I was kind of disappointed with the results after about a month of use.</li>
            <li>They are a little softer than I would like, but they do the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>The bristles are also slightly longer than the regular brushes, and they do shed when you first take them out of the box.</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic brush, but let&#x27;s be honest, it seems absurd that the replacement brushes are so expensive and</li>
            <li>Waste of money, buy the real thing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d not replaced my Clarisonic head in far too long due to high cost.</li>
            <li>The bristles are much softer than the sensitive brushes that the Clarisonic usually comes with.</li>
            <li>The first use was disappointing as the brushes did not move like the original brush heads.</li>
            <li>Works great and SO much less expensive!</li>
            <li>Such a great less expensive alternative to buying them from Clarisonic!</li>

            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I was given the offer to try these brush heads at a discount rate for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> It feels as nice on my face as the Clarisonic head.  </li>
            <li> What I am about to write is a testament how nicely Procizion handled a shipping mishap that happened to me.</li>
            <li> After trying these replacement brush heads today, I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t notice any difference between these and the originals.</li>
            <li> Excellent, thanks for the speedy shiment.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping (Amazon prime UPS)</li>
            <li> tried a lot of replacements head for my Clarisonic Mia, in all prices range : these are not the cheaper, but they sure are the very best I tried, and to me these one really worth</li>
            <li> Kind of a shame since I liked the quality of the brush itself.</li>
            <li> , I honestly cannot tell any difference in quality.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the name brand and much much more affordable.</li>
            <li> The difference between the two is astounding.  </li>
            <li> These brushes fit perfectly and are full and sift.</li>
            <li> I love the brushheads! :)</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on my Mia 2, clicked right in.</li>
            <li> This is a great product line, and am enjoying using these to get really clean skin.  </li>
            <li> But with these brushes, my skin has cleared up and had the most amazing texture.</li>
            <li> Good  substitute for original Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as good as the original Clarisonic brush, but you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> Great value and works really well!</li>
            <li> I bought these instead of the higher priced brushes and these are way better!!</li>
            <li> Works great, skin feels smooth and fresh after use.</li>
            <li> ok I guess for the money.  </li>
            <li> this is surely one of those products.</li>
            <li> Wish had more bushels on brush head..</li>
            <li> After two months of using this brush, I had more blackheads, cystic acne and whiteheads than before.  </li>
            <li> the better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made this choice in purchasing it.</li>
            <li> and they are more affordable, so</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for sure :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Mia 2 for about 3 years now and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> Love the price and quality of this.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the cleaning heads.  </li>
            <li> The cost is wonderful compared to getting the actual clarisonic ones</li>
            <li> As I was debating if I want to order from Procizion again I received email from Procizion asking the reason for requesting refund and if they can do anything to make my experience better.</li>
            <li> the quality of the product and customer service made me a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the deeper cleansing motion of these pads.</li>
            <li> Thry work better thsn my name brand heads and cost 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t quite confident in the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am using these with my mother&#x27;s Clarisonic and I love it.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Better price,</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Before spending the money for the brand name brush heads I found these, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> These brush heads have gotten rid of most of my blackheads, and as a result, my complexion is smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this brand.</li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Even if the name brand were slightly better</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes feel more substantial and seem to work better than the originals.</li>
            <li> This in itself was a life saver because I didn&#x27;t want to get stuck with more unusable brush heads.</li>
            <li> Glad I found a cheap replacement!</li>
            <li> This brush is more of a hum, with no movement of the brush to speak of.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service was outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> The price is certainly better than for the original replacement brush heads!</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise I found that these brushes are AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> Just like the original at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> When my Grandma gave me a Clarisonic Mia 2 for Christmas, I was so excited!</li>
            <li> I was able to easily twist these heads onto the device.</li>
            <li> These feel the same as the clairsonic brush heads and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Mia 2 perfectly, although one of them did not seem to be working properly.  </li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and the bristles are just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> so far I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Well made, on time shipping, very good product I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> and I was too scared to buy knock offs because I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would fit.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t feel like they do as good a job.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was too good to be true, but I love this brush head.  </li>
            <li> These work wonderfully for half the cost :)</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit softer than the Clarisonic ones, but the cleaning effect is exactly the same...and a much better price!</li>
            <li> Such a good deal!</li>
            <li> it is ok but not what the original one is.</li>
            <li> but they say these are actually better than the original cartridge that came with the device.  </li>
            <li> These are better than the original ones that came with the unit.  </li>
            <li> They were softer and come off easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than buying the Clarisonic brand, fits my Clarisonic easily and after about 4 weeks of use</li>
            <li> I received the brush heads very quickly and compared them to the Groupon brush heads.</li>
            <li> They fit perfect, the center part oscillates just like the Clarisonic brand brushes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical b.c these are cheaper than the Clarisonic brand, but they fit my Clarisonic device perfectly and seem to work great.</li>
            <li> Works very well - as good as the original.</li>
            <li> They fit my Clarisonic better than the original brush heads.</li>
            <li> The heads seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> and they are exactly as described, but they followed up with an email to make sure I had received them and was satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have the Mia 2, and they work with it just fine.</li>
            <li> It fit on there</li>
            <li> They &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; in the sense that they attach, but they do not spin like genuine clarisonic brush heads.  </li>
            <li> These are great alternative replacement brushes for my Clarisonic facial cleaning system.</li>
            <li> It fit and rotated</li>
            <li> Received the heads today and my skin is glowing and flake free.</li>
            <li> They fit snugly on head &amp; get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Cheap design.</li>
            <li> It did fit my brush</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> They fit .  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> They look the same as the intended brand name replacements and seem to work just as great.</li>
            <li> When I attached it to my Mia clarisonic, it just made a buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Why would anyone pay 44.00 for a brush replacement when you can get such a great deal?</li>
            <li> Price is fabulous, and I cannot tell a difference between the Sonic brush and these.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for my Clarisonic facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> They arrived in a timely manner and I am so glad I found them because they are such a good price as compare to the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good choice to replace your old clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> They fit just like the original.</li>
            <li> I am more then happy with these brush heads, they work exactly like the brand name ones with the exception that they are a little bit softer which is fine with me :).</li>
            <li> Awesome dupe for the real thing - long overdue!</li>
            <li> These fit great and are nearly identical to the ones by Clairisonic but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> my Mia 2 just like the original Clarisonic brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works just like the original as well, my face feels cleaner than ever</li>
            <li> my original Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t shed any bristles.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I found what looked like a comparable brush head for my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Seems like the original.</li>
            <li> I love these more than the caledonia brushes, they are so soft but still get the job done!</li>
            <li> I had to order the original brushes.</li>
            <li> Fits my Mia 2 and works just like the original brush head.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> My original brushes are still stiffer than these are.</li>
            <li> I removed an original Clairsonic brush and installed this one.  </li>
            <li> face felt amount of clean as the original brush would</li>
            <li> I am such a surprised and happy consumer!</li>
            <li> I put them in the dishwasher to clean them.  </li>
            <li> They leave my skin feeling clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> They are just soft enough and work perfectly with my Clarisonic Aria.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found a far more affordable alternative!</li>
            <li> Fit is good and performs similar to others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I went with it after reading so many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I really like this brush more than the original I got with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> As many people wrote these fit the machine and feel good for a lot less.</li>
            <li> It is a really pleasant surprise when a generic is better than the original, high priced item.</li>
            <li> A third of the cost of the name brand ones, yet works just as good.</li>
            <li> but these are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> such a good deal compared to the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> I buy brush heads for delicate skin and these were perfect.</li>
            <li> Returned the item for full refund without a problem.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are much softer than the bristles on the authentic brushes.</li>
            <li> After repeatedly attempting to get the brush head to oscillate, I gave up and began searching here for a true replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad.  </li>
            <li> They fit just fine, but doesn&#x27;t seem to vibrate/rotate as much as with the original clairsonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice and soft and my face feels great after I use it unlike the other replacement brushes I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This brush works great and actually feels much nicer on my skin.</li>
            <li> Sure enough I ordered from them again and love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t see &amp; feel any different from original......</li>
            <li> The bristles held up beautifully and did not leave any harsh abrasion feeling when I completed the cleansing.</li>
            <li> I clean it often with warm soapy water and alcohol, but as soon as I saw it again with the second one, I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Clarisonic Refreshing Foaming Gel as well as an off brand cleanser I got at my local grocery store and my skin has been so clean since I&#x27;ve bought it!</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase, two brushes for less than the cost of one of the Clarisonic brand replacement brush.</li>
            <li> Works just as great as the Clarisonic ones for half the price.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectily and are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> There is no wobbling or unusual sound.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok although it doesn&#x27;t soft as i think it is.</li>
            <li> well worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the additional money to get heads that work.</li>
            <li> but it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Clairsonic for a few years now and these by far are the best replacement heads for the money.</li>
            <li> wanted the brush heads to be alright considering the price, but they just aren&#x27;t worth the sacrifice.</li>
            <li> A lot softer than the Clarisonic replacement heads but for the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it,</li>
            <li> I bought the sensitive ones instead, and they seem better.</li>
            <li> Compatible as far as fitting onto the machine</li>
            <li> If your brush head does not oscillate, be sure to apply light pressure on the middle portion of the brush head.</li>
            <li> There are compatible and worth the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles felt perfect and were not too stiff or too soft.  </li>
            <li> I went through the two \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush heads that came with my Clarisonic Mia 2, and while that did clean better than my CVS brush, it still wasn&#x27;t enough to get rid of the blackheads I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find an inexpensive replacement head, but they went straight into the trash can.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the past 2 days and so far it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and break out very easy and was concerned this might bring up some unwanted pimples, but none so far!</li>
            <li> When I first started using the Clairsonic, it was so powerful that it almost hurt when I used it around my eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li> When I first received the replacement brush heads I was excited as they arrived extremely fast.</li>
            <li> they fit on the Clarisonic perfectly and the deep pore cleaning heads are even softer than my delicate skin heads from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft, smooth and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> They spray all over the place when used, are really soft, and the fibers fall out easily.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as the name brand, for half the price.</li>
            <li> Great substitute for more expensive replacements.</li>
            <li> have a couple old ones that I use on my feet and they work just fine despite their age.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> the bristles are softer, and don&#x27;t give me the same baby smooth clean feeling as the clarisonic brand brushes.  </li>
            <li> but it did not spin at all, which is the whole point of using a Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> i feel like the head makes more rattling noise than the brand name head, but not that big of a deal.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spin well enough to even be an OK product.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So much better in price and its the same brushes!</li>
            <li> These brush heads leave my skin feeling very cleaned and looking radiant!</li>
            <li> I was one of first people who bought one when it first came out.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> brand Clarsonic are better and last longer.  </li>
            <li> coincidentally i broke out for the first time in months and months upon use of this brush.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I always wash my make-up first, then re-wash my face using my Mia 2.</li>
            <li> These brushes made it much cheaper and easier to replace them and to start using my Clarisonic again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal &amp; actually does feel better than the expensive clarisonic refills</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Just like the real ones!</li>
            <li> Clean and soft!</li>
            <li> Not as soft as the original heads, they feel scratchy on my face.</li>
            <li> By the way, I  compared with a 2 month old original, so that may be</li>
            <li> brushes are too soft and don&#x27;t clean my skin well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;&#x27;m certain that after making my Daughter-in-law aware of this product, I&#x27;ll be having to purchase my own Clarisonic in the near future!</li>
            <li> But, they are super soft!</li>
            <li> All were helpful, and positive also.</li>
            <li> But even though the price point is amazing they are just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing or not</li>
            <li> These heads work just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand because it had good reviews although very few</li>
            <li> They give off an odd rattle, and within a month of use, I&#x27;m noticing some kind of rust stain?  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and large pores</li>
            <li> Will certainly be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t purchased the sonicare brand&#x27;s deep pore brush, u gotta say this has been working just fine</li>
            <li> This experiment with the generic brush justified the cost of the real thing to me.</li>
            <li> you really have to follow the instructions when putting the head on.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than clarsonic brush heads</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very comparable to the Clarisonic brand brushes.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like the real Clarisonic Mia heads.  </li>
            <li> I stuck with it for about two weeks and then went to the store to buy the real ones.  </li>
            <li> I really need to use for a while to see how well it holds up.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the real Clarisonic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> they are nothing like the real clarisonic brushes in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> Works like the real Clarisonic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use these, especially since they&#x27;re so cheap.  </li>
            <li> They offered refund and gave me a free 1 day shipping to order the same product again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The one thing about it that I&#x27;m NOT addicted to is the pricey replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Work just as well as the name brand price twice as much.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> figured $15.00 for two wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a loss.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Brushes came extremely fast and as promised.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You will always wonder why the heck you paid so much for ONE Clarisonic brush head.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work.</li>
            <li> Just as nice as name brand and half the cost!</li>
            <li> I think the price is great as the price of the brand name is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> After shopping Amazon and paying close attention to ratings, I decided to purchase both the Procizion and the original Clarisonic brush replacement heads in the same order.  </li>
            <li> feels same as the original brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Maybe the other types are better?</li>
            <li> Works as well as expensive brand, fit was great on my ciarisonic Mia, I will definitely buy these for now on!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitate to try generic brushes, but the price was so good</li>
            <li> This is my new brand!</li>
            <li> I will say that I emailed the company to address my concerns and the response was quick, but it also implied that the head smelled because of storing it in the shower, which I don&#x27;t do (I store it the same way I did with the originals that never smelled).I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to say that Procizion not only shipped the brushes quickly</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a more cost-effective method to replace facial cleansing replacement brush heads, look no further!</li>
            <li> I just received my 2nd purchase of these and could not be happier with this product :) , I plan on ordering from this company for all my future orders.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only difference from the leading brand is that they are softer so the Deep Pore Cleaning brush head is more like the Normal brush head by Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brand of brush heads for their quality and ability to deliver the cleansing you are seeking.</li>
            <li> They are what I expected at a fraction of the price and, in today&#x27;s economy,  it&#x27;s important to save where you can.  </li>
            <li> I washed the brush head and did not experience any issues where any portion of the head was not secure to the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I retested them again this morning - just to be sure I wasn&#x27;t being over hopeful.</li>
            <li> other than that it looks identical to the brand name head and the bristles feel just fine</li>
            <li> work very well and clean my face like the more expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t overly harsh, its actually a little softer than I prefer but it cleans great and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other compatible brushes, but none like these as they fit and work 100% like the originals</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it fit properly onto the device and also sounded normal.  </li>
            <li> These did not work with my new Mia 2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new user of the Clarisonic Mia.  </li>
            <li> , These are high quality brushes, the center part vibrate well, and it is most comparable to Clarisonic original brush, maybe just a tiny winy less stiffer) but  very lightly, in fact this is imperceptible.</li>
            <li> I love things that are cheap but work just like the expensive ones..</li>
            <li> I guess it doesn&#x27;t properly fit the Mia 2 cause the middle portion of bristles that are supposed to rotate with the motor only just vibrate.</li>
            <li> Is very loud on the mia2</li>
            <li> They work the exact same as well.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time with this product if you are looking for a cheaper solution for your clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the head didn&#x27;t work correctly at first</li>
            <li> They appear to function exactly the same</li>
            <li> Only difference I can see between these reasonably priced brushes and the name brand is bristle length, these are the tiniest bit longer, but I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference using it!</li>
            <li> Guess what I&#x27;m not doing... purchasing the exact same heads from the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> You only have to do this when you first install the brush head.</li>
            <li> Worse than the original brush that came on the original Mia.</li>
            <li> Plus, my old ones are about two years old!</li>
            <li> I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!  </li>
            <li> When they first arrived I thought they bristles felt much softer than my other one (which came with my Mia2), so I worried they wouldn&#x27;t give the thorough cleaning I had grown to expect from my device.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and very sensitive skin, even more so from being on Retin-A, so I have to be especially careful with facial products.</li>
            <li> Most people are looking for in a solid deep pore brush with bristles that are not so thick or super soft.</li>
            <li> I actually like them a little better.</li>
            <li> it may irritate those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and so far cannot tell any difference from the name brand.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of rosacea and these brushes are gentle enough for my skin.  </li>
            <li> These were flimsy and Way to soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased the acne prone skin heads and immediately noticed the difference they are way too soft.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t connect very well to my ClarisImpact and the brush motion wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> Too soft.</li>
            <li> and my skin is not dried out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone (nearly everyone) rinses toothbrushes after each use...</li>
            <li> The brush really gets deep into your pores and makes my skin feel softer than I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
            <li> The oscillating wasn&#x27;t loud nor did I feel my device was working &amp;#34;overtime&amp;#34; to do its job.</li>
            <li> I am glad I don&#x27;t have to waste extra time on this</li>
            <li> She informed me that she really liked it but was tired of the cost of replacement brushes, so she was no longer using it.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little softer than the original.</li>
            <li> It feels a little softer than my original Clarisonic brush</li>
            <li> Within a day I noticed a return of the dry flaky skin that prompted me to buy my Clarisonic Mia 2 in the first place.</li>
            <li> If anything it has slightly softer bristles and is more reminiscent of the sensitive heads than the regular.  </li>
            <li> I admit I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering these due to how much LESS they cost than the replacement brushes directly from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> They work well with my clarisonic, and though they informed me that the listing mentions that the heads are softer than the normal Clarisonic deep pore cleansing heads, I still wish they had a stiffer option.</li>
            <li> I also tested the brush heads with the Medisonic device last night using my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I received an email from  Procizion following up to make sure everything was working out well that I learned that you had to push down in the middle of the brush once connected in order for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> For me, it is easily solved by pushing down on the center of the brush head.</li>
            <li> so not sure how it intends to clean the pores.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t compare to clarisonic, bristles are way too soft for deep pore cleansing.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brushes are soft enough that I don&#x27;t feel them scratching or tearing my skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s miles and miles ahead of the sensitive brush head that came standard with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> They barely pulsed on my Clarisonic, and there was a major difference in the degree of movement between these and the actual Clarisonic brand heads.  </li>
            <li> I put my old clarisonic one back on and finally cleaned my face</li>
            <li> I can honestly say, I have been throwing away money the last 3 years by buying the expensive clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li> Let me just say, when I first bought my Clarisonic, I was kind of disappointed with the results after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> They are a little softer than I would like, but they do the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> The bristles are also slightly longer than the regular brushes, and they do shed when you first take them out of the box.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic brush, but let&#x27;s be honest, it seems absurd that the replacement brushes are so expensive and</li>
            <li> Waste of money, buy the real thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not replaced my Clarisonic head in far too long due to high cost.</li>
            <li> The bristles are much softer than the sensitive brushes that the Clarisonic usually comes with.</li>
            <li> The first use was disappointing as the brushes did not move like the original brush heads.</li>
            <li> Works great and SO much less expensive!</li>
            <li> Such a great less expensive alternative to buying them from Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Theses off brand Mia replacement brush heads don&#x27;t work right, hardly rotate or vibrate.</li>
            <li> I like the results, and though it is early on to describe what I feel long term, in the short term I have had absolutely no skin irritation or that &amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; feeling after a cleanse.</li>
            <li> Just as effective as the expensive clarisonic ones!</li>
            <li> The brushheads are absolutely not the same as the clarisonic brand - it was very harsh on my skin and made me breakout right away.</li>
            <li> Do not spend tons of money on the brand name replacement heads, these work just as well and last just as long.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because I liked the quality of the bristles.</li>
            <li> so if you have sensitive skin this may be to harsh for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had the same issue as other reviewers with the brush head clicking into place, but not spinning.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to switch!</li>
            <li> The reason I decided on this company was due to their guarantee money back policy.</li>
            <li> I usually purchased the gentle brushes, as I have sensitive skin, but opted for deep poor cleansing this time.</li>
            <li> After about a month  the head came loose and kept falling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t vibrating as well and seems to come loose.</li>
            <li> I ran my fingers over them a couple of times to get all the loose bristles out, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding since.</li>
            <li> It tightens down too low and doesn&#x27;t allow the brush heads to vibrate.  </li>
            <li> I typically use the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; Clarisonic brand brush head and found that the Deep-Pore version had a similar feel.  </li>
            <li> I had previously been using the official Clarisonic deep pore brushes.  </li>
            <li> : I agree and understand Clarisonic devices price, but on the other hand I found the original Clarisonic brushes exceedingly expensive....</li>
            <li> The bristles seem to be a little bit softer though than my clarisonic for deep pores.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t too soft or to hard</li>
            <li> I am so friggin happy to ditch the stupid brand price!</li>
            <li> This item does not perform remotely as well as the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> There is really no need to spend $25 for 1 Clarisonic branded brush head replacement when you can purchase 2 for $14.97.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the device only came with one sensitive brush head (Groupon made it up to me) but not the deep pore brush head.</li>
            <li> I was worried it was going to be too rough on my face.</li>
            <li> I returned them right away and was not impressed with their solution.</li>
            <li> While these were much less than the brand name replacement head, they do not nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other replacements and they were too rough on my face</li>
            <li> looks dirty even if you clean with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and they do the same job just as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about this product.  </li>
            <li> So these brush heads do oscillate like the clarisonic ones and they are softer bristles like other reviews</li>
            <li> I got a little ahead of myself with this review, I didn&#x27;t realize they click on a little different.</li>
            <li> They also provided extra information on how the brushes work, (oscillation rather than rotation) and a little trouble shooting advice.  </li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s for deep pore cleaning, but the bristles aren&#x27;t hard at all.</li>
            <li> I personally like a harsh facial brush as I has tough skin.</li>
            <li> I was trying to save a few dollars and now I&#x27;m ended up with more hassle. :(</li>
            <li> I have been skeptical in the past to buy generic replacement heads since the brush head is the vital component in receiving all the benefits of the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> for the price it is defiantly a steal to get 2 for less than the price of 1 name brand one.</li>
            <li> It will work if you put it one half way, but then the head falls off.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers that the brush head is not as stiff as it&#x27;s Clarisonic counterpart, but I solved that by buying up.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE BIT BETTER?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> like they&#x27;re supposed to, and they&#x27;re less than half the cost!  </li>
            <li> It feels a little stiffer</li>
            <li> I find these to be less irritating for my skin than the clairsonic deep pore brush head</li>
            <li> In a desperate attempt to save myself some money, I ordered these from Amazon without very high expectations.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if they changed the product, but does NOT fit my Mia2.</li>
            <li> Got my brush heads a few days after ordering.</li>
            <li> One of two brushed delivered broken.</li>
            <li> so it would have just been money wasted had Procizion not reached out to me.</li>
            <li> Not as harsh on my skin as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> But I think the worst part is that THEY DO SMELL, even when they&#x27;re new and they stain unlike the clarisonic version ( even when I always remove my make up first).</li>
            <li> Why anyone would pay $25 for ONE replacement brush when you can get these for so much less is beyond me!</li>
            <li> would totally recommend this product to anyone looking for a less expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I do not have to buy an expensive replacement brush head for my Clairsonic!!!</li>
            <li> Small price to pay.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is how expensive the replacement brush heads are.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to add to my collection for Clarisonic brushes and after reading the reviews about it not fitting with some</li>
            <li> Let me lay it down for you - I am helplessly addicted to my Clairsonic.  </li>
            <li> if you try to push to hard</li>
            <li> I hardly ever used my Clarisonic after failing to replace the brush heads.</li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;Brushes aren&#x27;t too hard on your face.  </li>
            <li> Any residual make-up will stain the brush head but obviously that just makes it look a bit dirty, it doesn&#x27;t change the performance any.</li>
            <li> A real waste of time &amp; money for me</li>
            <li> I bought these as a less expensive option for my clarisonic</li>
            <li> These are a lot less expensive than the Clarisonic brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Despite some of the negative reviews I went ahead and purchased anyways... Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> This product is poorly made.</li>
            <li> For years I have been paying for the very expensive Clarisonic brand and had been looking for a less expensive option.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my Clarisonic Brush :(</li>
            <li> Well, no more!!!</li>
            <li> They are so expensive</li>
            <li> but after just a couple of uses (including washing the brush after) they start to smell really weird.</li>
            <li> but I am obsessed with the savings).</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the expensive clairsonic versions.</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive brand name.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy the $25 Clairsonic brush...</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical to by a non brand name replacement brush.</li>

            <li> Awesome, works exactly like the branded version but a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Works great and SO much less expensive!</li>
            <li> Great value and works really well!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work with my Mia 2. It fit on there but it did not spin at all, which is the whole point of using a Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Just as good as the OEM brush heads. I actually like them a little better.</li>
            <li> These feel the same as the clairsonic brush heads and fit perfectly. for the price it is defiantly a steal to get 2 for less than the price of 1 name brand one. it may irritate those with sensitive skin. I find these to be less irritating for my skin than the clairsonic deep pore brush head</li>
            <li> ok I guess for the money.  you really have to follow the instructions when putting the head on.  if you try to push to hard it will not go on.  i feel like the head makes more rattling noise than the brand name head, but not that big of a deal.  other than that it looks identical to the brand name head and the bristles feel just fine</li>
            <li> Always nervous buying generic products but this one worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great they aren&#x27;t too soft or to hard they are just perfect. I have combination skin and large pores so the brush heads for deep pore cleansing work well for me, I use it once a week or once every 2 weeks to exfoliate my skin I apply St. Ives apricot scrub or clariSEA see salt on my face and then I start exfoliating for 5 to 10 mins my skin feels so soft, smooth and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use my sonic face brush by Pleasingcare daily and have dreaded the day that I would have to buy replacement heads. They are so expensive and I was too scared to buy knock offs because I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would fit. These fit great and are nearly identical to the ones by Clairisonic but much cheaper. They work the exact same as well. If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement brush you must try these and save some money!&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly for a fraction of the price. Will certainly be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Prime Member, and I&#x27;m always looking for a bargain on this site.  I&#x27;ve never left a product review, but I wanted to warn others about these brushes - they don&#x27;t work!  They barely pulsed on my Clarisonic, and there was a major difference in the degree of movement between these and the actual Clarisonic brand heads.  The quality of the bristles was also significantly different.  I was so excited to find an inexpensive replacement head, but they went straight into the trash can.</li>
            <li> Just as effective as the expensive clarisonic ones!</li>
            <li> I like a good value. I love my Clarisonic brush, but let&#x27;s be honest, it seems absurd that the replacement brushes are so expensive and of course they recommend you replace every three months. I had low expectations for this product. A generic product can be hit or miss, but these were a solid hit for me.  I do agree with other reviewers that the brush head is not as stiff as it&#x27;s Clarisonic counterpart, but I solved that by buying up. I typically use the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; Clarisonic brand brush head and found that the Deep-Pore version had a similar feel.  I&#x27;ve also had the same issue as other reviewers with the brush head clicking into place, but not spinning. For me, it is easily solved by pushing down on the center of the brush head. Small price to pay.</li>
            <li> fits my clairsonic perfect.</li>
            <li> Neither one of these would spin properly on my Mia2.  There&#x27;s a noticeable difference in how it spins.  Doesn&#x27;t spin well enough to even be an OK product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. These did not work with my new Mia 2. They vibrate but the middle does not spin. Very disappointed. Tried several times to get the brush heads to work, but they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok although it doesn&#x27;t soft as i think it is.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! Great price!</li>
            <li> They were softer and come off easily</li>
            <li> Despite some of the negative reviews I went ahead and purchased anyways... Couldn&#x27;t be happier! A third of the cost of the name brand ones, yet works just as good. I love things that are cheap but work just like the expensive ones.. this is surely one of those products. Well made, on time shipping, very good product I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> While these were much less than the brand name replacement head, they do not nearly as well. Both brushes do not spin like the usuals do- doesn&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re washing your face, rather just rubbing it. Also, 1 of the brushes did not vibrate at all. This product is poorly made. Next time, I will splurge for the $25 one- well worth it compared to this!</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful!! Just as nice as name brand and half the cost! I will defiantly buy them again.</li>
            <li> Do not buy these if you&#x27;re using them with the Mia 2.  They &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; in the sense that they attach, but they do not spin like genuine clarisonic brush heads.  It&#x27;s worth the additional money to get heads that work.</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Great consumer follow up</li>
            <li> I love the brushheads! :)</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. BRUSH HEADS WORK PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> Fits clairsonic Mia works well</li>
            <li> Wish had more bushels on brush head..but it is worth the buy. Much cheaper than clarsonic brush heads and it does a great job</li>
            <li> Great product and customer service. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great, works just like the Clarisonic brand heads.</li>
            <li> The follow-up email from Procizion was especially helpful as they helped me realize that I needed to push the middle section in until it &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34;. Thank you! Works great!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great!  Very comparable to the Clarisonic brand brushes.  The followup customer service was awesome, too.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The price is great and so is the product! Arrived quickly. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using the official Clarisonic deep pore brushes.  This generic brush was scouring my skin.  With the brush installed in the Clarisonic, I ran it over a glass nail file for 2 minutes, which polished the ends of the bristles enough that the brush was usable.  After two months of using this brush, I had more blackheads, cystic acne and whiteheads than before.  This experiment with the generic brush justified the cost of the real thing to me.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than any I&#x27;ve purchased in the past and they do the same job just as well.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a less expensive option for my clarisonic The brushheads are absolutely not the same as the clarisonic brand - it was very harsh on my skin and made me breakout right away. Do not waste your time with this product if you are looking for a cheaper solution for your clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Good Product, I WILL COME BACK.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY ONE SUGGESTION FOR YOU GUYS.&lt;br /&gt;IS THERE ANY WAY TO MAKE THE BOX LOOKS A LITTLE BIT BETTER?&lt;br /&gt;The original box is not too awesome as a gift.</li>
            <li> So much better in price and its the same brushes!</li>
            <li> Perfect these fit my Mia 2 Clairsonic good...</li>
            <li> arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> These brushes fit the device and work great. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I admit I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering these due to how much LESS they cost than the replacement brushes directly from Clarisonic. When they first arrived I thought they bristles felt much softer than my other one (which came with my Mia2), so I worried they wouldn&#x27;t give the thorough cleaning I had grown to expect from my device. Not so! This brush works great and actually feels much nicer on my skin. Why anyone would pay $25 for ONE replacement brush when you can get these for so much less is beyond me! I will definitely reorder from Procizion for my future replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about this product.  I have the clarisonic Mia 2.  Omg!!! If you are buying the clarisonic replacement brushes, STOP!  This product is just as good and the PRICE alone !! Thank me later.  ☺️</li>
            <li> excellent quality for the money.  work very well and clean my face like the more expensive brand.  will be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Fits my Clarsonic Mia perfectly and works just as well as the Clarsonic. It feels a little softer than the original.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, great price. Will purchase here next time I need them</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes work great with my Mia1. They arrived in a timely manner and I am so glad I found them because they are such a good price as compare to the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> Wow! I am such a surprised and happy consumer! The brush head fits PERFECTLY on my Clarisonic. I usually purchased the gentle brushes, as I have sensitive skin, but opted for deep poor cleansing this time. I like the results, and though it is early on to describe what I feel long term, in the short term I have had absolutely no skin irritation or that &amp;quot;tight&amp;quot; feeling after a cleanse. I cannot feel happier about this purchase. The cut in cost, the compatibility with the unit, the quality of the bristles, everything has worked out. I am thankful for all of the Amazon shoppers that took part in my purchase, as I reached out and received several feedback remarks. All were helpful, and positive also. Thank you Procizion for providing Clarisonic users an outstanding alternative!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d never know it wasn&#x27;t the brand heads!</li>
            <li> These are great alternative replacement brushes for my Clarisonic facial cleaning system. They fit perfectly and the bristles are just as good if not better. I personally like a harsh facial brush as I has tough skin. I think the harsher the brush the better it works. This brush isn&#x27;t overly harsh, its actually a little softer than I prefer but it cleans great and at a fraction of the cost. I would recommend these replacement brush heads to anyone with a Clarisonic facial system. These are a great value for the price. I purchased these brushes during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t just as good--they&#x27;re better!</li>
            <li> Seems to work just like the Clarisonic brush heads but 1/2 the cost! I will definitely purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have used once and so far cannot tell any difference from the name brand.</li>
            <li> Great Product. I&#x27;ve had my Clairsonic for a few years now and these by far are the best replacement heads for the money. They fit great.</li>
            <li> It feels a little softer than my original Clarisonic brush but it still does the job well. It&#x27;s cheaper than buying the Clarisonic brand, fits my Clarisonic easily and after about 4 weeks of use it is still holding up well. I&#x27;m glad I made this choice in purchasing it.</li>
            <li> These brushes work just as well as the brush that came with my Clarisonic Mia and they are more affordable, so yay!  I have a bit of rosacea and these brushes are gentle enough for my skin.  I would recommend these for sure :)</li>
            <li> These are terrible.  Nothing like the real Clarisonic Mia heads.  They spray all over the place when used, are really soft, and the fibers fall out easily.  I stuck with it for about two weeks and then went to the store to buy the real ones.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to switch!</li>
            <li> Compatible with my Clarisonic - couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, great price and fast service. I will order from them again!</li>
            <li> The heads seem to work fine. The bristles seem to be a little bit softer though than my clarisonic for deep pores. I really need to use for a while to see how well it holds up.</li>
            <li> Worse than the original brush that came on the original Mia. These were flimsy and Way to soft. Not a good product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t compare to clarisonic, bristles are way too soft for deep pore cleansing. I put my old clarisonic one back on and finally cleaned my face</li>
            <li> Work just like the brand. I see no difference but the awesome price</li>
            <li> Just like the original at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully for half the cost :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clarisonic Mia 2 for about 3 years now and absolutely love it.  The only issue I have is how expensive the replacement brush heads are.  I have been skeptical in the past to buy generic replacement heads since the brush head is the vital component in receiving all the benefits of the Clarisonic.  I was given the offer to try these brush heads at a discount rate for my honest and unbiased review so I figured it would be a perfect opportunity to try out the generics.  I can honestly say, I have been throwing away money the last 3 years by buying the expensive clarisonic brand.  The brush head fit perfectly and worked as it should.  The bristles felt perfect and were not too stiff or too soft.  I could notice no difference between the generic and the brand name.  These brush heads leave my skin feeling very cleaned and looking radiant!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t see &amp; feel any different from original......Save all the money if you can.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my Clarisonic Brush :(</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the real Clarisonic replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Clarsonic for years...I was one of first people who bought one when it first came out.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are too soft and don&#x27;t clean my skin well.  After about a month  the head came loose and kept falling out.&lt;br /&gt;The brand Clarsonic are better and last longer.  I put them in the dishwasher to clean them.  They last for 6 to 12 monthes.&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple old ones that I use on my feet and they work just fine despite their age.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy.....wasteful consumerism.</li>
            <li> Awesome that they fit the clarisonic but after just a couple of uses (including washing the brush after) they start to smell really weird.</li>
            <li> This product did not work with my mia 2. It fit and rotated but then when the bristles were touched it would click and the bristles would stop rotating. The company told me I needed to press them back in to get them to rotate again. I returned them right away and was not impressed with their solution.</li>
            <li> took a chance on these based upon the reviews.  they are nothing like the real clarisonic brushes in my opinion.  the bristles are softer, and don&#x27;t give me the same baby smooth clean feeling as the clarisonic brand brushes.  coincidentally i broke out for the first time in months and months upon use of this brush.  it also stopping pulsing properly in my mia 2 after two weeks.  threw them away.</li>
            <li> These are great for the money! can&#x27;t complain!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few months and once I realized I needed to increase the speed of my Clarisonic machine I have found it to work very well and I am very happy with the brush</li>
            <li> Excellent - performs as well as the brush heads from Clarisonic at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> great value. fast shipping</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly!</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement heads!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for the past 2 days and so far it&#x27;s great!  This brush is nice and soft and my face feels great after I use it unlike the other replacement brushes I have tried.  Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
            <li> So these brush heads do oscillate like the clarisonic ones and they are softer bristles like other reviews said. But I think the worst part is that THEY DO SMELL, even when they&#x27;re new and they stain unlike the clarisonic version ( even when I always remove my make up first). I also feel like the bristles have this waxy consistency and my face does not feel refreshed like it did with the clarisonic version. I will say that I emailed the company to address my concerns and the response was quick, but it also implied that the head smelled because of storing it in the shower, which I don&#x27;t do (I store it the same way I did with the originals that never smelled).I wanted the brush heads to be alright considering the price, but they just aren&#x27;t worth the sacrifice.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! A lot softer than the Clarisonic replacement heads but for the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it,</li>
            <li> Love the price and quality of this. Works like the real Clarisonic replacement heads. I even recommended it to my friends to buy</li>
            <li> If I could give these replacement heads no stars I would. They are nothing like the Clarisonic brand. I purchased the acne prone skin heads and immediately noticed the difference they are way too soft. Within a day I noticed a return of the dry flaky skin that prompted me to buy my Clarisonic Mia 2 in the first place. For 3 weeks I tried to like them by using it for 2 cycles instead of 1 each morning and night. But even though the price point is amazing they are just not worth it. I put in my order through Sephora.com using Ebates with 9% cash back (no I am not affiliated Ebates but I am obsessed with the savings). Received the heads today and my skin is glowing and flake free. Now I&#x27;m a happy girl.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it worked. Didn&#x27;t connect very well to my ClarisImpact and the brush motion wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the cleaning heads.  I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!  They fit snugly on head &amp; get the job done.  Glad I ordered!</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase, two brushes for less than the cost of one of the Clarisonic brand replacement brush. They fit perfectly on my Mia 2, clicked right in. Just like with the brand name ones, use them twice a day, replace at around 3 months. My only gripe is that they stain a bit easier. I always wash my make-up first, then re-wash my face using my Mia 2. Any residual make-up will stain the brush head but obviously that just makes it look a bit dirty, it doesn&#x27;t change the performance any. Works great, skin feels smooth and fresh after use. Overall, I would/will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the name brand, for half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new user of the Clarisonic Mia.  I had contemplated purchasing one for several months but kept putting the purchase off.  During a recent visit to my Daughter-in-law&#x27;s home I spotted hers and questioned her about her satisfaction with the product.  She informed me that she really liked it but was tired of the cost of replacement brushes, so she was no longer using it.  She encouraged me to take it home and give it a try.  After shopping Amazon and paying close attention to ratings, I decided to purchase both the Procizion and the original Clarisonic brush replacement heads in the same order.  My thought process being that I would do a side by side comparison.  It seems the only difference that I can decipher is color placement on the bristles.  It feels as nice on my face as the Clarisonic head.  I&#x27;&#x27;m certain that after making my Daughter-in-law aware of this product, I&#x27;ll be having to purchase my own Clarisonic in the near future!</li>
            <li> Too soft. Not all the bristles rotate. Cheap design.</li>
            <li> These are great!  The cost is wonderful compared to getting the actual clarisonic ones and I&#x27;ll be getting all of my replacement heads from Procision from now on!</li>
            <li> Works very well - as good as the original.</li>
            <li> This is a great product line, and am enjoying using these to get really clean skin.  I&#x27;d also like to say that Procizion not only shipped the brushes quickly and they are exactly as described, but they followed up with an email to make sure I had received them and was satisfied.  They also provided extra information on how the brushes work, (oscillation rather than rotation) and a little trouble shooting advice.  Great company.  I would not hesitate to buy from them again.</li>
            <li> For the price I like them quite a bit. They are a little softer than I would like, but they do the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever used my Clarisonic after failing to replace the brush heads. These brushes made it much cheaper and easier to replace them and to start using my Clarisonic again! My skin has definitely thanked me a million times over.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy these brushes instead of the Mia brushes. I&#x27;ve tried other replacements and they were too rough on my face but these are nice and soft. I also like that they are blue because depending on your cleanser it can make you brush looks dirty even if you clean with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Fit:&lt;br /&gt;Fits my Mia 2 just like the original Clarisonic brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionality:&lt;br /&gt;Works just like the original as well, my face feels cleaner than ever and my skin is not dried out after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other compatible brushes, but none like these as they fit and work 100% like the originals EXCEPT the bristles are actually softer than the originals. Not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing or not but my face is thanking me for it.</li>
            <li> :(. Don&#x27;t know if they changed the product, but does NOT fit my Mia2. It tightens down too low and doesn&#x27;t allow the brush heads to vibrate.  It will work if you put it one half way, but then the head falls off. Too bad, because I liked the quality of the bristles.</li>
            <li> This is the same quality as the brand name brush heads that cost 3/4 times this amount, considering the name brands do not come in the 2 packs for a value price. The quality has the same texture, same material it seems in terms of the plastic holding it together and the fibers. I am very happy with this and will no longer be purchasing the name brand.</li>
            <li> These are a lot less expensive than the Clarisonic brush heads.  That being said, you get what you pay for.  I really don&#x27;t feel like they do as good a job.  The head is wobbly and doesn&#x27;t seem to hold on as well.  I&#x27;ll use these, especially since they&#x27;re so cheap.  Don&#x27;t see the point in returning.  But I won&#x27;t be buying again in future.</li>
            <li> When my Grandma gave me a Clarisonic Mia 2 for Christmas, I was so excited! Then I looked at the prices for the Mia 2 replacement head and my heart sank.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I hopped on Amazon and found the Compatible Replacement Brush Heads for Deep Pore Cleaning. For All Skin Types, Enlarged Pores, Oily Skin, For Face and Body.&lt;br /&gt;The price simply could not be beat.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads fit the Mia 2 perfectly. I have used both heads and I have had no problems; they work just as well as the Clarisonic heads.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this product to anyone looking for a less expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> Good  substitute for original Clarisonic brush heads. I was very skeptical to by a non brand name replacement brush. I went with it after reading so many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Fits my original Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t shed any bristles.&lt;br /&gt;This feels same as the original brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;My face felt amount of clean as the original brush would do.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to update after 3 months to the durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;There is no con to the product as of today. What I am about to write is a testament how nicely Procizion handled a shipping mishap that happened to me. Here is the story, I ordered the product. After 2 days my order status says item delivered. I didn&#x27;t see the package at my front door or mailbox. I emailed amazon customer service. They offered refund and gave me a free 1 day shipping to order the same product again. As I was debating if I want to order from Procizion again I received email from Procizion asking the reason for requesting refund and if they can do anything to make my experience better. Sure enough I ordered from them again and love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand this is not the cheapest of the substitute brushes, the quality of the product and customer service made me a satisfied customer. Will definitely give them a chance in my future purchases.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit perfectly and are full and sift. so far I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly for my mia. Excellent quality. Fast delivery. Would order through this vendor again.</li>
            <li> These work great! The only difference from the leading brand is that they are softer so the Deep Pore Cleaning brush head is more like the Normal brush head by Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Let me lay it down for you - I am helplessly addicted to my Clairsonic.  It&#x27;s done wonders for my skin and always leaves me feeling amazing!  The one thing about it that I&#x27;m NOT addicted to is the pricey replacement brush heads.  In a desperate attempt to save myself some money, I ordered these from Amazon without very high expectations.  Much to my surprise I found that these brushes are AMAZING!  They work just as well as my Clairsonic Deep Pore Cleansing brush heads, moving and vibrating like they&#x27;re supposed to, and they&#x27;re less than half the cost!  I will definitely be restocking on these in the months to come!</li>
            <li> Work just as well as the name brand price twice as much.</li>
            <li> After trying these replacement brush heads today, I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t notice any difference between these and the originals. Of course, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it fit properly onto the device and also sounded normal.  The price is certainly better than for the original replacement brush heads!</li>
            <li> Excellent, thanks for the speedy shiment. They fit just like the original. I am enjoying the deeper cleansing motion of these pads.</li>
            <li> If you are currently paying $25 for clarasonic brush heads, STOP! This product is a fraction of the cost,  fits perfectly onto the clarasonic mia and works like magic. If anything it has slightly softer bristles and is more reminiscent of the sensitive heads than the regular.  Still keeps my complexion sparkling!</li>
            <li> I have a Mia2 and these replacement heads work great!</li>
            <li> Got my brush heads a few days after ordering. Thry work better thsn my name brand heads and cost 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are completely worthless. They don&#x27;t even spin with my clarisonic. Waste of money, buy the real thing!</li>
            <li> My fiancé has the clarisonic aria and I wanted to start using it. I was reading different reviews on the generic brushes and a lit if them said that the fit was poor. I chose this brand because it had good reviews although very few so I wasn&#x27;t quite confident in the purchase. Anyway I got the product and it works and fits perfectly! I&#x27;d definitely buy again and such a good deal compared to the Clarisonic brand.</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing a firmer brush head because the title said &amp;#34;deep pore cleaning&amp;#34;.  These brushes are even softer than the ones that come with the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Seem to be just as good as the name brand but much better price!</li>
            <li> They work alright but not as well as the clarisonic brand</li>
            <li> Fits on perfectly.  Just like the name brand.  Only problem is the head didn&#x27;t work correctly at first but all I had to do was smack the back of the wand and it started vibrating like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Brushes aren&#x27;t too hard on your face.  Just right.</li>
            <li> I got a little ahead of myself with this review, I didn&#x27;t realize they click on a little different. Good product will buy agian.  I was so excited that I found what looked like a comparable brush head for my Clarisonic. It did fit my brush but when I turned it on, the bristles on the brush head did not move or vibrate like they are supposed to. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia2. They leave my skin feeling clean, and refreshed. I would recommend these as a great alternative to the Clarisonic brand brush heads.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL with my Clarisonic MIA. I&#x27;m returning this and will just buy &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; ones from Clarisonic. I was trying to save a few dollars and now I&#x27;m ended up with more hassle. :(</li>
            <li> I am using these with my mother&#x27;s Clarisonic and I love it. I Just finished using it before I logged into my account and saw this request for the review. I was planning on doing the review later on today. It fits perfectly and does an amazing job of cleaning my face. My face feels so smooth. The bristles of the brushes are soft enough that I don&#x27;t feel them scratching or tearing my skin. And for the cost for a trial, it couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I have used the Clarisonic Mia brush for years and always loved it. I have allergies and very sensitive skin, even more so from being on Retin-A, so I have to be especially careful with facial products. I chose these Procizion brushed after reading numerous rave reviews, and I must agree. These brushes do an excellent job of cleaning my face, yet I have no irritation. The bristles are a bit softer than the Clarisonic ones, but the cleaning effect is exactly the same...and a much better price! I will continue to buy these for my Mia from now on</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived in record time (thanks Amazon), they fit my clairosonic perfectly and feel wonderful - better than the brushes that came with my clairosonic!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the expensive clairsonic versions.</li>
            <li> Awesome dupe for the real thing - long overdue! These work just as well for a fraction of what you would pay for Clarisonic brushes. A brush is a brush - an at home side-by-side comparison reveals an identical product. I am so friggin happy to ditch the stupid brand price!</li>
            <li> This item does not perform remotely as well as the Clarisonic brand. Mine went in the trash.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my mother as she has a Clarisonic Facial Cleanser brush. There is really no need to spend $25 for 1 Clarisonic branded brush head replacement when you can purchase 2 for $14.97. Essentially, you&#x27;re just paying for the &amp;#34;Clarisonic&amp;#34; labeling at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother has said that the brush heads are comparable to Clarisonic and she sees no distinctions between the 2 brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a more cost-effective method to replace facial cleansing replacement brush heads, look no further! This price point and quality can not be beat.</li>
            <li> just like the originals. work perfect</li>
            <li> These are amazing. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between the brand name and these.</li>
            <li> They fit .  They do the work.  Easy to clean.  Some instructions call for thorough cleaning per week.  I do thorough cleaning per use.  Lasts longer, folks.  And why wait for germs to grow.  Everyone (nearly everyone) rinses toothbrushes after each use...why not these.  Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  was hesitant about buying non-clarisonic brand but these actually make my skin feel softer than the clarisonic ones ever did!</li>
            <li> Seems like the original. Clean and soft!</li>
            <li> Great bargain.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d not replaced my Clarisonic head in far too long due to high cost. Well, no more!!! Brush fits perfectly. Will definitely order again!!!</li>
            <li> Is very loud on the mia2</li>
            <li> I was skeptical b.c these are cheaper than the Clarisonic brand, but they fit my Clarisonic device perfectly and seem to work great. It&#x27;s only been a week, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Not bad.  I could tell this difference between this and the ones that Clarasonic makes though.</li>
            <li> They fit perfect with my Mia 2. Definitely a great savings and value. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as the original heads, they feel scratchy on my face. Better price, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy them again as it doesn&#x27;t feel very good to use. Maybe the other types are better?</li>
            <li> These are amazing and I can&#x27;t believe the awesome price!! I will be ordering more. I&#x27;ve been using this brush since thanksgiving and its still holding up!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping (Amazon prime UPS), These are high quality brushes, the center part vibrate well, and it is most comparable to Clarisonic original brush, maybe just a tiny winy less stiffer) but  very lightly, in fact this is imperceptible. By the way, I  compared with a 2 month old original, so that may be the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a lot of replacements head for my Clarisonic Mia, in all prices range : these are not the cheaper, but they sure are the very best I tried, and to me these one really worth their price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE : I agree and understand Clarisonic devices price, but on the other hand I found the original Clarisonic brushes exceedingly expensive.... for quite a simple device.&lt;br /&gt;So I am very satisfied with these replacements and will continue with them from now on.</li>
            <li> I have the Mia 2, and they work with it just fine. Such a great less expensive alternative to buying them from Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> I went through the two \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush heads that came with my Clarisonic Mia 2, and while that did clean better than my CVS brush, it still wasn&#x27;t enough to get rid of the blackheads I&#x27;ve had for years. Before spending the money for the brand name brush heads I found these, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I have no idea how the brand name brush head for deep pore cleansing would have worked, but I don&#x27;t care. These brush heads have gotten rid of most of my blackheads, and as a result, my complexion is smoother and brighter. These brush heads are great and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Just like the expensive brand name. Love them!</li>
            <li> I love these more than the caledonia brushes, they are so soft but still get the job done!</li>
            <li> They work well with my clarisonic, and though they informed me that the listing mentions that the heads are softer than the normal Clarisonic deep pore cleansing heads, I still wish they had a stiffer option.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal &amp; actually does feel better than the expensive clarisonic refills</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to my collection for Clarisonic brushes and after reading the reviews about it not fitting with some I was concerned but figured $15.00 for two wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a loss. I really like this brush more than the original I got with my Clarisonic. The brush really gets deep into your pores and makes my skin feel softer than I&#x27;ve ever felt. I have super sensitive skin and break out very easy and was concerned this might bring up some unwanted pimples, but none so far! (knock on wood) I use this with the Clarisonic Refreshing Foaming Gel as well as an off brand cleanser I got at my local grocery store and my skin has been so clean since I&#x27;ve bought it!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!!</li>
            <li> Such a good deal! They look the same as the intended brand name replacements and seem to work just as great. I will definitely be purchasing these from now on.</li>
            <li> Better than the name brand!</li>
            <li> This item did not work. When I attached it to my Mia clarisonic, it just made a buzzing sound. I had to order the original brushes. A real waste of time &amp; money for me</li>
            <li> Brushes sucked, did not turn or vibrate as good as Clarisonic brushes. And I cannot return them because they only allow 30 day return. BOOOOO! Wast of money.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these for purchase for you Clarasonic. They do not vibrate with the brush. Not the same quality.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic.  They are just soft enough and work perfectly with my Clarisonic Aria.</li>
            <li> These are great.  They work just like the brand name ones.  I have not noticed any difference at all.</li>
            <li> Kind of a shame since I liked the quality of the brush itself. I guess it doesn&#x27;t properly fit the Mia 2 cause the middle portion of bristles that are supposed to rotate with the motor only just vibrate. I&#x27;ll be returning them since they don&#x27;t do what they&#x27;re supposed to, but the softness of the brush is definitely a plus.</li>
            <li> Good replacement for the money.</li>
            <li> These were too abrasive on my face. I could definitely tell a difference from Clarisonic. I bought the sensitive ones instead, and they seem better.</li>
            <li> They give off an odd rattle, and within a month of use, I&#x27;m noticing some kind of rust stain?  I clean it often with warm soapy water and alcohol, but as soon as I saw it again with the second one, I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these brushes.  For years I have been paying for the very expensive Clarisonic brand and had been looking for a less expensive option. I am pleased with this brand. They fit perfectily and are holding up very well. This will be where I purchase replacement brush heads going forward.</li>
            <li> Fits my Mia 2 and works just like the original brush head. It feels a little stiffer so if you have sensitive skin this may be to harsh for your skin.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Fit my Mia2 perfectly, working well.  Definitely a good choice to replace your old clarisonic brush heads.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly on my Clairsonic and are a fraction of what the name brand replacements cost. They appear to function exactly the same, I honestly cannot tell any difference in quality. I am so excited to have found a far more affordable alternative! I received a discount in order for testing and reviewing, but would not hesitate to order these again. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great and you can&#x27;t beat the price. I buy brush heads for delicate skin and these were perfect. Why would anyone pay 44.00 for a brush replacement when you can get such a great deal?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  Fast delivery</li>
            <li> One of two brushed delivered broken.</li>
            <li> Price is fabulous, and I cannot tell a difference between the Sonic brush and these. Definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Compatible as far as fitting onto the machine but definitely lacks in the vibration so not sure how it intends to clean the pores.  Returned the item for full refund without a problem.  Will order the OEM replacement head.</li>
            <li> As many people wrote these fit the machine and feel good for a lot less. Great product</li>
            <li> Works as well as expensive brand, fit was great on my ciarisonic Mia, I will definitely buy these for now on!</li>
            <li> These work great on my clarisonic. The price is incredible. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I do not have to buy an expensive replacement brush head for my Clairsonic!!! I bought one for me and one for my teen to try it.</li>
            <li> Brushes came extremely fast and as promised. Great quality. Only difference I can see between these reasonably priced brushes and the name brand is bristle length, these are the tiniest bit longer, but I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference using it!</li>
            <li> Great substitute for more expensive replacements.</li>
            <li> Definitely as good as the brand name for Clarisonic brush heads. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the clairsonic brushes! And this is a lot more header too!</li>
            <li> When I first received the replacement brush heads I was excited as they arrived extremely fast. The first use was disappointing as the brushes did not move like the original brush heads. It wasn&#x27;t until I received an email from  Procizion following up to make sure everything was working out well that I learned that you had to push down in the middle of the brush once connected in order for it to work properly. I don&#x27;t have time to return items if they don&#x27;t work so it would have just been money wasted had Procizion not reached out to me. I&#x27;m truly truly happy with the item I received, the price and quality are just awesome! I will definitely be buying my next brush heads again from Procizion. The customer service is Grrrrrrreat!</li>
            <li> Theses off brand Mia replacement brush heads don&#x27;t work right, hardly rotate or vibrate. The bristles are much softer than the bristles on the authentic brushes. I will buy brand name the next time</li>
            <li> These fit my Mia perfectly and work great. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my mia1 perfectly! There is no wobbling or unusual sound.  I was a little hesitate to try generic brushes, but the price was so good I decided to give them a try.  So glad I did!  Great seller.  Will do business with them again!</li>
            <li> These are amazing. Just as good as the name brand and much much more affordable.</li>
            <li> Guess what I&#x27;m not doing... purchasing the exact same heads from the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; manufacturer. These heads work just as good, if not better. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Just like the real ones!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit perfectly. But, they are super soft! My original brushes are still stiffer than these are. Plus, my old ones are about two years old!</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic Mia and don&#x27;t replace the brush head as often as I should because of the expense. I was leery of these non-name brand brush heads but I am so glad I tried them! they fit on the Clarisonic perfectly and the deep pore cleaning heads are even softer than my delicate skin heads from Clarisonic. I will definitely reorder!!!!! I think one of the review said something about the middle bristles moving and not the outer edge? When I saw the presentation for Clarisonic on QVC the inventor said they don&#x27;t move on purpose so it doesn&#x27;t kick cleanser up into your eyes. So don&#x27;t worry about that - it&#x27;s how the Clarisonic was designed to work.</li>
            <li> My brush is not working well with Clarisonic Aria. It isn&#x27;t vibrating as well and seems to come loose. i&#x27;m very disappointed and will be seeking to return.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect replacement brushes for my Mia2; I honestly think they even work better. They fit perfect, the center part oscillates just like the Clarisonic brand brushes. The bristles are much softer than the sensitive brushes that the Clarisonic usually comes with. The bristles are also slightly longer than the regular brushes, and they do shed when you first take them out of the box. I ran my fingers over them a couple of times to get all the loose bristles out, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding since. Let me just say, when I first bought my Clarisonic, I was kind of disappointed with the results after about a month of use. But with these brushes, my skin has cleared up and had the most amazing texture. All I changed was my brush head. For this price, I will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I am more then happy with these brush heads, they work exactly like the brand name ones with the exception that they are a little bit softer which is fine with me :). I think the price is great as the price of the brand name is ridiculous! I have some severe skin issues, so I was a bit hesitant but after using them for 2 weeks now my skin looks and feels great. I will absolutely be back for more!&lt;br /&gt;  I just received my 2nd purchase of these and could not be happier with this product :) , I plan on ordering from this company for all my future orders.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you for making a great product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> They fit just fine, but doesn&#x27;t seem to vibrate/rotate as much as with the original clairsonic brush heads. But can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Work great - compatible with my Mia.</li>
            <li> it is ok but not what the original one is.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t purchased the sonicare brand&#x27;s deep pore brush, u gotta say this has been working just fine and it&#x27;s miles and miles ahead of the sensitive brush head that came standard with my clarisonic. Even if the name brand were slightly better I&#x27;d still buy these again because I know they work well.</li>
            <li> They are what I expected at a fraction of the price and, in today&#x27;s economy,  it&#x27;s important to save where you can.  Fit is good and performs similar to others I&#x27;ve used.  The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the brush bristles are a bit longer and softer, but the design differences don&#x27;t impede performance.</li>
            <li> did not work on Mia 2</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was too good to be true, but I love this brush head.  It&#x27;s so soft! thank you for putting them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fits my Clarisonic plus perfectly!</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes feel more substantial and seem to work better than the originals.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the ladies in my life.  I had purchased the Sonicare for them but was balking at the cost  of the replacement heads.  I can personally attest to it but they say these are actually better than the original cartridge that came with the device.  It is a really pleasant surprise when a generic is better than the original, high priced item.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Medisonic cleansing device from Groupon. This device is the generic version of the Clarisonic except without the steep price tag. Unfortunately, the device only came with one sensitive brush head (Groupon made it up to me) but not the deep pore brush head. I decided to order the Groupon brush heads thinking they would be a perfect replacement for this device. After repeatedly attempting to get the brush head to oscillate, I gave up and began searching here for a true replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was relieved to find there are several vendors who sell this type of brush, of course, was concerned I would experience the same issue as the Groupon brush heads. The reason I decided on this company was due to their guarantee money back policy. This in itself was a life saver because I didn&#x27;t want to get stuck with more unusable brush heads. I received the brush heads very quickly and compared them to the Groupon brush heads. These are definitely superior in quality. Most people are looking for in a solid deep pore brush with bristles that are not so thick or super soft. I also tested the brush heads with the Medisonic device last night using my normal cleanser. I was able to easily twist these heads onto the device. If your brush head does not oscillate, be sure to apply light pressure on the middle portion of the brush head. This trick should ensure that your brush head is properly connected to the device. You only have to do this when you first install the brush head. The oscillating wasn&#x27;t loud nor did I feel my device was working &amp;#34;overtime&amp;#34; to do its job. I washed the brush head and did not experience any issues where any portion of the head was not secure to the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I retested them again this morning - just to be sure I wasn&#x27;t being over hopeful. I can honestly tell you I am ecstatic they work wonderfully. The bristles held up beautifully and did not leave any harsh abrasion feeling when I completed the cleansing. When I cleaned the brush head with my antibacterial soap, none of the bristles came off. The bristles also didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; onto the foam from the soap. I am glad I don&#x27;t have to waste extra time on this step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brand of brush heads for their quality and ability to deliver the cleansing you are seeking. You will always wonder why the heck you paid so much for ONE Clarisonic brush head.</li>
            <li> These are better than the original ones that came with the unit.  I&#x27;ll be buying again!</li>
            <li> There are compatible and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for my Clarisonic facial cleaner. Do not spend tons of money on the brand name replacement heads, these work just as well and last just as long.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH! I bought these instead of the higher priced brushes and these are way better!! I love the longer bristles and they vibrate and fit my Pro perfectly! The bristles just gave me MORE coverage, foam and a cleaner feel! This is my new brand! Make the body brush; I&#x27;ll buy it!</li>
            <li> Great brush heads!  They fit my Clarisonic better than the original brush heads.</li>
            <li> Works perfect on my Sonicare and can&#x27;t tell the difference from the $27 ones.  Will for sure buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Yep - great brush heads at a great price.  Am very happy with the performance and will purchase these again.  I have a Clarisonic Pro.</li>
            <li> It works on My Clarisonic mini! It says it&#x27;s for deep pore cleaning, but the bristles aren&#x27;t hard at all. I was worried it was going to be too rough on my face. Glad I found a cheap replacement!</li>
            <li> This is &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; with the Clairsonic in that it fits...other than that, it in no way works the same.  I removed an original Clairsonic brush and installed this one.  The difference between the two is astounding.  When I first started using the Clairsonic, it was so powerful that it almost hurt when I used it around my eyes and lips.  This brush is more of a hum, with no movement of the brush to speak of.  I did remove it and ensure that I had installed it properly so that wasn&#x27;t the issue.  Unfortunately, I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy the $25 Clairsonic brush...I was really hoping this would work.</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Mia 2 perfectly, although one of them did not seem to be working properly.  Their customer service was outstanding.  When I indicated to them that there was a problem with one of the heads, they sent me another set of replacement heads immediately without me having to return the originals.</li>
            <li> These cannot be left in the shower, even for a week, without being used - they will grow mold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It isn&#x27;t as good as the original Clarisonic brush, but you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> Not as harsh on my skin as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Great value for money. Works just as great as the Clarisonic ones for half the price.</li>
    </ol>
