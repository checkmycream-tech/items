            <li>The product smells great.  </li>
            <li>I like it because when I rinse it off, I can feel the air in my pores again lol.</li>

            <li>Love this cleanser!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Together, these products work very nicely.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with the seller each time I purchase this item, it arrives in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>DEFINELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;ve been getting weekly microdermabrasions (good deal on groupon) and the facialist helped me out by giving me a salicylic acid peel each time.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good cleanser</li>
            <li>A good product</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I will say, there is a very refreshing tingle to it...</li>
            <li>Best cleanser on the market right now.</li>
            <li>Very nice and refreshing though.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and effective.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li>And I have never ever gotten amazing results as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an amazing skin product.</li>
            <li>recipient liked it</li>
            <li>I honestly think this cleanser prevent them from coming on my face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an all purpose face wash (removing makeup, cleansing skin) then you won&#x27;t be thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>When cleansing your face, it feels really nice, providing a nice \\&quot;icy\\&quot; feeling to your face.</li>
            <li>just so it didn&#x27;t keep growing until it had its own zit-code.....</li>
            <li>Even more effective if you use it with a face scrubber.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>I then tone my face (very important step) as this gets rid of all the sloughed off skin.</li>
            <li>Wow it amazing!!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is an astonishing product.  </li>
            <li>Salicylic acid burns, especially at higher concentrations like this product claims to contain.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better, and I am so very happy with the product that I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>so i guess the next best thing is to get the salicylic acid myself.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m really glad i found this product.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;).</li>
            <li>and I will update this post after I&#x27;m sure of its effects on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and tingly feeling of this wash, however, it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve was using the Skinceutical Clarifiying cleanser with 2%, but can&#x27;t find it any more.  </li>
            <li>Most of my pimples and cysts are gone now</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling feeling when u put it on</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love al</li>
            <li>but their salicylic peels are better.  </li>
            <li>A better alternative to this face wash to me if you&#x27;re looking for both is the Dessert Essence cleaning face wash with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>But, I was hoping for something more abrasive.</li>
            <li>If you are a weenie, you might not be able to take it, but I think it is a tolerable tingle/sting.</li>
            <li>I think of it more like a cooling tingle.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff works well for my acne prone skin would reccomend</li>
            <li>cleanser is awesome, its makes my face so soft yet clean.</li>
            <li>I am not noticing great improvement or even decent exfoliation properties.</li>
            <li>this product can be drying so use a good moisturizer afterwards or you will peel &amp; flake &amp; that ain&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>i use decleor hydra floral.it has a light, lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I scar easily.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Although it does have a really strong tingling sensation that lasts about 10 minutes, and I basically feel like I have my face in an ice bucket.</li>
            <li>very potent for acne but gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>my skin has never looked better, and I am pretty vain!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day for 4 days and see a HUGE difference in the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li>Your diet also is what plays a huge role in your skins beauty.</li>
            <li>My skin is starting to look healthier and I am sooo happy.</li>
            <li>my skin feels smooth after using it</li>
            <li>fantastic price , fantastic product.</li>
            <li>follow this with Neutrogena&#x27;s alcohol free toner and Simple/Cetaphil moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do a light wash then leave on for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Sanitas Zapper spot treatment and it has cleared up all acne for me, so far so good.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for older skin .</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t feel the normal tingling that you feel with most acne products and it also did not have that many exfoliating beads in it</li>
            <li>I did like the strong lemony smell it has and the long-lasting cool, clean feeling it gives.  </li>
            <li>There is a remarkable difference in my skin using this product versus what is available in stores- only 2%.</li>
            <li>No lather or clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Feels cool &amp; fresh on skin and cleans well!</li>
            <li>I say its probably most effective on mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>just moisten skin, put on product, leave on 5 minutes and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>It truely delivers what it said it does.</li>
            <li>It works almost like having a mild salicylic peel.</li>
            <li>First off, the cleanser does NOT foam up, meaning you have to keep adding more to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>Makes you skin feel clean and refreshed and really gets your face clean of oils and makeup.  </li>
            <li>I used it during a Trentinoin regimen, and it was a bit too harsh, although it did a great job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m going to make my own from fruits and milk and save money.</li>
            <li>because I was goin on accutane and would be using insanely high %&#x27;s of strong ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The refreshing feel of the teatree oil in the product makes your skin feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li>A very strong facial cleanser, much like a mild chemical peel.</li>
            <li>Pretty much had my parents pay for a lot of acne treatments, but I never really got results as good as using this Salicylic Acid cleanser.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember how I found it exactly.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for about a month now, and my acne is pretty much gone!</li>
            <li>When I first applied this product it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li>but no numbness like the first time..</li>
            <li>For those interested, it smells and feels sort of like Noxema on your face, and it is not a foaming</li>
            <li>When I first used this product i didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>i have been plagued by a million tiny bumps, mostly along my jawline.</li>
            <li>Has a very menthol fresh feel to it.</li>
            <li>Finally a cleanser for acne that has enough salicylic acid in it to make a difference and truly be effective for acne prone skin!  </li>
            <li>Thank you for making this available for people like me that need professional strength products.</li>
            <li>I CAN FEEL PRETTY.</li>
            <li>I think a 10 or 20% peel left on for a minute or two would be better fopr what they are looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure to leave on face mixed with bit of water for 10 minutes or longer before scrubbing or rinsing gently off.</li>
            <li>Until I found this product what took me almost 5 months to clear out on my own took this product only 4 days .</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, it really burnt; but as I kept using it, the burning sensation subsided.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it is too strong for the face on a regular.</li>
            <li>The peel is strong so he only leaves it on for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews I thought the product would be strong or more than lotion in a bottle with tiny pieces of confetti.  </li>
            <li>If it really contained 15% salicylic acid, why would it not list this concentration on the bottle?</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product has caused it or something else.</li>
            <li>so it really depends on the skin type.</li>
            <li>this product really works .</li>
            <li>am still experimenting with it; therefore, I cannot really say much about this product.</li>
            <li>, I have found something that actually REALLY works.</li>
            <li>I still get hormonal cystic acne and at this age, still have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, it BURNED like holy hell, but after about a week, it was more of a really intense menthol tingle.</li>
            <li>I then rinse it off with cool water and this instantly stops the tingling.</li>
            <li>Cool if you just have regular acne but otherwise pass it up.</li>
            <li>First, I had oily skin, and hormonal adult acne.  </li>
            <li>This product after only 4 uses, is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>My black heads are not any better with this product either.</li>
            <li>I did purchase for my 3 teenagers and it hasnt helped with their acne at all so its either mainly for cysts or older adults.</li>
            <li>and i guess my hormones are in flux since i&#x27;m getting older? &#x3D;</li>
            <li>It started in my senior yr of high school, and I had acne throughout my college life.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>you do build up a  slight tolerance so start easy if it stings too much in the beginning.</li>
            <li>noticed a remarkable but a slight improvement of acne due to hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>Powerful cleanser that gets deep into the pores.</li>
            <li>i would say it has cleared up the bumps by 80%!&lt;br /&gt;the instructions on the bottle say to use daily, but it may be too strong if you leave it on too long, especially on sensitive skin like i have.</li>
            <li>I know what it feels like, and when I put this on my skin it felt so much more tame in comparison</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it does with younger aged skin (13-20) since that type responds better to BP but for older skin its a must have.</li>
            <li>I seriously bought 2 more bottles after the first week of use.</li>
            <li>I tend to get new acne after I wash my face with this product</li>
            <li>I CAN LIVE AGAIN.</li>
            <li>I might have to use it for a few more weeks before I am 100% clear and then maintain, but nothing has ever put a dent on my back-acne before.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve never had &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; skin, but it had been smooth sailing for a while (with just the occasional pimple here &amp; there) until recently.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect middle ground between harsh face peels like the HQ+ and 2% acne washes that don&#x27;t have enough kick for the average person suffering acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking this won&#x27;t last very long since so much has to be used to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but I notice that I go through it much slower than I did my old cleanser</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had a SINGLE pimple in 3 whole weeks!!</li>
            <li>I usual dampen my face with luke warm water, then i applied a nickle size and spread it all over my face, then leave on for about ten minutes before wash off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strong for my boyfriend, he has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this virtually eliminate new breakouts, it really helped clear my skin and evened the tone.</li>
            <li>which clearly states that Proactive is only intended for mild to moderate acne AND in the list of types of acne it helps, it does NOT mention cystic acne anywhere.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still clear.</li>
            <li>MY FACE IS ALMOST 100% CLEAR.</li>
            <li>I LITERALLY COULD CRY BECAUSE IM SO OVERWHELMED WITH HOW CLEAR MY SKIN IS.</li>
            <li>, ordered natural witch hazel (toner), and bought Cereve (i think its called that) creme to hydrate my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;- use the natural witch hazel toner with a cotton ball</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re meant to exfoliate, but they are like tiny shards of glass and really do tear the skin.</li>
            <li>, I felt like it couldn&#x27;t be anywhere near 15% salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>So far this routine is doing wonders for my face *</li>
            <li>But I was a bit surprised that it wouldn&#x27;t lather up.  </li>
            <li>however it hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up my skin</li>
            <li>save your money by buying it directly from its website.</li>
            <li>#34;I have adult acne anymore because I don&#x27;t get the cystic ones anymore&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into natural smells</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind that feeling, but I know some people are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it to someone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But my face is too sensitive for peels.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the minty freshness when applied to my face.</li>
            <li>TWENTY (20) years old</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old young.</li>
            <li>I must not have sensitive skin because I am experience no dryness at all.</li>
            <li>I have been dealing with adult acne for some time.</li>
            <li>I created a frankenstein version of the proactiv 3 step system using random products that had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In between i use this soap free cream cleanser to prevent any excessive dryness from the \\&quot;peel\\&quot;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I had got used to being a normal human without zits at freaking 26 years old.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer, it is purging some of the old bacteria out, to be expected.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my skin so fast, and I have tried many expensive products with no results.  </li>
            <li>I am finally getting a chance to use the lightening serums I had stocked up for when my acne stops to clear my acne</li>
            <li>He only has minor flaking as he doesn&#x27;t leave it on for very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im a 43 yr old female thats ALWAYS had acne.</li>
            <li>When applied it to my wet face it would slide off so much that by the time i rinsed my face, it felt like i didnt apply anything at all.</li>
            <li>just can&#x27;t be thankful enough that I came across this one day on amazon when I got curious to see if they sold anything with a higher salicylic acid percentage.</li>
            <li>For example, if you were to go into a drug store and pick up a bottle of Neutrogena cleanser with 2% salicylic acid, on the back of the bottle there would be a box labeled &amp;#34;drug facts&amp;#34; listing salicylic acid as the active ingredient along with its concentration (2%), usage (&amp;#34;for treating acne&amp;#34;), warnings, etc.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I actually have acne cysts and not black or white heads or even the bumps that appear on the surface.</li>
            <li>Had it through college too - fun stuff, I remember hating it, not wanting to go out - the usual stuff.</li>
            <li>I now apply the cleanser to my dry skin like a mask (not recommended for sensitive skin) and i let it sit until i feel a tingling/slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive so it didn&#x27;t dry out or peel as some others</li>
            <li>Naturally as a college student I tried every single thing I could lay my hands on.</li>

            <li> A good product</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I will say, there is a very refreshing tingle to it...</li>
            <li> Best cleanser on the market right now.</li>
            <li> Very nice and refreshing though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and effective.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> And I have never ever gotten amazing results as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an amazing skin product.</li>
            <li> recipient liked it</li>
            <li> I honestly think this cleanser prevent them from coming on my face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an all purpose face wash (removing makeup, cleansing skin) then you won&#x27;t be thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> When cleansing your face, it feels really nice, providing a nice \\&quot;icy\\&quot; feeling to your face.</li>
            <li> just so it didn&#x27;t keep growing until it had its own zit-code.....</li>
            <li> Even more effective if you use it with a face scrubber.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> I then tone my face (very important step) as this gets rid of all the sloughed off skin.</li>
            <li> Wow it amazing!!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is an astonishing product.  </li>
            <li> Salicylic acid burns, especially at higher concentrations like this product claims to contain.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better, and I am so very happy with the product that I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> so i guess the next best thing is to get the salicylic acid myself.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really glad i found this product.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> and I will update this post after I&#x27;m sure of its effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and tingly feeling of this wash, however, it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve was using the Skinceutical Clarifiying cleanser with 2%, but can&#x27;t find it any more.  </li>
            <li> Most of my pimples and cysts are gone now</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the tingling feeling when u put it on</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love al</li>
            <li> but their salicylic peels are better.  </li>
            <li> A better alternative to this face wash to me if you&#x27;re looking for both is the Dessert Essence cleaning face wash with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> But, I was hoping for something more abrasive.</li>
            <li> If you are a weenie, you might not be able to take it, but I think it is a tolerable tingle/sting.</li>
            <li> I think of it more like a cooling tingle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works well for my acne prone skin would reccomend</li>
            <li> cleanser is awesome, its makes my face so soft yet clean.</li>
            <li> I am not noticing great improvement or even decent exfoliation properties.</li>
            <li> this product can be drying so use a good moisturizer afterwards or you will peel &amp; flake &amp; that ain&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li> i use decleor hydra floral.it has a light, lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I scar easily.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Although it does have a really strong tingling sensation that lasts about 10 minutes, and I basically feel like I have my face in an ice bucket.</li>
            <li> very potent for acne but gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> my skin has never looked better, and I am pretty vain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day for 4 days and see a HUGE difference in the appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> Your diet also is what plays a huge role in your skins beauty.</li>
            <li> My skin is starting to look healthier and I am sooo happy.</li>
            <li> my skin feels smooth after using it</li>
            <li> fantastic price , fantastic product.</li>
            <li> follow this with Neutrogena&#x27;s alcohol free toner and Simple/Cetaphil moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do a light wash then leave on for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Sanitas Zapper spot treatment and it has cleared up all acne for me, so far so good.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for older skin .</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t feel the normal tingling that you feel with most acne products and it also did not have that many exfoliating beads in it</li>
            <li> I did like the strong lemony smell it has and the long-lasting cool, clean feeling it gives.  </li>
            <li> There is a remarkable difference in my skin using this product versus what is available in stores- only 2%.</li>
            <li> No lather or clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Feels cool &amp; fresh on skin and cleans well!</li>
            <li> I say its probably most effective on mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> just moisten skin, put on product, leave on 5 minutes and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> It truely delivers what it said it does.</li>
            <li> It works almost like having a mild salicylic peel.</li>
            <li> First off, the cleanser does NOT foam up, meaning you have to keep adding more to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> Makes you skin feel clean and refreshed and really gets your face clean of oils and makeup.  </li>
            <li> I used it during a Trentinoin regimen, and it was a bit too harsh, although it did a great job of cleaning my skin.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m going to make my own from fruits and milk and save money.</li>
            <li> because I was goin on accutane and would be using insanely high %&#x27;s of strong ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The refreshing feel of the teatree oil in the product makes your skin feel extra clean.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> A very strong facial cleanser, much like a mild chemical peel.</li>
            <li> Pretty much had my parents pay for a lot of acne treatments, but I never really got results as good as using this Salicylic Acid cleanser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember how I found it exactly.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about a month now, and my acne is pretty much gone!</li>
            <li> When I first applied this product it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> but no numbness like the first time..</li>
            <li> For those interested, it smells and feels sort of like Noxema on your face, and it is not a foaming</li>
            <li> When I first used this product i didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> i have been plagued by a million tiny bumps, mostly along my jawline.</li>
            <li> Has a very menthol fresh feel to it.</li>
            <li> Finally a cleanser for acne that has enough salicylic acid in it to make a difference and truly be effective for acne prone skin!  </li>
            <li> Thank you for making this available for people like me that need professional strength products.</li>
            <li> I CAN FEEL PRETTY.</li>
            <li> I think a 10 or 20% peel left on for a minute or two would be better fopr what they are looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> make sure to leave on face mixed with bit of water for 10 minutes or longer before scrubbing or rinsing gently off.</li>
            <li> Until I found this product what took me almost 5 months to clear out on my own took this product only 4 days .</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, it really burnt; but as I kept using it, the burning sensation subsided.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it is too strong for the face on a regular.</li>
            <li> The peel is strong so he only leaves it on for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I thought the product would be strong or more than lotion in a bottle with tiny pieces of confetti.  </li>
            <li> If it really contained 15% salicylic acid, why would it not list this concentration on the bottle?</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product has caused it or something else.</li>
            <li> so it really depends on the skin type.</li>
            <li> this product really works .</li>
            <li> am still experimenting with it; therefore, I cannot really say much about this product.</li>
            <li> , I have found something that actually REALLY works.</li>
            <li> I still get hormonal cystic acne and at this age, still have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, it BURNED like holy hell, but after about a week, it was more of a really intense menthol tingle.</li>
            <li> I then rinse it off with cool water and this instantly stops the tingling.</li>
            <li> Cool if you just have regular acne but otherwise pass it up.</li>
            <li> First, I had oily skin, and hormonal adult acne.  </li>
            <li> This product after only 4 uses, is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> My black heads are not any better with this product either.</li>
            <li> I did purchase for my 3 teenagers and it hasnt helped with their acne at all so its either mainly for cysts or older adults.</li>
            <li> and i guess my hormones are in flux since i&#x27;m getting older? &#x3D;</li>
            <li> It started in my senior yr of high school, and I had acne throughout my college life.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> you do build up a  slight tolerance so start easy if it stings too much in the beginning.</li>
            <li> noticed a remarkable but a slight improvement of acne due to hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> Powerful cleanser that gets deep into the pores.</li>
            <li> i would say it has cleared up the bumps by 80%!&lt;br /&gt;the instructions on the bottle say to use daily, but it may be too strong if you leave it on too long, especially on sensitive skin like i have.</li>
            <li> I know what it feels like, and when I put this on my skin it felt so much more tame in comparison</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it does with younger aged skin (13-20) since that type responds better to BP but for older skin its a must have.</li>
            <li> I seriously bought 2 more bottles after the first week of use.</li>
            <li> I tend to get new acne after I wash my face with this product</li>
            <li> I CAN LIVE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I might have to use it for a few more weeks before I am 100% clear and then maintain, but nothing has ever put a dent on my back-acne before.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never had &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; skin, but it had been smooth sailing for a while (with just the occasional pimple here &amp; there) until recently.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect middle ground between harsh face peels like the HQ+ and 2% acne washes that don&#x27;t have enough kick for the average person suffering acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking this won&#x27;t last very long since so much has to be used to clean my face.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but I notice that I go through it much slower than I did my old cleanser</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a SINGLE pimple in 3 whole weeks!!</li>
            <li> I usual dampen my face with luke warm water, then i applied a nickle size and spread it all over my face, then leave on for about ten minutes before wash off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strong for my boyfriend, he has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this virtually eliminate new breakouts, it really helped clear my skin and evened the tone.</li>
            <li> which clearly states that Proactive is only intended for mild to moderate acne AND in the list of types of acne it helps, it does NOT mention cystic acne anywhere.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still clear.</li>
            <li> MY FACE IS ALMOST 100% CLEAR.</li>
            <li> I LITERALLY COULD CRY BECAUSE IM SO OVERWHELMED WITH HOW CLEAR MY SKIN IS.</li>
            <li> , ordered natural witch hazel (toner), and bought Cereve (i think its called that) creme to hydrate my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;- use the natural witch hazel toner with a cotton ball</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re meant to exfoliate, but they are like tiny shards of glass and really do tear the skin.</li>
            <li> , I felt like it couldn&#x27;t be anywhere near 15% salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> So far this routine is doing wonders for my face *</li>
            <li> But I was a bit surprised that it wouldn&#x27;t lather up.  </li>
            <li> however it hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up my skin</li>
            <li> save your money by buying it directly from its website.</li>
            <li> #34;I have adult acne anymore because I don&#x27;t get the cystic ones anymore&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into natural smells</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that feeling, but I know some people are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it to someone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But my face is too sensitive for peels.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the minty freshness when applied to my face.</li>
            <li> TWENTY (20) years old</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old young.</li>
            <li> I must not have sensitive skin because I am experience no dryness at all.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with adult acne for some time.</li>
            <li> I created a frankenstein version of the proactiv 3 step system using random products that had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In between i use this soap free cream cleanser to prevent any excessive dryness from the \\&quot;peel\\&quot;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I had got used to being a normal human without zits at freaking 26 years old.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is much clearer, it is purging some of the old bacteria out, to be expected.</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my skin so fast, and I have tried many expensive products with no results.  </li>
            <li> I am finally getting a chance to use the lightening serums I had stocked up for when my acne stops to clear my acne</li>
            <li> He only has minor flaking as he doesn&#x27;t leave it on for very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im a 43 yr old female thats ALWAYS had acne.</li>
            <li> When applied it to my wet face it would slide off so much that by the time i rinsed my face, it felt like i didnt apply anything at all.</li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t be thankful enough that I came across this one day on amazon when I got curious to see if they sold anything with a higher salicylic acid percentage.</li>
            <li> For example, if you were to go into a drug store and pick up a bottle of Neutrogena cleanser with 2% salicylic acid, on the back of the bottle there would be a box labeled &amp;#34;drug facts&amp;#34; listing salicylic acid as the active ingredient along with its concentration (2%), usage (&amp;#34;for treating acne&amp;#34;), warnings, etc.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I actually have acne cysts and not black or white heads or even the bumps that appear on the surface.</li>
            <li> Had it through college too - fun stuff, I remember hating it, not wanting to go out - the usual stuff.</li>
            <li> I now apply the cleanser to my dry skin like a mask (not recommended for sensitive skin) and i let it sit until i feel a tingling/slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive so it didn&#x27;t dry out or peel as some others</li>
            <li> Naturally as a college student I tried every single thing I could lay my hands on.</li>
            <li> cyst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to this is that the salicylic acid level is SO much higher than normal store retail brands offer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s definitely something you should use everyday.</li>
            <li> have really dry flaky skin and this cleanser does not dry my skin at all.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try it again the next day and did not leave it on that long and the tingling was there</li>
            <li> but luckily enough it did not seem to make my skin any dryer or give me dry patches.</li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE ACNE PRODUCT IN JUST WALMART OR TARGET HAS ONLY 2%.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am writing a review for a product, because this thing definitely deserves one!&lt;br /&gt;I have had pretty bad acne from 6 years.</li>
            <li> I was reading some where that a few people were trying skin peels to remove old layers of sebum from their scalps to try and reverse their baldness.</li>
            <li> It may not suit some with overly sensitive skin, but thats when you should use less!</li>
            <li> I started breaking out because essentially my skin was bein exfoliated but the sloughed of skin just built up on my skin due to the lack of suds, and the ineffective exfoliant beads in the product.</li>
            <li> This product I would recommend for both facial and pore problems, along with cleaning the scalp or other areas of the skin.</li>
            <li> I was worried about using this because I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and my face seems to be clearing up.</li>
            <li> then a few months later, it came back.</li>
            <li> The store brands only contain 2% salicylic acid which is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Overall a average product.</li>
            <li> Since middle school - the cystic kind plus the annoying stuff on the surface, both have left a few scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had facial peels/treatments containing less than 15% salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> The results show after a few minutes when you dry your face off, less redness (salicylic acid does that), and smaller pores, with some actually being cleaned out.</li>
            <li> Then it came back a few months later - definitely less</li>
            <li> even when I have one, its just a little pimple... not a deep skin</li>
            <li> I was watching that Sandra Bullock movie where she goes to rehab for 28 days feeling absolutely horrendous as my acne got worse everyday (just before i started my 3rd course).</li>
            <li> I have spent HUNDREDS of $$ at the dermatologist on medicine, tetracycling, creams, washes, ETC, ETC, ETC.</li>
            <li> I had something serious going on both internally and externally showing in my skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read a review that stated there was no salicylic acid percentage listed on the bottle, but my skin was acting up so much (due to a new medicine I&#x27;ve been on)</li>
            <li> I was on some message boards that suggested this other face wash</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to write up my routine in the off chance someone finds it while watching a sandra bullock movie because they didn&#x27;t feel like going out with zits... and may be willing to try something random and different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While salicylic acid is listed on the bottle as the &amp;#34;active ingredient&amp;#34; in this product, there is no percentage specified, as with other products.</li>
            <li> The was is a little harsh for my aging skin, so I&#x27;m going to back off to every other day.</li>
            <li> she didn&#x27;t mention the strength of the salicylic acid, but every time after my session with her my skin clears up a lot for the next few days and then the million little bumps return.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe there is nothing in this bottle with an active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Its really tingly, a bit uncomfortable for me after a minute or two.</li>
            <li> and now i&#x27;m down to maybe a hundred bumps instead of a million</li>
            <li> The feel of this is a watered down cream with exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> I started using this, and it calmed down my face in 3 days</li>
            <li> cools a little bit, but I believe it is all due to the menthol listed in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This odd mish-mash of products seems to have worked.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and less break outs.</li>
            <li> I noticed my pores and black heads</li>
            <li> and I tried everything from proactive to black soap nothing worked.</li>
            <li> However, I did not see any change and I am serious about facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> Like mentioned in previous reviews this cleanser works quite well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let me start from the beginning, I&#x27;ve always had acne. Since middle school - the cystic kind plus the annoying stuff on the surface, both have left a few scars. I tried anti biotics for a decade beginning in HS. Had it through college too - fun stuff, I remember hating it, not wanting to go out - the usual stuff. Finally I went on Accutane a year or so after college. 6 month course, worked like a dream. Then it came back a few months later - definitely less but still there. Went on a second course, cleared up (religiously used pro activ in preperation for going off it) - then a few months later, it came back. I guess because of 2 years of relative clarity - when it came back it felt even worse (not really cystic anymore but noticeable and was leaving marks again)! I had got used to being a normal human without zits at freaking 26 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I went on a third course and decided I needed to find something else, a face wash of some sort I could use while on the third course that would work when I got off of it. Along came this little bottle. I don&#x27;t remember how I found it exactly. I was watching that Sandra Bullock movie where she goes to rehab for 28 days feeling absolutely horrendous as my acne got worse everyday (just before i started my 3rd course). I was on some message boards that suggested this other face wash and I think amazon&#x27;s wonderous prediction engine suggested this stuff too. After reading the reviews I thought at this point what do I have to lose? I created a frankenstein version of the proactiv 3 step system using random products that had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered this (scrub) planned to use it with the Olay circular exfoliating brush, immediately drove to CVS to get the 15% benzoil peroxide cream (after pausing the bullock movie - i also bought raisenettes, because why not? I was already feeling sorry for myself), ordered natural witch hazel (toner), and bought Cereve (i think its called that) creme to hydrate my skin because I was goin on accutane and would be using insanely high %&#x27;s of strong ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been off my 3rd course for 4 months and it&#x27;s still clear. I may get one or two randomly but I force myself not to mess with it, or panic and change my routine. This odd mish-mash of products seems to have worked. I think it would help you even if you don&#x27;t want to go on accutane - for the couple months leading up to my 3rd course, it was lessening some with just these products. So what the heck, try it - or don&#x27;t! I have been meaning to write up my routine in the off chance someone finds it while watching a sandra bullock movie because they didn&#x27;t feel like going out with zits... and may be willing to try something random and different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I start with this infinite 15% sal. acid (i leave it on for a couple of minutes and avoid corner of the mouth as it can cause flaking)&lt;br /&gt;- Then I use the olay brush to buff the cleanser in my skin a bit, and wash it off&lt;br /&gt;- Then I put a tiny amount of that 15% benzoil cream you can get at a drugstore, rub that in for a minute, and wash off&lt;br /&gt;- use the natural witch hazel toner with a cotton ball&lt;br /&gt;- use the Cerave cream moisturizer (not lotion), to finish it off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wierd, and alot, but whatever - it works for me, for now.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about a month now, and my acne is pretty much gone! Neutrogena facewashes didn&#x27;t cut it with only 2% Salicylic Acid; this one actually reduces acne. It doesn&#x27;t foam up at all which was slightly disappointing as I like a nice lather, but hey, it works. I definitely recommend this face wash.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, almost like a mask without the drying my face out.</li>
            <li> I was worried about using this because I have dry skin but luckily enough it did not seem to make my skin any dryer or give me dry patches. This is a good product. I have been using it a week and can see results. My skin is smoother and less break outs. When I first applied this product it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I couldn&#x27;t feel the normal tingling that you feel with most acne products and it also did not have that many exfoliating beads in it so I after rubbing it in I decided to leave it on for maybe 3 to 5 minutes. Boy, I felt a ton of tingling and also some weird numbness around the mouth area so I freaked out and thought I was possibly allergic but I decided to try it again the next day and did not leave it on that long and the tingling was there but no numbness like the first time.. So since then I&#x27;ve been using it daily and I love it. My skin is starting to look healthier and I am sooo happy.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product thinking it was an after wash application, instead I found out it was a wash lotion. It was my fault for not reading the products application directions at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> Im a 43 yr old female thats ALWAYS had acne. Ive tried everything non prescription as well as prescription and NOTHING has worked. I have oily skin. I actually have acne cysts and not black or white heads or even the bumps that appear on the surface. Mine are deep painful cysts that just will not go away. Ive been using this product for 2 mths now and havent had even the slightest acne. TRY THIS ONE !!!!!!! I did purchase for my 3 teenagers and it hasnt helped with their acne at all so its either mainly for cysts or older adults.</li>
            <li> Powerful cleanser that gets deep into the pores. It works almost like having a mild salicylic peel. Works great on acne.</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;nt help just burns my face and didnt help with acne. Seller is slow shipping products also. Save your money!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true. The seller is VERY slow to ship.&lt;br /&gt;I could do without the blue granules. They are terribly scratchy. I think they&#x27;re meant to exfoliate, but they are like tiny shards of glass and really do tear the skin.</li>
            <li> This is an astonishing product.  It has cleared up my skin so fast, and I have tried many expensive products with no results.  This is the last product I will need in my skin care regime.  The price can&#x27;t be beat, either.  I have shared with my daughters and they are also anxious to buy the product, after seeing what it has done for me.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER TRIED- AND I HAVE TRIED MANY!!!!! CLEARS UP ACNE AND LIGHTENS SCARS AND REDNESS- AWESOME PRODUCT. DEFINELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> but it is too strong for the face on a regular. just once a week, that&#x27;s all anyone needs. I had something serious going on both internally and externally showing in my skin. I dealt with the external part with this, and will keep using it on occasion, and can focus on the internal stuff, before I break out again. My back is ridiculous, but its improved in just a few weeks, but I do have to use it everyday there. I project I might have to use it for a few more weeks before I am 100% clear and then maintain, but nothing has ever put a dent on my back-acne before.</li>
            <li> This product/company is shady to say the least. I was skeptical when I read a review that stated there was no salicylic acid percentage listed on the bottle, but my skin was acting up so much (due to a new medicine I&#x27;ve been on) that I wanted to believe this was legit and that it would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My aunt is an aesthetician and I&#x27;ve used plenty of salicylic acid products in the past. I&#x27;ve had facial peels/treatments containing less than 15% salicylic acid. I know what it feels like, and when I put this on my skin it felt so much more tame in comparison, I felt like it couldn&#x27;t be anywhere near 15% salicylic acid. Salicylic acid burns, especially at higher concentrations like this product claims to contain. This product tingles/cools a little bit, but I believe it is all due to the menthol listed in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While salicylic acid is listed on the bottle as the &amp;#34;active ingredient&amp;#34; in this product, there is no percentage specified, as with other products. Salicylic acid is considered a &amp;#34;drug&amp;#34; by the FDA, and its concentration should be labeled in the designated &amp;#34;drug facts&amp;#34; panel somewhere on the packaging. For example, if you were to go into a drug store and pick up a bottle of Neutrogena cleanser with 2% salicylic acid, on the back of the bottle there would be a box labeled &amp;#34;drug facts&amp;#34; listing salicylic acid as the active ingredient along with its concentration (2%), usage (&amp;#34;for treating acne&amp;#34;), warnings, etc. This is all required by the FDA, yet this product does not list a concentration, usage, or warnings. If it really contained 15% salicylic acid, why would it not list this concentration on the bottle?</li>
            <li> This works great! make sure to leave on face mixed with bit of water for 10 minutes or longer before scrubbing or rinsing gently off. Then layer of dead skin will come off after it sits on your face at least 10 minutes or longer. Next time I&#x27;m going to make my own from fruits and milk and save money.Thats how its made from fruit acid, you can smell lemons in the clenaser too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It may not suit some with overly sensitive skin, but thats when you should use less! I noticed my pores and black heads deceased dramatically within a week of usage!  Ive tried over the counter products and even stuff from Clinique and Saphora and nothing has made a big difference as this product. I definitely recommend this product and for the price you can&#x27;t really go wrong!</li>
            <li> A very strong facial cleanser, much like a mild chemical peel. I used it during a Trentinoin regimen, and it was a bit too harsh, although it did a great job of cleaning my skin. Unfortunately, using this product with my prescription regimen left my skin raw and over exfoliated, so I had to go to a basic 2% salicylic acid treatment. Still, if you suffer from acne, I would recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I had terrible acne scarring and constantly picked at my skin because of it. Not only does this virtually eliminate new breakouts, it really helped clear my skin and evened the tone. For those interested, it smells and feels sort of like Noxema on your face, and it is not a foaming cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice per day (probably a quarter-sized amount) and and pair it with a glycolic acid mask 2-3 times per week. It had worked wonders; I wish I had taken a before and after picture. The best part is...it only took about a week to see a significant difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit pricey, but I notice that I go through it much slower than I did my old cleanser (Neutrogena grapefruit). I haven&#x27;t found anything that works better, and I am so very happy with the product that I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product i didn&#x27;t like it. It has a thin, watery consistency. When applied it to my wet face it would slide off so much that by the time i rinsed my face, it felt like i didnt apply anything at all. I started breaking out because essentially my skin was bein exfoliated but the sloughed of skin just built up on my skin due to the lack of suds, and the ineffective exfoliant beads in the product. So ive revamped the way I use it. I now use it sort-of as a skin peel. I now apply the cleanser to my dry skin like a mask (not recommended for sensitive skin) and i let it sit until i feel a tingling/slight burning sensation. I then rinse it off with cool water and this instantly stops the tingling. I then tone my face (very important step) as this gets rid of all the sloughed off skin. Afterwards i apply grapeseed oil (non comedogenic) immediately to combat any drying. I do this 2-3x a week. In between i use this soap free cream cleanser to prevent any excessive dryness from the \\&quot;peel\\&quot;[[ASIN:B0057ZPIEG Retinol Anti-Aging Cream Cleanser]] .This cleanser is awesome, its makes my face so soft yet clean. So far this routine is doing wonders for my face *knocks on wood*.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never had &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; skin, but it had been smooth sailing for a while (with just the occasional pimple here &amp; there) until recently. i have been plagued by a million tiny bumps, mostly along my jawline. there are a few that are big and painful as well. from what i understand, this is hormonal and i guess my hormones are in flux since i&#x27;m getting older? &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;anywhoo, i&#x27;ve been getting weekly microdermabrasions (good deal on groupon) and the facialist helped me out by giving me a salicylic acid peel each time. she didn&#x27;t mention the strength of the salicylic acid, but every time after my session with her my skin clears up a lot for the next few days and then the million little bumps return.&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t afford weekly microdermabrasions and peels without the groupon so i guess the next best thing is to get the salicylic acid myself. i&#x27;m really glad i found this product. i have been faithfully using it for 2 weeks and now i&#x27;m down to maybe a hundred bumps instead of a million &#x3D;). i would say it has cleared up the bumps by 80%!&lt;br /&gt;the instructions on the bottle say to use daily, but it may be too strong if you leave it on too long, especially on sensitive skin like i have. you do build up a  slight tolerance so start easy if it stings too much in the beginning. this product can be drying so use a good moisturizer afterwards or you will peel &amp; flake &amp; that ain&#x27;t pretty. i use decleor hydra floral.it has a light, lovely scent.</li>
            <li> gift. recipient liked it</li>
            <li> I tend to get new acne after I wash my face with this product but I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product has caused it or something else. So I&#x27;m omitting this product from my skincare regime at the moment. Will try this again after I get my acne under control and I will update this post after I&#x27;m sure of its effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and tingly feeling of this wash, however, it did nothing for me. I am 39 and non-cystic acne, just little bumps and blackheads.  I would not recommend if you have this type of acne.</li>
            <li> I was thinking that this cleanser would be a be thicker than it was.  I did like the strong lemony smell it has and the long-lasting cool, clean feeling it gives.  But I was a bit surprised that it wouldn&#x27;t lather up.  I&#x27;m thinking this won&#x27;t last very long since so much has to be used to clean my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a day for 4 days and see a HUGE difference in the appearance of my pores. I&#x27;ve was using the Skinceutical Clarifiying cleanser with 2%, but can&#x27;t find it any more.  This cleanser is amazing!  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for older skin . I&#x27;m 33&lt;br /&gt;and this product saved me from these atrocious stress pimples and cystic acne that just wouldn&#x27;t go away and I tried everything from proactive to black soap nothing worked. I ended up having to hide under foundation which  I&#x27;ve never gotten used to wear. Until I found this product what took me almost 5 months to clear out on my own took this product only 4 days . Most of my pimples and cysts are gone now I just have bad scarring left but I&#x27;m working on that. I don&#x27;t know how it does with younger aged skin (13-20) since that type responds better to BP but for older skin its a must have. I started out washing my face twice a day with cold water and now I am working my way down to once a day and eventually once a week. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive so it didn&#x27;t dry out or peel as some others so it really depends on the skin type. I will definitely buy another bottle when I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, and my face seems to be clearing up. The first few times I used it, it BURNED like holy hell, but after about a week, it was more of a really intense menthol tingle.</li>
            <li> I love the tingling feeling when u put it on however it hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up my skin</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews I thought the product would be strong or more than lotion in a bottle with tiny pieces of confetti.  No effect at all.  It does not say 15% salicylic acid on the bottle. I believe there is nothing in this bottle with an active ingredients.  No lather or clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Has a very menthol fresh feel to it. That said, of course beware around your eyes. I think it does great at cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Not noticed a remarkable but a slight improvement of acne due to hormonal acne. I say its probably most effective on mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> this product really works . very potent for acne but gentle on skin. my skin feels smooth after using it&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy it from here. save your money by buying it directly from its website. infiniteskinco.com.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and while I like the sting/tingle it provides, I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic improvement in skin appearance. I will continue use since I bought 2 bottles this time but unless I see overall change I probably won&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be. Also has that minty feeling like head and shoulders shampoo.  Overall a average product.</li>
            <li> Wow! Very refreshing and effective. Will buy this product again. I use it a couple times a week. Makes your skin look smoother and younger. Even more effective if you use it with a face scrubber. Good product.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, it really burnt; but as I kept using it, the burning sensation subsided.&lt;br /&gt;I am still experimenting with it; therefore, I cannot really say much about this product.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Sanitas Zapper spot treatment and it has cleared up all acne for me, so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s a little strong for my boyfriend, he has sensitive skin.  I love it.</li>
            <li> fantastic price , fantastic product. heals without burning, works without discoloration..just moisten skin, put on product, leave on 5 minutes and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> If you have used a peel then you will understand when I say it gives you the tingly feeling. However, I did not see any change and I am serious about facial cleansing. I have a few acne cyst and because of my color I scar easily. This temporarily helped with the cyst but that&#x27;s it. Cool if you just have regular acne but otherwise pass it up.</li>
            <li> I buff this in with olays buffing thingy. I usually leave this on after buffing and let the acid do its thing. I will buy this always. Love al the infinite skin cleansers!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why nobody has tried this yet. Take it from someone who has tried the highest grade of at home Salicylic Acid peels that this product is the best. It is the perfect middle ground between harsh face peels like the HQ+ and 2% acne washes that don&#x27;t have enough kick for the average person suffering acne. The best part? Its a cleanser so unlike a face peel it&#x27;s part of your daily routine!</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser but their salicylic peels are better.  Its really tingly, a bit uncomfortable for me after a minute or two.</li>
            <li> I came across this product by researching acne treatments in 2013. First, I had oily skin, and hormonal adult acne.  I will not say &amp;#34;I have adult acne anymore because I don&#x27;t get the cystic ones anymore&amp;#34;. I honestly think this cleanser prevent them from coming on my face. This cleanser is AWSOME serious.... Its like a cure for my acne. I am homestly telling my experience, ever since I started using this cleanser I got a big break from cystic acne and white heads. It truely delivers what it said it does. I will never stop using this product it help me big time, no doubt. I usual dampen my face with luke warm water, then i applied a nickle size and spread it all over my face, then leave on for about ten minutes before wash off. You will start to feel the tingle sensation working through your pores, deep cleaning it. Wow it amazing!!</li>
            <li> I am not noticing great improvement or even decent exfoliation properties. My black heads are not any better with this product either.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an all purpose face wash (removing makeup, cleansing skin) then you won&#x27;t be thrilled with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t lather..., so I am unable to remove my eye makeup and have to do two separate steps where with other washes I can do both in one step.  The feel of this is a watered down cream with exfoliate.  I am not sure what the exfoliate is because it&#x27;s hard, but blue in color.  The product smells great.  You can smell the essential oils (tea tree and lavender).  If you&#x27;re into natural smells you&#x27;ll be very pleased.  During and immediately post the wash my skin stung. I don&#x27;t mind that feeling, but I know some people are sensitive.  I would not recommend it to someone with sensitive skin.  My guess is the sting comes from the tea tree oil.  You feel moisturized afterward and pretty well cleaned (except for eye makeup which was disappointing for me).  A better alternative to this face wash to me if you&#x27;re looking for both is the Dessert Essence cleaning face wash with tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> The refreshing feel of the teatree oil in the product makes your skin feel extra clean.  Unfortunately after 2 weeks of use, I have found my skin actually broke out more.  I am not blaming the product, but it did not prevent breakouts from happening.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am writing a review for a product, because this thing definitely deserves one!&lt;br /&gt;I have had pretty bad acne from 6 years. It started in my senior yr of high school, and I had acne throughout my college life. Naturally as a college student I tried every single thing I could lay my hands on. Pretty much had my parents pay for a lot of acne treatments, but I never really got results as good as using this Salicylic Acid cleanser. I have tried everything from proactive to doxycycline to microdermabrasions. And I have never ever gotten amazing results as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time I bought this cleanser a month back I had a really bad breakout, basically both my cheeks were covered with acne. I started using this, and it calmed down my face in 3 days and I haven&#x27;t had a SINGLE pimple in 3 whole weeks!! Thats the longest I have ever gone without getting a pimple in 6 years! I am finally getting a chance to use the lightening serums I had stocked up for when my acne stops to clear my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry flaky skin and this cleanser does not dry my skin at all. Although it does have a really strong tingling sensation that lasts about 10 minutes, and I basically feel like I have my face in an ice bucket. lol&lt;br /&gt;I follow this with Neutrogena&#x27;s alcohol free toner and Simple/Cetaphil moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone suffering from severe acne needs to give this a try, you won&#x27;t regret it! Best part is I don&#x27;t have to use the overly drying Benzoyl Peroxide stuff anymore!</li>
            <li> I hated the way this made my skin look and it did nothing for my pores.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!!  Makes you skin feel clean and refreshed and really gets your face clean of oils and makeup.  It exfoliates and has cleared up my skin a bit and continues to do so.  Finally a cleanser for acne that has enough salicylic acid in it to make a difference and truly be effective for acne prone skin!  I will be ordering this again and again!</li>
            <li> I lovve this product!  No more clogged pores and saving loads of money by not getting facials!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! It works wonders for my skin. I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with the seller each time I purchase this item, it arrives in a timely fashion. This is my 3rd order, I&#x27;ve even recommended it to another person. We both love it. And the seller is awesome. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product! This is not available in stores. Thank you for making this available for people like me that need professional strength products. There is a remarkable difference in my skin using this product versus what is available in stores- only 2%. I use this daily. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> A good product no doubt.  But, I was hoping for something more abrasive.</li>
            <li> Like mentioned in previous reviews this cleanser works quite well. The store brands only contain 2% salicylic acid which is not strong enough. But my face is too sensitive for peels. And you can use this in your daily wash and not peel. I still have blackheads, but it has improved. Your diet also is what plays a huge role in your skins beauty.</li>
            <li> I have bought this, not for what it is recommended for, but for removing dried sebum from my scalp. I was reading some where that a few people were trying skin peels to remove old layers of sebum from their scalps to try and reverse their baldness. Since I like to experiment, I decided to try several different products, this was one of them. I like to use this on my face as well, it helps remove oil and unclog pores.This product I would recommend for both facial and pore problems, along with cleaning the scalp or other areas of the skin. With acne, I also mention echinacea root.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser to prevent blemishes. Does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing skin product. I was surprised at the minty freshness when applied to my face. The was is a little harsh for my aging skin, so I&#x27;m going to back off to every other day. Very nice and refreshing though.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser on the market right now. You put it on and let it work for a couple of minutes and then wash it away and you&#x27;ll notice a difference right away. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this on their Ebay store, for the purpose of getting the cheaper listed price. First off, the cleanser does NOT foam up, meaning you have to keep adding more to cover your whole face. When cleansing your face, it feels really nice, providing a nice \\&quot;icy\\&quot; feeling to your face. I use one of those exfoliating gloves to apply this cleanser. The results show after a few minutes when you dry your face off, less redness (salicylic acid does that), and smaller pores, with some actually being cleaned out. I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s definitely something you should use everyday.</li>
            <li> I WISH I COULD SHOUT FROM THE HEAVENS HOW WELL THIS WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;I have been battling BAD cystic, deep, skin cratering acne since I was about 12. Oh what I would give to have had this YEARS ago.&lt;br /&gt;At TWENTY (20) years old, I have found something that actually REALLY works. I have spent HUNDREDS of $$ at the dermatologist on medicine, tetracycling, creams, washes, ETC, ETC, ETC. Man what a bunch of wasted time and money. We almost did Acutane, which works, but man those side effects are TERRIBLE. You&#x27;re kinda miserable for 6 months if you decide to go through with it.... So the search for something else continued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about a month, twice a day, morning and night. Keep in mind, my acne is BAD and my skin is not overly sensitive to drying when I use salicylic acid. MY FACE IS ALMOST 100% CLEAR. I LITERALLY COULD CRY BECAUSE IM SO OVERWHELMED WITH HOW CLEAR MY SKIN IS. It is not perfect, but considering the acne I had would pit my face and be so painful I just had to squeeze it out just so it didn&#x27;t keep growing until it had its own zit-code..... This is a God Send. I will say, if I miss a wash, I will probably regret it with a pimple the next day, but even when I have one, its just a little pimple... not a deep skin cyst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to this is that the salicylic acid level is SO much higher than normal store retail brands offer. EVERY SINGLE ACNE PRODUCT IN JUST WALMART OR TARGET HAS ONLY 2%. ONLY 2. THIS HAS 15%. THAT IS WHY THIS WORKS. THIS IS WHAT IV BEEN LOOKING FOR.&lt;br /&gt;Proactive only has like 3 or 4%. Plus they use a hydrogen peroxide blend.. and in my opinion, hydrogen peroxide never worked as well for me. I even read their website... which clearly states that Proactive is only intended for mild to moderate acne AND in the list of types of acne it helps, it does NOT mention cystic acne anywhere. PROACTIVE IS NOT INTENDED FOR SEVERE ACNE. Moving on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually make a mask with it. I wash my face with thenormal orange Neutrogena wash to remove makeup and excess oil and then I make a mask out of this. I smear on a layer to my damp face and I leave it on until the tingling stops (5-10 mins). I will say, there is a very refreshing tingle to it... I like it because when I rinse it off, I can feel the air in my pores again lol. If you are a weenie, you might not be able to take it, but I think it is a tolerable tingle/sting. I think of it more like a cooling tingle. Moral of this, I like the tingle. It means my face is getting clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t be thankful enough that I came across this one day on amazon when I got curious to see if they sold anything with a higher salicylic acid percentage. I CAN LIVE AGAIN. I CAN GO WITHOUT MAKEUP IF I FEEL LIKE IT AND NOT HAVE PEOPLE STARE AT ME BECAUSE I LOOK LIKE I HAVE A FLESH EATING DISEASE. THIS STUFF WORKS. I CAN FEEL PRETTY. I wish I had a before and after picture to show everyone.... sorry I used to refuse having my picture taken if I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1000 OUT OF 10. DID buy again. I seriously bought 2 more bottles after the first week of use. Thank you to who ever created this &amp;#60;3 Bless you.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old young. I still get hormonal cystic acne and at this age, still have very oily skin. This product after only 4 uses, is a dream come true. I do a light wash then leave on for about 10 minutes. My skin is much clearer, it is purging some of the old bacteria out, to be expected. I must not have sensitive skin because I am experience no dryness at all. Of course, use a moisturizer following use of this product. All I can say is...my skin has never looked better, and I am pretty vain!</li>
            <li> So this worked great for my acne scars. It only works a bit for my blackheads which is why I bought it. I have left it on for quite awhile and my skin peeled a bit after that and I still had stubborn blackheads on my nose. But like I said my acne scars have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works well for my acne prone skin would reccomend</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with adult acne for some time. I have tried every drug store brand cleanser along with ones like ProActiv. Since using this product I have not had ANY breakouts. Before I would have them because of monthly hormonal surges and the breakouts would be all over my face for over two weeks of every month. I will never go without having this product in my home!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a complement to the salycic acid 30% peel and serum for my 16 year old son who has bad acne. He uses the wash and serum every day and the peel every 10 days. The peel is strong so he only leaves it on for about 2 minutes. He only has minor flaking as he doesn&#x27;t leave it on for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am not sure why other reviewers are trying to leave this on as a mask. It is a face wash. I think a 10 or 20% peel left on for a minute or two would be better fopr what they are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks, we really started to see his skin clearing up.  Now, after 5 months, he has no acne on his forehead and the scars are gone too.  His cheeks are also improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, these products work very nicely.</li>
            <li> Feels cool &amp; fresh on skin and cleans well!</li>
