            <li> Was a good buy. Did what it was make to do. Like this Brand.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how pure it is.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Product was packaged in bubble wrap and arrived in good condition. Great price. I opened bottle chamomile smelled wonderful. I know it&#x27;s a calming oil and today being valentines day I&#x27;m already in good mood but the smell was so comforting and made me feel snuggled ❤️.  I would buy again!</li>

            <li> This is a nice quality product, and very useful.  It is also a good value- this particular essential oil&lt;br /&gt;is known to cost more than some others, yet this remains a high quality therapeutic grade product&lt;br /&gt;for a reasonable and fair price.</li>
            <li> But the product leaked during the shipping process and we lost some of the product. This product is very expensive and we would like to get a discount for the oil lost. I contacted the seller about two weeks ago, but have not heard a word from them???</li>

            <li> Great oil, used it for my neck massage. It helps calm me down. I mixed it with peppermint. The scent is very strong.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and packages very securely. The bonus sample protein bar was a pleasant surprise and the return policy is excellent. But I am keeping it! Love the quality.</li>
            <li> I use with in conjunction with spearmint, lemon, and sage and sometimes I throw some sweet orange in there, it&#x27;s super duper smelling, can&#x27;t describe it. fresh and uplifting without being too strong</li>
            <li> Good pure oil for a great price!</li>
