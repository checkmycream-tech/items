            <li>The price is also pretty great too!</li>
            <li>I love this eight-pack!  </li>
            <li>This palette contains two of my favorite eyeshadow shades (ever!).  </li>
            <li>I have yet to try it, but the colors look amazing</li>
            <li>This is a nice eye shadow set.</li>
            <li>However, it has a nice assortment of colors to get the look you want.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, but is thick/powdery on the eyelid.  </li>
            <li>A lot of my nice eye shadows don&#x27;t come with a mirror.</li>
            <li>Nice variety of colors.  </li>
            <li>The colors are shimmery but are nice.</li>
            <li>it looks really nice for all occasions.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a great mix-and-match with so many color combination possibilities with these eight beautiful shades, and the color really stays with you.  </li>
            <li>I am super happy and will order another just in case.</li>
            <li>I am able to create a nice neutral look for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Ok for the price, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>excellent products the colours are so natural</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and lasts for quite some time!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!  </li>
            <li>A Beautiful Pallete with beatiful high pigmented colors!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>But you can build up the color for more drama if you want.  </li>
            <li>realy love the colors</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought 5 more....</li>
            <li>these were better priced.</li>
            <li>and I love all the colors (they are browns, whites, tans, beige...)</li>
            <li>I love the colors &amp; the shimmer in it.</li>
            <li>and i use the neutrals on this one more.</li>
            <li>Love this color palette.</li>
            <li>Its avon stuff, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It has the colors I use the most</li>
            <li>Totally love the colors of this palette.</li>
            <li>but the more I use it ..</li>
            <li>The more its breaking</li>
            <li>so you do not need your brush to stroke any of the eyeshadows more than twice or else</li>
            <li>I love the nude palette.</li>
            <li>This neutral tones is one of my favorite colors in the 8 in 1 set.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow set.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>They have plenty of shimmer that doesn&#x27;t wear off during the day and the eight colors would be flattering for most every skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I really LOVE this set</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product was great</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t say anything for this vendor, I can say this is one of the best neutral eyeshadow palettes I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>These neutrals make you look great throughout the day, and classy after five pm at the clubs!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Avon in the past and liked the quality this is genuine and worked Great!</li>
            <li>Comes off easily so</li>
            <li>but the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as the picture but its still a good by for brown and people that like neutrol tones</li>
            <li>The colors were beautiful, but the quality of the eye shadow was very basic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, I love all of the colors</li>
            <li>It includes the perfect combination of neutrals with highlights and low lights that complement each other very nicely.</li>
            <li>but I have to say, the applicator case with a little mirror is perfect.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth - no powdery chalkiness - and</li>
            <li>I keep an extra in my desk at work for days when I don&#x27;t have time to do a thorough makeup job, and it keeps me looking great as if I DIDN&#x27;T just dash out of the house.  </li>
            <li>Gave it to my Mom and happy to give this a solid 3 star review.</li>
            <li>and it was cheap</li>
            <li>It is a really great substitute for the NAKED palette if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li>These colors are great over a primer and really last.  </li>
            <li>and I really am surprised at how good it is and how well it lasts through out the day.</li>
            <li>Okay so the Urban Decay Palette is EVERYWHERE these days, so I had been looking for a neutral palette that I actually liked all of  the colors...</li>
            <li>i got it today actually like 3 days early and the packaging and shipping was great!!</li>
            <li>it for someone special in your life.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes and skin allergies, and experienced no negative reactions at all with Avon&#x27;s eye</li>
            <li>Pigment is good and they last all day (i do use a eye primer by nyx though).</li>
            <li>This eye shadow is very crumbly - when you brush the applicator over the powder, more lifts off then</li>
            <li>A great palette to rival the higher-end palettes, such as the popular but bulkier Urban Decay sets.  </li>
            <li>I really like the colors - very sheer and neutral great for any day every day.  </li>
            <li>Avon no longer sells this palette on their website and I was super bummed.</li>
            <li>Thank you for fixing order so quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the colors they are very pretty</li>
            <li>They are very pretty when applied.  </li>
            <li>Just be carefull with the shimmer ones, they are really shimmer!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>but it was packed a heavy frying pan a grill brush and all sorts of stuff and still came out looking brand new and great!  </li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear and evening looks as well.</li>
            <li>I use the natural pallet every day i love the shimmery neutral shades.</li>
            <li>I was just not crazy about them</li>
            <li>I have always liked Avons colors, especially since I prefer earth tones.</li>
            <li>I use other brushes for application than the ones provided as they are kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>right before it is taped</li>
            <li>Some have a good amount of shimmer, others have just a little.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty</li>
            <li>The neutral palette is so pretty</li>
            <li>oh so much, I definitely recommend this eye shadow to everyone. :)</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>I love neutral colored eyeshadows and this palette definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The size is smaller than what I expected (about 2\\&quot; x 4\\&quot;), but it&#x27;s great for travel purposes.</li>
            <li>Thought this might be a more affordable alternative to what I really wanted - the Urban Decay neutral palette.</li>
            <li>it is very airy first off.</li>
            <li>The brushes provided are not useful though, be prepared to use your own.  </li>
            <li>This little palette is wonderful for everyday eyes looks.</li>
            <li>Also, a few hours later, it didn&#x27;t look that great.</li>
            <li>Really like this eye shadow, avon don&#x27;t have it in the books</li>
            <li>very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you need not pack as much makeup.  </li>
            <li>and you will see the palette sold here as well as the real eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency and the colors with my primer wear</li>
            <li>I really like the selection of neutral colors in this collection...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to it.</li>
            <li>Such pretty neutrals that were soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It is every bit as quality as more expensive brands (I usually do Estee Lauder or Clinique) of eyeshadows and the color combo they put together is beautiful!!!  </li>
            <li>The staying power was not as strong as other higher quality eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are pretty colors and are cheaper than even other shadows for how many colors you get and go on nicely but not at all the same as the Urband Decay ones.</li>
            <li>It came packaged in a tight fitting box, but when I opened the compact, some of the shadows had already crumbled.  </li>
            <li>Just because it did not work for me does not mean it will not work on someone else.</li>
            <li>I love how it shimmers a little.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and use it everyday</li>
            <li>so normally this isn&#x27;t a problem) and they don&#x27;t stick to your lids at all.</li>
            <li>I received this product yesterday, in overall, good condition except for a small chip in the side of the case.</li>
            <li>It can fit anywhere and stays put about as well as any other powdered eye shadow out there.</li>
            <li>, there isnt a lot of avon where I live</li>
            <li>I love the little mirror on the inside!  </li>
            <li>The shade of colors is very nice, since I personally don&#x27;t enjoy wearing extreme colors like blue, pink, or green.</li>
            <li>I tried applying it with several different brushes and just didn&#x27;t feel excited about them.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the various matt to shiny and only one color is somewhat brown, but not very dark.  </li>
            <li>These colors are beautiful and natural enough for everyday wear when you don&#x27;t want people to laugh at you because you look like you confused work makeup with going out makeup.  </li>
            <li>Have to apply a lot for real effects, like shadow or multiple colors.</li>
            <li>but it lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>It arrived early and as it appeared on line.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal because I normally dont use those mirrors anyone.</li>
            <li>(In fact, I bought this on Amazon to replace the original, which I used down to the last crumbs).</li>
            <li>I dont wear it everyday because sometimes it seems too  much for evrday wear, really glittery.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;I took it out of the box and it was completely coated on the outside with eye shadow dust.</li>
            <li>The colors barely show up when you apply them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable</li>
            <li>Some one said it was small, for such good quality and small price you can&#x27;t expect a lot.</li>
            <li>I was a little afraid the colors would all be too similar, but they are all lovely, unique to themselves and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I was concerned initially that I would only use half of the neutrals with my skin tone, but it turns out these neutrals are exactly that.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s true, I love all of the colors</li>
            <li> It includes the perfect combination of neutrals with highlights and low lights that complement each other very nicely.</li>
            <li> but I have to say, the applicator case with a little mirror is perfect.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth - no powdery chalkiness - and</li>
            <li> I keep an extra in my desk at work for days when I don&#x27;t have time to do a thorough makeup job, and it keeps me looking great as if I DIDN&#x27;T just dash out of the house.  </li>
            <li> Gave it to my Mom and happy to give this a solid 3 star review.</li>
            <li> and it was cheap</li>
            <li> It is a really great substitute for the NAKED palette if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> These colors are great over a primer and really last.  </li>
            <li> and I really am surprised at how good it is and how well it lasts through out the day.</li>
            <li> Okay so the Urban Decay Palette is EVERYWHERE these days, so I had been looking for a neutral palette that I actually liked all of  the colors...</li>
            <li> i got it today actually like 3 days early and the packaging and shipping was great!!</li>
            <li> it for someone special in your life.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes and skin allergies, and experienced no negative reactions at all with Avon&#x27;s eye</li>
            <li> Pigment is good and they last all day (i do use a eye primer by nyx though).</li>
            <li> This eye shadow is very crumbly - when you brush the applicator over the powder, more lifts off then</li>
            <li> A great palette to rival the higher-end palettes, such as the popular but bulkier Urban Decay sets.  </li>
            <li> I really like the colors - very sheer and neutral great for any day every day.  </li>
            <li> Avon no longer sells this palette on their website and I was super bummed.</li>
            <li> Thank you for fixing order so quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the colors they are very pretty</li>
            <li> They are very pretty when applied.  </li>
            <li> Just be carefull with the shimmer ones, they are really shimmer!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> but it was packed a heavy frying pan a grill brush and all sorts of stuff and still came out looking brand new and great!  </li>
            <li> Great for everyday wear and evening looks as well.</li>
            <li> I use the natural pallet every day i love the shimmery neutral shades.</li>
            <li> I was just not crazy about them</li>
            <li> I have always liked Avons colors, especially since I prefer earth tones.</li>
            <li> I use other brushes for application than the ones provided as they are kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> right before it is taped</li>
            <li> Some have a good amount of shimmer, others have just a little.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty</li>
            <li> The neutral palette is so pretty</li>
            <li> oh so much, I definitely recommend this eye shadow to everyone. :)</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> I love neutral colored eyeshadows and this palette definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The size is smaller than what I expected (about 2\\&quot; x 4\\&quot;), but it&#x27;s great for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> Thought this might be a more affordable alternative to what I really wanted - the Urban Decay neutral palette.</li>
            <li> it is very airy first off.</li>
            <li> The brushes provided are not useful though, be prepared to use your own.  </li>
            <li> This little palette is wonderful for everyday eyes looks.</li>
            <li> Also, a few hours later, it didn&#x27;t look that great.</li>
            <li> Really like this eye shadow, avon don&#x27;t have it in the books</li>
            <li> very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you need not pack as much makeup.  </li>
            <li> and you will see the palette sold here as well as the real eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency and the colors with my primer wear</li>
            <li> I really like the selection of neutral colors in this collection...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to it.</li>
            <li> Such pretty neutrals that were soft and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It is every bit as quality as more expensive brands (I usually do Estee Lauder or Clinique) of eyeshadows and the color combo they put together is beautiful!!!  </li>
            <li> The staying power was not as strong as other higher quality eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are pretty colors and are cheaper than even other shadows for how many colors you get and go on nicely but not at all the same as the Urband Decay ones.</li>
            <li> It came packaged in a tight fitting box, but when I opened the compact, some of the shadows had already crumbled.  </li>
            <li> Just because it did not work for me does not mean it will not work on someone else.</li>
            <li> I love how it shimmers a little.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and use it everyday</li>
            <li> so normally this isn&#x27;t a problem) and they don&#x27;t stick to your lids at all.</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday, in overall, good condition except for a small chip in the side of the case.</li>
            <li> It can fit anywhere and stays put about as well as any other powdered eye shadow out there.</li>
            <li> , there isnt a lot of avon where I live</li>
            <li> I love the little mirror on the inside!  </li>
            <li> The shade of colors is very nice, since I personally don&#x27;t enjoy wearing extreme colors like blue, pink, or green.</li>
            <li> I tried applying it with several different brushes and just didn&#x27;t feel excited about them.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the various matt to shiny and only one color is somewhat brown, but not very dark.  </li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful and natural enough for everyday wear when you don&#x27;t want people to laugh at you because you look like you confused work makeup with going out makeup.  </li>
            <li> Have to apply a lot for real effects, like shadow or multiple colors.</li>
            <li> but it lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> It arrived early and as it appeared on line.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal because I normally dont use those mirrors anyone.</li>
            <li> (In fact, I bought this on Amazon to replace the original, which I used down to the last crumbs).</li>
            <li> I dont wear it everyday because sometimes it seems too  much for evrday wear, really glittery.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;I took it out of the box and it was completely coated on the outside with eye shadow dust.</li>
            <li> The colors barely show up when you apply them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely noticeable</li>
            <li> Some one said it was small, for such good quality and small price you can&#x27;t expect a lot.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid the colors would all be too similar, but they are all lovely, unique to themselves and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I was concerned initially that I would only use half of the neutrals with my skin tone, but it turns out these neutrals are exactly that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny, much smaller than it looks so it won&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> She said it&#x27;s hard to find so many neutral tones in one small package.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m at that age where I shouldn&#x27;t wear frosted eye shadow - which only emphasizes puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It will have a pink shade second from left.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get to enjoy my palette</li>
            <li> is long.</li>
            <li> BUT when you do a smoky eye for little kids you need a major reality check.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted something for every single day.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, and nothing broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow is easy to apply with brushes - not too dusty, not so hard you have to scrub to get it out of the pan</li>
            <li> I only use a few colors from the palette.  </li>
            <li> Opening the case as carefully as I could resulted in three of the pulverized colors creating a cloud of dust.</li>
            <li> When I saw Avon I pause for a sec and then was like what the heck might as well give it a try</li>
            <li> So please be warned the eyeshadow sometimes spills out the container during transit due to rough handling of the package by the postal service.</li>
            <li> Plus, I trust amazon over any other online retail store.  </li>
            <li> I am going to look into buying the other sets.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;m giving this product a four star just because it took slightly longer than expected.  </li>
            <li> The palette is supposed to include a pale pink as well as some less shimmery tones.</li>
            <li> Sad to say it fails on most counts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess to use and had gotten all over my bathroom sink and counters ...</li>
            <li> Was a little nervous about it getting messed up in delivery</li>
            <li> Used it a few times.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday highlight palette.  </li>
            <li> Finally, a makeup kit that allows you to put on makeup in a liberal fashion without looking like a ghost, clown, or worse.  </li>
            <li> Some of them have a slight shimmer to them, but it&#x27;s subtle.</li>
            <li> the brown pallett and the only bad thing i can say is the colors are not that dark</li>
            <li> one of the shadow sections was broken so it made a mess.</li>
            <li> The others were cracked and broken and fall out of their little slots.</li>
            <li> Hate go waste what little pieces are left</li>
            <li> I have always been wary when it comes to Avon because you think of the ladies with tacky pink lip stick coming to your door</li>
            <li> I accidently dropped it a very short distance when going to set it down, and was disappointed to see the others had crumbled a bit</li>
            <li> and it is very small compared to those.</li>
            <li> Careless packaging resulted in the shadows being crushed and broken.</li>
            <li> never order anything this delicate from Amazon again!</li>
            <li> This is an add on item which I now take to mean it gets thrown (literally!)</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for &amp; you can&#x27;t go wrong with Avon.</li>
            <li> Also the colors are all wrong.</li>
            <li> but i just hate seeing some of it go to waste because of the weightlessness.</li>
            <li> Expensive lesson.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

            <li> I like the colors they are very pretty and it&#x27;s a cheapter alternative to others. But please be warned that when this eyeshadow is shipped to you it spills out the container. I had to contact Avon to send me another and that one also spilled during shipping. So please be warned the eyeshadow sometimes spills out the container during transit due to rough handling of the package by the postal service. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get to enjoy my palette but I must say the colors are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> A Beautiful Pallete with beatiful high pigmented colors! I made a couple of make ups with this eyeshadows and there are great!! Just be carefull with the shimmer ones, they are really shimmer!! But Love this product!! Amazing seller too! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have no idea where the nearest avon store is in my area.  Plus, I trust amazon over any other online retail store.  The item arrived in good condition as described, but it did take a while to arrive.  Therefore, I&#x27;m giving this product a four star just because it took slightly longer than expected.  Thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors - very sheer and neutral great for any day every day.  But you can build up the color for more drama if you want.  I just wanted something for every single day.  I use them with a brush not the applicators.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the colors in this neutral palette.  They are very pretty when applied.  I confess I only use about 4 of the shades though.  Still, I like to have options.</li>
            <li> Okay so the Urban Decay Palette is EVERYWHERE these days, so I had been looking for a neutral palette that I actually liked all of  the colors...because yeah some of those colors would have NEVER made it onto my eyelids.  I teach preschool so I like to look polished and presentable BUT when you do a smoky eye for little kids you need a major reality check.  These colors are beautiful and natural enough for everyday wear when you don&#x27;t want people to laugh at you because you look like you confused work makeup with going out makeup.  The price is also pretty great too!</li>
            <li> i realy realy realy love the colors never been this happy about my eyeshadows i will be buying again i will be telling my friends about this beauty</li>
            <li> This is a nice eye shadow set. It&#x27;s tiny, much smaller than it looks so it won&#x27;t last too long. However, it has a nice assortment of colors to get the look you want. It can fit anywhere and stays put about as well as any other powdered eye shadow out there. I use other brushes for application than the ones provided as they are kind of cheap. Overall, I would buy again</li>
            <li> I thought this eyeshadow box was the same size as the Naked Pallette ones by Urban Decay and it is very small compared to those. The colors are pretty but I did order two of them for my daughters and in one of them one of the shadow sections was broken so it made a mess. I added a dab of alcohol to it with a q-tip and mashed it together and it seemed to hold after that. Other than that they are pretty colors and are cheaper than even other shadows for how many colors you get and go on nicely but not at all the same as the Urband Decay ones.</li>
            <li> No issues with this at all. I&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the brown pallett and the only bad thing i can say is the colors are not that dark</li>
            <li> My go-to eye shadow pallette..... great colors and stays on well during day.  I&#x27;ve ordered several of these over the years!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I got the nuetral brown/tan/beige.  It is every bit as quality as more expensive brands (I usually do Estee Lauder or Clinique) of eyeshadows and the color combo they put together is beautiful!!!  I bought 5 more....Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This was a gift. My sister loved the colors.  She said it&#x27;s hard to find so many neutral tones in one small package.</li>
            <li> I use the natural pallet every day i love the shimmery neutral shades. I am going to look into buying the other sets. Pigment is good and they last all day (i do use a eye primer by nyx though).</li>
            <li> Really like this eye shadow, avon don&#x27;t have it in the books very often.&lt;br /&gt;also these were better priced. Great Product</li>
            <li> I thought it was a lot bigger but it is still good! I just might consider buying the whole set green and blue to finish the look on my vanity (: 4 stars</li>
            <li> Avon no longer sells this palette on their website and I was super bummed. Thankfully I found it here and placed my order. It&#x27;s exactly what I was expecting! The neutral palette is so pretty and I love all the colors (they are browns, whites, tans, beige...) Some of them have a slight shimmer to them, but it&#x27;s subtle. This is the one and only eye shadow I ever use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this set a lot. I love the colors &amp; the shimmer in it. Just what I was looking for &amp; you can&#x27;t go wrong with Avon.</li>
            <li> It came packaged in a tight fitting box, but when I opened the compact, some of the shadows had already crumbled.  This eye shadow is very crumbly - when you brush the applicator over the powder, more lifts off then just what goes on the applicator, and I have to blow the excess off.  I accidently dropped it a very short distance when going to set it down, and was disappointed to see the others had crumbled a bit and I had to blow off quite a bit of powder.  It goes on nicely, but is thick/powdery on the eyelid.  I probably will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this eight-pack!  You&#x27;ll get a great mix-and-match with so many color combination possibilities with these eight beautiful shades, and the color really stays with you.  Goes on smooth - no powdery chalkiness - and these neutral browns and golds compliment ANY eye color.  I have extremely sensitive eyes and skin allergies, and experienced no negative reactions at all with Avon&#x27;s eye shadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack is a must-have for any woman. I keep an extra in my desk at work for days when I don&#x27;t have time to do a thorough makeup job, and it keeps me looking great as if I DIDN&#x27;T just dash out of the house.  Wonderful for travel - with so many combinations, you need not pack as much makeup.  These neutrals make you look great throughout the day, and classy after five pm at the clubs!</li>
            <li> I only use a few colors from the palette.  I am able to create a nice neutral look for my eyes.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are okay, however they&#x27;re fake. If you look up the nude pallete on google or on Avon&#x27;s website the colors and the packaging is different. The AVON on the front should be centered. Also the colors are all wrong. The palette is supposed to include a pale pink as well as some less shimmery tones. What is pictured on Amazon is what you receive however it is not truly Avon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictured above is what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Google Avon&#x27;s 8 in 1 palette in nudes in images and you will see the palette sold here as well as the real eyeshadow. It will have a pink shade second from left.</li>
            <li> The colors were beautiful, but the quality of the eye shadow was very basic. I tried applying it with several different brushes and just didn&#x27;t feel excited about them. It&#x27;s like they wouldn&#x27;t stick as well to the eye ....Also, a few hours later, it didn&#x27;t look that great. The staying power was not as strong as other higher quality eye shadows. I was just not crazy about them but I have to say, the applicator case with a little mirror is perfect. A lot of my nice eye shadows don&#x27;t come with a mirror. Used it a few times. Gave it to my Mom and happy to give this a solid 3 star review.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s prettier in person! I was a little afraid the colors would all be too similar, but they are all lovely, unique to themselves and highly pigmented. Some have a good amount of shimmer, others have just a little. None of them look too &amp;#34;glittery.&amp;#34; No complaints here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, I love all of the colors oh so much, I definitely recommend this eye shadow to everyone. :)</li>
            <li> This little palette is wonderful for everyday eyes looks. Such pretty neutrals that were soft and easy to work with. It came in great condition and before the delivery date. Happily grateful.</li>
            <li> Love the colors!!!  Came with Avon packaging and goes on wonderfully!  Was a little nervous about it getting messed up in delivery but it was packed a heavy frying pan a grill brush and all sorts of stuff and still came out looking brand new and great!  I&#x27;ve used Avon in the past and liked the quality this is genuine and worked Great!</li>
            <li> My fianc√© loved it!&lt;br /&gt;She can&#x27;t be made more beautiful however she enjoys the product immensely.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it for someone special in your life.</li>
            <li> Ok for the price, nothing spectacular. Have to apply a lot for real effects, like shadow or multiple colors. I dont wear it everyday because sometimes it seems too  much for evrday wear, really glittery. Comes off easily so I&#x27;d recommend a primer. Probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I have all kinds, especially urban decay! I really like the consistency and the colors with my primer wear is long. I have the naked palette by UD and i use the neutrals on this one more. Some one said it was small, for such good quality and small price you can&#x27;t expect a lot. You can kinda tell the size by looking at the shadow applicators. I am super happy and will order another just in case.</li>
            <li> Loved the shades of the eyeshadow I got.  Avon has great products and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Product was exactly what I hoped it would be.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this color palette. Great for everyday wear and evening looks as well. This is the second time I have purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the selection of neutral colors in this collection... Goes on easily and lasts for quite some time!</li>
            <li> Its avon stuff, and I love it. It has the colors I use the most and it was cheap, there isnt a lot of avon where I live so finding it here was awesome.</li>
            <li> Totally love the colors of this palette. Delivered on time</li>
            <li> This looked great until I got it and opened it .. Pieces of the eyeshadow palette were cracked and as I started to use it the rest of the palettes came apart and were breaking as I was using it too . It&#x27;s a mess to use and had gotten all over my bathroom sink and counters ... I am going to throw it Away . Hate go waste what little pieces are left but the more I use it .. The more its breaking</li>
            <li> I have the neutrals and blues and greens!  The quality of shadows and the beautiful array of colors received make this a great buy!</li>
            <li> This is my everyday highlight palette.  Nice variety of colors.  Packed well but mirror broke off as soon as I opened  the palette.  Not a big deal because I normally dont use those mirrors anyone.</li>
            <li> great price. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It was Alright!  Not the best product I have ever used, but I gave it to a friend and she loved it!  Just because it did not work for me does not mean it will not work on someone else.</li>
            <li> it is very airy first off. so you do not need your brush to stroke any of the eyeshadows more than twice or else you are just waisting powder. I love the colors and use it everyday but i just hate seeing some of it go to waste because of the weightlessness.</li>
            <li> Careless packaging resulted in the shadows being crushed and broken. This is an add on item which I now take to mean it gets thrown (literally!) in the box  right before it is taped up.&lt;br /&gt;I took it out of the box and it was completely coated on the outside with eye shadow dust. Opening the case as carefully as I could resulted in three of the pulverized colors creating a cloud of dust. The others were cracked and broken and fall out of their little slots. One usable eye shadow! Expensive lesson.&lt;br /&gt;Will never order anything this delicate from Amazon again!</li>
            <li> I am giving this a 4 because of a delivery hiccup, my order was delivered to someone in another state?? But I emailed the shipper and she immediately sent me a replacement. I am looking forward to these selections of colors. I have always liked Avons colors, especially since I prefer earth tones. Thank you for fixing order so quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the nude palette. The colors are shimmery but are nice.</li>
            <li> Thought this might be a more affordable alternative to what I really wanted - the Urban Decay neutral palette. Sad to say it fails on most counts. The colors barely show up when you apply them (I have fair skin so normally this isn&#x27;t a problem) and they don&#x27;t stick to your lids at all. I would pass.</li>
            <li> This neutral tones is one of my favorite colors in the 8 in 1 set.I always buy it from one source or another.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow set. It includes the perfect combination of neutrals with highlights and low lights that complement each other very nicely. The eyeshadow is easy to apply with brushes - not too dusty, not so hard you have to scrub to get it out of the pan. I haven&#x27;t used the included double foam applicator. I was concerned initially that I would only use half of the neutrals with my skin tone, but it turns out these neutrals are exactly that. Some run to the beige or taupe end and others run toward copper, but they all look great!</li>
            <li> i got it today actually like 3 days early and the packaging and shipping was great!! but the colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as the picture but its still a good by for brown and people that like neutrol tones</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday, in overall, good condition except for a small chip in the side of the case. It&#x27;s barely noticeable so I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to it. I have yet to try it, but the colors look amazing and I can&#x27;t wait to experiment with them! The size is smaller than what I expected (about 2\\&quot; x 4\\&quot;), but it&#x27;s great for travel purposes. The shade of colors is very nice, since I personally don&#x27;t enjoy wearing extreme colors like blue, pink, or green. I would definitely recommend this to anyone I know!  :)</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say anything for this vendor, I can say this is one of the best neutral eyeshadow palettes I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, but I didn&#x27;t realize how &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34; the shadow would be.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m at that age where I shouldn&#x27;t wear frosted eye shadow - which only emphasizes puffiness and fine lines.  I wish these shadows were matte rather than frosted, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars.  I gave this set to my much-younger daughter-in-law.  :)</li>
            <li> A great palette to rival the higher-end palettes, such as the popular but bulkier Urban Decay sets.  The brushes provided are not useful though, be prepared to use your own.  I love the little mirror on the inside!  The colors stay put.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> This palette contains two of my favorite eyeshadow shades (ever!).  They have plenty of shimmer that doesn&#x27;t wear off during the day and the eight colors would be flattering for most every skin tones.  Love, love, love!  (In fact, I bought this on Amazon to replace the original, which I used down to the last crumbs).</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this set (I got the neutrals set) it looks really nice for all occasions. It probably would stay longer if I used a primer but it lasts a pretty long time. It is a really great substitute for the NAKED palette if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> excellent products the colours are so natural,  i apply  them everywhere i go.</li>
            <li> It is a quality product and was a great price. Exactly what I expected, and nothing broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Finally, a makeup kit that allows you to put on makeup in a liberal fashion without looking like a ghost, clown, or worse.  These colors are great over a primer and really last.  I enjoy the various matt to shiny and only one color is somewhat brown, but not very dark.  It arrived early and as it appeared on line. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have always been wary when it comes to Avon because you think of the ladies with tacky pink lip stick coming to your door but this stuff is pretty good.  I was looking for something with neutral tones and this was perfect.  When I saw Avon I pause for a sec and then was like what the heck might as well give it a try and I really am surprised at how good it is and how well it lasts through out the day.</li>
            <li> Always a fan of Avon and the neutrals are a good mix of shimmer and nudes</li>
            <li> I love neutral colored eyeshadows and this palette definitely gets the job done. I love how it shimmers a little. And its a great quality product for an unbeatable price. Must have!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product was great</li>
