            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>This is the only Moroccan hair oil I like, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>Its worth the coin whether you wear your hsir straight or curly.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many similar products.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I found it for a good price on amazon, Bcs is so hard to find it in tjmaxx now for the same price.</li>
            <li>Helps with my dryness, tangling (as I have long hair) giving me more shine and loads of complements from strangers...</li>
            <li>This product leaves hair soft, smooth and hydrated (at least seemingly), and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed that I was able to blow dry my hair almost straight.  </li>
            <li>I poured the entire bottle into an applicator bottle , one that you would use to dye your hair and it makes application to the scalp easy.</li>
            <li>My hair was becoming dry and not so nice due to a medicine I&#x27;m taking.</li>
            <li>Hair is so soft, smooth with a little more body.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I try to keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li>It helps me comb threw my very damaged tangled hair.</li>
            <li>so the bottle will last me a while, it also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it really helps control the frizz too.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Use sparingly until you see how much your hair takes.</li>
            <li>and this oil really did it..</li>
            <li>My hair is silky, soft, conditioned, moisturized, bouncy, and it FLOWS!!!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product from a local store and didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>An extra good thing is you use just a little bit</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone with unruly hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very silky and soft.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Makes our hair sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>After I blow dry my hair straight, I just put two drops in my hand and rub together-and smooth it thoroughly through the bottom half of my hair first, then all over afterwards.</li>
            <li>Always been a fan of Argan oil and with a dry scalp that is thirsty its easy for me to just apply this daily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s able to tame it!</li>
            <li>I have used almost a whole bottle of this over the last year.</li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s a steal especially for around nine bucks.</li>
            <li>The tiniest drop is all I need for my hair to feel baby soft.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair manageable, soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 63 year old guy with wavy, aging hair.</li>
            <li>Go too far</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, suptle, shiny and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it helps my hair to dry much faster without the damage of a hair blow dryer!</li>
            <li>I use a small amount in my hair daily and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>The high price is the only reason it gets four stars.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, it makes my hair so soft and very little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product when I purchased a new flat iron /curler for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought more bottles to give to friends who also have thick, frizzy long hair.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is a little inconvenient, just because of how easily the product comes out - you literally can&#x27;t use more than a couple of drops at a time without turning into a greaseball.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor spend a few extra bucks and get pure 100% natural Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>It makes my curly dry hair feel soft and managable</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that this bottle is too big to take on the plane, but that can be solved (and anyway, most places are less humid!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The magic part is it barley contains any Argan oil.  Folks do your homework take a look at the ingredients.  The number one ingredient in this is one of those may or may not but probably doesn&#x27;t cause cancers chemicals.  Do yourself a favor spend a few extra bucks and get pure 100% natural Argan Oil.  It works 100% better than this chemical stuff and it&#x27;s safe to use.  Or you can save a few bucks and you may or may not but probably won&#x27;t get a brain tumor.</li>
            <li> I have long, color treated hair that is naturally wavy that I usually blow out straight. I trim my ends often, use cleansing conditioner instead of shampoo (Wen, Herbal Essences Naked, etc.) and use deep conditioner as my DAILY conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;No matter what I use, my hair is always dry, frizzy, split ends...no matter how much I try to keep it moisturized. I have tried every leave in conditioner, oil, etc. with no results. I recently purchased a bottle of this oil at Marshalls and I am SOLD. After I blow dry my hair straight, I just put two drops in my hand and rub together-and smooth it thoroughly through the bottom half of my hair first, then all over afterwards. I do this so most of the oil goes to my ends.) AMAZING. My hair is shiny, split ends aren&#x27;t everywhere, and my hair isn&#x27;t curling up/frizzing with humidity. I can even go a day or two between blow outs/cleansing now. This is better than anything else I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with quick shipping. The oil has a good a fragrance. This hair oil works great on the hair, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I have tried all kinds of argan oils. This is the best. It last a while. Smells good. Great for blow-drying your hair, flat ironing your hair. A little goes a long way. I am African American and Indian. You can find this at Marshall&#x27;s if you get lucky. Wish it was cheaper though.</li>
            <li> the best thing ever for your hair! shiny and healthy! take it!</li>
            <li> I have used almost a whole bottle of this over the last year. I use a tiny squirt for my short hair to make it sit down in the humid weather we have here year-round. The amazing \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; is that my hair has become fuller and more healthy feeling! I put it in once it dries, or while it&#x27;s wet if I can&#x27;t wait around. My only complaint is that this bottle is too big to take on the plane, but that can be solved (and anyway, most places are less humid!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. I am motivated to write this by the one negative review, I did not purchase on Amazon, but I may in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s like magic in a bottle. My hair is pretty frizzy but with a lil bit of this stuff it&#x27;s very silky and soft. Not to mention it smells great! Whenever my friends are over they always try stealing it! I really think it&#x27;s a steal especially for around nine bucks. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Loooove this product!! Smells awesome and it is not grossly oily. I have oily scalp but this works great in making my hair smooth and healthy. I no longer use conditioner which made my hair fall out. Instead I used this after showers and it leaves my hair smell fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It helps me comb threw my very damaged tangled hair.</li>
            <li> the perfect oil for your hair not oily and let your hair easy to dry and shiny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;perfect for frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Always been a fan of Argan oil and with a dry scalp that is thirsty its easy for me to just apply this daily. I poured the entire bottle into an applicator bottle , one that you would use to dye your hair and it makes application to the scalp easy. But also on the hair is smells great and makes my hair feel great</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it makes my hair so soft and very little goes a long way so the bottle will last me a while, it also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product was AMAZING!!!!  It is my go-to product every time I get out the shower.  It makes my hair extra shiny and does not make it greasy at all.  Plus, it helps my hair to dry much faster without the damage of a hair blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Using this product cuts my drying/styling time almost in half. I use it every time I wash my hair and it really helps control the frizz too. I&#x27;ve bought more bottles to give to friends who also have thick, frizzy long hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels amazing. Doesn&#x27;t leave that oily, sticky feeling either. It&#x27;s definitely one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  This is the best place Ive found to buy these at.  It makes my curly dry hair feel soft and managable</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  The tiniest drop is all I need for my hair to feel baby soft.  So, I think this one bottle will last me a year!  Smells great, too.</li>
            <li> It does helps with dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only Moroccan hair oil I like, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  It helps your hair dry quickly, leaves it smooth without being greasy, and has a great scent.  I even use it on my kids.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is actually doing anything for my hair, but it smells incredibly good. So I keep using it for that reason. The bottle itself is a little inconvenient, just because of how easily the product comes out - you literally can&#x27;t use more than a couple of drops at a time without turning into a greaseball.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;............great!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used. It smells great, and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I don&#x27;t use conditioner anymore. But a quarter size dollop in hands a distribute evenly through hair , comb and away you go.😘</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now. I have long wavy hair and it&#x27;s able to tame it! And for winter it helps my scalp not to get too dry. I also like this product Bcs it lasts you for a few months, since you only need to use so little. I am glad that I found it for a good price on amazon, Bcs is so hard to find it in tjmaxx now for the same price. It always sells out there.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product any better or worse than any other oil that I have used.  I was put off by the dyes Red 17 and yellow 11 along with the  cyclopentasiloxane, (whatever that is?</li>
            <li> I love this hair oil. You can use it on wet or dry hair. For my hair it works on damp hair. It has a ligjht scent. It does help frizziness.Reduces drying time. Love the price!!!!!!!!  Arrive on time . Rate it 5-10  Ms.B</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product when I purchased a new flat iron /curler for my hair. Love the smell abd thickness of the serum. And with my texture of hair it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily looking. It provides the right asking of shine &amp; softness. I do not use this on my wet hair tho I might try. I use this as a styling gloss to protect my hair from heat and to combat frizz... and I&#x27;m impressed. The second time I ran into this product was in TJ Maxx and I didnt hesitate to spend the $10... as this bottle will last me atleast 3-4 months. Its worth the coin whether you wear your hsir straight or curly.</li>
            <li> i use this every day!!! makes my hair so soft and cuts down the frizz!!! best thing i&#x27;ve ever had for my hair</li>
            <li> Has worked wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was becoming dry and not so nice due to a medicine I&#x27;m taking. My hair stylist suggested that I try this product. I&#x27;m impressed! Hair is so soft, smooth with a little more body. An extra good thing is you use just a little bit so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product from a local store and didn&#x27;t expect much.  The first time I used it I noticed that I was able to blow dry my hair almost straight.  My hair feels so smooth and soft.  It&#x27;s not like any other Argan oil that I&#x27;ve tried before.  This stuff is just amazing.  It has a very clean smell and is not greasy like most oils I&#x27;ve tried.  You will not be disappointed if you try to product.</li>
            <li> love this product..&lt;br /&gt;I found this product at the tjmaxx for a steal and fell in love.So I have been using this ever since.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say this is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever had lol. Love it, so I I had to come find it on Amazon and get more. Lasts forever and makes my hair literally feel so silky.</li>
            <li> This hair is exactly what it says MAGIC. I use a small amount in my hair daily and it works like magic. Keeps my hair manageable, soft and shinny. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This oil is the best!  It comes in a small bottle, but lasts such a long time.  I have very short hair and I put on about a pea-sized amount.  It makes my hair shiny and it smells great-without any oily feel.</li>
            <li> This product was quite a discovery for me. I just seem to like everything about this product.  I&#x27;m a 63 year old guy with wavy, aging hair. The pleasant scent, the shine, the gentle hold are great.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many similar products. All have left my hair weighed down. This controls frizz without losing body. AWESOME!!  Great price!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really works. It makes your hair shiny, manageable and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite hair products. It makes my hair dry faster and makes it so shiny. I think it also means that I don&#x27;t gave to wash it every day. Use sparingly until you see how much your hair takes. Go too far and you gave to wash it out. I use after I towel dry my hair. Then style. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product it made my hair soft and manageable and sOooooooooooo shiney!!!! I used it on my 4 year grandson&#x27;s dreads and Wow! what a difference it made, he had more moisture and it actually seem to make your hair grow! lu it!</li>
            <li> Helps with my dryness, tangling (as I have long hair) giving me more shine and loads of complements from strangers...</li>
            <li> The best for curly hair</li>
            <li> Makes our hair sooooo soft! Just a drop the size of a nickel applied to fresh clean shampooed &amp; conditioned hair makes it feel the softest ever. Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing like it...  Awesome......Smells great, Fells great. Not sticky or greasy.  Leaves hair soft, suptle, shiny and bouncy.  Try it!</li>
            <li> This smells soooo good and makes my hair so shiny and soft. It lasts foreverrr because you only have to use a small amount. I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This product leaves hair soft, smooth and hydrated (at least seemingly), and it smells really good. Definitely will keep using it. I did not buy it from Amazon, but it is so good that I wanted to leave a review on amazon. Although it is a little overpriced here. I paid only $7.99 (before tax) for it.</li>
            <li> This oil is not too thin or thick, just put a nickel size on your wet hair and it&#x27;s enough. Also smells amazing. Love this product. Used to buy it at CVS for $10 so I&#x27;m very annoyed that the price is now $20. What happened? Where can I find this for $10 again? The high price is the only reason it gets four stars.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING and makes my hair feel incredibly soft. I usually put it in my hair when I get out of the shower or just put a little in my hands and run it through my dry curly hair to tame frizz without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> This is really good for your hair it helps keep your hair healthy my hair is growing so long and this oil really did it..</li>
            <li> READ THE INGREDIENTS!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It really is magic.</li>
            <li> Love it. ..I tried others, but came back for this. .</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have tried argan oils from different retailers, but fell in love with this one! Its perfect. Its not too thin or thick. I am AA with relaxed hair and am prone to using professional products with the addition to a few from Sallys. This is the best argan oil hands down. I mix it with my conditioners, use it as a leave in, and use prior to drying and during flat ironing and curling. My hair is silky, soft, conditioned, moisturized, bouncy, and it FLOWS!!! You&#x27;ll definitely have salon finished hair! Its so in demand its hard to find...so buy buy buy!!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have curly, dry hair. I have tried MANY products, but this oil is the best! Highly recommend it to anyone with unruly hair. You do not need a lot. Leaves hair silk. I have ordered it four different times!</li>
