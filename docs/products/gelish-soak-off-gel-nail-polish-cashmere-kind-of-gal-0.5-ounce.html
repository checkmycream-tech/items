            <li>I absolutely LOVE the Gelish line.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Gelish polishes, and I love this color...</li>
            <li>I used this with a glittery top coat and was very pleased, a nice New Years Eve look.</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>because I used the same process I always have, it has always worked great for me, and the rest of my nails turned out fine.  </li>
            <li>was so happy to finally see a light gray color , with no shimmer.</li>
            <li>light gray color</li>
            <li>#2 Apply smoothly and evenly #3</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so bizarre,</li>
            <li>Gelish is my favorite brand, no disappointment here.</li>
            <li>This is a light gray.</li>
            <li>Perfect grey color, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>love this product, fantastic brand, with thin coats this product is perfect, also this color is a fantastic light grey.</li>
            <li>I have quite a few Gelish colors, and hadn&#x27;t experienced an issue with application until I tried this color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was more liquid than the regular gel polish ( I always use Harmony)&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first gelish harmony product that I have had an issue with.</li>
            <li>It is a medium gray and looks really pretty with some sparkles over it or by itself.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li>This color worked best for me by applying 3 very thin coats.</li>
            <li>This polish has withstood a SERIOUS beating and it still looks as gorgeous as it did the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I expected better from Gelish</li>
            <li>Love the color but not worth it when that happens.</li>
            <li>It has cut my spending and time down significantly compared to going to my nail salon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great color, but unfortunately I would definitely not recommend this polish to anyone because of the quality.</li>
            <li>however, the color is a really pretty gray, and once application is complete, this color lasts as long as all the other Gelish colors.</li>
            <li>Although I have been happy with all other gelish polishes, this one was definitely a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>I am a very busy, single, working mother of four children ages 13, 10, &amp; 4 (twins) and am constantly moving, cleaning, dressing, batheing, you name it.  </li>

            <li> I tried this polish at least 4 different times, each time taking it off and reapplying, and it never looked right.  </li>
            <li> but I realized with practice it covers much better with 3-4 very thin coats.</li>
            <li> for the new dark grey color Fashionably chic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flat grey</li>
            <li> It does not last as long as the other colors I have gotten.  </li>
            <li> not have the lasting power of my other gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice with my manicure and it was the same on a few nails.</li>
            <li> This is a lot thinner in consistency than all my other Gellish polishes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gelish and other brands of gel polish for about 6 months now and have never had a problem, until this color!  </li>
            <li> I have bought this color from two different sellers and sadly they have the same problem.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit getting used to it</li>
            <li> Even with super thin coats, I always have at least one nail that wrinkles during curing, which gets rather irritating (that&#x27;s why I rated this with 3 stars).  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and $.  </li>
            <li> tried a few times ...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money trying to use this.</li>
            <li> Apply to thickly</li>
            <li> This polish wrinkles so much that it looks horrible.  </li>
            <li> Apply to thinly</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s a bad bottle</li>
            <li> I read that it wrinkled when it cured so i was skeptical to buy it</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with this color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you cure started to shrink and show some weird</li>
            <li> It tends to discolor as the week goes on and look a bit dirty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but 3 of my nails wrinkled really really badly.  </li>

            <li> Great medium-light pure gray color.</li>
            <li> Every time I tried to use this it wrinkles.  Waste of time and $.  I expected better from Gelish</li>
            <li> I read that it wrinkled when it cured so i was skeptical to buy it glad i did because it worked out just fine and i love it. light gray color</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t my favorite gelish polish. It tends to discolor as the week goes on and look a bit dirty. It does look very nice when first applied.&lt;br /&gt;Does not have the lasting power of my other gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> love this product, fantastic brand, with thin coats this product is perfect, also this color is a fantastic light grey.</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with this color. Looks beautiful..BUT didnt work as usual.&lt;br /&gt;It was more liquid than the regular gel polish ( I always use Harmony)&lt;br /&gt;After you cure started to shrink and show some weird texture.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to finally see a light gray color , with no shimmer. But it didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;We tried a few times ...didnt work.&lt;br /&gt;Same for the new dark grey color Fashionably chic. It didnt work well either.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they changed something on the formula on these colors?</li>
            <li> Loved the color. Went on nice and smooth. No bubbling like some whites do. Perfect grey color, exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a lot thinner in consistency than all my other Gellish polishes. It took a little bit getting used to it but I realized with practice it covers much better with 3-4 very thin coats. When used under Water Field it makes the perfect accent nail!</li>
            <li> This polish wrinkles so much that it looks horrible.  I have been using gelish polish for 2 years and have never had a polish that wrinkles like this.  I tried doing thinner coats, thicker coats, longer time in the lamp, shorter time in the lamp, but nothing helped.  I tried this polish at least 4 different times, each time taking it off and reapplying, and it never looked right.  Although I have been happy with all other gelish polishes, this one was definitely a disappointment.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money trying to use this.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few Gelish colors, and hadn&#x27;t experienced an issue with application until I tried this color. Even with super thin coats, I always have at least one nail that wrinkles during curing, which gets rather irritating (that&#x27;s why I rated this with 3 stars).  however, the color is a really pretty gray, and once application is complete, this color lasts as long as all the other Gelish colors.</li>
            <li> In no part is the seller to blame, but this color wrinkles during the curing process. BUT you can get it to work with Patience! #1 Do Not do more than 3 layers! #2 Apply smoothly and evenly #3 Apply to thickly and it will wrinkle #4 Apply to thinly and you get holes and streaks. I have bought this color from two different sellers and sadly they have the same problem. This is the first gelish harmony product that I have had an issue with.</li>
            <li> This polish gets ridges when it dries. I tried it twice with my manicure and it was the same on a few nails. Love the color but not worth it when that happens.</li>
            <li> It is a medium gray and looks really pretty with some sparkles over it or by itself. I love it!</li>
            <li> this color for some reason peels very easily.  It does not last as long as the other colors I have gotten.  I am not sure if it&#x27;s a bad bottle or if it has something to do with the lack of &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gelish and other brands of gel polish for about 6 months now and have never had a problem, until this color!  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but 3 of my nails wrinkled really really badly.  It&#x27;s so bizarre, because I used the same process I always have, it has always worked great for me, and the rest of my nails turned out fine.  It&#x27;s a great color, but unfortunately I would definitely not recommend this polish to anyone because of the quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Gelish line.  It has cut my spending and time down significantly compared to going to my nail salon.  I had been spending between $50-70 and 2 hours every two weeks in nail salons.  Now that I have this system...I WILL NEVER GO back to the salon again.  I can&#x27;t get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a week and there is not a chip, scratch or crack in my polish.  I am a very busy, single, working mother of four children ages 13, 10, &amp; 4 (twins) and am constantly moving, cleaning, dressing, batheing, you name it.  This polish has withstood a SERIOUS beating and it still looks as gorgeous as it did the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have six colors and plan to continue growing my collection.  If you have any doubts, push them aside; this product is PHENOMENAL!!!!</li>
            <li> Great color for fall and winter! This color worked best for me by applying 3 very thin coats. Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> I prefer Gelish polishes, and I love this color...perfect shade of gray!</li>
            <li> I used this with a glittery top coat and was very pleased, a nice New Years Eve look. Sophisticated and festive!</li>
            <li> Gelish is my favorite brand, no disappointment here. This is a light gray. No shimmer. It&#x27;s flat grey</li>
