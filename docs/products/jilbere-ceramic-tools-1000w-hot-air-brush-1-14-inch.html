            <li>They just weren&#x27;t nearly as good!!  </li>
            <li>This one works the best ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li>lower setting is perfect for finishing a style.</li>
            <li>This is the best one of all..</li>
            <li>the best</li>
            <li>GREAT INVESTMENT!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because its one of the best ones I have had and the quality of the ceramic barrel is good, but they keep breaking.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great...</li>
            <li>This tool works great.</li>
            <li>It gives great volume and shape and my arms don&#x27;t hurt afterwards.</li>
            <li>When working, it is great though.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.</li>
            <li>I had mine for about two years, and it was great while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>It has great power</li>
            <li>If you luck out and get one that lasts 2 years, they work great.  </li>
            <li>She told me she bought this great blow dryer brush in one.</li>
            <li>So now I have a brush that is shorter, but it still works great.</li>
            <li>It truly is a great product.</li>
            <li>I love this brush!!</li>
            <li>fantastic - thank you!!!</li>
            <li>Everyone Loves It and it remains a very popular product that is used and  also sold at our Salon.</li>
            <li>and I kind of miss it!  </li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Two years of hair product on it had kind of ruined the bristles but otherwise, it was a great tool and served its purpose.</li>
            <li>wife loved it - but she already had one which was making sounds - this was a replacement</li>
            <li>has a good concept here</li>
            <li>I abosolutely loved it....while it worked.  </li>
            <li>I find that I now can get my hair to look as good as the hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>A good size of hair to use on the brush at a time is an amount that covers an inch in depth on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Best hot brush ever!!</li>
            <li>use it 3 times a week on my bangs only---less than 3 months--doesn&#x27;t work!---love the product but very cheaply made!</li>
            <li>Again, a great product that 1.made my life easier, 2. gives a way better appearance to my hair and 3.</li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This is the best hot air brush on the market</li>
            <li>But the time saving and what it does to my hair more than makes up for that!</li>
            <li>Love this tool!</li>
            <li>I tried it and fell in love!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>

            <li>the shine is amazing.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>She was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>I though it was no longer made and am thrilled to see I can get one.</li>
            <li>SOOOO easy and looks just as good as the salon.</li>
            <li>over done would love to see a better model come out!</li>
            <li>It was great for curly hair, I had it 3 months and it stopped getting hot!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!    </li>
            <li>Great product highly recommended !!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ve certainly destroyed a great styling tool.</li>
            <li>Would give four or five stars if the brush had a better longevity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this item for more than a couple of years</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I have had my Jilbere Ceramic Tool brush for so many years, I can&#x27;t even count.</li>
            <li>Ok, have to admit, being in a crunch, I sent my daughter to buy me another one, after the one I had kicked the bucket.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks, frizz is gone and</li>
            <li>I am glad that i was able to return it before the date specified.</li>
            <li>And yes, it gives you lots of \\&quot;poof\\&quot; on the top too ladies.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>None of the ones I&#x27;ve had lasted for more than a year or two, anyway.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure that is because it is meant for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>and she has been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>last one lasted me 6 years very happy to have another!!!</li>
            <li>I love the size of the barrel on this product.</li>
            <li>i love it and recomend it to anyone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I switched.  </li>
            <li>Although I did not purchase this from Amazon, I did pick it up at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and wasn&#x27;t sure if I would keep it.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>but it is wonderful overall...</li>
            <li>I was so glad I found it here</li>
            <li>To return it to the manufacturer costs $10 on top of the postage needed to ship it.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s the absolute best hot air brush.</li>
            <li>In addition, I have a finer toothed comb to pull in the fly away hair that I can&#x27;t use my boar brush on and to clean the hot brush and the boar brush</li>
            <li>The barrel is the right size, the bristles are perfect for catching hair without tangling in the brush, but all 3 units just suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li>The Jilbere is much better at adding body to my fine, wavy, chin-to-shoulder length layered hair, and letting me curl the ends under.</li>
            <li>my hair looks fantastic (and healthy).   </li>
            <li>Easy, soft great texture I use it every time I wash my hair</li>
            <li>I read that a hot air brush like this would make it easier to replicate the technique, and it pretty much has! :D</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and dries and styles my hair to my liking.  </li>
            <li>The higher setting kind of fries my hair</li>
            <li>Also the hot brush verey effective in turning curls into easy-to-manage waves...</li>
            <li>They work great to smooth and style barely damp hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and frizz was a problem</li>
            <li>This brand of brush works for my fine silky hair and does not tangle.</li>
            <li>still use the boar bristle brush right after the hot brush to re-emphasize the style with great success.</li>
            <li>My favorite Hot Air Brush!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair volumized, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Then I use the Jilbere to smooth and style.</li>
            <li>Works fabulous.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an amazing product. .</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last forever, about two years, but they are great while you have them.</li>
            <li>gets my curly hair smooth without  any effort.</li>
            <li>Only need the one hand to use it which is its great advantage.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you are going to love it!</li>
            <li>It makes styling hair quick &amp; easy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I discovered the JILBERE Hot Air Brush.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this Hot air brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been three years since I tried this brush for the first time and ladies I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love this product because you can style your hair into waves or curls without damaging to the extent that a hot iron would.</li>
            <li>Love this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>However, I decided to eventually replace it with the  John Frieda Salon Shape 1.5 Inch Hot Air Brush because of the larger barrel and the cool setting option &amp; I have to say that I have found these  2 features to be very worthwhile and make for an even better product!   </li>
            <li>I really  love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember the wattage on the Jilbere, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was either 1000 or 1200 watts.  </li>
            <li>This works the best as far as smoothing and styling my hair, but it only lasts about a week.</li>
            <li>I wish there was an easier way to clean hair and hair product off of it.</li>
            <li>Great brush to dry hair.  </li>
            <li>, I bought it right away!</li>
            <li>I just wish there would be cool fan button on this brush.</li>
            <li>I think it should have a cool air selection.</li>
            <li>Hair looks shiny and full of volume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been going for at least 2 years now, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It grips my hair without tangling, dries my hair quickly, and leaves it full of body and style.</li>
            <li>I have very straight fine hair, and it didn&#x27;t work to give my hair the body or lift I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I have had several different brands of this type of air brush over the years, and this model styled my hair the best and was the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li>Dries and styles hair so quickly</li>
            <li>I really wish it were more powerful.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s helped me tremendously</li>
            <li>I find my method instills more natural, smooth wave as well as body and root lift.  </li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and soft and I got so many compliments, I recommended it to everyone.</li>
            <li>The brush can get very hot and I try not to touch it when drying my hair</li>
            <li>It gets VERY hot and does not blow out a lot of air.</li>
            <li>The casing on the handle gets very hot as well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, fast and I longer have to worry about burning my air (or my skin).  </li>
            <li>Cant send it back because it has been more than 30 days!</li>
            <li>I was so upset I mourned my hot brush for almost a year!</li>
            <li>They are great when they work other than getting way too hot.</li>
            <li>Great for thin fine hair too!</li>
            <li>Great to add a little oomph at the end of the day without rewetting hair.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I love the way this brush leaves my coarse, curly hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I had had two in 6 years and they were worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I loved this brush so much that when I left it somewhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands and have liked none of them as well as this Jilbere model.  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it worked, even with some of the bristles flattening in a short time,  its not something that I will buy again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that this brush dies after 2 years or so, but for the style I want, it&#x27;s worth it until another brush comes along.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it there is no other like it not even for the price!!</li>
            <li>Some of my hair is still frizzy looking because I need to work on segmenting it into appropriate sizes before I use this hot air brush, but for the most part it worked as expected on my first try!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curling iron better than any other from years of use.  </li>
            <li>I also own the Conair 1 inch hot air and sometimes I use that if I want a little more curve in my hair ends.  </li>
            <li>However it helps me so much its worth $20 a year!</li>
            <li>something isn&#x27;t right with this brush.</li>
            <li>so exited  that I used it right</li>
            <li>Lol and after that it broke down on me!!</li>
            <li>So thank you to Amazon for the public product review and thanks to everyone who takes the time out to help others by writing the review!! :)</li>
            <li>I had a my 1ast one for a year and a half and loved it.  </li>
            <li>detachable and or burned out super fast within 1-2 months.</li>
            <li>The tip on this one makes it easy to use and it has stronger, thicker bristles than other hot hair brushes which makes it my favorite.</li>
            <li>I also think it is best to use moose or spray your hair with hair spray before using the hot air brush if you have hair like mine (thin, no-body and straight).</li>
            <li>fluffs up my hair which I need because my hair is very straight and has no body.</li>
            <li>First one died after 9 months.</li>
            <li>It worked well the first day I bought it</li>
            <li>and I like using this hot air brush to finish the bottom and sides.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my freeze unmanageable hair looks waaay better on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It never got overly hot, the bristles never melted, my hair has never been damaged.</li>
            <li>Then the hot air brush won&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
            <li>It also gets too hot to touch it.</li>
            <li>My first Jilbere hot air brush lasted over 10 years.</li>
            <li>for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Then they start getting so hot, you can&#x27;t even touch the barrel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for another 1-1/4\\&quot; hot air brush.</li>
            <li>I have had many different hot air dryers over the years, and basically I had given up on them.</li>
            <li>If they ever stop making this hot air dryer, I&#x27;ll probably shave my head~</li>
            <li>I never had any problems with flattened bristles or anything like that, but I did notice that after awhile, it started getting extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>The first one I ever bought was a conair</li>
            <li>, then I dropped the second one, bending it at the connection between the brush and the dryer part (that one still works, so I keep it in my gym bag :-)  </li>
            <li>Often got too hot and then just died.</li>
            <li>Have owned the Jilbere hot air brush for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li>I like the hot air brush.</li>
            <li>The heat in this air brush was WAY TOO HOT.  </li>
            <li>Just bought my first one.</li>
            <li>This makes it easier to keep it exactly where I want it in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchase many things from Amazon and the reviews on various items</li>
            <li>My hair dresser told me to get a hot air brush and this is the one I purchased.  </li>
            <li>TRUST ME  ;)</li>
            <li>It looked pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted about 4 years.</li>
            <li>When I first used this hot air brush, I was in heaven.</li>
            <li>So will I buy another hot air brush, absolutely!</li>
            <li>The 1st day worked great the 2nd day the black handle got warm, 3rd</li>
            <li>It is true than with time it deteriorates, but everything in live does.</li>
            <li>Mine usually last at least a year, but these are the best on the market that I have found to do the job.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but gets hot and the sound goes up and down</li>
            <li>This is a great curling brush, but as other reviewers have noted, don&#x27;t expect it to last forever.  </li>
            <li>The high gets pretty hot so start with the medium.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to style the back of your hair using this brush.  </li>
            <li>I believe this will extend its life in time, and it is certainly gentler on my hair.</li>
            <li>I came on here prior to opening the box to try out the new brush and glad I did.</li>
            <li>This brush has been a godsend for my hair AND my arms --- I have fine, shoulder-length, curly hair that becomes frizzy and kinky if I do not blowdry it quickly &amp; precisely enough when trying to straighten it.  </li>
            <li>I encouraged my grandmother to buy this as well, since has the same hair style (chin-length bob) and fine hair that I have</li>
            <li>As these get older sometimes they get too hot</li>
            <li>and I would have to stop frequently because it was too hot!</li>
            <li>I can either put some curl in it or leave it straight with lots of body.</li>
            <li>so I REALLY need something to eliminate frizz).</li>
            <li>What i really like this product for is when I have &amp;#34;second day hair&amp;#34; and it need a bit of fluffing up.</li>
            <li>People are very helpful when they take the time to write up a review on their purchases...</li>
            <li>I love how this brush lets me freshen and style my hair without having to wet it and start from scratch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MUCH easier to style my hair than managing a hair dryer and round brush, and has a good high setting for quick drying of the roots, and low setting for styling.  </li>
            <li>, the Jilbere Hot Air Brush was the only I found to consistently receive high reviews across multiple websites, and from more than just a handful of customers.  </li>
            <li>I find since my hair is thin, it is best to use the dryer when my hair is pretty wet unlike the instructions say to semi-dry.  </li>
            <li>Never had tangle issues, it gives much more volume of air than other products tried.</li>
            <li>And the bristles are better on the other one, too.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is you can&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li>makes my blowdry super fast (between regular blowdry with dryer and blowdry with air brush</li>
            <li>Sooo, now I have the 2nd one of these hot air dryers, love it, but now after about 6 months, the bristles are going flat!!</li>
            <li>I too had used the Jibere hot air brush for many years but they only lasted a few years, but still worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is I need to know how to successful use it on the front, were i have small hair.  </li>
            <li>Last month I bought both the Jilbere Hot Air Brush and the Infiniti by Conair BC173 Hot Air Styler.</li>
            <li>I have owned this particular brush for about a month.</li>
            <li>Two temp settings allows for quick drying (high) and then a low setting for the style.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>It has two settings, medium and high.  </li>
            <li>Third one died at exactly one month!</li>
            <li>it  is so lightweight and easy to manipulate from every angle that I am consistently able to create a refined &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; result from all sides with minimal frizz, in MUCH less time, without my arms!  </li>
            <li>I can also never get the brush tight enough to make my hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this styling tool and the convenience of not having to use a round brush, but it looks like that&#x27;s what I will be returning to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that many have had issues with it not lasting long.</li>
            <li>Previous to buying this, I tried many other brushes that just were not as effective, did not curl my hair smoothly leaving it frizzy, cord too short, got too hot or not hot enough.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine, thick hair and most of the hot air brushes have little stub bristles which would not even penetrate my hair,</li>
            <li>I love that I can just use this to blow dry my hair and curl it at the same time.</li>
            <li>The ceramic helps eliminate frizz (plus I live in South Florida</li>
            <li>help me a lot when buying something completely new.</li>
            <li>It was so hot that as I was using it, it would actually heat up the necklace I was wearing and burn my neck.  </li>
            <li>I have owned a handful of hot air brushes over the years and they typically last 1-2 years tops for me.</li>
            <li>The only blower I will use-dries and styles in one fast step!</li>
            <li>Would not change it for no other!!!</li>
            <li>away.it was fine until tried using it the second time and noticed that  the tip had melted from the first use and was breaking in little peices until it completely came</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more likely to actually do my hair now because it doesn&#x27;t take nearly as long</li>
            <li>I think I would have an easier time engaging with my hair if that was the case because when I dry smaller segments of hair, it refuses to wrap around this brush the way I want it to</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li>This brush served me very well and lasted several years.</li>
            <li>My daughter said I look like an old lady and after looking at a picture I agreed.</li>
            <li>In February it will be a year I bought it, and so far (fingers crossed)</li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day</li>
            <li>is exhausting and time consuming with my kind of hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is dry to oily,  plus it&#x27;s wavy curly, so it tends to be very freezy!</li>
            <li>Additionally, it saves me time in the morning since I don&#x27;t have to wrestle with a blow dryer and a round brush, so it is worth it to me!</li>
            <li>I have tried several different brands of Hot Air Brush</li>
            <li>only wish that this hot brush was smaller.</li>
            <li>only wash my hair 1-2 times per week, so it isn&#x27;t even getting high usage.&lt;br /&gt;Jilbere</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough to dry hair quickly and the bristles seem a little longer than others.</li>
            <li>This is my third purchase of this brush in ten years, with daily use - the first one was 8 years old when I burned it up using it in Europe - oops!</li>
            <li>I have bought three of these, they work well on my curly hair to blow dry straight.</li>
            <li>and it helps me get it dry sooo much faster.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they would only last 1 or 2 years, but I like it so much</li>
            <li>so I found myself trying to work with too much of it at a time, leaving some of the hair still wet because it was too far away from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not had any other hot air brushes to compare, but know that this one does everything I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>(air dry or via a regular blow dryer) and then use the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>It usually lasts about two years before it burns out even if I keep the brush and air intake clean.</li>
            <li>Accomplishing this, especially around the back of my head, while trying to manage a traditional brush and hairdryer at just the right angles, is not only cumbersome but burdensome.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind there being a few more bristles on the brush so that it grabbed my hair more tautly in areas where my hair does not grow in as thickly, but the areas affected by that are few (and can easily be followed up with a few passes of my flat iron if necessary.)  </li>
            <li>I usually use the low setting since I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have purchased over 5 of these, I worked for Ulta as the General Manager, I had the opportunity to try all&lt;br /&gt;sorts of things</li>
            <li>but sometimes I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several others that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>When it wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought it would be, I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was doing it wrong.....  </li>
            <li>My only complaint - and that&#x27;s probably stretching it - is that it can get very hot on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>the black handle got really hot and the 4th day</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and have no skills holding a blow dryer in one hand and using a round brush in the other, this is a fantastic solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a new one and can only hope it will be as long lasting as this one.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers suggest, I first use a regular blow dryer (drying with my head upside-down for root lift) to get my hair 85% dry.</li>
            <li>I am actually back here to purchase another because despite its relatively limited lifespan and somewhat frightening capacity for heat, I really liked it while it worked</li>
            <li>In the grand scheme of things, $30 isn&#x27;t too bad of a price to pay every couple of years, I guess, considering how much I pay to have my hair cut, colored, styled, etc.  </li>

            <li> Best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> They just weren&#x27;t nearly as good!!  </li>
            <li> This one works the best ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li> lower setting is perfect for finishing a style.</li>
            <li> This is the best one of all..</li>
            <li> the best</li>
            <li> GREAT INVESTMENT!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because its one of the best ones I have had and the quality of the ceramic barrel is good, but they keep breaking.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great...</li>
            <li> This tool works great.</li>
            <li> It gives great volume and shape and my arms don&#x27;t hurt afterwards.</li>
            <li> When working, it is great though.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.</li>
            <li> I had mine for about two years, and it was great while it lasted.  </li>
            <li> It has great power</li>
            <li> If you luck out and get one that lasts 2 years, they work great.  </li>
            <li> She told me she bought this great blow dryer brush in one.</li>
            <li> So now I have a brush that is shorter, but it still works great.</li>
            <li> It truly is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!</li>
            <li> fantastic - thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone Loves It and it remains a very popular product that is used and  also sold at our Salon.</li>
            <li> and I kind of miss it!  </li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Two years of hair product on it had kind of ruined the bristles but otherwise, it was a great tool and served its purpose.</li>
            <li> wife loved it - but she already had one which was making sounds - this was a replacement</li>
            <li> has a good concept here</li>
            <li> I abosolutely loved it....while it worked.  </li>
            <li> I find that I now can get my hair to look as good as the hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> A good size of hair to use on the brush at a time is an amount that covers an inch in depth on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Best hot brush ever!!</li>
            <li> use it 3 times a week on my bangs only---less than 3 months--doesn&#x27;t work!---love the product but very cheaply made!</li>
            <li> Again, a great product that 1.made my life easier, 2. gives a way better appearance to my hair and 3.</li>
            <li> love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this brush!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is the best hot air brush on the market</li>
            <li> But the time saving and what it does to my hair more than makes up for that!</li>
            <li> Love this tool!</li>
            <li> I tried it and fell in love!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> This hot brush leaves your hair looking silky and beautiful!!</li>
            <li> the shine is amazing.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> She was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I though it was no longer made and am thrilled to see I can get one.</li>
            <li> SOOOO easy and looks just as good as the salon.</li>
            <li> over done would love to see a better model come out!</li>
            <li> It was great for curly hair, I had it 3 months and it stopped getting hot!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!    </li>
            <li> Great product highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;ve certainly destroyed a great styling tool.</li>
            <li> Would give four or five stars if the brush had a better longevity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this item for more than a couple of years</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I have had my Jilbere Ceramic Tool brush for so many years, I can&#x27;t even count.</li>
            <li> Ok, have to admit, being in a crunch, I sent my daughter to buy me another one, after the one I had kicked the bucket.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks, frizz is gone and</li>
            <li> I am glad that i was able to return it before the date specified.</li>
            <li> And yes, it gives you lots of \\&quot;poof\\&quot; on the top too ladies.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> None of the ones I&#x27;ve had lasted for more than a year or two, anyway.  </li>
            <li> but I am sure that is because it is meant for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> and she has been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> last one lasted me 6 years very happy to have another!!!</li>
            <li> I love the size of the barrel on this product.</li>
            <li> i love it and recomend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I switched.  </li>
            <li> Although I did not purchase this from Amazon, I did pick it up at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and wasn&#x27;t sure if I would keep it.</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> but it is wonderful overall...</li>
            <li> I was so glad I found it here</li>
            <li> To return it to the manufacturer costs $10 on top of the postage needed to ship it.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s the absolute best hot air brush.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have a finer toothed comb to pull in the fly away hair that I can&#x27;t use my boar brush on and to clean the hot brush and the boar brush</li>
            <li> The barrel is the right size, the bristles are perfect for catching hair without tangling in the brush, but all 3 units just suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> The Jilbere is much better at adding body to my fine, wavy, chin-to-shoulder length layered hair, and letting me curl the ends under.</li>
            <li> my hair looks fantastic (and healthy).   </li>
            <li> Easy, soft great texture I use it every time I wash my hair</li>
            <li> I read that a hot air brush like this would make it easier to replicate the technique, and it pretty much has! :D</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and dries and styles my hair to my liking.  </li>
            <li> The higher setting kind of fries my hair</li>
            <li> Also the hot brush verey effective in turning curls into easy-to-manage waves...</li>
            <li> They work great to smooth and style barely damp hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and frizz was a problem</li>
            <li> This brand of brush works for my fine silky hair and does not tangle.</li>
            <li> still use the boar bristle brush right after the hot brush to re-emphasize the style with great success.</li>
            <li> My favorite Hot Air Brush!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair volumized, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Then I use the Jilbere to smooth and style.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous.</li>
            <li> Thanks for an amazing product. .</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last forever, about two years, but they are great while you have them.</li>
            <li> gets my curly hair smooth without  any effort.</li>
            <li> Only need the one hand to use it which is its great advantage.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you are going to love it!</li>
            <li> It makes styling hair quick &amp; easy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I discovered the JILBERE Hot Air Brush.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this Hot air brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been three years since I tried this brush for the first time and ladies I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love this product because you can style your hair into waves or curls without damaging to the extent that a hot iron would.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> However, I decided to eventually replace it with the  John Frieda Salon Shape 1.5 Inch Hot Air Brush because of the larger barrel and the cool setting option &amp; I have to say that I have found these  2 features to be very worthwhile and make for an even better product!   </li>
            <li> I really  love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the wattage on the Jilbere, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was either 1000 or 1200 watts.  </li>
            <li> This works the best as far as smoothing and styling my hair, but it only lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> I wish there was an easier way to clean hair and hair product off of it.</li>
            <li> Great brush to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> , I bought it right away!</li>
            <li> I just wish there would be cool fan button on this brush.</li>
            <li> I think it should have a cool air selection.</li>
            <li> Hair looks shiny and full of volume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been going for at least 2 years now, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It grips my hair without tangling, dries my hair quickly, and leaves it full of body and style.</li>
            <li> I have very straight fine hair, and it didn&#x27;t work to give my hair the body or lift I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I have had several different brands of this type of air brush over the years, and this model styled my hair the best and was the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li> Dries and styles hair so quickly</li>
            <li> I really wish it were more powerful.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s helped me tremendously</li>
            <li> I find my method instills more natural, smooth wave as well as body and root lift.  </li>
            <li> My hair was smooth and soft and I got so many compliments, I recommended it to everyone.</li>
            <li> The brush can get very hot and I try not to touch it when drying my hair</li>
            <li> It gets VERY hot and does not blow out a lot of air.</li>
            <li> The casing on the handle gets very hot as well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, fast and I longer have to worry about burning my air (or my skin).  </li>
            <li> Cant send it back because it has been more than 30 days!</li>
            <li> I was so upset I mourned my hot brush for almost a year!</li>
            <li> They are great when they work other than getting way too hot.</li>
            <li> Great for thin fine hair too!</li>
            <li> Great to add a little oomph at the end of the day without rewetting hair.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush leaves my coarse, curly hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I had had two in 6 years and they were worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush so much that when I left it somewhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands and have liked none of them as well as this Jilbere model.  </li>
            <li> I liked the way it worked, even with some of the bristles flattening in a short time,  its not something that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that this brush dies after 2 years or so, but for the style I want, it&#x27;s worth it until another brush comes along.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it there is no other like it not even for the price!!</li>
            <li> Some of my hair is still frizzy looking because I need to work on segmenting it into appropriate sizes before I use this hot air brush, but for the most part it worked as expected on my first try!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron better than any other from years of use.  </li>
            <li> I also own the Conair 1 inch hot air and sometimes I use that if I want a little more curve in my hair ends.  </li>
            <li> However it helps me so much its worth $20 a year!</li>
            <li> something isn&#x27;t right with this brush.</li>
            <li> so exited  that I used it right</li>
            <li> Lol and after that it broke down on me!!</li>
            <li> So thank you to Amazon for the public product review and thanks to everyone who takes the time out to help others by writing the review!! :)</li>
            <li> I had a my 1ast one for a year and a half and loved it.  </li>
            <li> detachable and or burned out super fast within 1-2 months.</li>
            <li> The tip on this one makes it easy to use and it has stronger, thicker bristles than other hot hair brushes which makes it my favorite.</li>
            <li> I also think it is best to use moose or spray your hair with hair spray before using the hot air brush if you have hair like mine (thin, no-body and straight).</li>
            <li> fluffs up my hair which I need because my hair is very straight and has no body.</li>
            <li> First one died after 9 months.</li>
            <li> It worked well the first day I bought it</li>
            <li> and I like using this hot air brush to finish the bottom and sides.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my freeze unmanageable hair looks waaay better on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It never got overly hot, the bristles never melted, my hair has never been damaged.</li>
            <li> Then the hot air brush won&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> It also gets too hot to touch it.</li>
            <li> My first Jilbere hot air brush lasted over 10 years.</li>
            <li> for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Then they start getting so hot, you can&#x27;t even touch the barrel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for another 1-1/4\\&quot; hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I have had many different hot air dryers over the years, and basically I had given up on them.</li>
            <li> If they ever stop making this hot air dryer, I&#x27;ll probably shave my head~</li>
            <li> I never had any problems with flattened bristles or anything like that, but I did notice that after awhile, it started getting extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> The first one I ever bought was a conair</li>
            <li> , then I dropped the second one, bending it at the connection between the brush and the dryer part (that one still works, so I keep it in my gym bag :-)  </li>
            <li> Often got too hot and then just died.</li>
            <li> Have owned the Jilbere hot air brush for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> I like the hot air brush.</li>
            <li> The heat in this air brush was WAY TOO HOT.  </li>
            <li> Just bought my first one.</li>
            <li> This makes it easier to keep it exactly where I want it in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchase many things from Amazon and the reviews on various items</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me to get a hot air brush and this is the one I purchased.  </li>
            <li> TRUST ME  ;)</li>
            <li> It looked pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about 4 years.</li>
            <li> When I first used this hot air brush, I was in heaven.</li>
            <li> So will I buy another hot air brush, absolutely!</li>
            <li> The 1st day worked great the 2nd day the black handle got warm, 3rd</li>
            <li> It is true than with time it deteriorates, but everything in live does.</li>
            <li> Mine usually last at least a year, but these are the best on the market that I have found to do the job.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but gets hot and the sound goes up and down</li>
            <li> This is a great curling brush, but as other reviewers have noted, don&#x27;t expect it to last forever.  </li>
            <li> The high gets pretty hot so start with the medium.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to style the back of your hair using this brush.  </li>
            <li> I believe this will extend its life in time, and it is certainly gentler on my hair.</li>
            <li> I came on here prior to opening the box to try out the new brush and glad I did.</li>
            <li> This brush has been a godsend for my hair AND my arms --- I have fine, shoulder-length, curly hair that becomes frizzy and kinky if I do not blowdry it quickly &amp; precisely enough when trying to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> I encouraged my grandmother to buy this as well, since has the same hair style (chin-length bob) and fine hair that I have</li>
            <li> As these get older sometimes they get too hot</li>
            <li> and I would have to stop frequently because it was too hot!</li>
            <li> I can either put some curl in it or leave it straight with lots of body.</li>
            <li> so I REALLY need something to eliminate frizz).</li>
            <li> What i really like this product for is when I have &amp;#34;second day hair&amp;#34; and it need a bit of fluffing up.</li>
            <li> People are very helpful when they take the time to write up a review on their purchases...</li>
            <li> I love how this brush lets me freshen and style my hair without having to wet it and start from scratch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s MUCH easier to style my hair than managing a hair dryer and round brush, and has a good high setting for quick drying of the roots, and low setting for styling.  </li>
            <li> , the Jilbere Hot Air Brush was the only I found to consistently receive high reviews across multiple websites, and from more than just a handful of customers.  </li>
            <li> I find since my hair is thin, it is best to use the dryer when my hair is pretty wet unlike the instructions say to semi-dry.  </li>
            <li> Never had tangle issues, it gives much more volume of air than other products tried.</li>
            <li> And the bristles are better on the other one, too.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is you can&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li> makes my blowdry super fast (between regular blowdry with dryer and blowdry with air brush</li>
            <li> Sooo, now I have the 2nd one of these hot air dryers, love it, but now after about 6 months, the bristles are going flat!!</li>
            <li> I too had used the Jibere hot air brush for many years but they only lasted a few years, but still worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is I need to know how to successful use it on the front, were i have small hair.  </li>
            <li> Last month I bought both the Jilbere Hot Air Brush and the Infiniti by Conair BC173 Hot Air Styler.</li>
            <li> I have owned this particular brush for about a month.</li>
            <li> Two temp settings allows for quick drying (high) and then a low setting for the style.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> It has two settings, medium and high.  </li>
            <li> Third one died at exactly one month!</li>
            <li> it  is so lightweight and easy to manipulate from every angle that I am consistently able to create a refined &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; result from all sides with minimal frizz, in MUCH less time, without my arms!  </li>
            <li> I can also never get the brush tight enough to make my hair smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this styling tool and the convenience of not having to use a round brush, but it looks like that&#x27;s what I will be returning to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that many have had issues with it not lasting long.</li>
            <li> Previous to buying this, I tried many other brushes that just were not as effective, did not curl my hair smoothly leaving it frizzy, cord too short, got too hot or not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine, thick hair and most of the hot air brushes have little stub bristles which would not even penetrate my hair,</li>
            <li> I love that I can just use this to blow dry my hair and curl it at the same time.</li>
            <li> The ceramic helps eliminate frizz (plus I live in South Florida</li>
            <li> help me a lot when buying something completely new.</li>
            <li> It was so hot that as I was using it, it would actually heat up the necklace I was wearing and burn my neck.  </li>
            <li> I have owned a handful of hot air brushes over the years and they typically last 1-2 years tops for me.</li>
            <li> The only blower I will use-dries and styles in one fast step!</li>
            <li> Would not change it for no other!!!</li>
            <li> away.it was fine until tried using it the second time and noticed that  the tip had melted from the first use and was breaking in little peices until it completely came</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more likely to actually do my hair now because it doesn&#x27;t take nearly as long</li>
            <li> I think I would have an easier time engaging with my hair if that was the case because when I dry smaller segments of hair, it refuses to wrap around this brush the way I want it to</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li> This brush served me very well and lasted several years.</li>
            <li> My daughter said I look like an old lady and after looking at a picture I agreed.</li>
            <li> In February it will be a year I bought it, and so far (fingers crossed)</li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day</li>
            <li> is exhausting and time consuming with my kind of hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry to oily,  plus it&#x27;s wavy curly, so it tends to be very freezy!</li>
            <li> Additionally, it saves me time in the morning since I don&#x27;t have to wrestle with a blow dryer and a round brush, so it is worth it to me!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of Hot Air Brush</li>
            <li> only wish that this hot brush was smaller.</li>
            <li> only wash my hair 1-2 times per week, so it isn&#x27;t even getting high usage.&lt;br /&gt;Jilbere</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough to dry hair quickly and the bristles seem a little longer than others.</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of this brush in ten years, with daily use - the first one was 8 years old when I burned it up using it in Europe - oops!</li>
            <li> I have bought three of these, they work well on my curly hair to blow dry straight.</li>
            <li> and it helps me get it dry sooo much faster.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they would only last 1 or 2 years, but I like it so much</li>
            <li> so I found myself trying to work with too much of it at a time, leaving some of the hair still wet because it was too far away from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not had any other hot air brushes to compare, but know that this one does everything I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> (air dry or via a regular blow dryer) and then use the hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> It usually lasts about two years before it burns out even if I keep the brush and air intake clean.</li>
            <li> Accomplishing this, especially around the back of my head, while trying to manage a traditional brush and hairdryer at just the right angles, is not only cumbersome but burdensome.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind there being a few more bristles on the brush so that it grabbed my hair more tautly in areas where my hair does not grow in as thickly, but the areas affected by that are few (and can easily be followed up with a few passes of my flat iron if necessary.)  </li>
            <li> I usually use the low setting since I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have purchased over 5 of these, I worked for Ulta as the General Manager, I had the opportunity to try all&lt;br /&gt;sorts of things</li>
            <li> but sometimes I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several others that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> When it wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought it would be, I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was doing it wrong.....  </li>
            <li> My only complaint - and that&#x27;s probably stretching it - is that it can get very hot on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> the black handle got really hot and the 4th day</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and have no skills holding a blow dryer in one hand and using a round brush in the other, this is a fantastic solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering a new one and can only hope it will be as long lasting as this one.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers suggest, I first use a regular blow dryer (drying with my head upside-down for root lift) to get my hair 85% dry.</li>
            <li> I am actually back here to purchase another because despite its relatively limited lifespan and somewhat frightening capacity for heat, I really liked it while it worked</li>
            <li> In the grand scheme of things, $30 isn&#x27;t too bad of a price to pay every couple of years, I guess, considering how much I pay to have my hair cut, colored, styled, etc.  </li>
            <li> It got too hot for me to use for very long plus the bristles on the brush were too limp to get into my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different (and expensive ) blow dryers, curling irons, flat irons, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the look of flat ironed hair and using a blowdryer and brush</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick though</li>
            <li> my mid back long hair is completely dry AND styled in 20/25 min).</li>
            <li> I just dry my hair beforehand with the regular dryer combing my hair thru with fingers until it is at least 80/85% dry; then I add some extra styling oil, divide my hair in sections and use this hot air brush to straighten.</li>
            <li> My hair is between my ears and my shoulder, so not too long, but pretty thick, and I can style it in 5 minutes flat!</li>
            <li> I never blow dry my hair because it&#x27;s such a pain</li>
            <li> I have below shoulder length straight hair, but it&#x27;s thick in the back</li>
            <li> While I cannot speak to its longevity since I&#x27;ve had this product for less than a year, the price is so affordable for what it offers, that I won&#x27;t give a second thought to having to purchase a replacement, even if sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser commented on how few and far between the bristles were which would account for it not being as smoothing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, today it died and of course yesterday was the last day to return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> The current one for at least 15 years and the bristles are now wearing off, so I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair that will frizz and get a little wavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m annoying that I paid $45 for a dryer that lasted only half a year, but I&#x27;m so happy to have found the other one.  </li>
            <li> It helps me immensely with blow drying straight my frizz prone curly hair (I am not able to blow dry with round brush and dryer).</li>
            <li> but they replace them so you really can&#x27;t loose as long as you send in your registration.</li>
            <li> however it makes my hair feel alittle dry and</li>
            <li> I can wash, dry and style in a breeze and</li>
            <li> and I can essentially completely dry &amp; style</li>
            <li> I let my hair get about 75% dry</li>
            <li> However, after only a few months of use, the ceramic brush split open where it&#x27;s beginning to break my hair.</li>
            <li> I have had some of these loose the bristles</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s made to do, can be used on wet or dry hair for styling.</li>
            <li> My second one lasted less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only had that one a little over a year, and I should have known it was one</li>
            <li> I know they will talk their way out of it.40 dollars down the toilet.</li>
            <li> Tried to take it back, but after a couple of days where I got stuck at work late and ended up at Sally just after closing, I finally gave up and bought another brand at Target</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful not to touch the metal part of the brush because it can burn your finger.  </li>
            <li> I also find that you can use this product anytime to give some fluff to your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, but I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Conair hot brushes for the past 18-20 years, but have grown tired of them breaking in the middle, where the brush piece meets with the handle section.</li>
            <li> I had this for less than 3 months, using it on average two times a week, and it just stopped working, mid hairstyle.</li>
            <li> So, either it doesn&#x27;t stay running or the bristles go flat, either way, NOT very functional!!!</li>
            <li> I very lightly dry my hair with a blow dryer (or wait afew minutes till it dries slightly) then use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also purchased Conair hot air brushes &amp; they&#x27;re useless.</li>
            <li> Tried other  Options, but had to return them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it now for about 5 years and use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Revlon, Hot Tools Conair, all expensive brands either broke since they</li>
            <li> and it was very difficult to get my hair smooth, while still maintaining body.  </li>
            <li> Always just blew it dry with a diffuser to make it curly because I couldn&#x27;t manage the round brush and blow dryer technique.</li>
            <li> only negative is</li>
            <li> if you add mousse to damp roots and a medium amount onto the rest of hair and set it with hair spray i can achieve thick ringlets and big waves.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am not talented enough to round brush and blow dry</li>
            <li> It cut my hair drying time down from almost 30 minutes to about 10.</li>
            <li> I had to cut the bristle brush down by an inch and a half.</li>
            <li> much less grip it and style it.</li>
            <li> They, by the way, have been less than helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is basically a brush and blow dryer in one nifty little package.  </li>
            <li> So sad it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long (3\\&quot; past shoulder) wavy hair with a little frizz</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still stuck on my round brush and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I want to buy a brush that gives me the same results without the poor construction</li>
            <li> They work a few weeks up to a couple months and then die.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a round brush and a blow dryer to straighten my hair and it would take about 30 mins or so</li>
            <li> Asked my hairdresser to teach me how to use the round brush.</li>
            <li> Now dead.</li>
            <li> and I use the product as directed - on mostly dried hair.</li>
            <li> I would also like to see it offered in a 3/4 round brush as I need both widths.</li>
            <li> You know, like a round brush blow out.</li>
            <li> I need something that I can use for awhile, and not have to replace every few months.</li>
            <li> I read reviews before I bought, and hoped that the bad ones just weren&#x27;t using it right.</li>
            <li> Also helps tame frizz.</li>
            <li> so far this is the worst I&#x27;ve bought (and the most expensive).</li>
            <li> but no more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure if Conair always owned Jilbere</li>
            <li> It still turns on but only to a very low heat. :(</li>
            <li> I usually end up using this and a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Sadly cannot find a blow dry brush that lasts longer than a few months</li>
            <li> Additionally, it was impossible to get the very back of my hair with a brush and heavy blow dryer...</li>
            <li> A big disappointment because u could not regulate the temp on it.</li>
            <li> Since January I have gone through at least 5 of them.  </li>
            <li> I have used this item for at least 3 years now, 1-2x/week.  </li>
            <li> , I have thick curly hair....</li>
            <li> Seriously can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t discover this sooner.</li>
            <li> I had a Brazilian blowout done to my hair in the past few weeks, and I was getting frustrated trying to replicate the &amp;#34;voluminous straightening&amp;#34; that my stylist had achieved with a hair dryer and a round boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Too bad it stopped working after only using it (not even every day) for a about a month.. .</li>
            <li> and it still works, but the bristles are no good now.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> and I am getting addicted to it</li>
            <li> The reset button is broken.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was tired of hearing me complain, so she got this one and gave it to me.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s frustrating that the quality is plummeting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Sadly, they keep breaking.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for 4 months of use.</li>
            <li> the brush would sometimes snag my hair, was difficult to see and hair would sometimes get caught in the blow dryer</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Very disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> This little gem is a life saver!!!!!</li>
            <li> Then lately the quality has gotten very bad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible electronics.</li>
            <li> But it is very annoying!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and it only worked for 3 weeks. Just shut off and never worked again. Very disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> The brush is working, as advertised, as of this posting - about three weeks since received. My wife has had two of these brushes. Problem is they only seem to last about two years before the heating element gives out. Would give four or five stars if the brush had a better longevity.</li>
            <li> It makes styling hair quick &amp; easy</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one I&#x27;ve had in 2 1/2 years. First one died after 9 months. Second one almost lasted 2 years. Third one died at exactly one month! Horrible electronics. The barrel is the right size, the bristles are perfect for catching hair without tangling in the brush, but all 3 units just suddenly stopped working. No quality assurance on this product. Conair should be ashamed to sell this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok It worked well the first day I bought it but I&#x27;m still stuck on my round brush and blow dryer. It works don&#x27;t get me wrong however it makes my hair feel alittle dry and over done would love to see a better model come out!</li>
            <li> The screws fell out and kept breaking after replacing the screws threw it away</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush leaves my coarse, curly hair smooth and shiny. However, after only a few months of use, the ceramic brush split open where it&#x27;s beginning to break my hair. I can also feel the electric current go throw the brush as I hold the handle and it&#x27;s beginning to feel unsafe. I want to buy a brush that gives me the same results without the poor construction and I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this item for more than a couple of years and I use it in addition to my T3 hairdryer about 2X/week.  I have below shoulder length straight hair, but it&#x27;s thick in the back and I like using this hot air brush to finish the bottom and sides.  I would buy this again, and I may do just that as a back up.  I also own the Conair 1 inch hot air and sometimes I use that if I want a little more curve in my hair ends.  The brush can get very hot and I try not to touch it when drying my hair but sometimes I&#x27;m not careful.  I&#x27;m glad I discovered the JILBERE Hot Air Brush.</li>
            <li> It leaves my freeze unmanageable hair looks waaay better on a daily basis. Easy, soft great texture I use it every time I wash my hair and I am getting addicted to it :)  The only thing is I need to know how to successful use it on the front, were i have small hair.  Great product highly recommended !!</li>
            <li> I have had my Jilbere Ceramic Tool brush for so many years, I can&#x27;t even count. The only reason I am back to buy another is that my puppy chewed through the cord this morning. I was devastated! Previous to buying this, I tried many other brushes that just were not as effective, did not curl my hair smoothly leaving it frizzy, cord too short, got too hot or not hot enough. I use this brush daily on my medium length colored hair.  It never got overly hot, the bristles never melted, my hair has never been damaged. Ordering on Prime and can&#x27;t wait to get it!</li>
            <li> Ok, have to admit, being in a crunch, I sent my daughter to buy me another one, after the one I had kicked the bucket.  I&#x27;d only had that one a little over a year, and I should have known it was one it&#x27;s last leg, since it started getting that burning smell (the lil engine inside, NOT hair!).   Sooo, now I have the 2nd one of these hot air dryers, love it, but now after about 6 months, the bristles are going flat!! Geez!!  No manufacturers site I can go to, to get a replacement brush!!  So, either it doesn&#x27;t stay running or the bristles go flat, either way, NOT very functional!!!</li>
            <li> A big disappointment because u could not regulate the temp on it. It got too hot for me to use for very long plus the bristles on the brush were too limp to get into my hair.</li>
            <li> Last month I bought both the Jilbere Hot Air Brush and the Infiniti by Conair BC173 Hot Air Styler. The Jilbere is much better at adding body to my fine, wavy, chin-to-shoulder length layered hair, and letting me curl the ends under. It leaves my hair volumized, smooth and shiny. If you&#x27;re like me and have no skills holding a blow dryer in one hand and using a round brush in the other, this is a fantastic solution. I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of the product but I&#x27;d buy another one if it died after the warrenty period ends. Like other reviewers suggest, I first use a regular blow dryer (drying with my head upside-down for root lift) to get my hair 85% dry. Then I use the Jilbere to smooth and style.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous. .absolutely love it!  Highly recommended. Thanks for an amazing product. .</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 months.</li>
            <li> I have had about 10 of these in the last month. I purchased from Sally&#x27;s so every time it breaks I have been exchanging it. But it is very annoying! This works the best as far as smoothing and styling my hair, but it only lasts about a week. Then the hot air brush won&#x27;t turn on anymore. The reset button is broken. It also gets too hot to touch it. My suggestion: AVOID THIS PRODUCT! I wish I could find one that works!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! I just wish there would be cool fan button on this brush.</li>
            <li> The 1st day worked great the 2nd day the black handle got warm, 3rd the black handle got really hot and the 4th day it stopped working all together</li>
            <li> My first Jilbere hot air brush lasted over 10 years. It had a blue housing. Then another company bought them and they&#x27;re called Ceramic Tools. They&#x27;re great...for the first couple of weeks. Then they start getting so hot, you can&#x27;t even touch the barrel. Then the bristles melt. I&#x27;ve had 4 of the \\&quot;new\\&quot; model\\&quot; and they all have the same problem. I&#x27;ve contacted Jilbere, but got no response. I&#x27;m still looking for another 1-1/4\\&quot; hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I never blow dry my hair because it&#x27;s such a pain and it hurts my arms. I can also never get the brush tight enough to make my hair smooth and frizz free. This tool works great. I love that I can just use this to blow dry my hair and curl it at the same time. It gives great volume and shape and my arms don&#x27;t hurt afterwards.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many years.  It is easy to handle and dries and styles my hair to my liking.  You just have to be careful not to touch the metal part of the brush because it can burn your finger.  Overall I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this Hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;It fluffs up my hair which I need because my hair is very straight and has no body. I find since my hair is thin, it is best to use the dryer when my hair is pretty wet unlike the instructions say to semi-dry.  I also think it is best to use moose or spray your hair with hair spray before using the hot air brush if you have hair like mine (thin, no-body and straight). This products beats using a blower or curling iron unless you have a short hair cut as the roller is rather big for short short hair. I also find that you can use this product anytime to give some fluff to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is I think it should have a cool air selection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three of these. They brake a lot. When working, it is great though.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  My hair is fine and frizz was a problem but no more. I have used so many different (and expensive ) blow dryers, curling irons, flat irons, etc. and have never had the results I get now from this brush.  It is easy to use, fast and I longer have to worry about burning my air (or my skin).  I can wash, dry and style in a breeze and my hair looks fantastic (and healthy).   Best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The Title says it all.  The combination of the Brush with the Hairdryer built into it  cann&#x27;t be beat.  Everyone Loves It and it remains a very popular product that is used and  also sold at our Salon.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this and thought I would try it.  I loved it.  It was great for curly hair, I had it 3 months and it stopped getting hot! Never buy this product again!</li>
            <li> It has been three years since I tried this brush for the first time and ladies I LOVE IT. I had had two in 6 years and they were worth every penny. I love the way my hair looks, frizz is gone and the shine is amazing. I get in 30 min the same results I get in a salon for $50 and two hours waiting. It is true than with time it deteriorates, but everything in live does.</li>
            <li> I have bought three of these, they work well on my curly hair to blow dry straight. Sadly, they keep breaking. The one I just bought lasted two weeks and died, cOuld not get it to turn on. The one before that, the barrel broke off. I gave it three stars because its one of the best ones I have had and the quality of the ceramic barrel is good, but they keep breaking. Returning this item was not a hassle. I am glad that i was able to return it before the date specified.</li>
            <li> bought it in March--use it 3 times a week on my bangs only---less than 3 months--doesn&#x27;t work!---love the product but very cheaply made! Cant send it back because it has been more than 30 days! Unacceptable! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I love this product because you can style your hair into waves or curls without damaging to the extent that a hot iron would. if you add mousse to damp roots and a medium amount onto the rest of hair and set it with hair spray i can achieve thick ringlets and big waves.</li>
            <li> I have had many different hot air dryers over the years, and basically I had given up on them. Couldn&#x27;t find one that worked correctly without tangling or frying my hair. I have straight, fine, thick hair and most of the hot air brushes have little stub bristles which would not even penetrate my hair, much less grip it and style it. My girlfriend was tired of hearing me complain, so she got this one and gave it to me. I LOVE IT! It grips my hair without tangling, dries my hair quickly, and leaves it full of body and style. I can either put some curl in it or leave it straight with lots of body. And yes, it gives you lots of \\&quot;poof\\&quot; on the top too ladies. Two temp settings allows for quick drying (high) and then a low setting for the style. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!    I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days, but I&#x27;m hooked. If they ever stop making this hot air dryer, I&#x27;ll probably shave my head~</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. I had one that lasted for years and years but recently just updated it.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush. I have very thick hair and it helps me get it dry sooo much faster. Also helps tame frizz. The downside?  This is my third one in six years. So you can count on about two years of working before it breaks. However it helps me so much its worth $20 a year!</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  This brush served me very well and lasted several years. However, I decided to eventually replace it with the  John Frieda Salon Shape 1.5 Inch Hot Air Brush because of the larger barrel and the cool setting option &amp; I have to say that I have found these  2 features to be very worthwhile and make for an even better product!   This brush has been a godsend for my hair AND my arms --- I have fine, shoulder-length, curly hair that becomes frizzy and kinky if I do not blowdry it quickly &amp; precisely enough when trying to straighten it.  Accomplishing this, especially around the back of my head, while trying to manage a traditional brush and hairdryer at just the right angles, is not only cumbersome but burdensome.  I had not used a hair dryer/brush combination product before but, based on my research prior to purchasing this item, the Jilbere Hot Air Brush was the only I found to consistently receive high reviews across multiple websites, and from more than just a handful of customers.  And since using this product I have not looked any further  -- it  is so lightweight and easy to manipulate from every angle that I am consistently able to create a refined &amp;#34;blow out&amp;#34; result from all sides with minimal frizz, in MUCH less time, without my arms!  I wouldn&#x27;t mind there being a few more bristles on the brush so that it grabbed my hair more tautly in areas where my hair does not grow in as thickly, but the areas affected by that are few (and can easily be followed up with a few passes of my flat iron if necessary.)  While I cannot speak to its longevity since I&#x27;ve had this product for less than a year, the price is so affordable for what it offers, that I won&#x27;t give a second thought to having to purchase a replacement, even if sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling brush, but as other reviewers have noted, don&#x27;t expect it to last forever.  I had mine for about two years, and it was great while it lasted.  I never had any problems with flattened bristles or anything like that, but I did notice that after awhile, it started getting extremely hot.  It was so hot that as I was using it, it would actually heat up the necklace I was wearing and burn my neck.  Then one day, it just stopped working.  I imagine that it just burned out over time.     I am actually back here to purchase another because despite its relatively limited lifespan and somewhat frightening capacity for heat, I really liked it while it worked and I kind of miss it!  I have had several different brands of this type of air brush over the years, and this model styled my hair the best and was the easiest to use.  None of the ones I&#x27;ve had lasted for more than a year or two, anyway.  In the grand scheme of things, $30 isn&#x27;t too bad of a price to pay every couple of years, I guess, considering how much I pay to have my hair cut, colored, styled, etc.  Additionally, it saves me time in the morning since I don&#x27;t have to wrestle with a blow dryer and a round brush, so it is worth it to me!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend with thicker hair. She was thrilled with it. I have very straight fine hair, and it didn&#x27;t work to give my hair the body or lift I was hoping for. So &amp;#34;It&#x27;s me, not you.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really  love this hot air brush.  I have tried several others that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  They don&#x27;t last forever, about two years, but they are great while you have them.</li>
            <li> I bought this two years ago from a Sally Beauty Store. The ceramic helps eliminate frizz (plus I live in South Florida so I REALLY need something to eliminate frizz). I usually use the low setting since I have fine hair. The higher setting kind of fries my hair but I am sure that is because it is meant for thicker hair. I have used this every day for 2 years. I wish there was an easier way to clean hair and hair product off of it. Two years of hair product on it had kind of ruined the bristles but otherwise, it was a great tool and served its purpose. I encouraged my grandmother to buy this as well, since has the same hair style (chin-length bob) and fine hair that I have and she has been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I actually bought two of these to have one in reserve.  It has great power and I can essentially completely dry &amp; style my hair (fine-shoulder length) with this.  Never had tangle issues, it gives much more volume of air than other products tried.</li>
            <li> wife loved it - but she already had one which was making sounds - this was a replacement</li>
            <li> I too had used the Jibere hot air brush for many years but they only lasted a few years, but still worth the money.  Then lately the quality has gotten very bad.  Since January I have gone through at least 5 of them.  They work a few weeks up to a couple months and then die.  It works one day and then the next won&#x27;t turn on.  I called and emailed Conair and told them of the issues and they did replace one, but I had to pay to ship it to them.  I explained that they had a quality problem but they did not care.  I asked to talk to a manager and they would not connect me to one.  I then tried emailing and they did not respond.  If you luck out and get one that lasts 2 years, they work great.  But don&#x27;t count on it</li>
            <li> I used to use a round brush and a blow dryer to straighten my hair and it would take about 30 mins or so and I would have to stop frequently because it was too hot! This little gem is a life saver!!!!! I&#x27;m more likely to actually do my hair now because it doesn&#x27;t take nearly as long</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s the absolute best hot air brush. My 1st lasted about 2 years before the bristles became too flattened to use.&lt;br /&gt;The next one lasted 3 months until the brush part snapped off. No way to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;Bought an extended warranty for the 3rd &amp; on the 62nd day, the heating element quit working. Which means I have to wait until year 2 to get a replacement, per Sally Beauty Supply. They, by the way, have been less than helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I only wash my hair 1-2 times per week, so it isn&#x27;t even getting high usage.&lt;br /&gt;Jilbere has a good concept here &amp; it&#x27;s frustrating that the quality is plummeting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also purchased Conair hot air brushes &amp; they&#x27;re useless. Not sure if Conair always owned Jilbere but they&#x27;ve certainly destroyed a great styling tool.</li>
            <li> last one lasted me 6 years very happy to have another!!!</li>
            <li> I have short,thin,slightly curly hair. Always just blew it dry with a diffuser to make it curly because I couldn&#x27;t manage the round brush and blow dryer technique. My daughter said I look like an old lady and after looking at a picture I agreed. Asked my hairdresser to teach me how to use the round brush. She showed me how and told me to buy this product. I cannot thank her enough. This brush is amazing. I very lightly dry my hair with a blow dryer (or wait afew minutes till it dries slightly) then use this. SOOOO easy and looks just as good as the salon. Dries and styles hair so quickly and I only use the lowest setting. Hair looks shiny and full of volume. Great to add a little oomph at the end of the day without rewetting hair.  Wish I knew this product existed before!</li>
            <li> This is the best hot air brush on the market and I have tried several! Great for thin fine hair too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron better than any other from years of use.  I have had some of these loose the bristles but they replace them so you really can&#x27;t loose as long as you send in your registration.</li>
            <li> My only complaint - and that&#x27;s probably stretching it - is that it can get very hot on the high setting.  But the time saving and what it does to my hair more than makes up for that!</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few weeks. Lots of power. Now dead. Reset button on plug does not work. Sadly cannot find a blow dry brush that lasts longer than a few months</li>
            <li> My favorite Hot Air Brush!  I&#x27;ve tried others because I couldn&#x27;t find this one.  They just weren&#x27;t nearly as good!!  Love this tool!</li>
            <li> I love the size of the barrel on this product. I had it for about a year and then the one of the heaters inside stopped working. It still turns on but only to a very low heat. :( So sad it didn&#x27;t last very long. I bought it for about $65 at a beauty store. I&#x27;ve used products like this for over 10 years and it seems they need to be replaced once a year. The first one I ever bought was a conair and it still works, but the bristles are no good now.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase.  I had a my 1ast one for a year and a half and loved it.  Tried other  Options, but had to return them.  This one works the best ....gets my curly hair smooth without  any effort.</li>
            <li> The wife got this. Ask her</li>
            <li> I used to brush twice and no longer works!</li>
            <li> Seriously can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t discover this sooner. My mother bought one at CVS and my hair dryer broke. She told me she bought this great blow dryer brush in one. I tried it and fell in love! Haven&#x27;t used a blow dryer or curling iron in over a month!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I have owned a handful of hot air brushes over the years and they typically last 1-2 years tops for me. I have medium length hair and I use the product as directed - on mostly dried hair. I have owned this particular brush for about a month. It gets VERY hot and does not blow out a lot of air. The casing on the handle gets very hot as well. Yesterday my smoke alarm went off while I was using this, and now today it won&#x27;t even turn on. I love the idea of this styling tool and the convenience of not having to use a round brush, but it looks like that&#x27;s what I will be returning to. I read reviews before I bought, and hoped that the bad ones just weren&#x27;t using it right. Trust me...something isn&#x27;t right with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of this brush in ten years, with daily use - the first one was 8 years old when I burned it up using it in Europe - oops!, then I dropped the second one, bending it at the connection between the brush and the dryer part (that one still works, so I keep it in my gym bag :-)  It&#x27;s MUCH easier to style my hair than managing a hair dryer and round brush, and has a good high setting for quick drying of the roots, and low setting for styling.  My hair is between my ears and my shoulder, so not too long, but pretty thick, and I can style it in 5 minutes flat!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for 4 months of use. Often got too hot and then just died.</li>
            <li> The only blower I will use-dries and styles in one fast step!</li>
            <li> i use the jilbere all the time every day i have been using it for years  i love it and recomend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Have owned the Jilbere hot air brush for about 10 years now.  They work great to smooth and style barely damp hair.  It is so easy to style the back of your hair using this brush.  It has two settings, medium and high.  The high gets pretty hot so start with the medium.  As these get older sometimes they get too hot and it&#x27;s time to replace them.  Mine usually last at least a year, but these are the best on the market that I have found to do the job.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different brands of Hot Air Brush and I always come back to the Jilbere.  It&#x27;s the best on the market in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I abosolutely loved it....while it worked.  Too bad it stopped working after only using it (not even every day) for a about a month.. .</li>
            <li> I loved this brush so much that when I left it somewhere I purchased another. I have thin fine hair that will frizz and get a little wavy. It smooths my hair and gives it body. I&#x27;ve read that many have had issues with it not lasting long. I had the opposite problem. I&#x27;ve had it now for about 5 years and use it every other day. The only problem is you can&#x27;t clean it. The inside became matted with hair. I unscrewed it and took out all the clogged hair but couldn&#x27;t get the bristles back in the holes properly. I had to cut the bristle brush down by an inch and a half. So now I have a brush that is shorter, but it still works great. I though it was no longer made and am thrilled to see I can get one. I&#x27;m ordering a new one and can only hope it will be as long lasting as this one. I would also like to see it offered in a 3/4 round brush as I need both widths.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush and used it daily for two years.  It does what it&#x27;s made to do, can be used on wet or dry hair for styling. I tried another brand recently and I saw hair damage. This brand of brush works for my fine silky hair and does not tangle.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these for about 6-7 years and I don&#x27;t think I could fix my hair without one.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Conair hot brushes for the past 18-20 years, but have grown tired of them breaking in the middle, where the brush piece meets with the handle section. This air brush is one piece and will take the pressure of having hair pulled against it. You know, like a round brush blow out. Anyway, I am not talented enough to round brush and blow dry so I use this and velcro rollers.  Love!</li>
            <li> I like the hot air brush. I really wish it were more powerful. I have a ton of hair and find that doing the roots of my hair is tricky. I usually end up using this and a hair dryer. What i really like this product for is when I have &amp;#34;second day hair&amp;#34; and it need a bit of fluffing up.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with directions on how to use, though that might be a no brainer for some.  When it wasn&#x27;t as effective as I thought it would be, I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was doing it wrong.....  My hairdresser commented on how few and far between the bristles were which would account for it not being as smoothing.</li>
            <li> It truly is a great product. It helps me immensely with blow drying straight my frizz prone curly hair (I am not able to blow dry with round brush and dryer). In February it will be a year I bought it, and so far (fingers crossed) I had no problem whatsoever. I just dry my hair beforehand with the regular dryer combing my hair thru with fingers until it is at least 80/85% dry; then I add some extra styling oil, divide my hair in sections and use this hot air brush to straighten. In this way I don&#x27;t need to use the maximum power, and I keep it always on the lower setting. I believe this will extend its life in time, and it is certainly gentler on my hair. Again, a great product that 1.made my life easier, 2. gives a way better appearance to my hair and 3. makes my blowdry super fast (between regular blowdry with dryer and blowdry with air brush my mid back long hair is completely dry AND styled in 20/25 min).</li>
            <li> fantastic - thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in July, it quit working by September.  The heat in this air brush was WAY TOO HOT.  I was constantly paranoid that it was going to burn my hair.  It never did, but I think it would have if I wasn&#x27;t as cautious as i was with it.  I don&#x27;t recommend this one.. I&#x27;ve been using a brush like this for years, so far this is the worst I&#x27;ve bought (and the most expensive).</li>
            <li> Great brush to dry hair.  Only need the one hand to use it which is its great advantage. Prior to this, using a dryer in one hand, brush in another. Also the hot brush verey effective in turning curls into easy-to-manage waves...</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from Sally Beauty in store for about $45.  It lasted 6 months before breaking.  Tried to take it back, but after a couple of days where I got stuck at work late and ended up at Sally just after closing, I finally gave up and bought another brand at Target (Revlon ceramic - the white one, 1500 watts, for $30).  I&#x27;m glad I switched.  I don&#x27;t remember the wattage on the Jilbere, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it was either 1000 or 1200 watts.  This Amazon listing doesn&#x27;t say.  In any event, the Revlon kicks its ass.  Dries my hair way faster.  And the bristles are better on the other one, too.  I&#x27;m annoying that I paid $45 for a dryer that lasted only half a year, but I&#x27;m so happy to have found the other one.  It&#x27;s been going for at least 2 years now, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just bought my first one.I was  so exited  that I used it right away.it was fine until tried using it the second time and noticed that  the tip had melted from the first use and was breaking in little peices until it completely came off.and I was standing there thinking to myself why didn&#x27;t I buy the insurance on it at Sally&#x27;s.  although the lady said that the factory gave a year I know they will talk their way out of it.40 dollars down the toilet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands and have liked none of them as well as this Jilbere model.  It is powerful enough to dry hair quickly and the bristles seem a little longer than others. This makes it easier to keep it exactly where I want it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The lower setting is perfect for finishing a style.</li>
            <li> This is the third time in 5 years I&#x27;m back to order this blow dryer. It usually lasts about two years before it burns out even if I keep the brush and air intake clean. To straighten my hair, it is much easier than the round brush and blow dryer method. The tip on this one makes it easy to use and it has stronger, thicker bristles than other hot hair brushes which makes it my favorite. Definitely tames my relaxed hair. I depend on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 or 3 of these brushes. They&#x27;ve all lasted YEARS! The current one for at least 15 years and the bristles are now wearing off, so I need a new one. I can&#x27;t believe they would only last 1 or 2 years, but I like it so much, I&#x27;ll probably buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just writing this review to thank everyone else for theirs. Although I did not purchase this from Amazon, I did pick it up at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and wasn&#x27;t sure if I would keep it. I purchase many things from Amazon and the reviews on various items help me a lot when buying something completely new. I came on here prior to opening the box to try out the new brush and glad I did. People are very helpful when they take the time to write up a review on their purchases...I know it&#x27;s helped me tremendously and I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;m not the only one. So thank you to Amazon for the public product review and thanks to everyone who takes the time out to help others by writing the review!! :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased over 5 of these, I worked for Ulta as the General Manager, I had the opportunity to try all&lt;br /&gt;sorts of things, I have thick curly hair....Revlon, Hot Tools Conair, all expensive brands either broke since they&lt;br /&gt;are detachable and or burned out super fast within 1-2 months. This is the best one of all..I love it..It doesnt smooth&lt;br /&gt;out the best but if it had a larger barrel it might have....but it is wonderful overall... I wish they had it in a larger barrel.&lt;br /&gt;Love it anyway!</li>
            <li> Works fine, but gets hot and the sound goes up and down like it&#x27;s trying to quit.</li>
            <li> I had this for less than 3 months, using it on average two times a week, and it just stopped working, mid hairstyle. I liked the way it worked, even with some of the bristles flattening in a short time,  its not something that I will buy again. I need something that I can use for awhile, and not have to replace every few months.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me to get a hot air brush and this is the one I purchased.  I have used this item for at least 3 years now, 1-2x/week.  I have thick, long (3\\&quot; past shoulder) wavy hair with a little frizz and it was very difficult to get my hair smooth, while still maintaining body.  I don&#x27;t like the look of flat ironed hair and using a blowdryer and brush is exhausting and time consuming with my kind of hair.  Additionally, it was impossible to get the very back of my hair with a brush and heavy blow dryer...the brush would sometimes snag my hair, was difficult to see and hair would sometimes get caught in the blow dryer ugghh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this tool I let my hair get about 75% dry (air dry or via a regular blow dryer) and then use the hot air brush.  It takes about 15-20 minutes of using the brush for me to finish and the look is smoother and shinier than using a brush and hair dryer, especially in the back.  I find that I now can get my hair to look as good as the hair stylist.  This is basically a brush and blow dryer in one nifty little package.  I start at the root and then wrap the hair around the barrel rather than starting at the ends and rolling.  I find my method instills more natural, smooth wave as well as body and root lift.  I have not had any other hot air brushes to compare, but know that this one does everything I had hoped for.  I have thought I should buy another one in case they ever stop making.</li>

            <li> Best hot brush ever!! My sister gave this to me 10 years ago! Yes I said 10 years ago! Lol and after that it broke down on me!! I was so upset I mourned my hot brush for almost a year! I absolutely love it there is no other like it not even for the price!! I was so glad I found it here, I bought it right away! Highly recommend you are going to love it! My hair is dry to oily,  plus it&#x27;s wavy curly, so it tends to be very freezy! This hot brush leaves your hair looking silky and beautiful!! Would not change it for no other!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT INVESTMENT!! TRUST ME  ;)</li>
            <li> I had a Brazilian blowout done to my hair in the past few weeks, and I was getting frustrated trying to replicate the &amp;#34;voluminous straightening&amp;#34; that my stylist had achieved with a hair dryer and a round boar bristle brush. It looked pretty frizzy. I read that a hot air brush like this would make it easier to replicate the technique, and it pretty much has! :D Some of my hair is still frizzy looking because I need to work on segmenting it into appropriate sizes before I use this hot air brush, but for the most part it worked as expected on my first try! A good size of hair to use on the brush at a time is an amount that covers an inch in depth on your scalp. My hair is pretty thick though so I found myself trying to work with too much of it at a time, leaving some of the hair still wet because it was too far away from the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the boar bristle brush right after the hot brush to re-emphasize the style with great success. In addition, I have a finer toothed comb to pull in the fly away hair that I can&#x27;t use my boar brush on and to clean the hot brush and the boar brush afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that this hot brush was smaller. I think I would have an easier time engaging with my hair if that was the case because when I dry smaller segments of hair, it refuses to wrap around this brush the way I want it to so I have to press my hair against it with my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard that this brush dies after 2 years or so, but for the style I want, it&#x27;s worth it until another brush comes along.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 of these. They are great when they work other than getting way too hot. My first one lasted about 4 years. My second one lasted less than 6 months. My third on lasted 2 months. It gets used maybe twice a week.  To return it to the manufacturer costs $10 on top of the postage needed to ship it. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When I first used this hot air brush, I was in heaven. It cut my hair drying time down from almost 30 minutes to about 10. My hair was smooth and soft and I got so many compliments, I recommended it to everyone. Unfortunately, today it died and of course yesterday was the last day to return it for a full refund. So will I buy another hot air brush, absolutely! Will I order this brand again...NO WAY! Sorry Jilbere, you lost me as a customer.</li>
            <li> I love how this brush lets me freshen and style my hair without having to wet it and start from scratch.  I use it nearly every day and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
