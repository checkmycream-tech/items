            <li>and I liked</li>
            <li>Great scent that reminds you of a brilliant summer day on the water in a southern clime.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been looking for years to replace a certain scented cologne he had years ago that had been discontinued, we smelled this at a Tommy Bahama store and just loved the scent, his search was over!</li>

            <li>and I just love the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li>love the price of purchase, I could not find it cheaper anywhere.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments (from men and women) on this cologne than any I have ever tried.</li>

            <li>My dad loved it and I highly recommend purchasing this item!</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and is a nice change of pace.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather strong so you will need to apply it in moderation.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a nice, light, and gentle cologne - you will love this one.</li>
            <li>It has a lemon like smell at first application which really makes it a great spring and summer cologne.  </li>
            <li>Love this clean fresh scent!</li>
            <li>It has a very light, yet distinct island smell that will make your nose never want it to leave.</li>
            <li>I own probably about a dozen different colognes and this one is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>fragrance is fantastic.</li>
            <li>If you spray, what you doing think may be too much, it won&#x27;t give those around you that coughing gag kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes a great present too</li>
            <li>And the shipping time was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was too cheap to buy the product that day</li>
            <li>smells cheap and synthetic</li>
            <li>Originally I found this for $20 at TJ MAXX.</li>
            <li>Not the original, its diluted with alcohol.</li>
            <li>Great scent lasts a long time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crisp and clean scent is sure to compliment most men ;)</li>
            <li>Not only was the price fantastic, but it arrived quickly and my husband was thrilled!</li>
            <li>Scent has lime vibe to it and while that may not sound appealing it really is great.  </li>
            <li>but i was definitely glad, made things so much easier.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie and say that I didn&#x27;t refresh myself a couple times throughout the day but full disclosure</li>
            <li>i did not expect the shipment to come so quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relieved to find it available here on Amazon and at very reasonable prices as compared to the retail stores.</li>
            <li>but that really doesn&#x27;t help as you are just too strong in the beginning</li>
            <li>seems very old, there are more fresher scents out there</li>
            <li>They love it, I am a single person and the love to come close to get a sample.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, packaged securely,</li>
            <li>well it is cheap but just very disapointed.</li>
            <li>Definitely what I would consider a nice non-offensive smell.</li>
            <li>St. Barts by Tommy Bahama is by far my favorite cologne ever.</li>
            <li>Scent is just as described in prior reviews readâ€¦.very memorable and fresh.  </li>
            <li>;-)-&lt;br /&gt;Great smell for summer</li>
            <li>First received this Tommy Bahama cologne as a gift.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would recomend izod (square blue bottle) out of the 3 as it is more fresher</li>
            <li>Do you love instant headaches and nausea?</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Since it is a rare occurance that we both like something I was ready to buy it from the store</li>
            <li>I personally like fragrances that are lighter, ever so sweet, maybe crisp and certainly clean.</li>
            <li>By far the best cologne of the year, and all the ladies always comment me on the way I now smell (seriously!).</li>
            <li>This product costs twice as much in their retail store.</li>
            <li>I think this cologne smells very &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I am complimented daily on how good my cologne smells so other people seem to like it also.</li>
            <li>I have gotten more inquiries and compliments on this cologne than any other I have worn and I don&#x27;t wear that much of it.  </li>
            <li>- I am extremely choosy with my colognes and finally I got one that has the right balance of sweetness, male muskyness and fresh lime flavor - one of the best that I have ever used - it goes extremely well with my body chemicals</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d like it to, but a great fragrance overall.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s large, akwardly shaped, and if you are not careful it could slip right out of your hands while you are trying to handle it or spray it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend purchasing Tommy or your other favorite fragrance here.</li>
            <li>Slightly sweet, not deep or earthy or spicy.</li>
            <li>The reason for only 4 stars is the scent begins to fade quickly after 4 hours</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t go wrong great shipping......</li>
            <li>(the one in the store comes with some deoderant and cream but is that really worth and extra $30?)  </li>
            <li>This is such an amazing long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>While I won&#x27;t say it was the product at fault completely, I will say do not wear this if you are going in areas of exteme heat.  </li>
            <li>Aggressive masculine scents.</li>
            <li>old school- ck one, Jean Paul gaultier, lacoste, and Burberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost the same as spraying &#x27;too much&#x27; febreeze on your pillows.</li>
            <li>Obviously, buying on Amazon I got the product much cheaper than in the Tommy Bahama store</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and arrived within a few days of ordering which was right before Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I rarely compliment other guy&#x27;s colognes but this one was quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I hear the scent is very smilar to Virgin Island water from Creed which is about $100 plus more expensive...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months now and barely used 1/10th of the bottle, so this will</li>
            <li>Not a single thing orginal about this juice .</li>
            <li>My wife got this scent for me a few years ago for the first time and I like it.  </li>
            <li>I had always been told when a fragrance is priced so low its usually because its old stock or has been very diluted with alcohol.</li>

            <li> I have gotten more inquiries and compliments on this cologne than any other I have worn and I don&#x27;t wear that much of it.  </li>
            <li> - I am extremely choosy with my colognes and finally I got one that has the right balance of sweetness, male muskyness and fresh lime flavor - one of the best that I have ever used - it goes extremely well with my body chemicals</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d like it to, but a great fragrance overall.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s large, akwardly shaped, and if you are not careful it could slip right out of your hands while you are trying to handle it or spray it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend purchasing Tommy or your other favorite fragrance here.</li>
            <li> Slightly sweet, not deep or earthy or spicy.</li>
            <li> The reason for only 4 stars is the scent begins to fade quickly after 4 hours</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong great shipping......</li>
            <li> (the one in the store comes with some deoderant and cream but is that really worth and extra $30?)  </li>
            <li> This is such an amazing long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> While I won&#x27;t say it was the product at fault completely, I will say do not wear this if you are going in areas of exteme heat.  </li>
            <li> Aggressive masculine scents.</li>
            <li> old school- ck one, Jean Paul gaultier, lacoste, and Burberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost the same as spraying &#x27;too much&#x27; febreeze on your pillows.</li>
            <li> Obviously, buying on Amazon I got the product much cheaper than in the Tommy Bahama store</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and arrived within a few days of ordering which was right before Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I rarely compliment other guy&#x27;s colognes but this one was quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I hear the scent is very smilar to Virgin Island water from Creed which is about $100 plus more expensive...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months now and barely used 1/10th of the bottle, so this will</li>
            <li> Not a single thing orginal about this juice .</li>
            <li> My wife got this scent for me a few years ago for the first time and I like it.  </li>
            <li> I had always been told when a fragrance is priced so low its usually because its old stock or has been very diluted with alcohol.</li>
            <li> and you know tommy fragrance last all day long.</li>
            <li> Even with this minor flaw I still give this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> However the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long so you will need to keep re-applying it constantly through out the day because after a few hours the cologne smell fades away.</li>
            <li> But I think it is an Imitation because it din&#x27;t last on me.</li>
            <li> When I ran out I looked for it and found it on Amazon for MUCH less that local department stores.</li>
            <li> Both are all musk and extremely spicy.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, this stuff is watered down.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne offline and paid way less than what I would have at any store like Belks.</li>
            <li> but I use it all year round -&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I can&#x27;t stand heavy musky scents.</li>
            <li> Remember, it needs to be hidden and slowly revealed, you shouldn&#x27;t ever be reeking of your cologne.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it from fragrance net, it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> so perhaps that smell overpowered this delicate fragerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious, dozens of people over the years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but pronounced.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell, but the longevity is terrible.</li>
            <li> 20 minutes later your in the 7th level of hell within a cloud of sickening vanilla goop.</li>
            <li> All fake.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with Amazon.com, I ordered a MEN fragrance and they send me a WOMEN fragrance</li>

            <li> This is such an amazing long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, this stuff is watered down.  Buy a bottle from an official TB Store and compare yourself.  The real stuff is great.  Shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to sell here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> TBSSSB - great cologne - I am extremely choosy with my colognes and finally I got one that has the right balance of sweetness, male muskyness and fresh lime flavor - one of the best that I have ever used - it goes extremely well with my body chemicals and it does attract great compliments from ladies!! ;-)-&lt;br /&gt;Great smell for summer but I use it all year round -&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> First received this Tommy Bahama cologne as a gift. When I ran out I looked for it and found it on Amazon for MUCH less that local department stores.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking i will only get cologne but i recieved three bottles of the colonge in different sizes and deoderant! I dont know if they messed up my order but i love it!</li>
            <li> Received in plenty of time - great product and great seller</li>
            <li> A lot of complements on this one. Doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as I&#x27;d like it to, but a great fragrance overall.</li>
            <li> seems very old, there are more fresher scents out there&lt;br /&gt;i would rate this similar to perry ellis portfolio&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recomend izod (square blue bottle) out of the 3 as it is more fresher</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected.  Shipped fast, packaged securely, great price!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and whenever he wears it I just about melt. The most amazing scent ever, and we&#x27;ve both had lots of experience with higher-end perfumes/colognes!</li>
            <li> The ladies love this fragrance on me! They love it, I am a single person and the love to come close to get a sample.</li>
            <li> smells amazing! great for any man!!!!</li>
            <li> love this product, i will buy this again via amazon. dont have anything else to say, but a great buy</li>
            <li> nice for the price. bought it as a gift and the recipient liked it and wears it all the time.  a nice men&#x27;s spray cologne. refreshing.</li>
            <li> Oneof my favorite scents. Good deal and quick delivery.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was a re-order of my favorite summer fragrance!</li>
            <li> My fav cologne of all time for my husband.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best men&#x27;s fragrance out there. Priced very good here!!!! You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Love this colonge ... Smells so Good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a cologne sort of guy but my wife got a whiff of this somewhere and she bought it for me... so whatever makes the wife happy makes me happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother as a gift.  He wore it once and only once.  While I won&#x27;t say it was the product at fault completely, I will say do not wear this if you are going in areas of exteme heat.  We&#x27;ve been experiencing a heat wave in our area this summer, and the smell this spray produces does not help in it.  I would recomand a sample bottle of this spray before you make your decision.</li>
            <li> i did not expect the shipment to come so quickly but i was definitely glad, made things so much easier. one of the best smelling scents ever</li>
            <li> I like the smell! Everyone else loves the smell! I am complimented daily on how good my cologne smells so other people seem to like it also. However the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long so you will need to keep re-applying it constantly through out the day because after a few hours the cologne smell fades away.</li>
            <li> Excellent Cologne&lt;br /&gt;Product is exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I am trying this product and I am very satisfied with the way this order was processed without delays.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it from fragrance net, it&#x27;s fake. You can read the bottom of the bottle, production and manufactured by fragrance net... Not tommy Bahamas .. All fake. The fragrance only last an hr and you know tommy fragrance last all day long.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is cheaper than buyin from a mall or elsewhere as far as i know i would recommend it</li>
            <li> Scent is just as described in prior reviews readâ€¦.very memorable and fresh.  Can be used by any age as well.</li>
            <li> My wife got this scent for me a few years ago for the first time and I like it.  I was running out so I ordered some more.  I have gotten more inquiries and compliments on this cologne than any other I have worn and I don&#x27;t wear that much of it.  Price was great here.</li>
            <li> This was the cheapest I have seen it for and I love the way it smells so it was an all around good purchase</li>
            <li> Originally I found this for $20 at TJ MAXX. After running out of the contents, I went on a search that started at Amazon and ended at Amazon. I think the retail stores sell it for about $50.</li>
            <li> This cologne is great. I get compliments from the ladies almost every time I wear it. It has a very light, yet distinct island smell that will make your nose never want it to leave. Phenomenal price as well.</li>
            <li> Tommy Bahama ..... You just can&#x27;t go wrong great shipping...... great packaging</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind keep reapplying your fragrance every couple of hrs then this is a good choice, wonderful summer scent, very peasant and non offensive, ideal for office work where you can keep a sprayer and reapply it at will whenever needed, or applying it before going to bed... I hear the scent is very smilar to Virgin Island water from Creed which is about $100 plus more expensive... I really like the smell, but the longevity is terrible.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne offline and paid way less than what I would have at any store like Belks. I was under the impression that it would just come with the big bottle of cologne however, it came with the entire kit! My dad loved it and I highly recommend purchasing this item!</li>
            <li> Not the original, its diluted with alcohol. This product is literally 10% product and 90% alcohol! very disappointed with this purchase</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered. Nice sent good price.</li>
            <li> Great scent lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I was out one night and a friend of mine was wearing this fragrance. I rarely compliment other guy&#x27;s colognes but this one was quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I describe? Let me start by saying I can&#x27;t stand heavy musky scents. Think John Varvedos or vicotr rolf. Both are all musk and extremely spicy. Aggressive masculine scents. I personally like fragrances that are lighter, ever so sweet, maybe crisp and certainly clean. My style would be -though old school- ck one, Jean Paul gaultier, lacoste, and Burberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance is fantastic. Slightly sweet, not deep or earthy or spicy. I think I smell discreet notes of powder - which I love! Definitely what I would consider a nice non-offensive smell. If you spray, what you doing think may be too much, it won&#x27;t give those around you that coughing gag kind of reaction. If anything, they will comment on how great you smell. It&#x27;s almost the same as spraying &#x27;too much&#x27; febreeze on your pillows. It&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I was nervous about was the price. I had always been told when a fragrance is priced so low its usually because its old stock or has been very diluted with alcohol. This isn&#x27;t the case here. I won&#x27;t lie and say that I didn&#x27;t refresh myself a couple times throughout the day but full disclosure, I&#x27;m a smoker so perhaps that smell overpowered this delicate fragerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a nice, light, and gentle cologne - you will love this one. I do! Nice packaging as well. I will be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> Do you love instant headaches and nausea? Then you&#x27;ll love St Barts. The opening is a lovely lime cocktail. 20 minutes later your in the 7th level of hell within a cloud of sickening vanilla goop. If you&#x27;re a fan of Joop! or Pi, then you&#x27;ll love this garbage water too.</li>
            <li> This product costs twice as much in their retail store. With amazon prime, this was a steal. By far the best cologne of the year, and all the ladies always comment me on the way I now smell (seriously!). It&#x27;s rather strong so you will need to apply it in moderation. Remember, it needs to be hidden and slowly revealed, you shouldn&#x27;t ever be reeking of your cologne. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months now and barely used 1/10th of the bottle, so this will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great present too, it&#x27;s packaging is nice, and the bottle its self always starts conversations.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome. Hard to find in the stores Macy&#x27;s stopped carrying it. A friend of mine wore it one day def got my attention.</li>
            <li> St. Barts by Tommy Bahama is by far my favorite cologne ever. I&#x27;ve tried many fragrances over the years but this is the perfect blend for me. I can&#x27;t count the times total strangers have stopped me (men and women) to ask what I was wearing and where they could purchase it. I&#x27;m serious, dozens of people over the years. To my dismay, the retail stores in my area have stopped carrying it. I&#x27;m relieved to find it available here on Amazon and at very reasonable prices as compared to the retail stores. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since two years ago and I just love the way it smells on me. However, I have always had complements from my fellow friends and family. When I wear the Tommy Bahama I get compliments from people in the public. This product has always met by needs.&lt;br /&gt;I love the price of purchase, I could not find it cheaper anywhere. And the shipping time was fantastic.</li>
            <li> love love this scent... best to buy is here, great pricing and fast response. Highly recommend purchasing Tommy or your other favorite fragrance here.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am not a cologne guy. When I was shopping with my wife in a Tommy Bahama outlet store they had cologne testers sitting at the checkout counter. I picked up a bottle and thought it smelled nice. I sprayed some on and my wife thought it smelled excellent on me. I was too cheap to buy the product that day but my wife went back a couple of days later and bought it for me. I get more compliments (from men and women) on this cologne than any I have ever tried. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle of this fragrance. Obviously, buying on Amazon I got the product much cheaper than in the Tommy Bahama store and now I don&#x27;t mind spending the money. I think this cologne smells very &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; without being overpowering. Buy it, use it and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Came on time and smelled great !</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and arrived within a few days of ordering which was right before Christmas.  We already knew we liked how it smelled because my husband had purchased a bottle before.</li>
            <li> Smell good. But I think it is an Imitation because it din&#x27;t last on me. Huele rico pero no duraba puesta en mi</li>
            <li> Love this clean fresh scent! My husband has been looking for years to replace a certain scented cologne he had years ago that had been discontinued, we smelled this at a Tommy Bahama store and just loved the scent, his search was over! It&#x27;s crisp and clean scent is sure to compliment most men ;) Best price found on amazon too.</li>
            <li> Not a single thing orginal about this juice . smells cheap and synthetic well it is cheap but just very disapointed. go for nautica voyage similar price and twice the quality.</li>
            <li> Great scent that reminds you of a brilliant summer day on the water in a southern clime.  Wear this and feel like you&#x27;re the leading character in a Hemingway novel.</li>
            <li> People love the smell and it is a great price.  It has a lemon like smell at first application which really makes it a great spring and summer cologne.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Good , i like it good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift. Not only was the price fantastic, but it arrived quickly and my husband was thrilled!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with Amazon.com, I ordered a MEN fragrance and they send me a WOMEN fragrance and I can&#x27;t return it. Tommy Bahamas is a great fragrance but if they send you the correct one...</li>
            <li> I own probably about a dozen different colognes and this one is my favorite!  I tried it last week when I was out shopping and I liked and so did my wife.  Since it is a rare occurance that we both like something I was ready to buy it from the store but I waited and checked online and found it 50% cheaper (the one in the store comes with some deoderant and cream but is that really worth and extra $30?)  I am no expert but I know what I like and I like this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is the shape and size of the bottle.  It&#x27;s beautiful and I love the color but it&#x27;s large, akwardly shaped, and if you are not careful it could slip right out of your hands while you are trying to handle it or spray it.  I haven&#x27;t had this problem and I will be pissed if it ever happens.  Even with this minor flaw I still give this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> What a great scent!  It&#x27;s subtle but pronounced.  It truly reminds me of great times and sensuous moments.  Truly it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and is a nice change of pace.  Can really only be worn in the summer, it would be out of place if worn in the winter.  Scent has lime vibe to it and while that may not sound appealing it really is great.  The reason for only 4 stars is the scent begins to fade quickly after 4 hours you will have to re-apply.  I tried to compensate by over spraying but that really doesn&#x27;t help as you are just too strong in the beginning and the scent doesn&#x27;t last any longer.  Got a number of compliments from the ladies in an environment not conducive toward that.</li>
