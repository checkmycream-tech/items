            <li>10 cuticle trimmers are great value!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works really good.  </li>
            <li>I love these cuticle cutters, they are a great change from clippers.</li>
            <li>However the plastic end is not well designed - doesn&#x27;t effectively push cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;Happy anyway.</li>
            <li>I purchase most all of everything I own off amazon.</li>
            <li>I love taking care of my cuticles with tools like these.  </li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>In fact it rips the skin more than it cuts.</li>
            <li>Service was fast and they are strong and do a great job.  </li>
            <li>The price is excellent, but I&#x27;ve found that some of the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t as sharp as others.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>After reading prior reviews, I thought these would be good.</li>
            <li>Left my cuticle ragged instead of the nice smooth cut that I&#x27;m accustom to.  </li>
            <li>I can carry them in my purse for quick fix whenever I need it.</li>
            <li>Works perfect when the cuticle is dry and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion; doesn&#x27;t fit for my need, but OK for occasional cuticle removal when dry.</li>
            <li>Looks nice, feels like good quality; however, they are so useless I am just go to throw them away at this point.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>So much easier than using a clipper.  </li>
            <li>I bought a fee similar ones from the Beaty supply and they weren&#x27;t sharp or flexible enough to be accurate and do a good job.</li>
            <li>I received very early and fast before July.  </li>
            <li>I tried to use two of them thinking that maybe the first try was simply a faulty trimmer.  </li>
            <li>When one is old or wear out, throw it away and take another one, save a lot of money.  </li>
            <li>But just can&#x27;t get a complete mani without one</li>
            <li>These cuticle trimmers completely wrecked my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I bought these kind of things before and they are useless if they are not sharp enough, these was as extremely sharp, so be careful as you can give yourself a good cut with them.  </li>
            <li>These trimmers are not sharp.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend that you purchase them. :o</li>
            <li>They are not sharp enough to trim them.  </li>

            <li> They are not sharp enough to trim them.  </li>
            <li> These are all very sharp cuticle cutters which work very well</li>
            <li> Be careful because it they&#x27;re not sharp enough it will pull your cuticle and tear.  </li>
            <li> but I expected them to work,it was like gliding plastic over my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Observation; this won&#x27;t work on wet cuticle.</li>
            <li> They came New and DULL!</li>
            <li> The file area is too small for nail file and the end is not tapered or thin enough to push back cuticles.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought maybe I just got a bad one or two OR ALL.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so small, that buying a bulk is not an issue.</li>
            <li> These implements are so dull, they cannot trim anything at all.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s hard to get close to the nail, hence why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Does dreadful job for removing hangnails -- feels like it&#x27;s yanking it rather than making a smooth snip.</li>
            <li> When trimming, do it very slow and take your time, no rush or else it would get cut and bleed.  </li>
            <li> the second one was just as bad confirming a terrible product.  </li>
            <li> I use these for cuticle cutting and removing stitches from clothing.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cuticle trimmers for years and these have got to be the worst!</li>

            <li> I received very early and fast before July.  I really like it.  It&#x27;s save a lot of money with 10-pc cuticle pusher trimmer remover than buy one for pricy.  When one is old or wear out, throw it away and take another one, save a lot of money.  When trimming, do it very slow and take your time, no rush or else it would get cut and bleed.  It like drive a car, you will feel it and get to use to.  I have been doing since 1980&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s works really good.  Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I love taking care of my cuticles with tools like these.  So much easier than using a clipper.  The price is excellent, but I&#x27;ve found that some of the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t as sharp as others.  Be careful because it they&#x27;re not sharp enough it will pull your cuticle and tear.  That hurts!</li>
            <li> These trimmers are not sharp.  Left my cuticle ragged instead of the nice smooth cut that I&#x27;m accustom to.  I wish I could post a picture to show you. I can&#x27;t recommend that you purchase them. :o(</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because they are dull,I like this type of tool to trim my cuticles but I expected them to work,it was like gliding plastic over my cuticles.  The file area is too small for nail file and the end is not tapered or thin enough to push back cuticles. I&#x27;ll have to toss these out.</li>
            <li> These are all very sharp cuticle cutters which work very well</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the price.  In stores they run about $3-4 for one. But just can&#x27;t get a complete mani without one</li>
            <li> Love these.  Work great and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Does dreadful job for removing hangnails -- feels like it&#x27;s yanking it rather than making a smooth snip. From China.</li>
            <li> These implements are so dull, they cannot trim anything at all.  At first, I thought maybe I just got a bad one or two OR ALL.  Looks nice, feels like good quality; however, they are so useless I am just go to throw them away at this point.</li>
            <li> My routine; Use sally hansen instant cuticle remover, and push and loosen up the cuticle with wood stick.&lt;br /&gt;  then use the cuticle pusher to remove cuticle or cut it with nipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observation; this won&#x27;t work on wet cuticle. Works perfect when the cuticle is dry and hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion; doesn&#x27;t fit for my need, but OK for occasional cuticle removal when dry.</li>
            <li> I purchase most all of everything I own off amazon. After reading prior reviews, I thought these would be good. They came New and DULL! Did not cut. In fact it rips the skin more than it cuts. VERY DISAPPOINTED. will NOT be purchasing from this rep ever again. BUYER BEWARE !</li>
            <li> These cuticle trimmers completely wrecked my cuticles.  They are not sharp enough to trim them.
