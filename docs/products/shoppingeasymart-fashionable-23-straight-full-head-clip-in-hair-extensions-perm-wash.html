            <li> Recieved wrong color but it was very shiny i gave it to a friend..it was very thin would need 2-3 packs for an entire head</li>
            <li> This thing is May be good for costume thing but otherwise, invest in nice human hair. This product is what you pay for</li>
            <li> The hair after wearing for one day started to become all tangly and matted, but it looked good when I first wore it. It blended well with other hair. Its more for short term use.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! It looks like real hair and also feels like it! It say you can&#x27;t use heat on them and that you can&#x27;t curl them you can just use a wand and put it on 240° and rotate it and the curls are perfect! It&#x27;s really long but looks amazing! It says brown but it&#x27;s dark dark brown. And it also sheds a lot but only if you pull the hairs. But other then that amazing:)</li>
            <li> I love them!!! they are so thick and good quality.Yes they are like a very dark brown but hey i was planning on dying my hair darker. i do plan on buying them again in the future!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really what I expected, it&#x27;s synthetic and I didn&#x27;t read that. Great timing and packaging. Thank you for the speedy service.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today. I was very excited to open the package and try it on. I felt the hair and it was very soft and long. I went to put it on and I found it to be darker than I wanted it to be... It was more of a black than a dark brown. It tangles very easily and the hair falls out A LOT. I was very displeased with this product.. Here are a few pictures..  I even tried to comb out some of the tangles. VERY EASY I MIGHT ADD.. and the hair was constantly falling out ...</li>
            <li> it not not a dark brown ITS JET BLACK very unhappy about it</li>
            <li> When the product came in the mail it was neat and clean. There was no tangles but when you take it out, it was easily tangled and if you brush few hairs fallen off. It is a good product although im worried it well wear off soon I&amp;#34;m not sure. I do like the look of it, it was very thick and natural.</li>
            <li> Love the thickness of the weft and the sturdy clips however it is not dark brown but it is a dark auburn, a heavy amount of red hue therefore I cannot wear it as it does not blend with my hair.</li>
            <li> Sucked!!!! Not at all colored like description. What a waste.</li>
            <li> This carp has red undertones. It doesn&#x27;t take in die and it looks like it&#x27;s hair for cosplay. Maybe if I wanted to look like an anime character I&#x27;d give it a five star</li>
            <li> Nice for about 3 months. Then just destroyed. Cant even touch it. Feels nasty. Went to sallys and bought clip in there. And ive had the sallys ones for about a year now. Even dyed em 5 times. Please dont buy this product.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for myself, however when I received it I knew automaticlaly it was too dark for me.  I gave this to my daughter (who has almost black hairI) and she loved it!  It&#x27;s beautiful, very long, silky smooth looks real.  Just almost black in color.  The color is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.  I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again in a medium brown for myself!  :)</li>
            <li> All my friends are give me such good comments about it i would but another one if i want to , its a great choice</li>
            <li> I bought two packs and the hair was very soft and long, limit amount of shedding. it came one week earlier :) my only problem is the color because it says dark brown and its black so it didnt blend well with my hair...</li>
            <li> Well I like that they&#x27;re soft but they&#x27;re a bit too shiny. You definitely don&#x27;t want to brush these because the hair falls out. I bought 2 of these and it blends with my hair - even with layers. The only drawback I have is that the color isn&#x27;t exactly like mine but I liked them.</li>
            <li> It says dark brown but when I got it, it looked more black than brown. The clips work but since there is only 5 (either 5 or 6 I can&#x27;t remember off the top of my head) it is kinda hard to get it to stay in on the sides. It does look like real hair and feel like it too. Mostly I could live with everything but the color. It is a lot darker than I thought it would be so it&#x27;s noticable when I where it.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as I had hoped but still a good product</li>
            <li> Like the thickness but too shiny and hard to cut to look natural.</li>
            <li> I love it, very good... :)</li>
            <li> Awesome blends right in, I purchase 2</li>
