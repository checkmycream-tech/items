            <li> I was looking for a new tanning oil/amplifier cause my old one got discontinued. I like this one even though it has an spf 4.</li>
            <li> I use this evry summer. Works great nice smell. Got alot of our ppool friends to start using it. good buy</li>
            <li> Originally got this in Key West and it&#x27;s the best thing out there, got darker 4 days there using this than 12 days in the Caribbean using Banana Boat or Australian Gold.  It gives you a deep bronzy tan and moisturizes your skin as well.  I call it the Truth because it truly makes a difference, why do you think I&#x27;m called Sun Goddess!</li>
            <li> Great product. No burns and a great tan</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how this product makes my skin feel. Even after showering, I can feel difference in my skin. It smells wonderful, too!</li>
            <li> I love this! It helped me get a very nice brown skin color in just a few hours of suntanning!</li>
            <li> Best by far outdoor tanning oil. I&#x27;ve used it for 8 years and get the most beautiful sun kissed skin ever! It is oil, so you have to be careful if your at the beach or where you can get dirty. I use it poolside and reapply after I swim.</li>

            <li> nice tanning - love ocean potion products!</li>
            <li> Smells SO good!  If you like a suntan oil, get this product. Goes on smooth and gives a nice dark tan!</li>
            <li> Item arrive on time. The only problem is that the pump spray isn&#x27;t working. Thought about returning it but didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle. I decide to keep and make it work. This stuff is very work it gives me a very nice color tan. I give it a five stars because it work  and a good customer services. It would be nice if the pump spray is working.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb.</li>
