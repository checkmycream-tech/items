            <li>This is a GREAT foundation brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush for that.</li>
            <li>so cheap i prefer buying another type of brush !!!</li>
            <li>this brush doesn&#x27;t blend that good.</li>
            <li>its good for its price</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen nothing but good reviews for e.l.f</li>
            <li>It works really good</li>
            <li>This is a good multifunctional brush.</li>
            <li>It does a good job blending my concealer into my face, but the bristles are kinda prickly</li>
            <li>Although the handle did break off, it is still a really good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality, doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>The brush has worked fine, but the quality must not be very good for it to fall apart immediately.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking of smearing, sometimes the foundation glided on great, but most of the time it looked like I had let a five-year-old smear it on for me.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and it works great.</li>
            <li>I love using this brush!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread foundation more like mops it around!</li>
            <li>It is a great foundation brush, a true value!</li>
            <li>This foundation brush is great quality and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Its elf, of course it amazing.</li>
            <li>When I used it to apply my bb cream, it went on quite nicely</li>
            <li>Nice brush for foundation application.</li>
            <li>but the bristles come out very easily.</li>
            <li>But using your fingers would blend better than this brush honestly -_-</li>
            <li>I like cheap and for $1 that&#x27;s good for me</li>
            <li>, I love it, it feels amazing on skin.</li>
            <li>This brush was great the first two times out of the package, but then it became too &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; with foundation to keep using.</li>
            <li>For a brush that is selling for $1, I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li>but i wish it was better...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Using my fingers works better and takes about 1/5 of the time, since I don&#x27;t have to get the foundation to not look like I painted it on</li>
            <li>On that note though, I would save that $1 to make an investment in a better brush.</li>
            <li>again, I would save that $1 to purchase something of better quality.</li>
            <li>love this brand</li>
            <li>all I guess its ok for the price.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re adventurous and want to give this brush a try, DO NOT BUY IT HERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the first foundation brush that I ever bought, and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still able to use the brush end, so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li>I have to clean it with soap and warm water after every use or else</li>
            <li>I bought this brush and loved it the first two times I used it.</li>
            <li>Brush is really good quality for the price, e.l.f is a great buy for anyone interested in makeup, I definitely reccomend</li>
            <li>But for the price it&#x27;s pretty nice(:</li>
            <li>They have many products that compare to higher end products but most of the time, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The material is really cheap.</li>
            <li>The brush places the foundation on your face evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>I lost my mac foundation brush so when I saw this at the dollar store I was excited.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d honestly rather spend a little money and get a good brush.</li>
            <li>You have to clean it a lot.</li>
            <li>Arrived faster than stated, love this brand, the nice part is that they sell it in the store and if the store is out of stock you can purchase it on Amazon for the same price.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to clean a brush</li>
            <li>Cheap, the head of the brush fell off the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d be better for real painting.</li>
            <li>Its super convenient and I have been putting my makeup on in bed (with a towel across my lap of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this with my liquid foundation and the bristles were detached from the very first</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is kind of stiff and doesn&#x27;t glide on your face very easily.</li>
            <li>The brush feels great on my skin but the handle started to fall apart like a few days after I started using it.</li>
            <li>I normally love elf products, but this one was a complete flunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I now have one more which is like 2 weeks old, it&#x27;s all discolored, and will probably break soon.</li>
            <li>I rarely give 1 star reviews, but I could not even justify giving this brush 2 stars.</li>
            <li>but I noticed it can be a bit prickly if you don&#x27;t use it the right way.</li>
            <li>I guess for the price it would be worthwhile to glue the tip back on with hot glue or super glue or something.</li>
            <li>It did not apply makeup smoothly, and the bristles aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li>I recommend that you don&#x27;t buy this item mostly because I saw you can buy this only for $1.00 at target.</li>
            <li>Brush broke off handle after first use.</li>
            <li>I first tried using this when I was using liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>This was the first foundation i ever bought.</li>
            <li>At first you feel so fancy, because your using a brush to apply foundation.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush if you are a first time user on foundation brushes.</li>
            <li>I didnt realize elf cosmetics is sold at target and most of their brushes are only $1!</li>
            <li>Friends have been trying to get me to use a foundation brush for several years now; I&#x27;m stubborn and have always used my fingers, feeling like I get better coverage</li>
            <li>It is my first.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first brushes I ever used to apply liquid foundation and will never use it for foundation again.</li>
            <li>The store carries all the ( e.l.f.) brushes and all are just $1.00 I am very impressed of the quality and performance of the brush, trust me you can&#x27;t go wrong for $1.00 dollar.</li>
            <li>I bought one of them a few months ago, it lasted a good month maybe, but then it broke.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure u use it really flat against Ur face.</li>
            <li>It pretty much does the job, but doesn&#x27;t blend .</li>
            <li>I really like at first.</li>
            <li>It can handle anything and cleans easily with white vinegar, peroxide and dawn.</li>
            <li>Not tapping with the tip too much otherwise it does poke you a bit.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really shed yet</li>
            <li>With much excitement to try it, it was a downer.</li>
            <li>The brush tip is pretty soft but when using it with liquid foundation, it gets caked on a lot and you have to wash it after every use pretty much.</li>
            <li>It applied the foundation very well if you blended a lot.</li>
            <li>If you really blend it in, it won&#x27;t look streaky.</li>
            <li>As I initially stated- if you are brave enough to give this brush a try, go buy it for a $1 at one of the aforementioned stores.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This would make a good paint brush for thick strokes.</li>
            <li>so i bought this as my first time brush and it was really soft to the touch and put my foindation on really well without leaving any streaks</li>
            <li>so it stays clean, but i&#x27;ve been putting it back in the plastic sleeve it came in and putting it in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>One of e.l.f.&#x27;s better brushes, however it is extremely stiff when first used.</li>
            <li>After losing my first one while traveling I bought a second one and washed it before using and it softened up right away</li>
            <li>I actually really didn&#x27;t expect much from this brush but it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>the foundation brush is okay - maybe its because I got poor foundation, but I feel like blending it with my finger would have been far better than blending it with this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend the e.l.f studio line brushes - which are three dollars each (still less than this rip off) and are much better quality</li>
            <li>Have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this brush here, I actually purchase this brush at a local store called DOLLAR TREE for just $1.00 much better price.</li>
            <li>Ecotools is always highly rated with their cosmetic brushes, for example.</li>
            <li>Although it does work good, it&#x27;s just poor quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to using my fingers until I buy a new foundation, then I&#x27;ll try it again to see if the problems I have are because of what I use right now or the brush itself.</li>
            <li>But well, till I get a new one this gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Opened it up, and it was sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>But later on i realized that i had strikes on my face, and it didn&#x27;t look pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was promising but overall it was a letdown.</li>
            <li>very sturdy seems like it will last a while</li>
            <li>I really love this brush, and although it takes me a little longer to make sure its covered everywhere, my makeup just looks smoother, and there is less mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend for anyone who uses a brush daily</li>
            <li>I put my foundation on the back of my left hand (between the thumb and index finger), and then hold a mirror with the same hand and paint my face with the right hand.</li>
            <li>Using this brush leaves my foundation looking super streaky and uneven.</li>
            <li>For when you have no other option.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super stiff like plastic.</li>
            <li>The size is right, but the brush is too stiff, almost plastic.</li>

            <li> so i bought this as my first time brush and it was really soft to the touch and put my foindation on really well without leaving any streaks</li>
            <li> so it stays clean, but i&#x27;ve been putting it back in the plastic sleeve it came in and putting it in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> One of e.l.f.&#x27;s better brushes, however it is extremely stiff when first used.</li>
            <li> After losing my first one while traveling I bought a second one and washed it before using and it softened up right away</li>
            <li> I actually really didn&#x27;t expect much from this brush but it&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li> the foundation brush is okay - maybe its because I got poor foundation, but I feel like blending it with my finger would have been far better than blending it with this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the e.l.f studio line brushes - which are three dollars each (still less than this rip off) and are much better quality</li>
            <li> Have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this brush here, I actually purchase this brush at a local store called DOLLAR TREE for just $1.00 much better price.</li>
            <li> Ecotools is always highly rated with their cosmetic brushes, for example.</li>
            <li> Although it does work good, it&#x27;s just poor quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to using my fingers until I buy a new foundation, then I&#x27;ll try it again to see if the problems I have are because of what I use right now or the brush itself.</li>
            <li> But well, till I get a new one this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Opened it up, and it was sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> But later on i realized that i had strikes on my face, and it didn&#x27;t look pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was promising but overall it was a letdown.</li>
            <li> very sturdy seems like it will last a while</li>
            <li> I really love this brush, and although it takes me a little longer to make sure its covered everywhere, my makeup just looks smoother, and there is less mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend for anyone who uses a brush daily</li>
            <li> I put my foundation on the back of my left hand (between the thumb and index finger), and then hold a mirror with the same hand and paint my face with the right hand.</li>
            <li> Using this brush leaves my foundation looking super streaky and uneven.</li>
            <li> For when you have no other option.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super stiff like plastic.</li>
            <li> The size is right, but the brush is too stiff, almost plastic.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this brush as a normal everyday brush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all!</li>
            <li> Bristles were not very soft at all either.</li>
            <li> price, I also found this brush at my local dollar tree and spent a whopping $1.09 on it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a flat sided foundation brush like this one for applying foundation because it takes forever and leaves streak marks down your face that take extra time to be blended out.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have been using a foundation brush a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> it had that weird package smell that came with it, but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a softer hair brush..</li>
            <li> The brush gets wet and tacky!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also poorly constructed as the metal piece has completely fallen off the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little investment and little hassle if you feel the need to return it.</li>
            <li> I typically like ELF products, but was super disappointed by this brush.</li>
            <li> but I figured a foundation brush could handle a heavy liquid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using it, but as for me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The stiffness also results in STREAKS which only get worse when you try to fix them.</li>
            <li> Its too stiff.</li>
            <li> After that, it became stiff, streaky, and needed to be cleaned almost every time I used my product.</li>
            <li> That way I don&#x27;t waste product on my hands!</li>
            <li> When I was applying it - it brushed on like weird streaks.</li>
            <li> not exactly sure how to keep it</li>
            <li> /&gt;E.L.F. products are usually a hit or miss with me.</li>
            <li> Even for one dollar it&#x27;s not very good they are hard and shed.</li>
            <li> This brush is a bit too bulky or kinda hard</li>
            <li> Really shoddy.</li>
            <li> This brushes make my face feel dirty and gross.</li>
            <li> I had to glue them back together with crazy glue.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this stuff is too thick to use a foundation brush with</li>
            <li> for the brush itself, failure.</li>
            <li> But if you want to waste money I guess there is nothing wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> Not good for foundation.</li>
            <li> I did and felt incredibly dumb when I went on elf&#x27;s website and found the brush for one dollar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times, but it&#x27;s difficult since it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> Booo not impressed</li>
            <li> 2 stars instead of 1 is merely since it was just $1.</li>
            <li> that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> and then the brush and metal broke away from the handle and now its useless.</li>
            <li> Ill say to buy it for ur concealer.</li>
            <li> the foundation cakes on and the bristles stick together, making it impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t painful to use.</li>
            <li> i hate the brush</li>
            <li> awful.</li>
            <li> This is horrible!</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Crap!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recommend that you don&#x27;t buy this item mostly because I saw you can buy this only for $1.00 at target. They might even have them at the dollar tree. But if you want to waste money I guess there is nothing wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> this brush doesn&#x27;t blend that good. its good for its price but i wish it was better...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this brush as a normal everyday brush. It pretty much does the job, but doesn&#x27;t blend . Its too stiff. I would recommend using a Kabuki brush instead.  Bottom Line: This should only be used as a emergency brush. For when you have no other option. But using your fingers would blend better than this brush honestly -_-</li>
            <li> I actually really didn&#x27;t expect much from this brush but it&#x27;s so soft! When I used it to apply my bb cream, it went on quite nicely but I noticed it can be a bit prickly if you don&#x27;t use it the right way. You have to make sure u use it really flat against Ur face. Not tapping with the tip too much otherwise it does poke you a bit. But for the price it&#x27;s pretty nice(:</li>
            <li> Ive gotten this yesterday, before the estimated delivery date. Opened it up, and it was sooooo soft! I love using this brush! I reccomend this brush. Elf products are great quality and still affordable.</li>
            <li> The size is right, but the brush is too stiff, almost plastic. I expected it to be a softer hair brush.. But well, till I get a new one this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long at all! It doesn&#x27;t matter what the brush quality is when it falls apart from the wooden part that &#x27;should&#x27; be used to jold</li>
            <li> Works GREAT with the elf foundation.</li>
            <li> I use this for my foundation obviously lol and I like the brush. It doesn&#x27;t really shed yet it had that weird package smell that came with it, but it quickly went away. This brush is a bit too bulky or kinda hard</li>
            <li> I bought this in stores. With much excitement to try it, it was a downer. I have to agree with others that when you start using liquid foundation with the brush stiffens up. You have to clean it a lot.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than stated, love this brand, the nice part is that they sell it in the store and if the store is out of stock you can purchase it on Amazon for the same price. Love it.</li>
            <li> When I got this brush, the brush tip broke apart from the handle like it wasn&#x27;t glued on properly or just popped off in the mail. I&#x27;ve used it a couple times, but it&#x27;s difficult since it&#x27;s broken. I guess for the price it would be worthwhile to glue the tip back on with hot glue or super glue or something. The brush tip is pretty soft but when using it with liquid foundation, it gets caked on a lot and you have to wash it after every use pretty much.</li>
            <li> This is only ONE dollar at through E.L.F online..or walmart...target... etc. Don&#x27;t buy it. Even for one dollar it&#x27;s not very good they are hard and shed. I&#x27;d recommend the e.l.f studio line brushes - which are three dollars each (still less than this rip off) and are much better quality</li>
            <li> awful. Brush broke off handle after first use. Really shoddy. Bristles were not very soft at all either. Booo not impressed</li>
            <li> It worked well for a while but the bristles come out very easily.</li>
            <li> I used it for only a week and it break already..The material is really cheap. Although it does work good, it&#x27;s just poor quality.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It can handle anything and cleans easily with white vinegar, peroxide and dawn. I&#x27;d highly recommend for anyone who uses a brush daily</li>
            <li> I like cheap and for $1 that&#x27;s good for me but I&#x27;d honestly rather spend a little money and get a good brush. This is horrible! It doesn&#x27;t spread foundation more like mops it around! The brush gets wet and tacky! The foundation looks caked on when applied with this brush!&lt;br /&gt;Seems like it just absorbs the liquid and doesn&#x27;t spread.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen nothing but good reviews for e.l.f but I&#x27;m not getting the hype.</li>
            <li> This brush was great the first two times out of the package, but then it became too &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; with foundation to keep using. I have to clean it with soap and warm water after every use or else the foundation cakes on and the bristles stick together, making it impossible to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brush with Maybelline Dream Matte Liquid foundation. Perhaps this stuff is too thick to use a foundation brush with but I figured a foundation brush could handle a heavy liquid. I will edit this review when I try it with a lighter foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of smearing, sometimes the foundation glided on great, but most of the time it looked like I had let a five-year-old smear it on for me. Using my fingers works better and takes about 1/5 of the time, since I don&#x27;t have to get the foundation to not look like I painted it on and I don&#x27;t have to clean a brush after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was promising but overall it was a letdown. I&#x27;ll go back to using my fingers until I buy a new foundation, then I&#x27;ll try it again to see if the problems I have are because of what I use right now or the brush itself.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for applying face masks, and it&#x27;s awesome! That way I don&#x27;t waste product on my hands! It also helps with precision. I have never used this for foundation though, so I can&#x27;t say how it would work for that!</li>
            <li> I did not like this brush. The quality was lacking. It did not apply makeup smoothly, and the bristles aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li> The only reason at all why I&#x27;m rating this product 2 stars instead of 1 is merely since it was just $1. On that note though, I would save that $1 to make an investment in a better brush. Ecotools is always highly rated with their cosmetic brushes, for example. I bought this brush and loved it the first two times I used it. After that, it became stiff, streaky, and needed to be cleaned almost every time I used my product. To put the icing on the cake, the actual metal brush part popped off of the wooden handle after about 2-3 months of use.  I normally love elf products, but this one was a complete flunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again, I would save that $1 to purchase something of better quality.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought one of them a few months ago, it lasted a good month maybe, but then it broke. I bought another one, it broke within a week. I now have one more which is like 2 weeks old, it&#x27;s all discolored, and will probably break soon. This brushes make my face feel dirty and gross. They&#x27;d be better for real painting.</li>
            <li> I first tried using this when I was using liquid foundation. It applied the foundation very well if you blended a lot. If you really blend it in, it won&#x27;t look streaky. I now use a mousse foundation and I don&#x27;t like using the brush with it. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me. This is a very good brush for liquid makeups though! And it&#x27;s only $1 in stores.</li>
            <li> the foundation brush is okay - maybe its because I got poor foundation, but I feel like blending it with my finger would have been far better than blending it with this brush. When I was applying it - it brushed on like weird streaks. I don&#x27;t know...I&#x27;ll continue using it, but as for me it was a waste of money. Nothing my finger can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> This was the first foundation i ever bought. At first you feel so fancy, because your using a brush to apply foundation. I really like at first. But later on i realized that i had strikes on my face, and it didn&#x27;t look pretty. It was like i was painting my face. I would recommend this brush if you are a first time user on foundation brushes. Not the best, but i think it is good to start off with.</li>
            <li> I lost my mac foundation brush so when I saw this at the dollar store I was excited. It works really good and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. I wash each time I use it and store it in the plastic pouch it came in.</li>
            <li> I used this with my liquid foundation and the bristles were detached from the very first use!&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this!!</li>
            <li> Using this brush leaves my foundation looking super streaky and uneven. I typically like ELF products, but was super disappointed by this brush.</li>
            <li> Brush is really good quality for the price, e.l.f is a great buy for anyone interested in makeup, I definitely reccomend</li>
            <li> I didnt realize elf cosmetics is sold at target and most of their brushes are only $1! i use all of their products and i think the most expensive makeup item they have is only $9..if that! love this brand</li>
            <li> This is a good multifunctional brush. Oddly enough, I don&#x27;t use this brush to apply foundation. I use it to apply concealer to blemishes, under eye concealer, and face masks. It performs all of these tasks well and I never experience any shedding when washing the brush. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a flat sided foundation brush like this one for applying foundation because it takes forever and leaves streak marks down your face that take extra time to be blended out. If you are looking for an inexpensive foundation brush I recommend elf&#x27;s stippling brush or powder brush. The powder brush is another great multifunctional brush that applies powders, blush, and foundation flawlessly. Do not buy this  brush off Amazon! I did and felt incredibly dumb when I went on elf&#x27;s website and found the brush for one dollar. Elf is always having great sales online and you could buy several brushes on their site for the price you would pay for this brush on here. Also, don&#x27;t expect this brush to be a miracle worker. Have realistic expectations. It&#x27;s a one dollar brush.</li>
            <li> All the hairs started falling out almost immediately.  Crap!  How about 0 stars.</li>
            <li> For a brush that is selling for $1, I&#x27;m pretty happy. It does a good job blending my concealer into my face, but the bristles are kinda prickly so I don&#x27;t like that feeling against my face. That&#x27;s the main reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I found it at Walmart for a 1$ after I ordered it. When I received it the bristles were all different lengths.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and it works great. Although the handle did break off, it is still a really good product.</li>
            <li> so i bought this as my first time brush and it was really soft to the touch and put my foindation on really well without leaving any streaks</li>
            <li> Friends have been trying to get me to use a foundation brush for several years now; I&#x27;m stubborn and have always used my fingers, feeling like I get better coverage that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong. I really love this brush, and although it takes me a little longer to make sure its covered everywhere, my makeup just looks smoother, and there is less mess. I put my foundation on the back of my left hand (between the thumb and index finger), and then hold a mirror with the same hand and paint my face with the right hand. Its super convenient and I have been putting my makeup on in bed (with a towel across my lap of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exactly sure how to keep it so it stays clean, but i&#x27;ve been putting it back in the plastic sleeve it came in and putting it in my makeup bag. I wish I would have been using a foundation brush a long time ago!</li>
            <li> Upon opening the package, the brush fell into two pieces. I had to glue them back together with crazy glue. The brush has worked fine, but the quality must not be very good for it to fall apart immediately.</li>
            <li> Its elf, of course it amazing. I will order again, I love it, it feels amazing on skin. It looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Cheap, the head of the brush fell off the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> The brush feels great on my skin but the handle started to fall apart like a few days after I started using it. .over all I guess its ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It worked as it should have for a while and then the brush and metal broke away from the handle and now its useless.</li>
            <li> Great price and products!  This foundation brush is great quality and easy to use.  I use with my BB creams, and it spreads the product well.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT foundation brush. It is my first. The brush places the foundation on your face evenly and smoothly. Great value for my money!</li>
            <li> soaks up a lot of product but does the job well. very sturdy seems like it will last a while</li>
            <li> I bought this for a dollar at the 99 cent store. Good quality, doesn&#x27;t shed. i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it is kind of stiff and doesn&#x27;t glide on your face very easily.</li>
            <li> Not good for foundation. Works wonderful as a concealer brush. Ill say to buy it for ur concealer. Great brush for that.</li>
            <li> [BOTTOM LINE]: I do not recommend this brush. Cheaply made and poor performance- 1 star quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding price, I also found this brush at my local dollar tree and spent a whopping $1.09 on it. Since Dollar Tree stores like to swap up inventory, you can also find this at Target for $1. Point being, if you&#x27;re adventurous and want to give this brush a try, DO NOT BUY IT HERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the brush itself, failure. This is one of the first brushes I ever used to apply liquid foundation and will never use it for foundation again. The bristles are super stiff like plastic. It looks and feels just like a paintbrush- I actually use mine as a paintbrush now. The stiffness also results in STREAKS which only get worse when you try to fix them. I suggest something like a stippling brush with dual fibers (currently using RT stippling brush) so you can buff the makeup into your skin, eliminating the streak prob. It&#x27;s also poorly constructed as the metal piece has completely fallen off the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E.L.F. products are usually a hit or miss with me. They have many products that compare to higher end products but most of the time, you get what you pay for. As I initially stated- if you are brave enough to give this brush a try, go buy it for a $1 at one of the aforementioned stores. Little investment and little hassle if you feel the need to return it. I rarely give 1 star reviews, but I could not even justify giving this brush 2 stars.</li>
            <li> One of e.l.f.&#x27;s better brushes, however it is extremely stiff when first used. After losing my first one while traveling I bought a second one and washed it before using and it softened up right away so it isn&#x27;t painful to use. However I only paid $1 at HEB for my brush.</li>
            <li> This was the first foundation brush that I ever bought, and it was amazing! I&#x27;ve had it for some time now, and it only recently broke. But I&#x27;m still able to use the brush end, so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for foundation application. Works great!</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this brush here, I actually purchase this brush at a local store called DOLLAR TREE for just $1.00 much better price. Hope this helped. The store carries all the ( e.l.f.) brushes and all are just $1.00 I am very impressed of the quality and performance of the brush, trust me you can&#x27;t go wrong for $1.00 dollar.</li>
            <li> i hate the brush so cheap i prefer buying another type of brush !!!&lt;br /&gt;hate it totally&lt;br /&gt;sorry&lt;br /&gt;:(&lt;br /&gt;fake</li>
            <li> My 3rd time purchasing this brush. It is a great foundation brush, a true value! Works just as well as the more expensive brands! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I only paid $1 for this at target because  I needed a foundation brush. You get what you pay for , which is practically nothing. This would make a good paint brush for thick strokes. Not for applying foundation.</li>
