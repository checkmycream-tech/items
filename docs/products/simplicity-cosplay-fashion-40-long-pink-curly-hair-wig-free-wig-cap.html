            <li>The quality is great and very realistic.</li>

            <li>I love this wig.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product, you will love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>this is a great wig for cosplay or halloween, it really made a difference</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thinner than most my wigs, but I love the color and length.</li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think you could get anything better than this wig.  </li>
            <li>its very soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>It gets tangled so easy (arrived tangled)and</li>
            <li>Easily tangles, clumps up and falls out.</li>
            <li>Also, the curls are beautiful, but get a bit frizzy especially after rubbing against clothing.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of shedding, but it&#x27;s nothing too significant.</li>
            <li>Love it so much I bought two.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really true to shape and color</li>
            <li>It does tangle easily, but it kinda makes it look more natural</li>
            <li>To be honest  the color is great but this wig is to thin</li>
            <li>The wig is very pretty</li>
            <li>Pros: its very soft, color that you see on the picture, if you expect it to be long you will be very happy, the texture is pretty realistic, the shine goes away easily with cornstarch.</li>
            <li>Awesome for cosplay just bangs are long and you can see the netting in the back</li>
            <li>Great if you don&#x27;t mess with it at all.</li>
            <li>gets a little frizzy but looks great.</li>
            <li>Though, the color is paler/darker than the bright pink they showed in the picture</li>
            <li>From the looks of it, the head is pretty full.</li>
            <li>but i replaced it right away, don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture its a disaster</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s long, and it&#x27;s lightly curled.</li>
            <li>Honestly buy a better slightly more expensive wig.</li>
            <li>i love being different if you are never afraid to be different&lt;</li>
            <li>Super super soft, pretty color,</li>
            <li>it came early which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>the front needs more hair, not enough and you can see the elastic band underneath.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my daughters first Cosplay.</li>
            <li>The color, curls, and texture are exactly as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and it came just in time.</li>
            <li>I just have to figure out the correct way to style my hair before putting the wig on, but overall I love</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Super soft!</li>
            <li>then I thought, and really ratty after first time wearing it.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of trouble making the wig fit just right on my head since my head is a bit big, but after some practice I found that it became easy and fit snug.</li>
            <li>My only problem is it tangles REALLY easily, but my dog jumps on me so that could be why mine did.</li>
            <li>A lovely wig: if youre careful.</li>
            <li>This added a really gentle, feminine look to my outfit, and fellow passer-by gave me lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>i really suggest it&lt;br /&gt;little</li>
            <li>The length of the wig, straight out of the box 3 - Close up of the wig after styling the bangs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking to straight haired wigs.</li>
            <li>The wig is very cheaply made and it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Im still in the process of untangling and wish I had not messed with it; I dont know if itll ever be as soft and curly as it was when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for someone who is low budget like me :)</li>
            <li>Its really soft and the curls are cute, but when I tried to style it, it got extremely tangled.</li>
            <li>curls get tangled and sticks to everything but feels soft like real hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super long.</li>
            <li>so they looked more natural and not so long, and you can see through the top of the wig a little bit sometimes, but it&#x27;s super soft, and looks pretty real )aside from being pink and going down to my butt)</li>
            <li>its soft and looks like realistic</li>
            <li>the wig arrived ahead of time, and it was a few shades pink-er than I&#x27;d expected from the picture, but that was a good thing.</li>
            <li>and you get more for how little you spend!</li>
            <li>needs to be fuller, very soft.</li>
            <li>is certain ways, but I cut bangs into it and that total fixed the problem!</li>
            <li>I used it in the photography shoot and it looked so professional.</li>
            <li>but if you fix the bangs when you take it out it&#x27;s completely unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>The wig was not as full as I had expected once i finally received it.</li>
            <li>Great color and looks like real hsir but a hard wig to manage is really thin and sheds a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick for its price, and is 100% true to the picture&#x27;s color!</li>
            <li>The wig came with a wig cap as well, which was needed especially since I&#x27;m new to wigs.</li>
            <li>Super long, pink, curly wig.</li>
            <li>A lot of people sell wigs, but not many sell high quality wigs that are durable, affordable, and look almost real!</li>
            <li>, The wig was much nicer quality than we expected.</li>
            <li>Pleased with the shipping speed, displeased with the thin area where the bangs are supposed to part.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also thin at the top</li>
            <li>This pink and long and people still asked if it were my real hair!</li>
            <li>its kinda thin but for this wig its a good thing, if it was thicker it would be extremely heavy.</li>
            <li>Nothing really special here, at least, not for the price.</li>
            <li>When I took the wig out of the packaging, I was surprised at how long it was.</li>

            <li> When I took the wig out of the packaging, I was surprised at how long it was.</li>
            <li> Cons: its very thin on top</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to come in rather late, however, this one was the first thing of my Psychoshy outfit to come in.</li>
            <li> The bangs of the wig was really long and thick, it covered my whole face.</li>
            <li> and she has hair as long as the wig and triple in thickness!</li>
            <li> I so wish that I had long, curly pink anime hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thin as well</li>
            <li> After only wearing it only a couple of hours it became unbelievably tangled</li>
            <li> problem was that it has less hair in the back</li>
            <li> Also, the inside of the wig has a little elastic adjuster if your head is smaller, but I have mine set on the biggest setting.  </li>
            <li> i find nothing bad about this wig, and the fact that they included a wig cap with it made it better.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have loved this wig, but the truth is I hated It.</li>
            <li> im 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and it goes down to my butt so its very long.</li>
            <li> so you can see the cap, I used a hat to cover it up, and it was a little too long for me</li>
            <li> The wig was very thin and the yellow wig cap part of the wig was easily visible and is extremely difficult to hide.</li>
            <li> I tend to give cheap wigs a chance considering they&#x27;re synthetic, but this one is really bad, its a nightmare.</li>
            <li> It came tangled up and knotted, was deffinantly not worth the wait</li>
            <li> It goes down to my hips</li>
            <li> goes down to my butt</li>
            <li> the wig arrived slightly tangled so i immedietly sprayed it in order to untangle it and try it on.</li>
            <li> and so you have to almost divide the bangs in half in order to cover up the spot.</li>
            <li> I cut the bangs a little</li>
            <li> However, the color is a little darker than the picture.</li>
            <li> I never got it :/</li>
            <li> The shorter hairs framing the face are still thick, and I&#x27;m not sure what to do with them at the moment 4 -</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was that on the one side, where the bangs are supposed to part, they glued less hair</li>
            <li> The wig after cutting the bangs, also shows the length of the wig relative to my body.</li>
            <li> Not a good</li>
            <li> no helping it its just to thin</li>
            <li> Ive bought 3 wigs on this site and although they&#x27;ve been thin and shed and arent heat resistancce.</li>
            <li> makes it 10xs worse!</li>
            <li> Every mad and disapointed</li>
            <li> The curls got all messed up and is just a horrible product.</li>

            <li> To be honest  the color is great but this wig is to thin you cant move the bangs any way to get them out of your face and not see the cap i tried to trim the bangs but theres no helping it its just to thin</li>
            <li> You can see the meshing in the front of the wig.</li>
            <li> needs to be fuller, very soft. the front needs more hair, not enough and you can see the elastic band underneath. Super super soft, pretty color, just not what the photo shows</li>
            <li> Pros: its very soft, color that you see on the picture, if you expect it to be long you will be very happy, the texture is pretty realistic, the shine goes away easily with cornstarch. Cons: its very thin on top so you can see the cap, I used a hat to cover it up, and it was a little too long for me so I cut off a bit...but all in all it is a good wig for the price. I would definitely recommend it for someone who is low budget like me :)</li>
            <li> The color was perfect and so was the length but it got soooo tangled! I can&#x27;t even run my fingers through it! It is a good buy but just make sure to keep it in good shape!</li>
            <li> A lovely wig: if youre careful. Its really soft and the curls are cute, but when I tried to style it, it got extremely tangled. Im still in the process of untangling and wish I had not messed with it; I dont know if itll ever be as soft and curly as it was when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I so wish that I had long, curly pink anime hair...and now I do! I cut the bangs a little so they looked more natural and not so long, and you can see through the top of the wig a little bit sometimes, but it&#x27;s super soft, and looks pretty real )aside from being pink and going down to my butt) It does tangle easily, but it kinda makes it look more natural so I&#x27;m okay with it, plus it can be re curled, so all in all this is a great wig for the price, and  love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughters first Cosplay. We were running shirt on time and it arrived within plenty of time!, The wig was much nicer quality than we expected. The hairnet helped hold ALL of her hair in place and she has hair as long as the wig and triple in thickness! Great transaction!!</li>
            <li> I used it in the photography shoot and it looked so professional. The art was put into a art show!!</li>
            <li> Loved the wig but. After only wearing it only a couple of hours it became unbelievably tangled</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It&#x27;s cute, it&#x27;s long, and it&#x27;s lightly curled. This added a really gentle, feminine look to my outfit, and fellow passer-by gave me lots of compliments. People seemed really impressed with the quality(as was I), and many people asked me where I purchased this product. The color, curls, and texture are exactly as shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Shipping! I was really impressed with this product. A lot of people sell wigs, but not many sell high quality wigs that are durable, affordable, and look almost real! Would definitely recommend this to anyone! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The wig was not as full as I had expected once i finally received it. I had some issues with shipping but thankfully it was resolved. The wig is very cheaply made and it is not worth the money. Honestly buy a better slightly more expensive wig. The wig was very thin and the yellow wig cap part of the wig was easily visible and is extremely difficult to hide. I do not recommend this wig, especially if you want it for cosplay and not a halloween costume you&#x27;ll only wear one time. If you want what you see do not buy this wig.</li>
            <li> curls get tangled and sticks to everything but feels soft like real hair. Great color and looks like real hsir but a hard wig to manage is really thin and sheds a lot.</li>
            <li> Love it so much I bought two.  The only draw back is it doesn&#x27;t have the ear things that drop in front .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and it came just in time.</li>
            <li> It gets tangled so easy (arrived tangled)and can never be untangled any attempts to fix it makes it 10xs worse!</li>
            <li> the wig arrived slightly tangled so i immedietly sprayed it in order to untangle it and try it on. It just kept getting tangled and tangled and now i dont know what to do anymore. Ive bought 3 wigs on this site and although they&#x27;ve been thin and shed and arent heat resistancce. I tend to give cheap wigs a chance considering they&#x27;re synthetic, but this one is really bad, its a nightmare.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and the wig itself is astonishing it&#x27;s really true to shape and color, it&#x27;s just thinner than you would expect and you can sort of see the wig cap but if you fix the bangs when you take it out it&#x27;s completely unnoticeable. My only problem is it tangles REALLY easily, but my dog jumps on me so that could be why mine did. I will definitely be buying this wig again.</li>
            <li> it came early which is a huge plus. its very soft and looks great. im 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and it goes down to my butt so its very long. its kinda thin but for this wig its a good thing, if it was thicker it would be extremely heavy. i find nothing bad about this wig, and the fact that they included a wig cap with it made it better. this is the perfect wig for my fluttershy cosplay :)</li>
            <li> Super soft! I got this just on a whim, and didn&#x27;t expect it to be so great. The weaving does show a bit when you move the hair is certain ways, but I cut bangs into it and that total fixed the problem! It&#x27;s thick for its price, and is 100% true to the picture&#x27;s color!</li>
            <li> Easily tangles, clumps up and falls out. Great if you don&#x27;t mess with it at all. Didn&#x27;t last a week in my house.</li>
            <li> Super long, pink, curly wig. It goes down to my hips and I&#x27;m 5&#x27; 4&amp;#34;! The quality is great and very realistic. I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter used it for cos play and she was happy with it...  I was too. The length is perfect and the condition of the curl is absolutely beautiful and flows very naturally. I recommend this product, you will love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also we kept it, maybe we can use it for another event.</li>
            <li> this is a great wig for cosplay or halloween, it really made a difference and you get more for how little you spend!</li>
            <li> I turned out prettier than what we imagined. They curls are cute and perfect! It also has hooks in the back so you can make it tighter so it won&#x27;t fall ofc,!</li>
            <li> ok.  Nothing really special here, at least, not for the price. the wig arrived ahead of time, and it was a few shades pink-er than I&#x27;d expected from the picture, but that was a good thing. The only bad thing was that on the one side, where the bangs are supposed to part, they glued less hair and so you have to almost divide the bangs in half in order to cover up the spot. Pleased with the shipping speed, displeased with the thin area where the bangs are supposed to part. Meh.</li>
            <li> This pink and long and people still asked if it were my real hair!</li>
            <li> loves it likes playing with the curls</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner than most my wigs, but I love the color and length. I just have to figure out the correct way to style my hair before putting the wig on, but overall I love it am I&#x27;m glad I bought this item!</li>
            <li> It came tangled up and knotted, was deffinantly not worth the wait</li>
            <li> i love being different if you are never afraid to be different&lt;br /&gt;then i really suggest it&lt;br /&gt;little problem was that it has less hair in the back and you can see the wig cap</li>
            <li> Not a good but I never resived my item !!! Every mad and disapointed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful wig and is perfect for any Luca or Fluttershy cosplay! It looks exactly like the picture. The curls stay in the wig, even if you run your fingers through it. Its a great wig!&lt;br /&gt;I will order from this seller again</li>
            <li> Barley any hair,can&#x27;t comb because hair will fall out.&lt;br /&gt;I can style it,looks great but tangles easy.</li>
            <li> I never got it :/ asked three times where it was and even had anther sent and never got that one either.</li>
            <li> Thinnest, crappiest wig ive ever bought, had to make do with it at con because i ordered it so close but i replaced it right away, don&#x27;t be fooled by the picture its a disaster</li>
            <li> i love it, great for cosplay. gets a little frizzy but looks great. goes down to my butt and im 5&#x27;6. its soft and looks like realistic</li>
            <li> I have Prime, so I got the two-day shipping and it arrived on time. The wig came with a wig cap as well, which was needed especially since I&#x27;m new to wigs. When I took the wig out of the packaging, I was surprised at how long it was. It&#x27;s pretty thin as well but if it were thicker, the wig would have been a lot heavier. The color is a bit lighter than the stock photo, but if you know what Megurine Luka&#x27;s hair looks like then the wig matches that perfectly. The bangs of the wig was really long and thick, it covered my whole face. But all wigs need a bit of styling. There is a bit of shedding, but it&#x27;s nothing too significant. Also, the curls are beautiful, but get a bit frizzy especially after rubbing against clothing. I had a bit of trouble making the wig fit just right on my head since my head is a bit big, but after some practice I found that it became easy and fit snug. Also, the inside of the wig has a little elastic adjuster if your head is smaller, but I have mine set on the biggest setting.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think you could get anything better than this wig.  Pictures: 1 - Hair before any styling. My Just be Friends cosplay 2 - The length of the wig, straight out of the box 3 - Close up of the wig after styling the bangs. The shorter hairs framing the face are still thick, and I&#x27;m not sure what to do with them at the moment 4 - The color and quality of the wig 5- The wig after cutting the bangs, also shows the length of the wig relative to my body. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and the wig falls where my hand ends</li>
            <li> This wig is perfect! However, the color is a little darker than the picture. I would also advise people to spray a detangler spray before and after use. It tangles easy, but is wonderful quality.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to come in rather late, however, this one was the first thing of my Psychoshy outfit to come in. From the looks of it, the head is pretty full.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have loved this wig, but the truth is I hated It. The curls got all messed up and is just a horrible product. I&#x27;m sticking to straight haired wigs.</li>
            <li> Awesome for cosplay just bangs are long and you can see the netting in the back</li>
            <li> The wig is very pretty and it&#x27;s super long. The curls and bangs are very nice and the texture is good quality. Though, the color is paler/darker than the bright pink they showed in the picture and it&#x27;s also thin at the top so you can see the wig cap.</li>
