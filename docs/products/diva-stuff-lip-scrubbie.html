            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Zero stars would be more accurate!</li>
            <li>Overall the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they cost about 10 dollars more and probably work just as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok, dries my lips ore than anything.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a better product.</li>
            <li>Bought 2 more for my daughters.</li>
            <li>I love it , with some of the reviews saying it was like Vaseline</li>
            <li>but more like a sugar cookie.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I abosoletly love this lip scrub I plan on getting the bubble gum one when I run out.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER I gave it a four star rating because after using the scrub, I find my lips are much more moisturized.</li>
            <li>love love love the smell</li>
            <li>The most important thing though, it that it does WONDERS for your lips!</li>
            <li>Looking into more of their product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to order more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast which was great</li>
            <li>the the product was just ok.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the face scrubie out yet, but I&#x27;m very excited to.</li>
            <li>The lip scrub works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Has a great taste and makes your lips very soft.</li>
            <li>love this and the free samples</li>
            <li>The chap stick, is soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>Tastes great and make lips soft.</li>
            <li>It tastes interesting, it made my lips smooth</li>
            <li>Good size and works very well.</li>
            <li>How sweet!</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells like a sweet treat and tastes like one as well!  </li>
            <li>This is my first lip scrub and I love it!  </li>
            <li>My daughter is on actuate ( a strong acne medication) which leaves her lips peeling and bleeding from dryness.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get better than that right!</li>
            <li>and I love lip scrubs, but this is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve had as far as leaving them moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not only does the lip balm taste great and feel fantastic, the service was phenomenal.</li>
            <li>But in general this stuff works great</li>
            <li>Taste is nice and I can really tell a difference in my lips with usage!  </li>
            <li>The lip scrub plastic was a bit greasy but nothing overwhelming - a quick dab of a tissue eliminated that.</li>
            <li>I am from the desert and this has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li>Tastes &amp; feels fantastic and has helped with my chapped lips.</li>
            <li>It sort of scratches your lips, making them smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this scrub.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the texture and consistency of the scrub.</li>
            <li>SO cheap..</li>
            <li>but I also got another lip scrub and a face cream for free also.</li>
            <li>I had hoped this scrub  would work as well as the mint scrub that used to be available at bath and body works.  </li>
            <li>And my free Chapstick while I hear people rave about the product it was in root beer flavor</li>
            <li>They work well at exfoliating and leaving lips kissably smooth.</li>
            <li>Plus I got a free sample.</li>
            <li>My free samples were a Cantaloupe Face Cream  and Night Repair Lip mask in the flavor Watermelon.</li>
            <li>and I got two free samples</li>
            <li>,  smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>One application of this and my lips were baby smooth.</li>
            <li>Works Pretty!!</li>
            <li>Makes your lips smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>The scrub is amazing, rubs off the dry skin and tastes amazing.</li>
            <li>Very helpful with dry lips and tastes great!</li>
            <li>I cannot say I will never buy another lush lip scrub again, but I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>love it so much!</li>
            <li>This is worth trying!</li>
            <li>I feel that I could actually attempt to make my own lip scrub and come out with better results...</li>
            <li>I put my lip gloss on and it makes my lips super smooth</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic - almost good enough to eat.  </li>
            <li>Feels really nice and made my lips soft!</li>
            <li>I just used it, &amp; my lips are nice &amp; soft!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t plan on licking it off lol that seemed weird, but it is actually very effective.</li>
            <li>Works great to exfoliate dry lips and leaves them moisturized!</li>
            <li>its quick easy and fun.</li>
            <li>Makes your lips nice and soft</li>
            <li>They come in so many yummy flavors and really work to exfoliate and moisturize your lips.  </li>

            <li>and I look forward to buying the full versions of them, if they sell those.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>have not a bad word about this product.</li>
            <li>Tastes great, obviously, its a sugar scrub, but really wasn&#x27;t great at removing the dry skin on my lips..</li>
            <li>It smells and tastes amazing, makes my lips super soft before applying my lipstick.</li>
            <li>they also give you great samples of the other products they sell.</li>
            <li>I got my package extremely quick</li>
            <li>It taste good and scrubs dead skins out of your lips :)</li>
            <li>The one star Is for shipping as it arrived quickly.</li>

            <li>I have tried many different lip scrubs and Diva Stuff is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different flavors but this one is my favorite</li>

            <li>It really is ediable, sweet tasting, fun and does a nice the job of gentle lip exfoliation.</li>
            <li>My lips are soft and sweet! YUM!</li>

            <li>Would totally recommend this amazing product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s filled to the very brim.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the free samples that came with the product.</li>
            <li>I do not know where all the great reviews came from, but this is garbage a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Not only is the product amazing</li>
            <li>I also received free samples of other products with my order and all were outstanding!</li>
            <li>Works better than the lip scrub from lush</li>
            <li>I love that this product is 100% all natural, it contains no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>So I decided to take the lush and put it on top of the diva and then rub my lips together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my dark spots from scars; I think it&#x27;s kind of working so far.. and smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Smells and tastes good but did not really do anything for my lips.  </li>
            <li>And the company was cute enough to send me some free samples.</li>
            <li>love how it&#x27;s made with all natural</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more when I run out and also very cool that it comes with other samples :)!</li>
            <li>this lip scrub works very well and is fun to use!</li>
            <li>So much better than i expected, i have had to give these as gifts to my friends since they also love it so much!</li>
            <li>but you have to put Chapstick or lip gloss on right away because your lips will feel like sand paper if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It had just the right amount of exfoliating power.</li>
            <li>It is edible, but I didn&#x27;t buy this to eat it, am I right?</li>
            <li>So easy and fun to use, makes my lips feel soft and plump.</li>
            <li>So much better and more affordable than comparable lip scrubs, from companies such as Lush.  </li>
            <li>i have a big issue with my lips getting chapped especially in the winters and its hard to put on a nice lipstick but after using this it&#x27;s been perfect.</li>
            <li>Which was disappointing because so many people said they loved i!</li>
            <li>I would definitely say that some of the reviews are misleading though, the smell isn&#x27;t very strong, and there isn&#x27;t too much of a taste.</li>
            <li>1/4 ounce didn&#x27;t sound like much, but you get a nice little tub.  </li>
            <li>Way better than Sugar scrub that smells gross and way over priced.</li>
            <li>That absolutely made my day!</li>
            <li>Looks much more smaller than the picture, and I don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience purchasing something by Diva Stuff</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and tastes like cake!</li>
            <li>Arrived today by mail, was exited to open and it came wrapped on a plastic that was to oily, the smell was ok, but the product was just too greasy a</li>
            <li>Just used for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>but it does work so no room to really complain!</li>
            <li>This scrub mades my lips smooth and soft after a first try.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have the most stubborn dead skin spots on my bottom lip, and yet this takes them off in the most gentle way.</li>
            <li>Better than the various scrubs from Sephora that I tried!</li>
            <li>just like Cake Batter says her lips are soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Comes exactly as shown in picture so no complaints here</li>
            <li>Left my lips smooth and it smells just like cake batter!</li>
            <li>and I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>so make sure you only use it  on your lips.</li>
            <li>It came in half the time they said it would and they included a free lip balm, face scrub, and coupon for more.</li>
            <li>This lip scrub arrived pretty quickly, &amp; I was also happy to find a few free samples of some of Diva Stuffs other products!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and make my lips smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I also like that the product does not dry out easily.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling that despite my love of using it this one will last a while as one does not need much, - unless you eat it for dessert.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cost effective alternative to lush, look no further.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Fresh Sugar lip treatment, Elf lip exfoliator, and many other lip products</li>
            <li>My lips are usually pretty chapped and this doesn&#x27;t take much of the chapped skin off, if any.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I found Diva Stuff, &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try other products!</li>
            <li>Plus the little sprinkles inside are a cute touch!</li>
            <li>I love all of the Diva Stuff Lip Scrubs I have gotten - I no longer have to worry about them getting dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you moisturize well after because sugar does dry out skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple of other lip scrubs (which cost a lot more), and Diva Stuff&#x27;s is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>Honestly I would have been a little freaked out if it was like straight up frosting.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really really greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the sprinkles in it</li>
            <li>I really do recommend</li>
            <li>The Lip  Scrubbie doesn&#x27;t taste so much like cake batter</li>
            <li>Tastes yummy, works well - highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, and the tub is packed.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it do a fantastic job of exfoliating but it tastes like cake.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, really.</li>
            <li>It tastes good at least.</li>
            <li>the sent is nice and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>The Dr. told us not to use a scrub of any kind because it would be too harsh and could cause damage.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a very cute pink envelope with two little free samples.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product because I heard other people rave about it.</li>
            <li>I may try some other products to see if I like those better.</li>
            <li>I have used lip scrubs in the past and liked them, but I really like the scent/taste of this one.  </li>
            <li>I have lips that get dry easily</li>
            <li>its really good if you have chapped lips, only 4 stars because in the picture it looks way bigger and it is actually only 2 fingers wide if you put your fingers on the top.</li>
            <li>Works great to soften my lips when they&#x27;re dry removing the dead skin.</li>
            <li>It was cool because I only ordered this</li>
            <li>Because lush is super dry sugar and diva scrub is super greasy.</li>
            <li>I dab it on, rub my lips together and most of the sugar dissolves, I lick what is left off and there is still a very moisturizing type balm left on my lips.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>I add balm on top just because I can never get enough but just leaving it might be enough for done.</li>
            <li>I find this well worth the money only because I&#x27;m too lazy to make my own.</li>
            <li>I use  high end lipsticks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it.</li>
            <li>I also suggest stirring it up a little before using it for better taste.</li>
            <li>and it really makes your lips soft.</li>
            <li>This company seems very customer service oriented, the packaging came with an email to contact the company directly if you have any problems.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t go to waste though :)</li>
            <li>It was too sweet and didn&#x27;t remove dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It makes your lips so soft!</li>
            <li>but this stuff fixed it up in one application!</li>
            <li>The fact that they use all natural ingredients is a plus!  </li>
            <li>and you only need a tiny bit for a full result.</li>
            <li>But it smells nice and sweet and doesn&#x27;t taste horrible, so that is what matter most there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very decent product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Takes all the dry and dead skin right off your lips and makes them look and feel smooth</li>
            <li>It tastes yummy, is all natural, and gets my lips soft and smooooth.</li>
            <li>and leaves your lips feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Go to Lush, and get their lip scrub.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old LOVES this stuff.</li>
            <li>Iy made my lips soft and the taste was addicting</li>
            <li>Very grainy and can be too much to me, I feel if you use sugar mixed with a cream you like will do the same.</li>
            <li>also it moisturizes your lips alot and makes them feel soft.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my lips extremely soft all day.</li>
            <li>makes my lips so soft and feel revived.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s have a soft oily finish</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and my lips are so soft all day.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh in any way.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>AND MADE MY LIPS SOOOO SOFT #CakeBatter ....</li>
            <li>I was originally turned off by the see through packaging, it looked a little cheap and childish but the reviews made me order anyway.</li>
            <li>After I rinsed off the sugar it felt like I had put on lip balm and my mouth tasted sweet for for a few hours.</li>
            <li>It gets all those flaky dry patches of skin right off my lips, revealing smoother, softer, plumped up lips instantly.</li>
            <li>Really helps my lips in the winter time when they tend to get really dry.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a reasonably price lip scrub that actually relieves my chapped lips!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sadly, I can&#x27;t say that for most of the products out there today!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched long and hard and spent big bucks at large retail stores, even tried to make my own at home.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh and it is the only thing to keep her lips moist throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have dry or cracked lips.</li>
            <li>Great flavor, the sugar crystals aren&#x27;t too rough and a little goes a very long way so this little vial will last a long time!</li>
            <li>If I use it before I go to sleep especially after wearing the dreaded liquid lipsticks, I wipe down gently with a washcloth to remove granular residue and leave some of the oil.</li>
            <li>The packaging my scrub came in was black with a white lid and very sleek looking.</li>
            <li>I was also very surprised when it arrived an entire week earlier than I expected it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this and all the other diva stuff products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great lip exfoliator, my lips chap like crazy and this gets rid of the dead skin and moisturizes the lips.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I just threw it away but the cake lip batter scrubbie was amazing.</li>
            <li> Diva Stuff Lip Scrubbies are amazing.</li>
            <li> All the flavors are amazing.</li>
            <li> but it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Make your own.</li>
            <li> Its nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice moisture and softness after you use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of sticky however.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice, it doesn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me of something I can&#x27;t put my finger one, it&#x27;s nice, but it isn&#x27;t cake batter to me at all.</li>
            <li> By the way, it is also came with a bunch of cute samples that I loved playing with.</li>
            <li> nice lips scrub.  </li>

            <li> They all smell great but NONE OF THEM ARE WORTH ANYTHING!</li>
            <li> None of it is worth anything!!!</li>

            <li> I absolutely adore the lip balm, it is a wonderful scent, and keeps my lips nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is easy to wipe off but is tempting to eat it!</li>
            <li> and my lips feel very smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Sweet and wonderful lip scrub that really works.</li>
            <li> Very cheap... says made of vegetable oil, but cheap greasy vasoline, probably!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My lips are always so smooth after using this!</li>

            <li> I will defenitly be buying more diva stuff</li>
            <li> And usually I love everything cupcake flavored/scented.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Zero stars would be more accurate!</li>
            <li> Overall the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they cost about 10 dollars more and probably work just as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok, dries my lips ore than anything.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a better product.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> I love it , with some of the reviews saying it was like Vaseline</li>
            <li> but more like a sugar cookie.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I abosoletly love this lip scrub I plan on getting the bubble gum one when I run out.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER I gave it a four star rating because after using the scrub, I find my lips are much more moisturized.</li>
            <li> love love love the smell</li>
            <li> The most important thing though, it that it does WONDERS for your lips!</li>
            <li> Looking into more of their product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to order more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast which was great</li>
            <li> the the product was just ok.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the face scrubie out yet, but I&#x27;m very excited to.</li>
            <li> The lip scrub works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Has a great taste and makes your lips very soft.</li>
            <li> love this and the free samples</li>
            <li> The chap stick, is soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and make lips soft.</li>
            <li> It tastes interesting, it made my lips smooth</li>
            <li> Good size and works very well.</li>
            <li> How sweet!</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells like a sweet treat and tastes like one as well!  </li>
            <li> This is my first lip scrub and I love it!  </li>
            <li> My daughter is on actuate ( a strong acne medication) which leaves her lips peeling and bleeding from dryness.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get better than that right!</li>
            <li> and I love lip scrubs, but this is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve had as far as leaving them moisturized.</li>
            <li> Not only does the lip balm taste great and feel fantastic, the service was phenomenal.</li>
            <li> But in general this stuff works great</li>
            <li> Taste is nice and I can really tell a difference in my lips with usage!  </li>
            <li> The lip scrub plastic was a bit greasy but nothing overwhelming - a quick dab of a tissue eliminated that.</li>
            <li> I am from the desert and this has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li> Tastes &amp; feels fantastic and has helped with my chapped lips.</li>
            <li> It sort of scratches your lips, making them smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this scrub.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the texture and consistency of the scrub.</li>
            <li> SO cheap..</li>
            <li> but I also got another lip scrub and a face cream for free also.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this scrub  would work as well as the mint scrub that used to be available at bath and body works.  </li>
            <li> And my free Chapstick while I hear people rave about the product it was in root beer flavor</li>
            <li> They work well at exfoliating and leaving lips kissably smooth.</li>
            <li> Plus I got a free sample.</li>
            <li> My free samples were a Cantaloupe Face Cream  and Night Repair Lip mask in the flavor Watermelon.</li>
            <li> and I got two free samples</li>
            <li> ,  smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> One application of this and my lips were baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Works Pretty!!</li>
            <li> Makes your lips smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> The scrub is amazing, rubs off the dry skin and tastes amazing.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with dry lips and tastes great!</li>
            <li> I cannot say I will never buy another lush lip scrub again, but I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> love it so much!</li>
            <li> This is worth trying!</li>
            <li> I feel that I could actually attempt to make my own lip scrub and come out with better results...</li>
            <li> I put my lip gloss on and it makes my lips super smooth</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic - almost good enough to eat.  </li>
            <li> Feels really nice and made my lips soft!</li>
            <li> I just used it, &amp; my lips are nice &amp; soft!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t plan on licking it off lol that seemed weird, but it is actually very effective.</li>
            <li> Works great to exfoliate dry lips and leaves them moisturized!</li>
            <li> its quick easy and fun.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips nice and soft</li>
            <li> They come in so many yummy flavors and really work to exfoliate and moisturize your lips.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sons girl friend who happens to love the real Cake says this smells  </li>
            <li> and I look forward to buying the full versions of them, if they sell those.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> have not a bad word about this product.</li>
            <li> Tastes great, obviously, its a sugar scrub, but really wasn&#x27;t great at removing the dry skin on my lips..</li>
            <li> It smells and tastes amazing, makes my lips super soft before applying my lipstick.</li>
            <li> they also give you great samples of the other products they sell.</li>
            <li> I got my package extremely quick</li>
            <li> It taste good and scrubs dead skins out of your lips :)</li>
            <li> The one star Is for shipping as it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> and it came quickly</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lip scrubs and Diva Stuff is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different flavors but this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> Tastes delicious and really scrubbs the dead skin off</li>
            <li> It really is ediable, sweet tasting, fun and does a nice the job of gentle lip exfoliation.</li>
            <li> My lips are soft and sweet! YUM!</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well and is cute, but does not taste like Cake Batter, it tastes like pure vaseline.</li>
            <li> this is the first lip scrub i used and so far i am loving it.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to receive this lip scrub</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do !</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like funfetti cake batter!</li>
            <li> , I really recommend this product, the smell alone sells it!!</li>
            <li> it tastes great and gives my lips a little shine I also used it on my daughter</li>
            <li> Would totally recommend this amazing product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s filled to the very brim.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the free samples that came with the product.</li>
            <li> I do not know where all the great reviews came from, but this is garbage a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not only is the product amazing</li>
            <li> I also received free samples of other products with my order and all were outstanding!</li>
            <li> Works better than the lip scrub from lush</li>
            <li> I love that this product is 100% all natural, it contains no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> So I decided to take the lush and put it on top of the diva and then rub my lips together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my dark spots from scars; I think it&#x27;s kind of working so far.. and smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Smells and tastes good but did not really do anything for my lips.  </li>
            <li> And the company was cute enough to send me some free samples.</li>
            <li> love how it&#x27;s made with all natural</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more when I run out and also very cool that it comes with other samples :)!</li>
            <li> this lip scrub works very well and is fun to use!</li>
            <li> So much better than i expected, i have had to give these as gifts to my friends since they also love it so much!</li>
            <li> but you have to put Chapstick or lip gloss on right away because your lips will feel like sand paper if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It had just the right amount of exfoliating power.</li>
            <li> It is edible, but I didn&#x27;t buy this to eat it, am I right?</li>
            <li> So easy and fun to use, makes my lips feel soft and plump.</li>
            <li> So much better and more affordable than comparable lip scrubs, from companies such as Lush.  </li>
            <li> i have a big issue with my lips getting chapped especially in the winters and its hard to put on a nice lipstick but after using this it&#x27;s been perfect.</li>
            <li> Which was disappointing because so many people said they loved i!</li>
            <li> I would definitely say that some of the reviews are misleading though, the smell isn&#x27;t very strong, and there isn&#x27;t too much of a taste.</li>
            <li> 1/4 ounce didn&#x27;t sound like much, but you get a nice little tub.  </li>
            <li> Way better than Sugar scrub that smells gross and way over priced.</li>
            <li> That absolutely made my day!</li>
            <li> Looks much more smaller than the picture, and I don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience purchasing something by Diva Stuff</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and tastes like cake!</li>
            <li> Arrived today by mail, was exited to open and it came wrapped on a plastic that was to oily, the smell was ok, but the product was just too greasy a</li>
            <li> Just used for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> but it does work so no room to really complain!</li>
            <li> This scrub mades my lips smooth and soft after a first try.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have the most stubborn dead skin spots on my bottom lip, and yet this takes them off in the most gentle way.</li>
            <li> Better than the various scrubs from Sephora that I tried!</li>
            <li> just like Cake Batter says her lips are soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Comes exactly as shown in picture so no complaints here</li>
            <li> Left my lips smooth and it smells just like cake batter!</li>
            <li> and I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> so make sure you only use it  on your lips.</li>
            <li> It came in half the time they said it would and they included a free lip balm, face scrub, and coupon for more.</li>
            <li> This lip scrub arrived pretty quickly, &amp; I was also happy to find a few free samples of some of Diva Stuffs other products!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and make my lips smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I also like that the product does not dry out easily.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling that despite my love of using it this one will last a while as one does not need much, - unless you eat it for dessert.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cost effective alternative to lush, look no further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Fresh Sugar lip treatment, Elf lip exfoliator, and many other lip products</li>
            <li> My lips are usually pretty chapped and this doesn&#x27;t take much of the chapped skin off, if any.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I found Diva Stuff, &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try other products!</li>
            <li> Plus the little sprinkles inside are a cute touch!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Diva Stuff Lip Scrubs I have gotten - I no longer have to worry about them getting dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you moisturize well after because sugar does dry out skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of other lip scrubs (which cost a lot more), and Diva Stuff&#x27;s is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> Honestly I would have been a little freaked out if it was like straight up frosting.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really really greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the sprinkles in it</li>
            <li> I really do recommend</li>
            <li> The Lip  Scrubbie doesn&#x27;t taste so much like cake batter</li>
            <li> Tastes yummy, works well - highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, and the tub is packed.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it do a fantastic job of exfoliating but it tastes like cake.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, really.</li>
            <li> It tastes good at least.</li>
            <li> the sent is nice and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The Dr. told us not to use a scrub of any kind because it would be too harsh and could cause damage.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very cute pink envelope with two little free samples.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product because I heard other people rave about it.</li>
            <li> I may try some other products to see if I like those better.</li>
            <li> I have used lip scrubs in the past and liked them, but I really like the scent/taste of this one.  </li>
            <li> I have lips that get dry easily</li>
            <li> its really good if you have chapped lips, only 4 stars because in the picture it looks way bigger and it is actually only 2 fingers wide if you put your fingers on the top.</li>
            <li> Works great to soften my lips when they&#x27;re dry removing the dead skin.</li>
            <li> It was cool because I only ordered this</li>
            <li> Because lush is super dry sugar and diva scrub is super greasy.</li>
            <li> I dab it on, rub my lips together and most of the sugar dissolves, I lick what is left off and there is still a very moisturizing type balm left on my lips.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I add balm on top just because I can never get enough but just leaving it might be enough for done.</li>
            <li> I find this well worth the money only because I&#x27;m too lazy to make my own.</li>
            <li> I use  high end lipsticks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it.</li>
            <li> I also suggest stirring it up a little before using it for better taste.</li>
            <li> and it really makes your lips soft.</li>
            <li> This company seems very customer service oriented, the packaging came with an email to contact the company directly if you have any problems.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t go to waste though :)</li>
            <li> It was too sweet and didn&#x27;t remove dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It makes your lips so soft!</li>
            <li> but this stuff fixed it up in one application!</li>
            <li> The fact that they use all natural ingredients is a plus!  </li>
            <li> and you only need a tiny bit for a full result.</li>
            <li> But it smells nice and sweet and doesn&#x27;t taste horrible, so that is what matter most there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very decent product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Takes all the dry and dead skin right off your lips and makes them look and feel smooth</li>
            <li> It tastes yummy, is all natural, and gets my lips soft and smooooth.</li>
            <li> and leaves your lips feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Go to Lush, and get their lip scrub.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old LOVES this stuff.</li>
            <li> Iy made my lips soft and the taste was addicting</li>
            <li> Very grainy and can be too much to me, I feel if you use sugar mixed with a cream you like will do the same.</li>
            <li> also it moisturizes your lips alot and makes them feel soft.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my lips extremely soft all day.</li>
            <li> makes my lips so soft and feel revived.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s have a soft oily finish</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and my lips are so soft all day.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh in any way.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> AND MADE MY LIPS SOOOO SOFT #CakeBatter ....</li>
            <li> I was originally turned off by the see through packaging, it looked a little cheap and childish but the reviews made me order anyway.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed off the sugar it felt like I had put on lip balm and my mouth tasted sweet for for a few hours.</li>
            <li> It gets all those flaky dry patches of skin right off my lips, revealing smoother, softer, plumped up lips instantly.</li>
            <li> Really helps my lips in the winter time when they tend to get really dry.  </li>
            <li> I finally found a reasonably price lip scrub that actually relieves my chapped lips!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, I can&#x27;t say that for most of the products out there today!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched long and hard and spent big bucks at large retail stores, even tried to make my own at home.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh and it is the only thing to keep her lips moist throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have dry or cracked lips.</li>
            <li> Great flavor, the sugar crystals aren&#x27;t too rough and a little goes a very long way so this little vial will last a long time!</li>
            <li> If I use it before I go to sleep especially after wearing the dreaded liquid lipsticks, I wipe down gently with a washcloth to remove granular residue and leave some of the oil.</li>
            <li> The packaging my scrub came in was black with a white lid and very sleek looking.</li>
            <li> I was also very surprised when it arrived an entire week earlier than I expected it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this and all the other diva stuff products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lip exfoliator, my lips chap like crazy and this gets rid of the dead skin and moisturizes the lips.</li>
            <li> My lips were super chapped and peeling due to me being sick and it made them 90% better.</li>
            <li> I have been using lush and lush  is a little pricey at times!</li>
            <li> The problem is I was looking g for something a little less pricey, and that I could actually get without paying so much for shipping as well.</li>
            <li> The little letter you get with it gives you a direct email address to contact if their is any problem and encourages you to contact them if there is.</li>
            <li> The product is a bit smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I expected the lip scrub to be MUCH smaller</li>
            <li> Also, the size of the jar was much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> but I am open to giving their other products a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranae</li>
            <li> The product will last long enough even with heavy use.</li>
            <li> And cause them to dry</li>
            <li> It did not even scrub my lips after use my lips were still dry.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I reply like that it&#x27;s natural and small company</li>
            <li> And the size is so big when you consider that you only need a little dab for every use!</li>
            <li> On the plus side it shipped in half the time expected and came with an extra gift.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Lush lip scrubs, as well as any other beauty products.</li>
            <li> So I crack the little jar open and put it on</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit, a smidgen, a dabble -just</li>
            <li> But the other lip scrub was in a different container and taped shut not sealed and it looked like it was half used..</li>
            <li> So I open the package jump up and down with excitement!</li>
            <li> I was in awe at how crazy smooth and moisturized</li>
            <li> Just received my lip scrub today, shipping was one week faster than expected.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never tried any other type</li>
            <li> Other companies may have fancy photos and lots of advertising</li>
            <li> Along with my 4 other LIP scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , my only problem is that I have to wash my face after because some of the oil in the product lingers around my mouth :/</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first to buy this</li>
            <li> It is small enough to toss in her purse and go.</li>
            <li> and afterwards I didn&#x27;t even need a lip balm because it left this residue, that was oddly, wry moisturizing!!</li>
            <li> , my only complaint is that I kept reading reviews that people got samples and stuff</li>
            <li> Very small quantity is required, feels like this will last for months!</li>
            <li> Gets rid of dead skin like any other product.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 4 rating because it does taste odd.</li>
            <li> Just odd.</li>
            <li> It can be done in 5 minutes or less while watching TV.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this after some glowing reviews, but I am not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cute company and also sent little samples of other items!</li>
            <li> If you use just a pea size or a little less and scrub away the dry/dead skin this product is quite efficient.</li>
            <li> The scent and taste is a little like Lip Smackers</li>
            <li> Scrubbie was a little slippery/sticky when it arrived....</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of a  &amp;#34;vaseliny&amp;#34; taste but it smells and tastes a lot like cake batter.</li>
            <li> But their is one thing I don&#x27;t like about it, after I apply it to my lips it leaves my fingers greasy and when I rinse it off my lips it leave my mouth a little greasy</li>
            <li> greasy messy and petroleum feeling.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t take any dead skin off my lips.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Came with two little samples (shh!)</li>
            <li> Ect.. the chemicals are way to harsh on my lips!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I am supposed to wipe it off or let it sit though.</li>
            <li> I used mine once and it is hard not to eat it</li>
            <li> The packaging makes the product hard to get out.</li>
            <li> It has not lived up to that expectation in the least.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be somewhat waxy because of the ingredients but the product seemed to mosturize my lips without the thick waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly taste like it, but it by no means tastes bad!</li>
            <li> product itself is small but it lasts!</li>
            <li> I mean if you&#x27;re into eating beauty products indulge yourself if you wish.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t receive all the extra things like everyone else :(</li>
            <li> Its still a little cold where I am at</li>
            <li> It is sort of like chapstick in that it leaves behind a hint of a flavor.</li>
            <li> That was the only annoying part of this experience</li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting after, but it does make your lips really soft.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad scoop or batch</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know where I went wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now obsessed with this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about it being edible, I was a bit scared to try it</li>
            <li> Sorry about that.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this scrub!</li>
            <li> I feel like all diva products are flashy junk.</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> But personally I think it tastes terrible, reminded me of the fake makeup lip balms I had as a kid.  </li>
            <li> Addicted!</li>
            <li> and it kinda smells weird</li>
            <li> I am weird about any lip glosses or chapsticks because they often have a weird taste.</li>
            <li> Had a weird smell in the package, like some perfumed wax spilled on it, but I just wiped it off and got over it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend for his dry lips and he is very unhappy to put this stuff on!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on diva crap!</li>
            <li> My lips were peeling and cracking from the cold northern weather-</li>
            <li> Hate it on my lips- hard to get off!!</li>
            <li> Tisk tisk putting all these fake reviews on this crap.</li>
            <li> Bad product.</li>
            <li> cake batter was disgustingly greasy and there are chunks of a Vaseline like substance in it.....</li>
            <li> but it is disgusting.....</li>
            <li> This lip scrub was horrible</li>
            <li> The sugar melted instantly,the container was broke and the taste was horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is amazing it taste soooo good and smells just like cake batter! It makes your lips so soft! I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I love this lip scrub! It smells and tastes amazing, makes my lips super soft before applying my lipstick. Way better than Sugar scrub that smells gross and way over priced. Would totally recommend this amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very decent product, especially for the price. It has a wonderful smell to it, as well as flavor. I usually use Lush lip scrubs, as well as any other beauty products. The problem is I was looking g for something a little less pricey, and that I could actually get without paying so much for shipping as well. I cannot say I will never buy another lush lip scrub again, but I am very pleased with this product. It works almost if not just as well as theirs. It does the job and I loved that they sent a sample face scrub and lip balm with it. I absolutely adore the lip balm, it is a wonderful scent, and keeps my lips nice and smooth. If you use just a pea size or a little less and scrub away the dry/dead skin this product is quite efficient. My lips have been very happy and smooth. I was also very surprised when it arrived an entire week earlier than I expected it. That absolutely made my day!</li>
            <li> Looks much more smaller than the picture, and I don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> This thing is greasy and make my lips dries and sicks ,I don&#x27;t like and I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> this lip scrub works very well and is fun to use! it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;vanilla&amp;#34; flavor, vs cake batter, but it still yummy, nonetheless! the only downside is that i need to remember to use it BEFORE brushing my teeth, as it IS an edible sugar scrub!!! i love diva stuff! :)</li>
            <li> Feels really nice and made my lips soft!</li>
            <li> Love this! My lips are always so smooth after using this! I&#x27;ve searched long and hard and spent big bucks at large retail stores, even tried to make my own at home. Don&#x27;t know where I went wrong. But anyway, this stuff is the shiz. It tastes yummy, is all natural, and gets my lips soft and smooooth. A must have!</li>
            <li> Such a great product! I&#x27;m now obsessed with this brand. I also received free samples of other products with my order and all were outstanding! Will be buying from this seller again and I highly recommend this and all the other diva stuff products!</li>
            <li> Sweet and wonderful lip scrub that really works.</li>
            <li> Tastes great, obviously, its a sugar scrub, but really wasn&#x27;t great at removing the dry skin on my lips..won&#x27;t go to waste though :)</li>
            <li> This lib scrub is amazing.  Tastes &amp; feels fantastic and has helped with my chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I would definitely say that some of the reviews are misleading though, the smell isn&#x27;t very strong, and there isn&#x27;t too much of a taste. It is sort of like chapstick in that it leaves behind a hint of a flavor. Honestly I would have been a little freaked out if it was like straight up frosting. The consistency is perfect in my opinion. It sort of scratches your lips, making them smooth afterwards. I keep this at my desk and rub my lips together all day, I love it.</li>
            <li> tastes/smells so good. and leaves your lips feeling soft.</li>
            <li> it does wonders I absolutely love it be it</li>
            <li> I love this. I get cracked lips and I love lip scrubs, but this is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve had as far as leaving them moisturized. I would guess it has coconut oil?</li>
            <li> Received it today and I like it already. My lips were super chapped and peeling due to me being sick and it made them 90% better. But I didn&#x27;t receive all the extra things like everyone else :(</li>
            <li> Just received my lip scrub today, shipping was one week faster than expected. The product itself is wonderful, tastes so good and my lips feel very smooth and moisturized. Plus it came with a sample of cuticle lotion and an overnight lip treatment. Would recommend this to anyone looking for lip exfoliator</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this scrub. It tastes divine- &amp; I reply like that it&#x27;s natural and small company based- I will be buying more from this company! Did I mention it tastes delicious?! Love it! Thanks</li>
            <li> Enjoy the texture and consistency of the scrub. Not a fan of the taste though! Good product but could use better flavoring!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to receive this lip scrub and I wasn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s decent. I could definitely smell the cake batter but the taste I wasn&#x27;t too fond of it. I&#x27;m skeptical about it being edible, I was a bit scared to try it so I just wiped it off when I was finished. Overall, I did like it, it did its job~</li>
            <li> greasy messy and petroleum feeling.  gross.  Make your own. Go to Brambleberry.com and learn how.  SO cheap.. So much better</li>
            <li> I got this faster than I was informed and I used it and love it it tastes great and gives my lips a little shine I also used it on my daughter she loves it as well I will be getting more😀</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of other lip scrubs (which cost a lot more), and Diva Stuff&#x27;s is just as good if not better. Their Cake Batter smells (and tastes) delicious, and it does a wonderful job of exfoliating my lips. Definitely will be ordering from this line from now on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Works good, feels good, smells good,  perfect lip scrub.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. So easy and fun to use, makes my lips feel soft and plump. Tastes and smells so amazing. Good thing to have.</li>
            <li> Bad product. Used this product on my lips and it was basically vasaline. Does not do anything for your lips but make them greasy as hell. Go to Lush, and get their lip scrub.</li>
            <li> I absolutely  love it and the flavor  is so yummy!!</li>
            <li> My lips are soft and sweet! YUM!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very cute pink envelope with two little free samples. The lip scrub plastic was a bit greasy but nothing overwhelming - a quick dab of a tissue eliminated that. The product is a bit smaller than I expected but it&#x27;s filled to the very brim. Smells good, works wonderfully, nice price and - they gave me a discount for my next order! How sweet! DivaStuff, you have made me a permanent customer. :)</li>
            <li> I like it and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> This lip scrub definitely exfoliates and doesn&#x27;t have the gross taste of oil.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well and is cute, but does not taste like Cake Batter, it tastes like pure vaseline. I bought it for my boyfriend for his dry lips and he is very unhappy to put this stuff on!</li>
            <li> Its nice.  Nice moisture and softness after you use it. I gave this product a 4 rating because it does taste odd. Not bad. Just odd. But for the price its nice!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells and tastes so good. I use it everyday. Highly recommended if you have dry or cracked lips. I am from the desert and this has made a huge difference for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Works better than the lip scrub from lush</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Tastes good and moisturizes well! The sprinkles are a cute touch as well!</li>
            <li> I love the lip scrub, but most of all, I loved all the samples included in my package. I will be ordering again soon!</li>
            <li> removes all dryness from my lips and smells lovely</li>
            <li> OOPS I mixed up my reviews, if you read the one for the eyecream by Diva stuff, that one was meant to be about this product. So I will review the eye cream on here I love that one as well and no I did NOT taste the eyecream. Sorry about that.</li>
            <li> It was cool because I only ordered this but I also got another lip scrub and a face cream for free also. But the other lip scrub was in a different container and taped shut not sealed and it looked like it was half used.. I just threw it away but the cake lip batter scrubbie was amazing.</li>
            <li> I had hoped this scrub  would work as well as the mint scrub that used to be available at bath and body works.  It has not lived up to that expectation in the least.  It tastes good at least.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff!  This was my first experience purchasing something by Diva Stuff and I was so impressed that I searched and purchased more of their products.  It smells and works great.  I have used lip scrubs in the past and liked them, but I really like the scent/taste of this one.  It makes my lips soft and moisturized.  I also appreciated the free samples that came with the product.</li>
            <li> I am  in love with this lip scrub!  This is by far one of the best lip scrubs I have ever had.  I am addicted to this scrub! It gets all those flaky dry patches of skin right off my lips, revealing smoother, softer, plumped up lips instantly. Also, it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells like a sweet treat and tastes like one as well!  I love that this product is 100% all natural, it contains no harmful chemicals. So when you lick your lips &amp; get some of the scrub in your mouth,  you can be rest assured that you are not unwittingly ingesting harmful chemicals. Sadly, I can&#x27;t say that for most of the products out there today!  This lip scrub arrived pretty quickly, &amp; I was also happy to find a few free samples of some of Diva Stuffs other products! I am thrilled that I found Diva Stuff, &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try other products!</li>
            <li> cake batter was disgustingly greasy and there are chunks of a Vaseline like substance in it..... Not sure if I got a bad scoop or batch but it is disgusting..... Which was disappointing because so many people said they loved i! And my free Chapstick while I hear people rave about the product it was in root beer flavor so I passed it along to someone else.....</li>
            <li> I love DIva products. This one makes me want to use it every night. It really is ediable, sweet tasting, fun and does a nice the job of gentle lip exfoliation. I have a feeling that despite my love of using it this one will last a while as one does not need much, - unless you eat it for dessert. Delicious and good for your lips! Thank you for great products, Diva!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product because I heard other people rave about it. So I ordered and well it never showed up. So I contacted the seller and she promptly sent me a refund and mailed me two more no charge! So I open the package jump up and down with excitement! I have been using lush and lush  is a little pricey at times! So I hoped this would be a great alternative! So I crack the little jar open and put it on and it&#x27;s greasy. Really really greasy. I could tell the sugar was not going to buff out all the chapped skin I get on my lips! I use  high end lipsticks Mac lipsticks, Chanel, Dior. Ect.. the chemicals are way to harsh on my lips! And cause them to dry out!anyway!  So I decided to take the lush and put it on top of the diva and then rub my lips together. The combo was good! Because lush is super dry sugar and diva scrub is super greasy. It made a great combo! So I will use them together. To make the ultimate lipscrub! This was my experience using the diva scrub. I may try some other products to see if I like those better. I won&#x27;t buy the scrubs again but I am open to giving their other products a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranae</li>
            <li> Smells great, wonderful lip rejuvinator</li>
            <li> i love this lip scrub.  a little goes a long way.  plus, a sample of the coconut milk and peaches lip balm was included...oh goodness is it wonderful.</li>
            <li> Does this stuff smell great hell yes it does! Does it work I don&#x27;t think so! Tisk tisk putting all these fake reviews on this crap. I feel like all diva products are flashy junk. They all smell great but NONE OF THEM ARE WORTH ANYTHING! This will be the last thing I buy from them. I&#x27;m only giving this three stars because after you take Forever to come off your lips, you lips shine but you have to put Chapstick or lip gloss on right away because your lips will feel like sand paper if you don&#x27;t. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on diva crap! None of it is worth anything!!!</li>
            <li> its really cute and theyre so nice and they give you samples which is way better and the shipping was on time. and the cake batter smells so good. deffinetly should buy</li>
            <li> I just received my lip scrub yesterday and I can&#x27;t stop putting it on my lips! Im in love with how it makes my lips feel and smell! Definitely enjoyed the added samples that came with it! I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Makes your lips smooth and clean. One of the best scrubs I have had. Love the smell and the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It smells and tastes so yummy and it really makes your lips soft. I have lips that get dry easily so this product has defintely helped.</li>
            <li> The scrub is amazing, rubs off the dry skin and tastes amazing. I figured you can make it at home and still have the same results.</li>
            <li> love it so much! the boyfriend even likes it! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cute company and also sent little samples of other items! I will be back!</li>
            <li> I got my package extremely quick and I love it. It&#x27;s kind of sticky however. I also suggest stirring it up a little before using it for better taste. I don&#x27;t really like the sprinkles in it but it&#x27;s a cute idea. All around a good product though, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Diva Stuff Lip Scrubs I have gotten - I no longer have to worry about them getting dry and cracked.  Love the experience of using the product and lips look and feel way better after using.  Also make awesome gifts!</li>
            <li> I love the smell can&#x27;t wait to try this (:</li>
            <li> Loveee the taste and smell of this product!! I was expecting it to be somewhat waxy because of the ingredients but the product seemed to mosturize my lips without the thick waxy feeling. I loved the free samples they smell wounderfull. I will defenitly be buying more diva stuff</li>
            <li> It was too sweet and didn&#x27;t remove dry skin. I also ordered one and was charged for two. Not happy!</li>
            <li> Overall it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.. But personally I think it tastes terrible, reminded me of the fake makeup lip balms I had as a kid.  And usually I love everything cupcake flavored/scented.  On the plus side it shipped in half the time expected and came with an extra gift.  My extra was \\&quot;even steven facial moisturizer\\&quot; says it&#x27;s skin lightening and anti aging.. I&#x27;ve been using it on my dark spots from scars; I think it&#x27;s kind of working so far.. and smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Smells and tastes good but did not really do anything for my lips.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Diva Stuff Lip Scrubbies are amazing. They work well at exfoliating and leaving lips kissably smooth. All the flavors are amazing.</li>
            <li> love this and the free samples</li>
            <li> I used mine once and it is hard not to eat it it smells and tastes great</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I just got it and had to try it. Tastes awesome and my lips feel so good. Plus I got a free sample. Yay!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old LOVES this stuff. Great gift idea for all ages. I love the cinnamon/clove combo, too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping and tastes like cake!</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well as a scrub and the smell is great. Edible for sure, but not the best tasting! Lol. Still, great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice, it doesn&#x27;t smell like I thought it would. The scent reminds me of something I can&#x27;t put my finger one, it&#x27;s nice, but it isn&#x27;t cake batter to me at all. But it smells nice and sweet and doesn&#x27;t taste horrible, so that is what matter most there. I didn&#x27;t plan on licking it off lol that seemed weird, but it is actually very effective. I dab it on, rub my lips together and most of the sugar dissolves, I lick what is left off and there is still a very moisturizing type balm left on my lips. It also came with a banana chap stick and banana face scrubie. The chap stick, is soft and smells great. I haven&#x27;t tried the face scrubie out yet, but I&#x27;m very excited to. This company seems very customer service oriented, the packaging came with an email to contact the company directly if you have any problems. I would also like to add that the packaging is totally different from the picture. I was originally turned off by the see through packaging, it looked a little cheap and childish but the reviews made me order anyway. The packaging my scrub came in was black with a white lid and very sleek looking. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this after some glowing reviews, but I am not impressed at all. This smells like yummy cake batter, but it just tastes like petroleum jelly with sugar and doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize at all. Zero stars would be more accurate! Boo.</li>
            <li> Not only does the lip balm taste great and feel fantastic, the service was phenomenal. It came in half the time they said it would and they included a free lip balm, face scrub, and coupon for more. The little letter you get with it gives you a direct email address to contact if their is any problem and encourages you to contact them if there is. The scent and taste is a little like Lip Smackers but I&#x27;ve never tried any other type so I couldn&#x27;t tell you if this is just an unavoidable taste. Overall the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and don&#x27;t let the cheap-ish looking picture deter you. Other companies may have fancy photos and lots of advertising but they cost about 10 dollars more and probably work just as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok, dries my lips ore than anything. Was hoping for a better product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff!!! Not greasy and tastes great. Bought 2 more for my daughters. Plan on keeping this product  on my &amp;#34; must have&amp;#34;list.</li>
            <li> Works great to soften my lips when they&#x27;re dry removing the dead skin. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> It taste good and scrubs dead skins out of your lips :)</li>
            <li> Scrubs and moisturizes the lips effectively! Smells delicious! Very small quantity is required, feels like this will last for months!</li>
            <li> I do not know where all the great reviews came from, but this is garbage a waste of money. Its just sugar and Vaseline that&#x27;s it, had no \\&quot;cake batter\\&quot; taste or smell to it. It did not even scrub my lips after use my lips were still dry.  The one star Is for shipping as it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Great ! Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do ! I really do recommend</li>
            <li> Makes your lips nice and soft</li>
            <li> Great lip scrub, smells like funfetti cake mix!! Smooths lips and moisturizers.. Addicted!</li>
            <li> Very helpful with dry lips and tastes great!</li>
            <li> I have just received my package containing Diva Stuff&#x27;s Edible Eatable Lip Scrubbie in the flavor Cake Batter. I love it , with some of the reviews saying it was like Vaseline I was a little skeptical but it is amazing. The Lip  Scrubbie doesn&#x27;t taste so much like cake batter but more like a sugar cookie. Still tastes really good to lick of your lips. My free samples were a Cantaloupe Face Cream  and Night Repair Lip mask in the flavor Watermelon. Have not yet tried theses but I am very excited to! I definitely would order from here again. It arrived 2 days before the last day it was supposed to come.The container for the lip Scrubbie was a little slippery/sticky when it arrived.... but maybe that&#x27;s because my mail lady THREW IY ON MY PORCH!! That was the only annoying part of this experience and it did not involve Diva Stuff. Overall 5 star rating!😃</li>
            <li> Arrived today by mail, was exited to open and it came wrapped on a plastic that was to oily, the smell was ok, but the product was just too greasy a it didn&#x27;t work on my lips they feel the same. Would not recommend or buy again.</li>
            <li> I finally found a reasonably price lip scrub that actually relieves my chapped lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is small but it lasts! I use it once or twice a day and you only need a tiny bit for a full result. Not to mention, it is adorable — and smells and tastes absolutely delicious, just like cake batter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not a bad word about this product. By the way, it is also came with a bunch of cute samples that I loved playing with. So please, Miss Diva Stuff, NEVER stop making this product ever. It is a heavensent!</li>
            <li> The cake batter scub is yummy!  Really helps my lips in the winter time when they tend to get really dry.  Tastes pretty good too!</li>
            <li> Great product! Great deal for a quality scrub. Iy made my lips soft and the taste was addicting lol</li>
            <li> This lip scrub was horrible it didn&#x27;t take any dead skin off my lips. The sugar melted instantly,the container was broke and the taste was horrible don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> This lip scrub feels great on my lips, smells great, and is quick and easy to do every week. My lips have never looked or felt better! I&#x27;ve tried Fresh Sugar lip treatment, Elf lip exfoliator, and many other lip products but this is my favorite! It can be done in 5 minutes or less while watching TV. It is easy to wipe off but is tempting to eat it! Yum! This is worth trying!</li>
            <li> Just used for the first time yesterday.  Tastes great on my lips and does a great job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and it stays on my lips feeling soft</li>
            <li> This is awesome and it taste great too lol!</li>
            <li> Works great to exfoliate dry lips and leaves them moisturized!</li>
            <li> Doesnt have the best taste but it does work so no room to really complain!</li>
            <li> Very grainy and can be too much to me, I feel if you use sugar mixed with a cream you like will do the same.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME!!! :) I just used it, &amp; my lips are nice &amp; soft! I would HIGHLY recommend this!!! Plus, it smells DELICIOUS!!! :)</li>
            <li> I abosoletly love this lip scrub I plan on getting the bubble gum one when I run out. This scrub mades my lips smooth and soft after a first try. Its still a little cold where I am at and my lips were beyond chapped and this saved them. Its taste and smells so good I got a mini sample ChapStick in asian pear and it smells so good, beyond good. I want to order that also. I recommended all the products I order to my friends and on beautylish.</li>
            <li> So much better than i expected, i have had to give these as gifts to my friends since they also love it so much! Tastes yummy, works well - highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this scrub!! It had just the right amount of exfoliating power. If I use it before makeup it exfoliates perfectly. If I use it before I go to sleep especially after wearing the dreaded liquid lipsticks, I wipe down gently with a washcloth to remove granular residue and leave some of the oil. I add balm on top just because I can never get enough but just leaving it might be enough for done.</li>
            <li> The lip scrub is delicious! It&#x27;s not the best &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; though. My lips are usually pretty chapped and this doesn&#x27;t take much of the chapped skin off, if any. HOWEVER I gave it a four star rating because after using the scrub, I find my lips are much more moisturized. And the company was cute enough to send me some free samples. Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cost effective alternative to lush, look no further.</li>
            <li> So much better and more affordable than comparable lip scrubs, from companies such as Lush.  They come in so many yummy flavors and really work to exfoliate and moisturize your lips.  I also like that the product does not dry out easily.  Plus the little sprinkles inside are a cute touch!</li>
            <li> Tastes disgusting after, but it does make your lips really soft.</li>
            <li> Taste great and exfoliates lips well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but isn&#x27;t tasty as it said would be and it kinda smells weird</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!&lt;br /&gt;It only took 2 days for it to come in the mail. Along with my 4 other LIP scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients!!&lt;br /&gt;It has already worked!</li>
            <li> nice lips scrub.  the sent is nice and not too heavy.  It did just what it is supposed to do, exfoliate my lips.  the oil in it gave it a nice moisture treatment, too.  It doesn&#x27;t take much, and the tub is packed.  1/4 ounce didn&#x27;t sound like much, but you get a nice little tub.  I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Yummy way to exfoliate your lips! Rub it on with you finger, then rub your lips together, eventually lick the remaining sugar.</li>
            <li> this is really good and it is full to the very top! they also give you great samples of the other products they sell. the cake batter one smell amazing an tastes great also it moisturizes your lips alot and makes them feel soft. its really good if you have chapped lips, only 4 stars because in the picture it looks way bigger and it is actually only 2 fingers wide if you put your fingers on the top.</li>
            <li> Smells and tastes so yummy! I am weird about any lip glosses or chapsticks because they often have a weird taste. This exfoliates so well! And the size is so big when you consider that you only need a little dab for every use!</li>
            <li> This is the lip scrub I&#x27;ve always dreamed off. I have the most stubborn dead skin spots on my bottom lip, and yet this takes them off in the most gentle way. Better than the various scrubs from Sephora that I tried!</li>
            <li> This is my first lip scrub and I love it!  Great flavor, the sugar crystals aren&#x27;t too rough and a little goes a very long way so this little vial will last a long time! Taste is nice and I can really tell a difference in my lips with usage!  I use it about once a week!</li>
            <li> love love love the smell the feel</li>
            <li> I expected the lip scrub to be MUCH smaller then it was it was a good size and I got two free samples and it came quickly and I got the flavor &amp;#34;blue rock candy&amp;#34; and it tastes great and my lips have never been smoother.</li>
            <li> Smells and tastes great but I prefer a rougher exfoliant. The packaging makes the product hard to get out.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this stuff is AMAZING! It smells just like cake batter! It doesn&#x27;t exactly taste like it, but it by no means tastes bad! The most important thing though, it that it does WONDERS for your lips! My lips were peeling and cracking from the cold northern weather- but this stuff fixed it up in one application! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sons girl friend who happens to love the real Cake says this smells  just like Cake Batter says her lips are soft and smooth she was Happy so i was too.</li>
            <li> The lip scrub works pretty good. Looking into more of their product. They just might have a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> Works Pretty!! smells yummy too!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different lip scrubs and Diva Stuff is definitely my favorite. I have tried many different flavors but this one is my favorite and it just smells sooo good that I want to eat it all! I use it once a day and it keeps my lips extremely soft all day. Not only is the product amazing but the price is great too! Cant wait to buy more to gift to family and friends!</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of a  &amp;#34;vaseliny&amp;#34; taste but it smells and tastes a lot like cake batter. Love it!</li>
            <li> Because this scrub uses sugar as the exfoliate and sugar (I found out later), when left on the lips - even for a short amount of time - can cause canker sores, this stuff gave me four sores that still haven&#x27;t healed after two weeks. Also, the size of the jar was much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> smells and taste like cake batter. makes my lips so soft and feel revived. its quick easy and fun. i dont know what girl wouldnt like it. another good product from diva stuff</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes so good! It does what it&#x27;s supposed to while being yummy, my only problem is that I have to wash my face after because some of the oil in the product lingers around my mouth :/</li>
            <li> Has a great taste and makes your lips very soft. Not sure if I am supposed to wipe it off or let it sit though.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Not only does it do a fantastic job of exfoliating but it tastes like cake. Doesn&#x27;t get better than that right! I&#x27;m planning to order more as gifts.</li>
            <li> It scrubbed my lips so well and afterwards I didn&#x27;t even need a lip balm because it left this residue, that was oddly, wry moisturizing!! Plus, it tastes so good and I love the sprinkles inside!</li>
            <li> this stuff is alright , dosnt work as great as i thought and doesnt taste wonderfull but im not realy dissapointed or stoked on this product</li>
            <li> tastes great and it works! I love it! Recommend it to all!</li>
            <li> Bought it for girlfriend she liked it</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeeeeeee this lip scrub. My first time using anything like this &amp; its awesome!!!!! And it tastes great.</li>
            <li> This Lip Scrub is Amazing!!!! I was in awe at how crazy smooth and moisturized it left my lips. I would definitely purchase this again!!!</li>
            <li> have tried others but not compare to this one..it&#x27;s just the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and my search is over..it&#x27;s perfect:) It WORKS!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast which was great the the product was just ok. I feel that I could actually attempt to make my own lip scrub and come out with better results...</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like funfetti cake batter! Good size and works very well. Comes exactly as shown in picture so no complaints here, I really recommend this product, the smell alone sells it!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! Takes all the dry and dead skin right off your lips and makes them look and feel smooth</li>
            <li> Amazing , it&#x27;s scrub my lips very good and it&#x27;s have a soft oily finish</li>
            <li> Very cheap... says made of vegetable oil, but cheap greasy vasoline, probably!  Hate it on my lips- hard to get off!!</li>
            <li> I saw my friend bought this $20 lip srub and I didn&#x27;t want to pay that much so I started to look for something cheaper. I was skeptical at first to buy this but so glad I did! I use it in the morning b4 I put my lip gloss on and it makes my lips super smooth I love this product! Definitely buying more when I run out and also very cool that it comes with other samples :)!</li>
            <li> Left my lips smooth and it smells just like cake batter! After I rinsed off the sugar it felt like I had put on lip balm and my mouth tasted sweet for for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Tastes great and make lips soft.</li>
            <li> So delicious and now my lips are smooth!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and make my lips smooth and soft. But their is one thing I don&#x27;t like about it, after I apply it to my lips it leaves my fingers greasy and when I rinse it off my lips it leave my mouth a little greasy so I use it before I wash my face or when I  take a shower. But in general this stuff works great and I will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Ok this stuff isn&#x27;t cheap but it&#x27;s really good! A little goes a long way. I use it in the morning and my lips are so soft all day. And it tastes really good. I will definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> this is the first lip scrub i used and so far i am loving it. i have a big issue with my lips getting chapped especially in the winters and its hard to put on a nice lipstick but after using this it&#x27;s been perfect.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It smells fantastic - almost good enough to eat.  My daughter is on actuate ( a strong acne medication) which leaves her lips peeling and bleeding from dryness. We have tried everything to no avail. Diva Stuff lip scrub is perfect. It is not harsh and it is the only thing to keep her lips moist throughout the day. The Dr. told us not to use a scrub of any kind because it would be too harsh and could cause damage. This is not the case for Diva Stuff lip scrub. It is not harsh in any way.  It is small enough to toss in her purse and go. I highly recommend using it. They offer tons of flavors. Also, their customer service is great and will help in any way they can. They will also offer advice on what to buy if you are deciding between products.</li>
            <li> Tastes delicious and really scrubbs the dead skin off</li>
            <li> I find this well worth the money only because I&#x27;m too lazy to make my own. It is edible, but I didn&#x27;t buy this to eat it, am I right? I mean if you&#x27;re into eating beauty products indulge yourself if you wish. You only need to use a little bit, a smidgen, a dabble -just a bit- for this to work well. Gets rid of dead skin like any other product. Make sure you moisturize well after because sugar does dry out skin. I find regular Burt&#x27;s Bees peppermint lip balm does the trick. Nothing fancy, really. The product will last long enough even with heavy use.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The fact that they use all natural ingredients is a plus!  And it smells and  taste great too! lol It made my lips feel nice,  smooth and refreshed.  I do plan on ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> I just revived this and have only used it twice. WOW. It smells good, tastes good and does its job. It does leave a bit of a oily residue so make sure you only use it  on your lips. Unless you don&#x27;t mind having a shiny chin.</li>
            <li> IT TASTE SOO GOOD AND MADE MY LIPS SOOOO SOFT #CakeBatter ....but the packaging came like greasy</li>
            <li> It tastes interesting, it made my lips smooth, my only complaint is that I kept reading reviews that people got samples and stuff and I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Really gets the dead skin off of your lips. Was looking for a lip scrub forever, DIY scrubs didn&#x27;t do the job. One application of this and my lips were baby smooth. This smells delicious, and tastes fairly okay! Had a weird smell in the package, like some perfumed wax spilled on it, but I just wiped it off and got over it. Came with two little samples (shh!) they&#x27;re very nice and I look forward to buying the full versions of them, if they sell those. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lip exfoliator, my lips chap like crazy and this gets rid of the dead skin and moisturizes the lips. I also use it as a before lipstick applicator since lipstick isn&#x27;t the kindest to my lips.</li>
