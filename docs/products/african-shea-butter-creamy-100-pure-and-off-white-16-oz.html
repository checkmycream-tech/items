            <li>and I think this is the best product I have found.  </li>
            <li>There is no smell which I love!!!</li>
            <li>the price is very good .   </li>
            <li>Very good for skin.  </li>
            <li>This is wonderful and great to use on the bottom of my feet.  </li>
            <li>Good price&lt;br /&gt;Too !</li>
            <li>So - I sent for this and have been happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Great communication, immediate shipping &amp; receipt.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality product&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>So if you are using it for a purpose where the aroma doesn&#x27;t matter, or you like the aroma, all is good.  </li>
            <li>It&lt;br /&gt;Makes a wonderful rich body butter.</li>
            <li>It must be really good because my physician husband, who washes his hands many times a day, stole some to take to his office!</li>
            <li>the shea butter texture is creamy and the smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>I am about to place another order right now!!!</li>
            <li>First of all, the seller is committed to great customer service.  </li>
            <li>The Shea Butter is very clean and came in a nice resealable container for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Superb white texture, no tell-tale smell.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>it and mix it with your favorite essential&lt;br /&gt;Oil.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more, again &amp; always :)</li>
            <li>I am about to buy some more.</li>
            <li>Yes the gold stuff smells, but it&#x27;s a lot better to use.</li>
            <li>This Shea Butter is refined and will arrive in a sealed bag and nothing more.</li>
            <li>Then you can transfer to your favorite container.   </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a quality refined shea butter and nothing more.</li>
            <li>The company seems to be more concerned with quantity (mass producing) over quality.</li>
            <li>infact despite baking soda and charcoal and bleach and sealed ziplocked bags, everything in my one fridge smells strongly of unrefined shea butter.  </li>
            <li>shea butter is unrefined and has all of its healing properties and is thus a better product if you are looking for the full value of a shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel smooth like silk.</li>
            <li>By the way, this seller (Nature &amp; Herbs)  was fabulous too-</li>
            <li>and I have found it very useful.  </li>
            <li>This Shea is absolute bliss &amp; far superior to any high-priced balms/salves.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I assumed that once I purchased the yellow product, I&#x27;d keep it whether I liked it or not.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Refined shea butter (white) is processed using chemicals, thus stripping the shea butter of its many healing properties.</li>
            <li>I find the white a bit more oily than the gold.  </li>
            <li>My family loves the white-their first choice.</li>
            <li>But, the gold african shea butter lasts for many hours.</li>
            <li>In the extremely hot temperatures, I put sunscreen on over it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.</li>
            <li>So much nicer!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I received it today, and like it so much better than the yellow.  </li>
            <li>It worked wonders on my feet with the first use.</li>
            <li>I also have read majority of the reviews on this product and the seller started using containers at first, then resealable bags, and now just a sealed bag (product must be transferred).</li>
            <li>the unrefined yellow was very good soft &amp; oily indeed, the white butter which is this one was more harder</li>
            <li>Pure bliss-</li>
            <li>The price is also pretty high for refined Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I have been using shea butter cream but wanted to use the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Where the cream (tan or light yellow) colored shea butter is unrefined.  </li>
            <li>The cream colored (sometimes light yellow)</li>
            <li>I really really like this product.</li>
            <li>This has really been a blessing for me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I have once gotten true, refined white Shea Butter from this dealer.  </li>
            <li>Twice now I have ordered this particular product and received material which I can not call &#x27;refined&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, the reason I only rated this product as Four Stars, because I know the quality could be better.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It leaves it stripped of its vitamins, minerals and many other natural healing properties.  </li>
            <li>The Shea Butter will be kind of hard and not really in a stage that you could apply directly to your skin smoothly.</li>
            <li>In contrast, this African White Shea, from Nature &amp; Herbs, comes in a plastic food tub, is a pale yellow color, and is dramatically smoother &amp; more buttery/easily melted when rubbed between hands, &amp; magically absorbs into skin.</li>
            <li>This white butter is absolutely heaven!</li>
            <li>It is a little greasier (at first) than my old cream, but absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Most other creams and lotions wear off in an hour or two and my skin is dry again.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they responded fast ; they sent me another package next day .     </li>
            <li>favorite way of using it after a few trials&lt;br /&gt;Of various recipes.</li>
            <li>It can be melted down a little and then whipped up with a blender to get a real smooth consistency.</li>

            <li>my pack was not sealed well ,so I received an empty container where the whole shea butter spoiled the shipment box .    </li>
            <li>I too am surprised that the seller didn&#x27;t mention that the white shea butter is refined shea butter.  </li>
            <li>This is a very heavy and thick shea butter and it does a nice job healing and sealing skin.  </li>

            <li> I too am surprised that the seller didn&#x27;t mention that the white shea butter is refined shea butter.  </li>
            <li> This is a very heavy and thick shea butter and it does a nice job healing and sealing skin.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the shipping cost, almost ten dollars, and I live in the same state as the distributor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they decided to discontinue the original product and only offer the newer \\&quot;organic\\&quot; type, which I had tried, and didn&#x27;t care for (texture and aroma).  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to get extremely dry (feet, legs)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised the seller doesn&#x27;t mention that when gold shea butter is turned into white shea butter it loses a lot of its healing properties.</li>
            <li> Try adding a little regular creme and&lt;br /&gt;Coconut or olive oil with petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> I still use regular Raw Shea Butter for my skin</li>
            <li> And, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t clash with any other scent I wear.</li>
            <li> This mixes well with other oils and butters.</li>
            <li> This shows me the quality has went down also and the price is not reasonable either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cold winter where I live in the Rocky Mountains, and this butter is essential to avoid leather skin!</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I had sampled \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Shea previously at a farmer&#x27;s market, the odour was intolerable (to us).</li>
            <li> it was very costly, &amp; \\&quot;granular\\&quot;- hard little grains in the Shea were difficult to melt &amp; rub into hands for application to the skin.</li>
            <li> It is also very creamy to apply, if it does not get cold.</li>
            <li> but OK , the refined yellow (with the box not with bag )was awful  very hard &amp;not fresh not applicable</li>
            <li> It comes in random sized chunks, is dirty greyish colored, and the aroma is very akin to the unrefined yellow.  </li>
            <li> I forgot to state that this Refined Shea Butter has No nutty or smoke smell, like Raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I had been using the well-known French label shea butter in the tin - which was expensive, but well-worth it.  </li>
            <li> with this product, because it came in the plastic bag, I was expecting it will come in some bottle, I lost a lot of it when I put it in the jar and is hard so it is hard to spread over body</li>
            <li> thick and smelly.  </li>
            <li> Going in &amp; out, from dry heated air, to cold dry air, the skin suffers.</li>
            <li> In Upstate NY (Syracuse), we hold numerous claims to infamy for bad weather...</li>
            <li> I was not very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> and I use this one as a base product for other things.   </li>
            <li> i did not like the expensive shipping.</li>
            <li> We use on hands, face, elbows, feet, wherever we need moisture &amp; protection from cold &amp; windburn.</li>
            <li> At this point I am very disappointed with this dealer and am not sure if I will purchase from them again</li>
            <li> I make lotion and lipgloss form my shea and have found it nearly impossible to mask the musky scent of this.  </li>
            <li> Snow &amp; frigid temps; no sunshine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Refined shea butter (white) is processed using chemicals, thus stripping the shea butter of its many healing properties. When chemically processed, it goes through a refining, bleaching, deodorization and degumming process, which destroys the shea butter. It leaves it stripped of its vitamins, minerals and many other natural healing properties.  The yellow is the only way to go to get all the benefits.</li>
            <li> I had been using the well-known French label shea butter in the tin - which was expensive, but well-worth it.  Unfortunately, they decided to discontinue the original product and only offer the newer \\&quot;organic\\&quot; type, which I had tried, and didn&#x27;t care for (texture and aroma).  So - I sent for this and have been happy with it.  It is a little greasier (at first) than my old cream, but absorbs quickly.  And - what a bargain!!</li>
            <li> I was not very impressed with this product. My skin is not any softer and doesn&#x27;t look any healthier after a month of use.</li>
            <li> First of all, the seller is committed to great customer service.  In regards to the product, I have tried both gold and white.  I find the white a bit more oily than the gold.  I agree, the white is odorless. My skin tends to get extremely dry (feet, legs) so my experience is that it takes a larger quantity of the white to moisturize, than it does for the gold.  My family loves the white-their first choice. However, mine is still the gold.  It makes your skin feel smooth like silk. And, a little goes a long way.  Most other creams and lotions wear off in an hour or two and my skin is dry again. But, the gold african shea butter lasts for many hours. In the extremely hot temperatures, I put sunscreen on over it. It is also very creamy to apply, if it does not get cold.</li>
            <li> thick and smelly.  my husband don&#x27;t like me using it .</li>
            <li> the shea butter texture is creamy and the smell is nice.  it is packed in a plastic container.  my pack was not sealed well ,so I received an empty container where the whole shea butter spoiled the shipment box .    I contacted the seller and they responded fast ; they sent me another package next day .     the price is very good .   Quality is same as L&#x27;Occitane Shea Butter which i used to buy .       defiantly i will buy this product again and again .</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product. It arrived ahead of schedule and was well-packaged to avoid \\&quot;squishing.\\&quot; This white butter is absolutely heaven! Superb white texture, no tell-tale smell. It&#x27;s a cold winter where I live in the Rocky Mountains, and this butter is essential to avoid leather skin! After it&#x27;s coated my hands, I run them through my hair for extra conditioning. It must be really good because my physician husband, who washes his hands many times a day, stole some to take to his office! I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> If you like Shea butter, but not the pungent&lt;br /&gt;Smoky smell of yellow Shea butter, then this&lt;br /&gt;Is for you. No smell, so you can use as is or&lt;br /&gt;Melt it and mix it with your favorite essential&lt;br /&gt;Oil. Try adding a little regular creme and&lt;br /&gt;Coconut or olive oil with petroleum jelly. It&lt;br /&gt;Makes a wonderful rich body butter. This is&lt;br /&gt;My favorite way of using it after a few trials&lt;br /&gt;Of various recipes. This is a good quality product&lt;br /&gt;And arrived in a timely fashion. Good price&lt;br /&gt;Too !</li>
            <li> This is shea butter and I love this stuff.  Very good for skin.  This product came like described and I have found it very useful.  If this is what you&#x27;re looking for, this is what you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li> African Shea Butter Cream (100% Pure &amp; White) 16 oz: Pure bliss- In Upstate NY (Syracuse), we hold numerous claims to infamy for bad weather... Snow &amp; frigid temps; no sunshine. Going in &amp; out, from dry heated air, to cold dry air, the skin suffers. My hands chapped &amp; bled, my daughter&#x27;s face (child) chapped &amp; was raw/painful. I&#x27;d had Shea from a cosmetic company in a tin last year- it was very costly, &amp; \\&quot;granular\\&quot;- hard little grains in the Shea were difficult to melt &amp; rub into hands for application to the skin. In contrast, this African White Shea, from Nature &amp; Herbs, comes in a plastic food tub, is a pale yellow color, and is dramatically smoother &amp; more buttery/easily melted when rubbed between hands, &amp; magically absorbs into skin. So much nicer! We use on hands, face, elbows, feet, wherever we need moisture &amp; protection from cold &amp; windburn. My daughter &amp; I had sampled \\&quot;raw\\&quot; Shea previously at a farmer&#x27;s market, the odour was intolerable (to us). This White Shea does not have that odour. It is soooo luxurious... Nature again trumps Madison Avenue high-priced lotions/potions. This Shea is absolute bliss &amp; far superior to any high-priced balms/salves. Cost is reasonable. I plan to buy some inexpensive tin containers for convenient storage &amp; use of the Shea. By the way, this seller (Nature &amp; Herbs)  was fabulous too- Great communication, immediate shipping &amp; receipt. Thanks! Will buy more, again &amp; always :)</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter is very clean and came in a nice resealable container for easy storage. I am about to buy some more. My boyfriend is using all of mine up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised the seller doesn&#x27;t mention that when gold shea butter is turned into white shea butter it loses a lot of its healing properties. Yes the gold stuff smells, but it&#x27;s a lot better to use.</li>
            <li> I have once gotten true, refined white Shea Butter from this dealer.  And by definition, WHITE shea is refined.  Cream shea may or may not be. Twice now I have ordered this particular product and received material which I can not call &#x27;refined&#x27;.  It comes in random sized chunks, is dirty greyish colored, and the aroma is very akin to the unrefined yellow.  In my discourse with the dealer they have ranged from stating that it IS refined, to saying it isn&#x27;t, and that they have the refined white also.  So if you are using it for a purpose where the aroma doesn&#x27;t matter, or you like the aroma, all is good.  This is a very heavy and thick shea butter and it does a nice job healing and sealing skin.  I make lotion and lipgloss form my shea and have found it nearly impossible to mask the musky scent of this.  infact despite baking soda and charcoal and bleach and sealed ziplocked bags, everything in my one fridge smells strongly of unrefined shea butter.  So consider your uses and your nose, and beware that this can not be returned.  At this point I am very disappointed with this dealer and am not sure if I will purchase from them again</li>
            <li> I have been using shea butter cream but wanted to use the real thing.  This is wonderful and great to use on the bottom of my feet.  Shea butter was recommended by my doctor and I think this is the best product I have found.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This seller is committed to customer satisfaction.  For some reason, I assumed that once I purchased the yellow product, I&#x27;d keep it whether I liked it or not.  However, the seller was told about my dissatisfaction with the smell of the yellow and offered - at his expense - to replace my shipment with the white butter.  I received it today, and like it so much better than the yellow.  So, please know that he aims to please.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It worked wonders on my feet with the first use. It is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t clash with any other scent I wear. My only complaint is the shipping cost, almost ten dollars, and I live in the same state as the distributor.</li>
            <li> with this product, because it came in the plastic bag, I was expecting it will come in some bottle, I lost a lot of it when I put it in the jar and is hard so it is hard to spread over body I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> This Shea Butter is refined and will arrive in a sealed bag and nothing more. The Shea Butter will be kind of hard and not really in a stage that you could apply directly to your skin smoothly. It can be melted down a little and then whipped up with a blender to get a real smooth consistency. Then you can transfer to your favorite container.   I personally would only use this refined Shea Butter for making creams etc., it&#x27;s a quality refined shea butter and nothing more. I still use regular Raw Shea Butter for my skin and I use this one as a base product for other things.   Lastly, the reason I only rated this product as Four Stars, because I know the quality could be better. The company seems to be more concerned with quantity (mass producing) over quality. The price is also pretty high for refined Shea Butter.  I forgot to state that this Refined Shea Butter has No nutty or smoke smell, like Raw Shea Butter. I also have read majority of the reviews on this product and the seller started using containers at first, then resealable bags, and now just a sealed bag (product must be transferred). This shows me the quality has went down also and the price is not reasonable either.</li>
            <li> I too am surprised that the seller didn&#x27;t mention that the white shea butter is refined shea butter.  Where the cream (tan or light yellow) colored shea butter is unrefined.  Refined shea butter is processed to where a lot of the healing properties are removed.  You know it&#x27;s refined because there is no smell.  The cream colored (sometimes light yellow) shea butter is unrefined and has all of its healing properties and is thus a better product if you are looking for the full value of a shea butter.  If you only want it for a moisturizer (and not necessarily to use for healing purposes) then the white shea butter is o.k.</li>
            <li> African Shea Butter  I really really like this product. Very good for dry skin. This has really been a blessing for me. I recommend this product.[[ASIN:B0009MHJZI African Shea Butter Cream (100% Pure &amp; White ) 16 Oz]]</li>
            <li> Thank you. Fast shipment. This mixes well with other oils and butters. There is no smell which I love!!! It is so creamy. Thank you very much. I am about to place another order right now!!!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 kinds : unrefined white , unrefined yellow &amp; refined yellow ....&amp; all 3 from the same company... the unrefined yellow was very good soft &amp; oily indeed, the white butter which is this one was more harder but OK , the refined yellow (with the box not with bag )was awful  very hard &amp;not fresh not applicable , I gave it 2 stars coz i did not like the expensive shipping.</li>
