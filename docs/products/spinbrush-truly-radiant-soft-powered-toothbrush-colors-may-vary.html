            <li>A great buy!</li>
            <li>This is the best toothbrush that I have found.</li>
            <li>Best of the inexpensive \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The Sonic Spinbrush is the best powered toothbrush that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I can feel with my tongue that it does the best cleaning ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, Spinbrush does do a very good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>If successful, proceed to retaining good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I feel as though it&#x27;s doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I found it does a good job cleaning teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>It is a good size for travel if you must have an electric brush on the road.</li>
            <li>It is also good for my gums.</li>
            <li>This brush does a good  job cleaning teeth.</li>
            <li>The bristles are colored, so that you can determine a good time to repllace the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Believing that this toothbrush would be easier to take and use during my travels, I was delighted to have an opportunity to use and evaluate it.  </li>
            <li>love this product , have used it for yrs , dentist is also happy with it.</li>
            <li>and he can invest in a better machine, the Spinbrush is great.</li>
            <li>I agree that plug in is nice in most instances, but a battery powered brush is great when you’re on the move.</li>
            <li>I really love it!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Kind of like Sonicare brushes do.  </li>
            <li>No, this is not an electric toothbrush, and it can&#x27;t do what an electric toothbrush can do; however, it does make a nice travel toothbrush if you don&#x27;t want to lug your electric along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The head of the brush vibrates and it does feel nice against the gums, massaging them and relaxing you as you brush.</li>
            <li>This will always remain a handy stand in for when you travel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, I liked it.</li>
            <li>As to the brushing, it wasn&#x27;t overpowering when it was turned on and the vibration did a nice job of massaging the gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears to have colorwear indicators to let you know when it is time to replace the head of the brush- which is also a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hno dentist, so I can&#x27;t vouch for how effective it is on plaque or how well it works on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very strong grip is required to grip and twist the cap.</li>
            <li>And, to be honest, it&#x27;s not as stylish as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>It has been more effective in reducing plaque than manual brushing.  </li>
            <li>Since he doesn&#x27;t know how great an Oral-B or Sonicare system is, the Spinbrush is right up his alley.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Electric toothbrushes are good for cleaning the teeth and gums and the Spinbrush Proclean Sonic Battery Powered Toothbrush is a good and reasonably priced option for powered brushing.</li>
            <li>It is easy to grip, has a on/off/continuous switch and most of all - it gets the gunk that gets stuck between your teeth and at the gum line out!  </li>
            <li>Does that provide a more thorough cleaning than manual brushing?</li>
            <li>He used it for about a week, and thought that it wasn&#x27;t much better than his manual brush.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this bruch.  </li>
            <li>had hoped that improvements had been made in the design of the battery compartment in the latest incarnation of the SpinBrush.</li>
            <li>It vibrates in more areas and the longer bristles get between teeth and gums better.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This Spinbrush is one of many powered brushes I have used</li>
            <li>Yes, it does better than a handheld toothbrush at cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>But I suspect at the price point offered, there are better alternatives.</li>
            <li>top button is for continuous operation:</li>
            <li>It contained two Duracell AA copper top cells.  </li>
            <li>And I love trhe battery operated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And teeth do feel nice and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>so it seems to have a pretty good battery life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t have Oral-B professional version to compare, I would be happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if the vibrations moved in more varied directions because the brushing would be more through, but this is still a good toothbrush overall for the money.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care for them sitting on the countertop to be easily bumped and tipped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The buttons are easy to use to turn it off and on -</li>
            <li>The light cheap plastic feel of the Spinbrush makes it feel more like a child&#x27;s toy as well.</li>
            <li>I love these spin brushes because they leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The controls are easy to use and the battery is easy to change out.</li>
            <li>I use Rotadent toothbrush, and love that it has microfiber bristles - they clean but they do not transfer vibration to the bones.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is well made with easy on and off buttons.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>They often clean better and faster than a manual toothbrush, removing more plaque and contributing to a healthier smile.</li>
            <li>Spinbrush is fine as a low-cost electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Batteries in the handle are located side by side which makes handle wider than Sonicare and OralB brushes yet it is still comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>use it as a brush at work while still keeping my Sonicare Essence as my primary brush at home.</li>
            <li>* Cheap and replaceable&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than the cheap plastic appearance, it seems to do the job promised.  </li>
            <li>and I could fit it into  my toothbrush holder on my sink, this one won;&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>It vibrates, much likle the popular Sonic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can say is that this item seems cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good feature of this toothbrush is that you can change the brush head without having to purchase another complete set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Spinbrush has a very big brush head that does a great job of getting all my teeth and gums really clean.</li>
            <li>After every brushing, my teeth feel clean and smooth</li>
            <li>the up side, after using this toothbrush my teeth feel really clean and shiny</li>
            <li>Though the feeling of clean teeth is subjective, using the Philips PowerUp toothbrush makes my teeth feel a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li>Spinbrush Proclean Sonic Battery Powered Toothbrush is one such powered toothbrush, a battery powered brush to be precise with a good deal of cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>* Louder - sounds like you are using a power tool to clean your teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality wise, it appears quite cheap comparing to the Oral-B, but it claim to serve the purpose of deep cleaning and 95% removal of plaque.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from those differences, I found the brushing action to be vigorous and effective.  </li>
            <li>she was like wow cheap easy and works!  </li>
            <li>Even for an adult with strong healthy hands, removing the cap can be a struggle, as you can see from my video.</li>
            <li>The vibration is quite strong, and the sound it makes is a bit loud.</li>
            <li>Additional heads are available at Amazon, curentlhy at about $9 for 2, which seems fairly reasonable.</li>
            <li>This portable, battery charged version is a nice travel version of the larger charging stand version we have in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li>If you already have one, and are looking for an additional brush – this makes a nice, low cost temporary solution to try it out.  </li>
            <li>packed &amp; delivered in a quick manner and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>My biannual dental checkups had been good while I was using the Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the problems with the battery compartment is fixed, I simply cannot recommend this SpinBrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is battery powered and so far the battery that the toothbrush arrived with is still going strong</li>
            <li>The head of this toothbrush might be too large for a child or small person, but I found this toothbrush easier to use and more effective than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>AA Duracell batteries come pre-installed, but if you ever need to change the batteries, be sure to orient the polarity the right way before snapping the cover back on.</li>
            <li>He felt that if you are already a good brusher, the powered movement wasn&#x27;t all that better – he did wonder if a spinning action might be different, but of course, this brush doesn&#x27;t actually spin, despite it&#x27;s name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The speed is very fast.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It works as well as a higher priced brush .  </li>
            <li>Not expensive, nor are the brush head replacements.  </li>
            <li>Better than a manual brush, and he won&#x27;t be going backward while he waits for his financial lot to improve.</li>
            <li>About 2 minutes with this brush is more than enough to remove food and plaque.</li>
            <li>They may never be able to get the cap open.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply not user-friendly and in need of a design overhaul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better options.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After opening the sealed plastic package, the first thing I did was pop off the bottom to see what was powering this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>First: This is not a spinbrush.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend for those that really want your teeth clean</li>
            <li>Having just had two implants and other dental procedures done, this brush is amazing at helping keep my dental health in tip-top shape.  </li>
            <li>First of all, there&#x27;s nothing on it that SPINS, and certainly nothing sonic.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way that it works and my teeth feel super clean after I have brushed with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a brush that is not going to get to your far back teeth real easily...for smaller mouthed people anyway, the head is rather large, so not easy to reach those back these, and the vibration doesn&#x27;t feel too great if the rest of the toothbrush hits your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries, not too easy to get to and remove, it&#x27;s a good idea, but needs some work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was very cool to open the package and have a battery- powered product that is ready to use.</li>
            <li>brush might be a good option for older children, especially if they&#x27;ve never used a manual brush, but it looks like hubby is going back to his manual brush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is only good for as long as the batteries last.&lt;br</li>
            <li>problem is, I can&#x27;t seem to open the battery compartment according to the instruction, even though I am a reasonably strong man.  </li>
            <li>We have very limited storage space in the bathroom, and I&#x27;m not quite sure where to put it.</li>
            <li>buy for the money, cheap enough to be a travel brush, works very well.</li>
            <li>But he also wants to keep his teeth</li>
            <li>And it much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I had the same problem with another cheap disposable battery-operated brush, and my dentist told me to choose another.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fancy and there&#x27;s nothing really</li>
            <li>I was able to make it come off by not pulling it away from the brush bottom but instead prying it sideways from its wide side to pop it</li>
            <li>much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even Crest Cross Action feels like a better brush.</li>
            <li>The Spinbrush Spinbush Proclean Sonic is a good alternative to the much more expensive Oral-B professional electronic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>brush motion on the Spinbrush is better, in my opinion, than my other battery powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This has a slightly larger head than I usually like, but it works great.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt clean and my gums didn&#x27;t feel scraped up so the item definitely works for</li>
            <li>Battery powered or rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t that important to me, as long as our teeth get</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference, and I normally brush manually.</li>
            <li>They operate at a very high number of vibrations per second and are economical.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He compares it to a regular old toothbrush, and it&#x27;s a huge improvement, he says.</li>
            <li>This is my 4th and will most likely be my last SpinBrush.</li>
            <li>toothbrush is very loud, and it makes my whole head vibrate with it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Like the bristles, brush head a little better than the Phillips&lt;</li>
            <li>I use a Phillips Sonicare normally, and this compares well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For one, I like that it uses normal batteries; and for two, I like that it came with batteries included.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at what this brush managed to get off my teeth even after brushing with a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s probably a few dollars more to buy the Phillips.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush - like other electrics - works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s larger than many other battery powered toothbrushes&lt;br</li>
            <li>often go back and forth with toothbrushes, using manual brushed most of the time and powered brushes only on occasion.</li>
            <li>will tell about the longevity of the battery and the brush itself, but so far, this is a winner with both me and my dentist!</li>
            <li>One speed only and creates tiny vibrational movements to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good step up if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, although be careful due to the head size and remember that this brush doesn&#x27;t actually spin.....</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, but still not as soft and flexible as Rotodent&#x27;s bristles.</li>
            <li>brush head is larger and covers more area in less time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>this entire \\&quot;Spinbrush\\&quot; (which vibrates but does not spin) costs less than a replacement head for my SoniCare and is much more practical for traveling.  </li>
            <li>It is harder than my super soft one so if you have really sensitive gums that is something to think about.</li>
            <li>It certainly has power unlike a regularly battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old school, manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Spinbrush Pro Whitening Soft Bristle Replacement Heads, 2 Heads]] do spin.</li>
            <li>loved using it however the battery cap is ridiculously difficult to close.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>Been using it for a few weeks and my teeth seem clean.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this toothbrush for anyone with finger dexterity problems, such as older adults.</li>
            <li>it worked right out of the package due to battery being included and already installed.</li>
            <li>The vibrations are not overwhelming, and it is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a purely mechanical side-to-side vibrating action with absolutely no \\&quot;spinning\\&quot; at all on this head, though [[ASIN:B004D13ZEA</li>
            <li>Pressing the on button, it seemed to depress about halfway through the body, much like when the breaks on your car are going bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this as my travel brush, as I have a Sonicare at home, but for the price I think this compares very favorably to a much more expensive brush.</li>
            <li>This is my first &amp;#34;battery powered&amp;#34; toothbrush other than a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the sound and excessive vibration, it cleans rather well, but only if you can stand having it in your mouth for two minutes.</li>
            <li>far as I can tell, the bristles vibrate back and forth but do not spin at all (like the title suggests).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next, I evaluated its brushing action.  </li>
            <li>It vibrates and buzzes, and it does get your teeth at least as clean as a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>For any adult who is looking for a low-cost or travel alternative to the more expensive rechargeable sonic-type toothbrushes, I believe that this one is viable.</li>
            <li>A spin brush that doesn&#x27;t really spin, although not sure how well vibration brush would work as far as marketing goes.  </li>
            <li>I feel like they do a better job, get into hard to reach spaces and in a lot less time.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is large, and children will have trouble reaching to back teeth.  </li>

            <li> had hoped that improvements had been made in the design of the battery compartment in the latest incarnation of the SpinBrush.</li>
            <li> It vibrates in more areas and the longer bristles get between teeth and gums better.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This Spinbrush is one of many powered brushes I have used</li>
            <li> Yes, it does better than a handheld toothbrush at cleaning teeth.  </li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> But I suspect at the price point offered, there are better alternatives.</li>
            <li> top button is for continuous operation:</li>
            <li> It contained two Duracell AA copper top cells.  </li>
            <li> And I love trhe battery operated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And teeth do feel nice and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> so it seems to have a pretty good battery life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have Oral-B professional version to compare, I would be happy with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if the vibrations moved in more varied directions because the brushing would be more through, but this is still a good toothbrush overall for the money.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care for them sitting on the countertop to be easily bumped and tipped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The buttons are easy to use to turn it off and on -</li>
            <li> The light cheap plastic feel of the Spinbrush makes it feel more like a child&#x27;s toy as well.</li>
            <li> I love these spin brushes because they leave my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> The controls are easy to use and the battery is easy to change out.</li>
            <li> I use Rotadent toothbrush, and love that it has microfiber bristles - they clean but they do not transfer vibration to the bones.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is well made with easy on and off buttons.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> They often clean better and faster than a manual toothbrush, removing more plaque and contributing to a healthier smile.</li>
            <li> Spinbrush is fine as a low-cost electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Batteries in the handle are located side by side which makes handle wider than Sonicare and OralB brushes yet it is still comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> use it as a brush at work while still keeping my Sonicare Essence as my primary brush at home.</li>
            <li> * Cheap and replaceable&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than the cheap plastic appearance, it seems to do the job promised.  </li>
            <li> and I could fit it into  my toothbrush holder on my sink, this one won;&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> It vibrates, much likle the popular Sonic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can say is that this item seems cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another good feature of this toothbrush is that you can change the brush head without having to purchase another complete set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Spinbrush has a very big brush head that does a great job of getting all my teeth and gums really clean.</li>
            <li> After every brushing, my teeth feel clean and smooth</li>
            <li> the up side, after using this toothbrush my teeth feel really clean and shiny</li>
            <li> Though the feeling of clean teeth is subjective, using the Philips PowerUp toothbrush makes my teeth feel a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li> Spinbrush Proclean Sonic Battery Powered Toothbrush is one such powered toothbrush, a battery powered brush to be precise with a good deal of cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> * Louder - sounds like you are using a power tool to clean your teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality wise, it appears quite cheap comparing to the Oral-B, but it claim to serve the purpose of deep cleaning and 95% removal of plaque.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from those differences, I found the brushing action to be vigorous and effective.  </li>
            <li> she was like wow cheap easy and works!  </li>
            <li> Even for an adult with strong healthy hands, removing the cap can be a struggle, as you can see from my video.</li>
            <li> The vibration is quite strong, and the sound it makes is a bit loud.</li>
            <li> Additional heads are available at Amazon, curentlhy at about $9 for 2, which seems fairly reasonable.</li>
            <li> This portable, battery charged version is a nice travel version of the larger charging stand version we have in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li> If you already have one, and are looking for an additional brush – this makes a nice, low cost temporary solution to try it out.  </li>
            <li> packed &amp; delivered in a quick manner and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> My biannual dental checkups had been good while I was using the Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the problems with the battery compartment is fixed, I simply cannot recommend this SpinBrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is battery powered and so far the battery that the toothbrush arrived with is still going strong</li>
            <li> The head of this toothbrush might be too large for a child or small person, but I found this toothbrush easier to use and more effective than a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> AA Duracell batteries come pre-installed, but if you ever need to change the batteries, be sure to orient the polarity the right way before snapping the cover back on.</li>
            <li> He felt that if you are already a good brusher, the powered movement wasn&#x27;t all that better – he did wonder if a spinning action might be different, but of course, this brush doesn&#x27;t actually spin, despite it&#x27;s name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The speed is very fast.  </li>
            <li> Works much better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works as well as a higher priced brush .  </li>
            <li> Not expensive, nor are the brush head replacements.  </li>
            <li> Better than a manual brush, and he won&#x27;t be going backward while he waits for his financial lot to improve.</li>
            <li> About 2 minutes with this brush is more than enough to remove food and plaque.</li>
            <li> They may never be able to get the cap open.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply not user-friendly and in need of a design overhaul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better options.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After opening the sealed plastic package, the first thing I did was pop off the bottom to see what was powering this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> First: This is not a spinbrush.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend for those that really want your teeth clean</li>
            <li> Having just had two implants and other dental procedures done, this brush is amazing at helping keep my dental health in tip-top shape.  </li>
            <li> First of all, there&#x27;s nothing on it that SPINS, and certainly nothing sonic.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way that it works and my teeth feel super clean after I have brushed with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a brush that is not going to get to your far back teeth real easily...for smaller mouthed people anyway, the head is rather large, so not easy to reach those back these, and the vibration doesn&#x27;t feel too great if the rest of the toothbrush hits your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries, not too easy to get to and remove, it&#x27;s a good idea, but needs some work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very cool to open the package and have a battery- powered product that is ready to use.</li>
            <li> brush might be a good option for older children, especially if they&#x27;ve never used a manual brush, but it looks like hubby is going back to his manual brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is only good for as long as the batteries last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> problem is, I can&#x27;t seem to open the battery compartment according to the instruction, even though I am a reasonably strong man.  </li>
            <li> We have very limited storage space in the bathroom, and I&#x27;m not quite sure where to put it.</li>
            <li> buy for the money, cheap enough to be a travel brush, works very well.</li>
            <li> But he also wants to keep his teeth</li>
            <li> And it much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I had the same problem with another cheap disposable battery-operated brush, and my dentist told me to choose another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fancy and there&#x27;s nothing really</li>
            <li> I was able to make it come off by not pulling it away from the brush bottom but instead prying it sideways from its wide side to pop it</li>
            <li> much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even Crest Cross Action feels like a better brush.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush Spinbush Proclean Sonic is a good alternative to the much more expensive Oral-B professional electronic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> brush motion on the Spinbrush is better, in my opinion, than my other battery powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This has a slightly larger head than I usually like, but it works great.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt clean and my gums didn&#x27;t feel scraped up so the item definitely works for</li>
            <li> Battery powered or rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t that important to me, as long as our teeth get</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference, and I normally brush manually.</li>
            <li> They operate at a very high number of vibrations per second and are economical.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He compares it to a regular old toothbrush, and it&#x27;s a huge improvement, he says.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th and will most likely be my last SpinBrush.</li>
            <li> toothbrush is very loud, and it makes my whole head vibrate with it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Like the bristles, brush head a little better than the Phillips&lt;</li>
            <li> I use a Phillips Sonicare normally, and this compares well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For one, I like that it uses normal batteries; and for two, I like that it came with batteries included.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at what this brush managed to get off my teeth even after brushing with a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s probably a few dollars more to buy the Phillips.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush - like other electrics - works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s larger than many other battery powered toothbrushes&lt;br</li>
            <li> often go back and forth with toothbrushes, using manual brushed most of the time and powered brushes only on occasion.</li>
            <li> will tell about the longevity of the battery and the brush itself, but so far, this is a winner with both me and my dentist!</li>
            <li> One speed only and creates tiny vibrational movements to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good step up if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, although be careful due to the head size and remember that this brush doesn&#x27;t actually spin.....</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, but still not as soft and flexible as Rotodent&#x27;s bristles.</li>
            <li> brush head is larger and covers more area in less time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> this entire \\&quot;Spinbrush\\&quot; (which vibrates but does not spin) costs less than a replacement head for my SoniCare and is much more practical for traveling.  </li>
            <li> It is harder than my super soft one so if you have really sensitive gums that is something to think about.</li>
            <li> It certainly has power unlike a regularly battery operated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old school, manual toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Spinbrush Pro Whitening Soft Bristle Replacement Heads, 2 Heads]] do spin.</li>
            <li> loved using it however the battery cap is ridiculously difficult to close.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks and my teeth seem clean.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this toothbrush for anyone with finger dexterity problems, such as older adults.</li>
            <li> it worked right out of the package due to battery being included and already installed.</li>
            <li> The vibrations are not overwhelming, and it is comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a purely mechanical side-to-side vibrating action with absolutely no \\&quot;spinning\\&quot; at all on this head, though [[ASIN:B004D13ZEA</li>
            <li> Pressing the on button, it seemed to depress about halfway through the body, much like when the breaks on your car are going bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this as my travel brush, as I have a Sonicare at home, but for the price I think this compares very favorably to a much more expensive brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;battery powered&amp;#34; toothbrush other than a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the sound and excessive vibration, it cleans rather well, but only if you can stand having it in your mouth for two minutes.</li>
            <li> far as I can tell, the bristles vibrate back and forth but do not spin at all (like the title suggests).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next, I evaluated its brushing action.  </li>
            <li> It vibrates and buzzes, and it does get your teeth at least as clean as a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> For any adult who is looking for a low-cost or travel alternative to the more expensive rechargeable sonic-type toothbrushes, I believe that this one is viable.</li>
            <li> A spin brush that doesn&#x27;t really spin, although not sure how well vibration brush would work as far as marketing goes.  </li>
            <li> I feel like they do a better job, get into hard to reach spaces and in a lot less time.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is large, and children will have trouble reaching to back teeth.  </li>
            <li> My previous, rechargeable toothbrush is dying and I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> I use a rechargeable Oral-B and really like it for the small spinning head that gets in the smallest parts of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have a small mouth because the head of this toothbrush is about the size of a manual toothbrush, comes without a cover and is significantly larger than the small head on my SoniCare.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s more expensive than other battery powered toothbrushes&lt;</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and they bleed a little bit no matter</li>
            <li> It also has a replaceable head, so can be used for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used a much more expensive rechargeable brush in the past and I like this Spinbrush just as well as the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> You can also start with the bottom button which will turn on the brush and keep it on as long as you hold it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this toothbrush is lightweight and since it uses batteries it makes for easier traveling, no clunky base to pack, the price is also great...since it seems to do a better job than a regular old toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, the head is bigger and more awkward than other models I have used.  </li>
            <li> The head is a bit too large to get all the way behind my rear molars, but each person&#x27;s mouth is different.</li>
            <li> BUT this one has a few drawbacks that more expensive models do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike the single ON/OFF button on my SoniCare, this toothbrush has separate \\&quot;ON\\&quot; and \\&quot;OFF\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it is LOUD LOUD LOUD, louder than other models I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is next to impossible to remove the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly fond of powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Previously I used a regular manual Oral B Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also just seems bigger, clunkier and less refined than the Phillips Bettery operated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I came close to breaking the thing instead of just liberating the spent batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint, is that my other one had a smaller handle</li>
            <li> have used a Phillips Sonicbrush for years and recently decided to try their new battery operated option, because the cost of replacing the heads for the rechargable version seemed expensive.</li>
            <li> spinbrush does not actually spin, it vibrates, so I am not sure why it was named like that.</li>
            <li> that makes it stand out from other toothbrushes in its price range.</li>
            <li> have noticed that other companies are putting out battery operated versions, to compete, I guess.</li>
            <li> the batteries run out, it is next to impossible to open the cap to change the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The way it is designed, suggests this is done on purpose in order to push consumers to buy new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> B00DS0KP2C Philips Sonicare Hx3631/02 Powerup Battery Toothbrush, Blue]] is much less frustrating and has a 2-minute timer, for example while costing the same.</li>
            <li> If you are still using an old fashion brush, I highly encourage you to switch – you will be shocked by the difference it makes.  </li>
            <li> only negative thing I can say about this brush is that I am not a fan of the switch to turn it on/off-</li>
            <li> It makes his teeth cleaner, noticeably so, in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each of my previous SpinBrushes lasted anywhere from 3-5 months before conking out.</li>
            <li> tried this Arm &amp; Hammer Sonic Spinbrush over the last week, and I&#x27;m not very impressed with it.  </li>
            <li> But it has just a few negatives to keep me from giving it five stars.</li>
            <li> My 3 previous SpinBrushes had one common problem -- the battery compartments were not watertight, which resulted in water seeping into the battery compartments and corroding the batteries and electronics.</li>
            <li> I need a small brush head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my Sonic care and use this one as a back up if the Sonic care brush fails.</li>
            <li> still not sure if I&#x27;d get another</li>
            <li> It is unbelievably difficult to open and cramp-inducing.</li>
            <li> Out of the box it seemed a little weak.</li>
            <li> For travel, it is much simpler for me to replace the AA cells than to haul a charging base.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I think if I were to stop brushing manually, I&#x27;d go for a regular, rechargeable electric model.</li>
            <li> I hate it when I have to change the batteries because it is hard to get the cap back on it.</li>
            <li> One negative is that the bottom was real hard to twist off to replace batteries.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the battery covers on these were very, very hard to remove (Removing the battery cover involves a simultaneous twisting and pulling motion).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the vibration makes me push on the brush too hard, and I feel that my gums do not like that.</li>
            <li> I got thin one to travel with</li>
            <li> I write this review, my hand is bloody because I punched my finger with screwdriver trying to open the battery housing cap.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Some might be annoyed with battery power because they don’t want to replace batteries and would rather use the plug- in style toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> But traveling with that toothbrush, which requires a plug-in charging base, is not really practical.  </li>
            <li> I think of spinning as rotating, but perhaps I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> in all, it does the job, albeit not perfectly.  </li>
            <li> battery compartment cap is difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> But now it is impossible to obtain the brush heads and to find a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> He said he&#x27;d hate to use it if he had a head</li>
            <li> battery compartment design is completely horrible and not designed for humans.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I think of spinning as rotating, but perhaps I&#x27;m wrong. This brush doesn&#x27;t seem to spin or rotate, or noticeably chug sideways. Instead, the bristles sort of vibrate. Does that provide a more thorough cleaning than manual brushing? I don&#x27;t know. I didn&#x27;t see much difference, and I normally brush manually. The handle is bulkier than a rechargeable electric toothbrush, and you&#x27;ll need to factor in the cost of batteries. However, if you like the idea of an almost-electric toothbrush, or don&#x27;t have an outlet in the bathroom for one, this may work for you. The head is a bit too large to get all the way behind my rear molars, but each person&#x27;s mouth is different. I need a small brush head. It isn&#x27;t a bad product, but I think if I were to stop brushing manually, I&#x27;d go for a regular, rechargeable electric model.</li>
            <li> My husband has never used a power toothbrush before, and of course it takes some getting used to, but he was quite indifferent on this toothbrush. He used it for about a week, and thought that it wasn&#x27;t much better than his manual brush. He felt that if you are already a good brusher, the powered movement wasn&#x27;t all that better – he did wonder if a spinning action might be different, but of course, this brush doesn&#x27;t actually spin, despite it&#x27;s name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said the vibrations made it feel as if his teeth were getting knocked around. He said he&#x27;d hate to use it if he had a head cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I don&#x27;t care for how big and bulky the brush is. We have very limited storage space in the bathroom, and I&#x27;m not quite sure where to put it. It is obviously too big for a standard toothbrush holder and I don&#x27;t care for them sitting on the countertop to be easily bumped and tipped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush might be a good option for older children, especially if they&#x27;ve never used a manual brush, but it looks like hubby is going back to his manual brush.</li>
            <li> This has a slightly larger head than I usually like, but it works great. My previous, rechargeable toothbrush is dying and I needed a new one. Battery powered works better on trips (I don&#x27;t have to drag along a charger, and don&#x27;t risk leaving the charger behind in the hotel-which I have done before). It also has a replaceable head, so can be used for a long time. It gives a vigorous brush. I definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had several different battery powered toothbrushes over the years.  I use a rechargeable Oral-B and really like it for the small spinning head that gets in the smallest parts of my mouth.  I like the Colgate Spinbrush for my kids, who need a bigger handle to help them grip.  Battery powered or rechargeable batteries aren&#x27;t that important to me, as long as our teeth get clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this Arm &amp; Hammer Sonic Spinbrush over the last week, and I&#x27;m not very impressed with it.  First of all, there&#x27;s nothing on it that SPINS, and certainly nothing sonic.  It vibrates and buzzes, and it does get your teeth at least as clean as a manual toothbrush.  But for the size, noise, weight and big, non-spinning head, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.  Why would they call it a spinbrush when it doesn&#x27;t spin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s $14, which is about double the cost of the Colgate Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> This Spinbrush has a very big brush head that does a great job of getting all my teeth and gums really clean. The brush head is a medium/soft firmness. I really love it! The buttons are easy to use to turn it off and on - it worked right out of the package due to battery being included and already installed. I have used a much more expensive rechargeable brush in the past and I like this Spinbrush just as well as the more expensive brand. A great buy!</li>
            <li> A spin brush that doesn&#x27;t really spin, although not sure how well vibration brush would work as far as marketing goes.  This brush does not spin, it vibrates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a brush that is not going to get to your far back teeth real easily...for smaller mouthed people anyway, the head is rather large, so not easy to reach those back these, and the vibration doesn&#x27;t feel too great if the rest of the toothbrush hits your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries, not too easy to get to and remove, it&#x27;s a good idea, but needs some work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the up side, after using this toothbrush my teeth feel really clean and shiny so I feel as though it&#x27;s doing a good job.  I do still prefer my Sonic care though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this toothbrush is lightweight and since it uses batteries it makes for easier traveling, no clunky base to pack, the price is also great...since it seems to do a better job than a regular old toothbrush it&#x27;s a good step up if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, although be careful due to the head size and remember that this brush doesn&#x27;t actually spin.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my Sonic care and use this one as a back up if the Sonic care brush fails.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush Proclean just cannot compare against any of the Philips electric toothbrushes. I&#x27;m not talking about the E series or above. Though the feeling of clean teeth is subjective, using the Philips PowerUp toothbrush makes my teeth feel a lot cleaner. Even Crest Cross Action feels like a better brush. The light cheap plastic feel of the Spinbrush makes it feel more like a child&#x27;s toy as well. If you&#x27;re gonna go for an electric toothbrush in this price range, I&#x27;d look for a Philips Powerup.</li>
            <li> Works much better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! My second one. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this bruch.  It certainly has power unlike a regularly battery operated toothbrush.  Con:  I hate it when I have to change the batteries because it is hard to get the cap back on it.</li>
            <li> love this product , have used it for yrs , dentist is also happy with it. It works as well as a higher priced brush .  packed &amp; delivered in a quick manner and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp;#34;battery powered&amp;#34; toothbrush other than a Sonicare.  I got thin one to travel with and it has exceeded my expectations!  I would recommend this toothbrush!  Not expensive, nor are the brush head replacements.  I like it!</li>
            <li> I love these spin brushes because they leave my mouth feeling clean. They operate at a very high number of vibrations per second and are economical.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush that I have found. I am getting compliments from my dental hygienist regarding my self care. She actually asked about the brand and name of toothbrush. So, that she (hygienist) could recommend it to her patients. But now it is impossible to obtain the brush heads and to find a toothbrush. For some reason it seemed to pulled from the market. I hope that Amazon continues to have some supply.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who is struggling financially. He hasn&#x27;t money for anything that isn&#x27;t a total necessity, a category into which he places ultrasonic and mechanical brushing systems. But he also wants to keep his teeth healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s for someone in his category the Spinbrush was made for. He&#x27;s been using it for months, and loves it. Since he doesn&#x27;t know how great an Oral-B or Sonicare system is, the Spinbrush is right up his alley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He compares it to a regular old toothbrush, and it&#x27;s a huge improvement, he says. It makes his teeth cleaner, noticeably so, in less time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So until and when his financial situation eases up and he can invest in a better machine, the Spinbrush is great. Better than a manual brush, and he won&#x27;t be going backward while he waits for his financial lot to improve.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is only good for as long as the batteries last.&lt;br /&gt;As I write this review, my hand is bloody because I punched my finger with screwdriver trying to open the battery housing cap.&lt;br /&gt;Once the batteries run out, it is next to impossible to open the cap to change the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The way it is designed, suggests this is done on purpose in order to push consumers to buy new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th and will most likely be my last SpinBrush. My 3 previous SpinBrushes had one common problem -- the battery compartments were not watertight, which resulted in water seeping into the battery compartments and corroding the batteries and electronics. Each of my previous SpinBrushes lasted anywhere from 3-5 months before conking out. In addition, the battery covers on these were very, very hard to remove (Removing the battery cover involves a simultaneous twisting and pulling motion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped that improvements had been made in the design of the battery compartment in the latest incarnation of the SpinBrush. But, nope. It still has the same hard-to-remove battery cover and a battery compartment that&#x27;s prone to water seepage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, Spinbrush does do a very good job of cleaning my teeth. After every brushing, my teeth feel clean and smooth (I do the \\&quot;tongue test\\&quot; by running my tongue over them -- no grit!). My biannual dental checkups had been good while I was using the Spinbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the problems with the battery compartment is fixed, I simply cannot recommend this SpinBrush.</li>
            <li> It does not spin, it vibrates. Kind of like Sonicare brushes do.  It does a good job cleaning my teeth.  The head is replaceable.  Batteries in the handle are located side by side which makes handle wider than Sonicare and OralB brushes yet it is still comfortable to hold.  To replace batteries you do not need a .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a brush at work while still keeping my Sonicare Essence as my primary brush at home.</li>
            <li> Switched to this &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; from another Spinbrush, and my teeth do seem cleaner after a briefer brushing.  No fancy power source needed: just two AA alkaline batteries</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is going to be my go-to brush from now on. I really like the way that it works and my teeth feel super clean after I have brushed with it. The controls are easy to use and the battery is easy to change out. I definitely brush my teeth longer when using this brush as compared to my regular one.</li>
            <li> No, this is not an electric toothbrush, and it can&#x27;t do what an electric toothbrush can do; however, it does make a nice travel toothbrush if you don&#x27;t want to lug your electric along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more expensive than other battery powered toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s larger than many other battery powered toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lighter, so it&#x27;s easier to pack than an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is larger and covers more area in less time.&lt;br /&gt;The brush motion on the Spinbrush is better, in my opinion, than my other battery powered toothbrush. It vibrates in more areas and the longer bristles get between teeth and gums better.&lt;br /&gt;The battery and brush head are both changeable - nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line for me: I like it as a substitute toothbrush when I can&#x27;t use my electric. Best of the inexpensive \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes can make a difference. They often clean better and faster than a manual toothbrush, removing more plaque and contributing to a healthier smile. Spinbrush Proclean Sonic Battery Powered Toothbrush is one such powered toothbrush, a battery powered brush to be precise with a good deal of cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often go back and forth with toothbrushes, using manual brushed most of the time and powered brushes only on occasion. This Spinbrush is one of many powered brushes I have used and I found it does a good job cleaning teeth and gums. The head of the brush vibrates and it does feel nice against the gums, massaging them and relaxing you as you brush. And teeth do feel nice and clean after brushing. About 2 minutes with this brush is more than enough to remove food and plaque. I did have some issues with bleeding gums, but I can’t blame the spinbrush for this. I have sensitive gums and they bleed a little bit no matter what type of brush I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation of this toothbrush requires two AA batteries. I like that the manufacturer included the batteries. It was very cool to open the package and have a battery- powered product that is ready to use. Some might be annoyed with battery power because they don’t want to replace batteries and would rather use the plug- in style toothbrushes. I agree that plug in is nice in most instances, but a battery powered brush is great when you’re on the move. You can take this brush with you anyplace and use it whenever you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric toothbrushes are good for cleaning the teeth and gums and the Spinbrush Proclean Sonic Battery Powered Toothbrush is a good and reasonably priced option for powered brushing. It would be better if the vibrations moved in more varied directions because the brushing would be more through, but this is still a good toothbrush overall for the money.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is an electric toothbrush, though not a spinning brush - spinning is just in the name.  Yes, it does better than a handheld toothbrush at cleaning teeth.  BUT this one has a few drawbacks that more expensive models do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is LOUD LOUD LOUD, louder than other models I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is next to impossible to remove the batteries.  I came close to breaking the thing instead of just liberating the spent batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Third, the head is bigger and more awkward than other models I have used.  Bigger is not necessarily better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it does the job, albeit not perfectly.  It is a good size for travel if you must have an electric brush on the road.</li>
            <li> TIPS FOR CLOSING THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in BOOTS London, UK.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely loved using it however the battery cap is ridiculously difficult to close.&lt;br /&gt;Best advice? Push it against the floor with damn strength and somewhere along the way it will gullibly give in. If successful, proceed to retaining good oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> Loud!&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is very loud, and it makes my whole head vibrate with it. I use Rotadent toothbrush, and love that it has microfiber bristles - they clean but they do not transfer vibration to the bones. And it much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;The spinbrush does not actually spin, it vibrates, so I am not sure why it was named like that. Aside from the sound and excessive vibration, it cleans rather well, but only if you can stand having it in your mouth for two minutes. The head is really big so it goes not only after your teeth, but also massages your gums at the same time. The bristles are very soft, but still not as soft and flexible as Rotodent&#x27;s bristles. Unfortunately, the vibration makes me push on the brush too hard, and I feel that my gums do not like that. I had the same problem with another cheap disposable battery-operated brush, and my dentist told me to choose another.</li>
            <li> Spin brushes are essential for proper teeth cleaning.  My bi-annual cleaning has changed dramatically since I switched.  This portable, battery charged version is a nice travel version of the larger charging stand version we have in our bathroom.  If you are still using an old fashion brush, I highly encourage you to switch – you will be shocked by the difference it makes.  If you already have one, and are looking for an additional brush – this makes a nice, low cost temporary solution to try it out.  While the low price makes it tempting, changing the batteries is a costly pain in the rear; so if you like it, think of this as your gateway to a more expensive purchase later.  This will always remain a handy stand in for when you travel.</li>
            <li> I use a Phillips Sonicare normally, and this compares well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cheap and replaceable&lt;br /&gt;* Like the bristles, brush head a little better than the Phillips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Louder - sounds like you are using a power tool to clean your teeth&lt;br /&gt;* Not rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy for the money, cheap enough to be a travel brush, works very well.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush Spinbush Proclean Sonic is a good alternative to the much more expensive Oral-B professional electronic toothbrushes.  Since it doesn&#x27;t need a charger, you can take it on your traveling trips conveniently, without having to worry about voltage compatibility if you are abroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality wise, it appears quite cheap comparing to the Oral-B, but it claim to serve the purpose of deep cleaning and 95% removal of plaque.  If I don&#x27;t have Oral-B professional version to compare, I would be happy with this toothbrush.  But, in this day and age, brushes like this will ultimately save you a lot of expenses at the dental clinic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem is, I can&#x27;t seem to open the battery compartment according to the instruction, even though I am a reasonably strong man.  I&#x27;ll leave it until the batteries actually die to figure out how to open it.  My concern is, having used a similar product years ago, the battery compartment is no longer waterproof after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good feature of this toothbrush is that you can change the brush head without having to purchase another complete set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the cheap plastic appearance, it seems to do the job promised.  So I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I prefer battery powered toothbrushes versus non battery powered.  I feel like they do a better job, get into hard to reach spaces and in a lot less time.  You don&#x27;t have to spend minutes using your arm to brush your teeth.  On my last battery powered toothbrush, only the round head spun, on this brush the whole brush vibrates, cleaning your teeth to remove plaque and prevent cavities.  The speed is very fast.  It comes with the batteries.  My only complaint, is that my other one had a smaller handle and I could fit it into  my toothbrush holder on my sink, this one won;&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly fond of powered toothbrushes. I&#x27;m old school, manual toothbrushes but I decided to give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I liked it. For one, I like that it uses normal batteries; and for two, I like that it came with batteries included. As to the brushing, it wasn&#x27;t overpowering when it was turned on and the vibration did a nice job of massaging the gums. My teeth felt clean and my gums didn&#x27;t feel scraped up so the item definitely works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not sure if I&#x27;d get another but I am definitely thinking about it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:fad74cf2c6e6538e2d7598ee7719481b]]This Spinbrush is fine as a low-cost electric toothbrush. It&#x27;s not fancy and there&#x27;s nothing really that makes it stand out from other toothbrushes in its price range. It&#x27;s a purely mechanical side-to-side vibrating action with absolutely no \\&quot;spinning\\&quot; at all on this head, though [[ASIN:B004D13ZEA Spinbrush Pro Whitening Soft Bristle Replacement Heads, 2 Heads]] do spin. It&#x27;s quite a lot louder than my Sonicare, but that shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise to anyone, as the Sonicare in my video is 6 or 7x the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment design is completely horrible and not designed for humans. It is unbelievably difficult to open and cramp-inducing. 2 AA Duracell batteries come pre-installed, but if you ever need to change the batteries, be sure to orient the polarity the right way before snapping the cover back on. I do not recommend this toothbrush for anyone with finger dexterity problems, such as older adults. They may never be able to get the cap open. Even for an adult with strong healthy hands, removing the cap can be a struggle, as you can see from my video. This is not a one-off incident. Every one of the 4 takes I did has me struggling. A very strong grip is required to grip and twist the cap. It&#x27;s simply not user-friendly and in need of a design overhaul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better options. The [[ASIN:B00DS0KP2C Philips Sonicare Hx3631/02 Powerup Battery Toothbrush, Blue]] is much less frustrating and has a 2-minute timer, for example while costing the same.</li>
            <li> Sonic boom! One speed only and creates tiny vibrational movements to clean your teeth.  The vibrations are not overwhelming, and it is comfortable to use.  The toothbrush is well made with easy on and off buttons.  The brush can be replaced,  and uses 2 A A batteries. It comes with batteries.  One negative is that the bottom was real hard to twist off to replace batteries.  We had to use a knife to help!</li>
            <li> Having just had two implants and other dental procedures done, this brush is amazing at helping keep my dental health in tip-top shape.  It is easy to grip, has a on/off/continuous switch and most of all - it gets the gunk that gets stuck between your teeth and at the gum line out!  I was amazed at what this brush managed to get off my teeth even after brushing with a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell about the longevity of the battery and the brush itself, but so far, this is a winner with both me and my dentist!</li>
            <li> This is my forth or fifth Spinbrush - so I am officially a fan.  I use this as my travel brush, as I have a Sonicare at home, but for the price I think this compares very favorably to a much more expensive brush.</li>
            <li> The Sonic Spinbrush is the best powered toothbrush that I have ever used. I can feel with my tongue that it does the best cleaning ever. It is also good for my gums.</li>
            <li> Only one husband likes</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not an electric toothbrush person. This toothbrush - like other electrics - works fine. It cleans my teeth ok. It&#x27;s easy to use. Been using it for a few weeks and my teeth seem clean. But it has just a few negatives to keep me from giving it five stars. The head is a bit big it seems. Not a big deal but bigger than some others. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of power. Out of the box it seemed a little weak. And, to be honest, it&#x27;s not as stylish as I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;d recommend for a kid&#x27;s toothbrush if the price point was competitive. But I suspect at the price point offered, there are better alternatives.</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush alot. It is harder than my super soft one so if you have really sensitive gums that is something to think about. It does get tarter off your teeth!!  I know this cause I used it for a week, then my denist saw me  and she was like what are you doing I need to tell my patients.  I just told her this tooth brush she was like wow cheap easy and works!  so I highly recommend for those that really want your teeth clean</li>
            <li> This brush does a good  job cleaning teeth. The vibration is quite strong, and the sound it makes is a bit loud. The brush head is large, and children will have trouble reaching to back teeth.  Additional heads are available at Amazon, curentlhy at about $9 for 2, which seems fairly reasonable. The bristles are colored, so that you can determine a good time to repllace the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top button is for continuous operation: press it and the brush keeeps going until you press the bottom button. You can also start with the bottom button which will turn on the brush and keep it on as long as you hold it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, the bristles vibrate back and forth but do not spin at all (like the title suggests).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery compartment cap is difficult to get off. I was able to make it come off by not pulling it away from the brush bottom but instead prying it sideways from its wide side to pop it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, if you don&#x27;t mind a struggle when replacing batteries.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Truly Radiant Spin Brush for about two weeks now. Previously I used a regular manual Oral B Toothbrush. I do feel that this toothbrush gets my teeth much cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is battery powered and so far the battery that the toothbrush arrived with is still going strong so it seems to have a pretty good battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to have colorwear indicators to let you know when it is time to replace the head of the brush- which is also a nice feature.  Since I have only been using it two weeks I can not speak to the ease of finding replacement heads or the ease of replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can say about this brush is that I am not a fan of the switch to turn it on/off- I find that I occasionally turn it off accidentally while brushing. I guess I just need to retrain myself on how I hold the brush.</li>
            <li> On recommendation by my dentist, I have been using a SoniCare toothbrush for years.  It has been more effective in reducing plaque than manual brushing.  But traveling with that toothbrush, which requires a plug-in charging base, is not really practical.  Believing that this toothbrush would be easier to take and use during my travels, I was delighted to have an opportunity to use and evaluate it.  Comparisons between this toothbrush and my SoniCare were inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After opening the sealed plastic package, the first thing I did was pop off the bottom to see what was powering this toothbrush.  It contained two Duracell AA copper top cells.  For travel, it is much simpler for me to replace the AA cells than to haul a charging base.  Next, I evaluated its brushing action.  Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have a small mouth because the head of this toothbrush is about the size of a manual toothbrush, comes without a cover and is significantly larger than the small head on my SoniCare.  Unlike the single ON/OFF button on my SoniCare, this toothbrush has separate \\&quot;ON\\&quot; and \\&quot;OFF\\&quot; buttons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from those differences, I found the brushing action to be vigorous and effective.  The head of this toothbrush might be too large for a child or small person, but I found this toothbrush easier to use and more effective than a manual toothbrush.  Although I would not trade my SoniCare toothbrush for this one, this entire \\&quot;Spinbrush\\&quot; (which vibrates but does not spin) costs less than a replacement head for my SoniCare and is much more practical for traveling.  For any adult who is looking for a low-cost or travel alternative to the more expensive rechargeable sonic-type toothbrushes, I believe that this one is viable.</li>
            <li> First: This is not a spinbrush. Nothing spinds. It does&#x27;t move in a circular motion. It vibrates, much likle the popular Sonic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Phillips Sonicbrush for years and recently decided to try their new battery operated option, because the cost of replacing the heads for the rechargable version seemed expensive. And I love trhe battery operated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that other companies are putting out battery operated versions, to compete, I guess. This version seems to work fne. I&#x27;m hno dentist, so I can&#x27;t vouch for how effective it is on plaque or how well it works on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that this item seems cheap. Pressing the on button, it seemed to depress about halfway through the body, much like when the breaks on your car are going bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also just seems bigger, clunkier and less refined than the Phillips Bettery operated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably a few dollars more to buy the Phillips. I would stick with that.</li>
