    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Roses smell great</li>
            <li>thank you for a quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li>The Rose Otto has a wonderful scent - I cannot wait to make a batch of face cream for my mother-in-love.</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>Weleda has also a very good Rose oil.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice compromise and a great addition to aromatherapy skin recipes.</li>
            <li>Loved the fact that jojoba was used as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I too am a senior and it is wonderful in keeping my skin looking fresh and glowing and smooths out the eye area.</li>
            <li>A favorite!</li>
            <li>Perhaps that is the most soul-satisfying aspect of all!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, and it is very strong, which is great.</li>
            <li>Great, light scent.</li>
            <li>Kind of a mid-note, well-balanced rose smell, not cloying or too earthy.</li>
            <li>Nice to have both.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice</li>
            <li>Love it,... for a rose it smells woody, and jammy/fruity to me.</li>
            <li>I love this Rose Otto with Jojoba.</li>
            <li>This brand is my favorite.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>but I thought there would be more of a similarity.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and seller even sent a follow up correspondence to make sure I was happy with my transaction.</li>
            <li>and since it is already diluted to a safe percentage makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product for skin care and aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>I like feeling good about knowing what is being absorbed into my body.</li>
            <li>I will for sure be ordering it again and again.</li>
            <li>At the time I purchased  Rose Otto, I did not see the Rose Absolute.</li>
            <li>I loved it even my guy thought it smelled just like real roses.</li>
            <li>Pure rose otto is beyond most of our price ranges.</li>
            <li>Overall, quite happy.</li>
            <li>this essential oil is great.  </li>
            <li>2)Readily available.</li>
            <li>This particular Rose oil is also balancing to the emotions, a bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this essential rose Otto.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is not 100% pure rose otto (which I am okay with considering it takes 60,000 roses to make one pound of pure rose oil or 30 roses per drop, which is why pure is super expensive), but it is still super fragrant and has wonderful effects on my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it smells like roses, or really sweet at all.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed to complete my rose face cream.</li>
            <li>So, affordable, handy, effective, and one in the teeth for corporate control of modern life.</li>
            <li>Pretty scent, not too strong though.</li>
            <li>A good price for real rose, lasts long enough for a natural.</li>
            <li>I have smelled in the past the Rose Absolute, and this was heavenly smelling, more like a rose should smell.</li>
            <li>This particular blend is formulated with a quite costly oil, rose otto (or attar), a personal favorite.</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin most creams and oils give me a reaction but this does not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this oil, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for an expected.</li>
            <li>I like the Aura Cacia Essential Brand, but I do not like this particular essence, Rose Otto.  </li>
            <li>it was ok i just wish the bottle was  a bit bigger,i only hope thing get better for me,i am very  much in need of a jobs money and inner peace</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this essential oil!  </li>
            <li>However, I am now quite satisfied with this product for the following reasons:</li>
            <li>I use this everyday on my skin (blended with rose hip seed oil, after cleansing with Cerave delicate face wash and Thayer&#x27;s Alcohol-Free Rose Witch Hazel Toner) and it has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is strong enough to stay fragrant over time, including when I use it on my essential oil diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers have noted that the rose fragrance in this blend is neither strong nor lasting, which caused me to deliberate before ordering.</li>
            <li>I would like to see the percentage of pure label oil in each bottle.</li>
            <li>I understand the Otto doesn&#x27;t smell like roses as much as Absolute does</li>
            <li>i purchased this product from a store, but paid twice as much.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It smells kind of gross to me actually.</li>
            <li>10% probably isn&#x27;t high enough to be therapeutic or to impart a lasting scent to any lotions or perfume you make with it, but straight on the skin it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>Probably my least favorite of all my oils right now</li>
            <li>Order online or buy from Whole Foods, Sprouts, or similar outlets.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the use of essentials oils acts, for me, as an unbroken link to a past when our ancestors relied more than we do on natural products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell is amazing and a little tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>I try to live this way as much as possible.</li>
            <li>While it is admittedly composed mainly of jojoba oil, it contains enough essential oil (and I also use jasmine from the same company, to which the same applies) to satisfy me that the active principles are available.</li>
            <li>I employ both oils as a facial moisturizer for my aging skin and feel quite convinced that the rose/jasmine is protecting the delicate skin around my eyes in a way more commercial products would not.</li>
            <li>I am disappointed that neither Neroli Oil nor Rose Otto from this company states the percentage of pure oil in these mixtures.  </li>

            <li> Roses smell great so why not smell them all the time! You will love it. I guarantee on my honor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells like roses, or really sweet at all. It smells kind of gross to me actually. I understand the Otto doesn&#x27;t smell like roses as much as Absolute does but I thought there would be more of a similarity.

            <li> Great, light scent. Pre blended into jojoba oil. Works well. Fast shipping, and seller even sent a follow up correspondence to make sure I was happy with my transaction. Those little things make a difference. Overall, quite happy.</li>
            <li> I too use this product for facial-skin care. After cleansing face and before any other products. I too am a senior and it is wonderful in keeping my skin looking fresh and glowing and smooths out the eye area. I use no other products other than a cleanser and UV cream. This particular Rose oil is also balancing to the emotions, a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hooray for all her other comments about natural products and not making the corporations richer by using artificial products. I try to live this way as much as possible.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product from a store, but paid twice as much.  thank you for a quality product at a great price.</li>
            <li> When I received the packaged, majority of it was already spilled out into the foam.</li>
            <li> Love this essential rose Otto.  Moderate smell, but oil last a long time. Just need a few drops. Weleda has also a very good Rose oil.  Nice to have both. Makes your day less stressful.</li>
            <li> I like the Aura Cacia Essential Brand, but I do not like this particular essence, Rose Otto.  I should have listened to others reviews about the fragrance.  I have smelled in the past the Rose Absolute, and this was heavenly smelling, more like a rose should smell. At the time I purchased  Rose Otto, I did not see the Rose Absolute. Due to the odd smell, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> it was ok i just wish the bottle was  a bit bigger,i only hope thing get better for me,i am very  much in need of a jobs money and inner peace</li>

            <li> The Rose Otto has a wonderful scent - I cannot wait to make a batch of face cream for my mother-in-love.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product for skin care and aromatherapy. Yes, it is not 100% pure rose otto (which I am okay with considering it takes 60,000 roses to make one pound of pure rose oil or 30 roses per drop, which is why pure is super expensive), but it is still super fragrant and has wonderful effects on my skin. I use this everyday on my skin (blended with rose hip seed oil, after cleansing with Cerave delicate face wash and Thayer&#x27;s Alcohol-Free Rose Witch Hazel Toner) and it has never looked better. I actually returned all my Men&#x27;s Clinique products after starting to use this. I&#x27;ve notice my skin texture, tone, and oiliness improving dramatically and I like feeling good about knowing what is being absorbed into my body.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that neither Neroli Oil nor Rose Otto from this company states the percentage of pure oil in these mixtures.  I need to know this for therapeutic applications.  I would like to see the percentage of pure label oil in each bottle.</li>
            <li> I loved it even my guy thought it smelled just like real roses. I use it on the area around my eyes and face. I have very sensitive skin most creams and oils give me a reaction but this does not. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to complete my rose face cream. Loved the fact that jojoba was used as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I use this in the making of candles, bath salts, perfumes, oils and lotions. It&#x27;s smell is amazing and a little tiny bit goes a very long way. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this Rose Otto with Jojoba. It smells so good and is so moisturizing. I will for sure be ordering it again and again.</li>
            <li> Writing as one who formerly blended essentials oils for sale in England, I both know the oils well and their approximate value. This particular blend is formulated with a quite costly oil, rose otto (or attar), a personal favorite. Other reviewers have noted that the rose fragrance in this blend is neither strong nor lasting, which caused me to deliberate before ordering. However, I am now quite satisfied with this product for the following reasons: 1)Convenience. Comes in a small bottle (.5 fl. oz.) convenient for carrying in one&#x27;s purse. 2)Readily available. Order online or buy from Whole Foods, Sprouts, or similar outlets. 3)Affordable. While it is admittedly composed mainly of jojoba oil, it contains enough essential oil (and I also use jasmine from the same company, to which the same applies) to satisfy me that the active principles are available. I employ both oils as a facial moisturizer for my aging skin and feel quite convinced that the rose/jasmine is protecting the delicate skin around my eyes in a way more commercial products would not. 4. Lastly, the use of essentials oils acts, for me, as an unbroken link to a past when our ancestors relied more than we do on natural products. It&#x27;s my way of bucking the trend to industrial foods, genetically modified ingredients and Big Pharma. Perhaps that is the most soul-satisfying aspect of all! So, affordable, handy, effective, and one in the teeth for corporate control of modern life. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, and it is very strong, which is great. A few drops go very far!</li>
