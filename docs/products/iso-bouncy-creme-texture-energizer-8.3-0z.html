            <li>It is great.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing for curly hair!</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have used Bouncy Creme for 20 plus years, love it, and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>so you look nice.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get this product at a great price and quick via Prime!</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love ISO bouncy creme.</li>
            <li>Need more firmness to get some texture.</li>
            <li>Mostly it works well, although if I want my hair to have more body and curl I use a mousse made for curly hair.</li>
            <li>and this makes it look and feel more manageable and not as unruly or frizzy.  </li>
            <li>i have very curly hair and am always on the search for a good leave in conditioner at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best product I have used.</li>
            <li>It keeps your curls hydrated and frizz free.</li>
            <li>after using a generous amount of iso bouncy and a dime size of argan oil, on my hair my curls stay frizz free.</li>
            <li>The product is great but it shipped in packaging without protection that caused the bottle to open and spill out and the pump did not work.</li>
            <li>I now look no further - ISO is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for putting on right out of the shower and letting it air dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>Has a fresh scent to it that stays in your hair for days.</li>
            <li>Even applying Argan oil first didn&#x27;t help soften the texture.</li>
            <li>Not only did it work, but it worked BETTER than many more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have 2A/3C curls, and just a small amount of this works great to allow me to use second and even third-day hair.</li>
            <li>It works well in my naturally curly hair regardless of how I am styling it, straight or curly.</li>
            <li>It does leave behind some build up, but a good clarifying shampoo takes care of that.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to Bouncy Creme by an buddy and this product is hands down top quality for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I live in the the north east and the humidity in the summer</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stand the new scent.</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and touchable but intact and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>It keeps my natural curly hair from being frizzy and helps it style.</li>
            <li>It does not flake, your hair will feel soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>It probably works well for people with naturally soft curls.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone, especially with curly hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff like so many other \\&quot;well-intentioned\\&quot;  products that claim to enhance curls and eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair too soft and does not add enough body.  </li>
            <li>IT IS THE ONLY product that creates those spiral type curls for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep frizz down as well for my dry, super curly hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this cream. I used to use mousse which always left my hair crunchy and I got tired of that look. I switched to this which I use with a little bit of protein gel (Pro Styl) and its been like a hair transformation. My curls are soft and touchable but intact and not frizzy. Its def a different look than what I am used to but I love it! Also, this cream smells great! Has a fresh scent to it that stays in your hair for days. I have 2B-2C hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have wavy hair and the bouncy creme keeps the curls and waves in without drying my hair out or leaving a flaky mess.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of extra body the cream give to wet hair. I dry mine before curling/styling. After curling, the curls seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> I have used Bouncy Creme for 20 plus years, love it, and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I love ISO bouncy creme. It works well in my naturally curly hair regardless of how I am styling it, straight or curly. It is hands down the best product I have used.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair too soft and does not add enough body.  Need more firmness to get some texture.</li>
            <li> She loves this stuff..and always get it from Amazon</li>
            <li> I have been using this on and off for about a year.  Mostly it works well, although if I want my hair to have more body and curl I use a mousse made for curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to give my hair some extra bounce and define curls and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Not only did it work, but it worked BETTER than many more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried. Love that I can get this product at a great price and quick via Prime!</li>

            <li> This is my go-to product for second-day curls! I have 2A/3C curls, and just a small amount of this works great to allow me to use second and even third-day hair. I just wet it with a lavendar mist and apply about 2 pumps of this stuff...miraculous! Love it!</li>
            <li> I had to go online to find this product. It keeps my natural curly hair from being frizzy and helps it style.</li>
            <li> Hard to believe but I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably 15 yrs. AT LEAST.  IT IS THE ONLY product that creates those spiral type curls for my naturally curly hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff like so many other \\&quot;well-intentioned\\&quot;  products that claim to enhance curls and eliminate frizz.</li>

            <li> Came on time.  I use this in my hair to make it stay in place.  It is great.  Does not gum up the hair and keeps it in place so you look nice.</li>
