            <li>I love the Aussie shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love all their products and this one does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li>This is a great buy for people who are responsible for buying hair care products for many people in one house.</li>
            <li>Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li>Some of them were OKAY</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product but won&#x27;t buy it again online.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; items are close to, or better, on their prices than most places, but they sure missed the mark on this one...</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>You will not find a better deal on this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have always enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I love the way it leaves our hair feeling and smelling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a Redkin lover but for the price, it leaves me feeling a bit worked over.  </li>
            <li>It goes a long way and is the best price per ounce that I have found.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and is in a large size, which I love.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shampoo, great smell, soft and floral.</li>
            <li>I also find the fragrance added to this product (aussie moist) a bit strong for my liking which the john frieda did not have.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down (shampoo or conditioner).  </li>
            <li>I have oily, fine, hair that is almost like a child&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I use very little shampoo and way too much conditioner every week to keep my hair in good health so these pumps are perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Love Aussie, great for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the Aussie shampoo, and even more now that I&#x27;ve found it in a large bottle with a pump.  </li>
            <li>I ended up switching to an organic based shampoo that was sulfate free in the end, but overall a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>But just for the extra volume i use \\&quot;Aussie Aussome volume hairspray\\&quot; and that works great to volumize my hair.</li>
            <li>it really helps your hair and the price is amazing</li>
            <li>But my hair did not feel smooth after using this for a while.</li>
            <li>Please continue to make this size, include the pump, and have it available in&amp;#34;Moist.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My hair is always soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a very good strong smell that last ALL DAY and really moisturizes your hair!</li>
            <li>So I decided to pick up the 2 big pump bottles of Aussie&#x27;s moist shampoo and conditioner - I AM IN LOVE!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the low price I paid for this quality, fast shipping and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find that the large volume 29.2 oz versions are available online with the subscribe &amp; save option.  </li>
            <li>But - shampoo is supposed to get my hair clean.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a not quite clean feeling without producing any noticeable results in terms of body and shine.  </li>
            <li>have recently noticed that this product is EVEN better when used with &amp;#34;soft water&amp;#34; but still works great with a great lather in hard water.</li>
            <li>I love harsh shampoos (neutrogena, head and shoulders, etc) which give me a really clean feeling that I honestly have not been able to replicate with moisturing shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Works very good, does not require much shampoo to wash long hair.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be on your way to thick looking beautiful hair!  </li>
            <li>Aussie, you did it again, this shampoos makes my hair so silky soft, I even feel a nice tingling when using it.  </li>
            <li>I do a lot to my hair, like bleaching and dying and straightening everyday, and this shampoo and conditioner just takes away any damage and replaces it with strong and great smelling hair.</li>
            <li>smells pretty strong.</li>
            <li>My hair gets oily really quick</li>
            <li>the best (daily shampoo and conditioner) as it had several benefits:</li>
            <li>the product is good too, pretty standard shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair feeling very light after it dries, and so so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use a cheap clarifying shampoo just to prevent any normal build up on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells awesome, its not very strong, more of a subtle sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I use about 3 pumps of this shampoo, which makes my hair super clean and not heavy or greasy or anything.</li>
            <li>I have very very baby fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li>I love products that actually &#x27;do&#x27; what they say they are suppose too.</li>
            <li>T-Gel did not worked for me, it made the scalp more itchy the next day.</li>
            <li>This Aussie product gives the same effect but for a fraction of the price and Amazon&#x27;s specials make it an even better buy.  </li>
            <li>And even though it adds moisture it actually feels VERY light and VERY</li>
            <li>This is my goto shampoo, because I think it is a good medium between something that would be a lot more expensive-- like paul mitchell, and something that would be a lot cheaper-- like suave.</li>
            <li>Have used this for a long time and still love it.  </li>
            <li>My hair does not get dry at all, but I wanted to try this shampoo because of the smell and because I love Aussie products.</li>
            <li>At lease it is a large bottle so it not like you have to buy it every month.</li>
            <li>I am stuck with 3 large bottles</li>
            <li>Its very pleasent.</li>
            <li>It will do great if you have thin hair no matter what.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it up fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived fast well packaged.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and its corresponding conditioner has really helped with the texture (4 c hair type), making it easier to comb through after washing, even after rinsing the conditioner out the curls remain defined.  </li>
            <li>I also used the hair insurance (heat protectant spray) which I also really like as well.</li>
            <li>I have very sensetive skin, and all shampoos irritate my scalp, except for this one.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t care what i wash my hair with.  </li>
            <li>not so much so that I will stop using it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and moisturized without making it greasy, which is great because pretty much every moisturizing shampoo i have ever tried made my hair seriously greasy!  </li>
            <li>usually I have to switch after a few months, but this one is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good shampoo, but suddenly there&#x27;s a whole lot less of it.</li>
            <li>So basicly it smells like sweet yummy candy with a hint of coconut.</li>
            <li>(and it does live up to its 100 uses claim!).</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found any other one that gives me that kind of quality for the same price.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gives my hair so much moisture and offers a lot of slip.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give more information.  </li>
            <li>These bottles last me for a few months, and this \\&quot;Moist\\&quot; brand does a good job to keep the natural dryness and stiffness of my hair under control.</li>
            <li>Aussie takes this to a new level.  </li>
            <li>plus I like using trying out new smells).</li>
            <li>no more putting it on a list and making sure to get to the store before you run out.  </li>
            <li>Coming out of the shower with my hair smelling like a giant Pina Colada doesn&#x27;t exactly inspire confidence.  </li>
            <li>With the conditioner it makes my hair ridiculously soft and smooth, other shampoos make my hair poofy and fluffy and they make my layers frizzy, but this tames my hair and makes it easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad since we now have a bottle and a half left of this  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even been using a conditioner because the shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>i have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>/&gt;2)Never requires a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;3)Smells like a natural product (not</li>
            <li>a chemical).&lt;br /&gt;4)Makes my hair completely manageable.</li>
            <li>I believe if you have a oily and itchy scalp, and sensitive then dandruff shampoos will make it worst.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw this on Prime and at that volume/price, I didn&#x27;t really need to look any further for shampoo.</li>
            <li>The new pump bottles -- which sell at similar prices to the original pump bottles -- contain a whopping 20% less product than they used to.  </li>
            <li>changed to regular shampoo after my doctor asked me to use a regular good moisture shampoo since my dandruff is caused due to less moisture in the scalp.</li>
            <li>There has been no dramatic changed in my hair, good  or bad.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I recently turned 30 and my hair was beginning to lose its natural shine.  </li>
            <li>For the same price of the old \\&quot;125</li>
            <li>I have medium to long normal hair that becomes dry because I live in the desert</li>
            <li>And then I use this combined with the Moist conditioner and not only do I not have to use extra products but it just feels sooo soft and takes away some of the bulky volume I fight (even with layered hair) and creates style as oppose to frizz.</li>
            <li>So, I cannot rate it as a person with dry hair, and the effectiveness it has with dry hair, but if you are a person with fine/oily hair, you really should try this shampoo.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I was pleased to find that the large volume 29.2 oz versions are available online with the subscribe &amp; save option.  </li>
            <li> But - shampoo is supposed to get my hair clean.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a not quite clean feeling without producing any noticeable results in terms of body and shine.  </li>
            <li> have recently noticed that this product is EVEN better when used with &amp;#34;soft water&amp;#34; but still works great with a great lather in hard water.</li>
            <li> I love harsh shampoos (neutrogena, head and shoulders, etc) which give me a really clean feeling that I honestly have not been able to replicate with moisturing shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Works very good, does not require much shampoo to wash long hair.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be on your way to thick looking beautiful hair!  </li>
            <li> Aussie, you did it again, this shampoos makes my hair so silky soft, I even feel a nice tingling when using it.  </li>
            <li> I do a lot to my hair, like bleaching and dying and straightening everyday, and this shampoo and conditioner just takes away any damage and replaces it with strong and great smelling hair.</li>
            <li> smells pretty strong.</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily really quick</li>
            <li> the best (daily shampoo and conditioner) as it had several benefits:</li>
            <li> the product is good too, pretty standard shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair feeling very light after it dries, and so so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use a cheap clarifying shampoo just to prevent any normal build up on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells awesome, its not very strong, more of a subtle sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I use about 3 pumps of this shampoo, which makes my hair super clean and not heavy or greasy or anything.</li>
            <li> I have very very baby fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li> I love products that actually &#x27;do&#x27; what they say they are suppose too.</li>
            <li> T-Gel did not worked for me, it made the scalp more itchy the next day.</li>
            <li> This Aussie product gives the same effect but for a fraction of the price and Amazon&#x27;s specials make it an even better buy.  </li>
            <li> And even though it adds moisture it actually feels VERY light and VERY</li>
            <li> This is my goto shampoo, because I think it is a good medium between something that would be a lot more expensive-- like paul mitchell, and something that would be a lot cheaper-- like suave.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a long time and still love it.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not get dry at all, but I wanted to try this shampoo because of the smell and because I love Aussie products.</li>
            <li> At lease it is a large bottle so it not like you have to buy it every month.</li>
            <li> I am stuck with 3 large bottles</li>
            <li> Its very pleasent.</li>
            <li> It will do great if you have thin hair no matter what.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it up fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived fast well packaged.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and its corresponding conditioner has really helped with the texture (4 c hair type), making it easier to comb through after washing, even after rinsing the conditioner out the curls remain defined.  </li>
            <li> I also used the hair insurance (heat protectant spray) which I also really like as well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensetive skin, and all shampoos irritate my scalp, except for this one.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t care what i wash my hair with.  </li>
            <li> not so much so that I will stop using it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and moisturized without making it greasy, which is great because pretty much every moisturizing shampoo i have ever tried made my hair seriously greasy!  </li>
            <li> usually I have to switch after a few months, but this one is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good shampoo, but suddenly there&#x27;s a whole lot less of it.</li>
            <li> So basicly it smells like sweet yummy candy with a hint of coconut.</li>
            <li> (and it does live up to its 100 uses claim!).</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found any other one that gives me that kind of quality for the same price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives my hair so much moisture and offers a lot of slip.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give more information.  </li>
            <li> These bottles last me for a few months, and this \\&quot;Moist\\&quot; brand does a good job to keep the natural dryness and stiffness of my hair under control.</li>
            <li> Aussie takes this to a new level.  </li>
            <li> plus I like using trying out new smells).</li>
            <li> no more putting it on a list and making sure to get to the store before you run out.  </li>
            <li> Coming out of the shower with my hair smelling like a giant Pina Colada doesn&#x27;t exactly inspire confidence.  </li>
            <li> With the conditioner it makes my hair ridiculously soft and smooth, other shampoos make my hair poofy and fluffy and they make my layers frizzy, but this tames my hair and makes it easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad since we now have a bottle and a half left of this  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even been using a conditioner because the shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> i have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> /&gt;2)Never requires a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;3)Smells like a natural product (not</li>
            <li> a chemical).&lt;br /&gt;4)Makes my hair completely manageable.</li>
            <li> I believe if you have a oily and itchy scalp, and sensitive then dandruff shampoos will make it worst.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw this on Prime and at that volume/price, I didn&#x27;t really need to look any further for shampoo.</li>
            <li> The new pump bottles -- which sell at similar prices to the original pump bottles -- contain a whopping 20% less product than they used to.  </li>
            <li> changed to regular shampoo after my doctor asked me to use a regular good moisture shampoo since my dandruff is caused due to less moisture in the scalp.</li>
            <li> There has been no dramatic changed in my hair, good  or bad.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I recently turned 30 and my hair was beginning to lose its natural shine.  </li>
            <li> For the same price of the old \\&quot;125</li>
            <li> I have medium to long normal hair that becomes dry because I live in the desert</li>
            <li> And then I use this combined with the Moist conditioner and not only do I not have to use extra products but it just feels sooo soft and takes away some of the bulky volume I fight (even with layered hair) and creates style as oppose to frizz.</li>
            <li> So, I cannot rate it as a person with dry hair, and the effectiveness it has with dry hair, but if you are a person with fine/oily hair, you really should try this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick, I cant get 100 uses, but its VERY close!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone, especially those who have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing my hair with Aussie for a long, long time - and I always stock up.  </li>
            <li> But this is one of the few products that I have found on Amazon that is more expensive on Amazon than it is at my local retailer.  </li>
            <li> I only wash my hair with the shampoo every other day and use the conditioner in between days</li>
            <li> neither dry nor oily.</li>
            <li> Excellet for dry hair and that faces</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste the shampoo and by the end of the bottle my hair was starting to look like it hadn&#x27;t been washed for days (my hair gets so oily it NEEDS to be washed on a daily basis).</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that there is A LOT left in the container once you get down to the end, so to use it all you need to throw away the pump and shake it upside, which is not ideal (but is the case with many hair products).</li>
            <li> 2 and a half years later</li>
            <li> The pump keeps working until the last little bit is gone.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when this shampoo left my hair cleaner and with less buildup than any other shampoo I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Well I guess it doesnt matter if you hair is Naturally thin, or thinning cause of older age or stress.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I have extremely thick, DRY, coarse horse-like texture hair.</li>
            <li> (of course this is mainly due to my water intake).  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same shampoo &amp; conditioner for the past year</li>
            <li> There are two 30 ounce bottles - I swear this is going to last me at least a year.</li>
            <li> Even worse, I take a shower in the early evening.</li>
            <li> hair was easier to style when I did style after using, hair was shiner, there was some residue to my hair after use but minimal and the least of the three that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Sorry guys - you lost a VERY long term customer this time.</li>
            <li> Of the three, I like aussie the least.  </li>
            <li> I did not liked the smell though.</li>
            <li> so im not experiencing hair loss, I just have Naturally thin hair.</li>
            <li> I hope this help some of the people out there with thin hair.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this to anyone with oily and/or thin hair, but for anyone with my annoying hair type, I definitely would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> But the price is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> It stripped my hair just as bad as shampoo that doesn&#x27;t claim to moisturize.</li>
            <li> What were you thinking???  :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used to buy this in stores and its so nice to have it on amazon now.  I love that I order and it just shows up, no more putting it on a list and making sure to get to the store before you run out.  the product is good too, pretty standard shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good shampoo. One of the only ones that didn&#x27;t cause dandruff for me. I ended up switching to an organic based shampoo that was sulfate free in the end, but overall a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the Aussie shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair so soft and moisturized without making it greasy, which is great because pretty much every moisturizing shampoo i have ever tried made my hair seriously greasy!  This one doesn&#x27;t! Its wonderful!  And the smell is AMAZING!  I can describe it as a \\&quot;candied coconut\\&quot; kinda smell... So basicly it smells like sweet yummy candy with a hint of coconut. It smells awesome, its not very strong, more of a subtle sweet scent. Its very pleasent. I have very very baby fine/thin hair. And this surprisingly gives me some volume! But just for the extra volume i use \\&quot;Aussie Aussome volume hairspray\\&quot; and that works great to volumize my hair. Btw im not even in my 20s so im not experiencing hair loss, I just have Naturally thin hair. Well I guess it doesnt matter if you hair is Naturally thin, or thinning cause of older age or stress. It will do great if you have thin hair no matter what. Just pair it with the Aussie Aussome Volume hairspay and you&#x27;ll be on your way to thick looking beautiful hair!  I hope this help some of the people out there with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Aussie, you did it again, this shampoos makes my hair so silky soft, I even feel a nice tingling when using it.  I love all their products and this one does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give more information.  There has been no dramatic changed in my hair, good  or bad.  Pump is nice.</li>
            <li> i do love this shampoo - it&#x27;s my favorite kind - huge bottle, smells ok and a good deal when purchased in a set.  lasts me about a year i think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing my hair with Aussie for a long, long time - and I always stock up.  I guess I haven&#x27;t purchased it for a while bc the last bottle sitting in my shower was coffee colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought Aussie in the purple bottle. YUCK! Coming out of the shower with my hair smelling like a giant Pina Colada doesn&#x27;t exactly inspire confidence.  Even worse, I take a shower in the early evening. By the next morning, I can already smell my hair!  I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair: neither dry nor oily. Never colored it. My point is - it isn&#x27;t damaged. The only think I can attribute this to is shampoo residue.  I can&#x27;t use it up fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side: it IS NOT causing flaking, itching, or dryness. But - shampoo is supposed to get my hair clean. Sorry guys - you lost a VERY long term customer this time. What were you thinking???  :(</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily really quick but I bought this shampoo because I loved the smell and the reviews on here said it didn&#x27;t make hair oily - holy smokes my hair has never been so oily in my life!! I didn&#x27;t want to waste the shampoo and by the end of the bottle my hair was starting to look like it hadn&#x27;t been washed for days (my hair gets so oily it NEEDS to be washed on a daily basis). I hope I can find a different Aussie shampoo that won&#x27;t make my hair so gross.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I recently turned 30 and my hair was beginning to lose its natural shine.  It was explained to me that the dullness was likely related to shampoo (as I do not overstyle or heat damage, etc).  I love harsh shampoos (neutrogena, head and shoulders, etc) which give me a really clean feeling that I honestly have not been able to replicate with moisturing shampoos.  I have now tried aussie moist, bed head, and john frieda.  Of the three, I like aussie the least.  It gives my hair a not quite clean feeling without producing any noticeable results in terms of body and shine.  I liked John Frieda the best (daily shampoo and conditioner) as it had several benefits: hair was easier to style when I did style after using, hair was shiner, there was some residue to my hair after use but minimal and the least of the three that I have tried.  I also find the fragrance added to this product (aussie moist) a bit strong for my liking which the john frieda did not have.</li>
            <li> This product is just wonderful and give me an awesome hair day with every use! I love that it leaves my hair feeling clean without drying it out!!! I love that it can be bought in bulk cheaper than at walmart!!!</li>
            <li> A very nice item indeed. Well worth the low price I paid for this quality, fast shipping and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> This has become the shampoo I reach for on a regular basis now.  I haven&#x27;t even been using a conditioner because the shampoo leaves my hair soft and manageable.  Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I use.  Great product and price.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy for people who are responsible for buying hair care products for many people in one house. Works on may different hair types.</li>
            <li> We all know that it&#x27;s all the rage these days for manufacturers to down-size their products a bit rather than raising prices.  Aussie takes this to a new level.  The new pump bottles -- which sell at similar prices to the original pump bottles -- contain a whopping 20% less product than they used to.  For the same price of the old \\&quot;125 uses\\&quot; packages, you can now get a \\&quot;100 uses\\&quot; package.  It&#x27;s good shampoo, but suddenly there&#x27;s a whole lot less of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, along with its conditioner counterpart.  However I have always bought it in the stores until now.  I was pleased to find that the large volume 29.2 oz versions are available online with the subscribe &amp; save option.  These bottles last me for a few months, and this \\&quot;Moist\\&quot; brand does a good job to keep the natural dryness and stiffness of my hair under control.</li>
            <li> This has to be the absolute best shampoo I have ever used. The smell is great, the lather is wonderful, and someone can get up to 100 pumps from this one bottle, which is great! My hair is so thick, I cant get 100 uses, but its VERY close! These last for months, and the lather and smell never wear out. I would recommend this for anyone, especially those who have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> This is my goto shampoo, because I think it is a good medium between something that would be a lot more expensive-- like paul mitchell, and something that would be a lot cheaper-- like suave. It doesn&#x27;t over-dry my hair, and it has a pleasant smell. I also like the convenience of the pump bottle -- it lasts a while.Been using it for a while now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> ...I found it! I&#x27;ve tried Pantene (which isn&#x27;t even good for your hair), John Freida, Aveda, Garnier, Tresseme...you name it. Some of them were OKAY but none were great. I&#x27;ve tried mousses, leave-ins...everything. Anyways, I have extremely thick, DRY, coarse horse-like texture hair. And then I use this combined with the Moist conditioner and not only do I not have to use extra products but it just feels sooo soft and takes away some of the bulky volume I fight (even with layered hair) and creates style as oppose to frizz. And even though it adds moisture it actually feels VERY light and VERY clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone with oily and/or thin hair, but for anyone with my annoying hair type, I definitely would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve been using this for about 1.5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 2 and a half years later and I&#x27;m still using the same brand-usually I have to switch after a few months, but this one is great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for 6 years now and I haven&#x27;t found any other one that gives me that kind of quality for the same price. My hair is always soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is amazing it really helps your hair and the price is amazing i would recomend this shampoo its amazing.</li>
            <li> smells good, thats about it. i have a sensitive scalp but my sister doesn&#x27;t. this shampoo left the same burning affect on our scalp</li>
            <li> I have this shampoo along with the conditioner, and they work awesomely together. I use about 3 pumps of this shampoo, which makes my hair super clean and not heavy or greasy or anything. With the conditioner it makes my hair ridiculously soft and smooth, other shampoos make my hair poofy and fluffy and they make my layers frizzy, but this tames my hair and makes it easy to manage. I do a lot to my hair, like bleaching and dying and straightening everyday, and this shampoo and conditioner just takes away any damage and replaces it with strong and great smelling hair. I would recommend to anyone with color treated hair, curly hair, frizzy hair, bleached hair, basically any hair type!! :D</li>
            <li> At 57 I&#x27;ve used a lot of shampoos over the years. Aussie Moist is the ONLY one that does the following:&lt;br /&gt;1)Cleans my hair daily with no dryness.&lt;br /&gt;2)Never requires a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;3)Smells like a natural product (not a chemical).&lt;br /&gt;4)Makes my hair completely manageable.</li>
            <li> I have oily, fine, hair that is almost like a child&#x27;s hair. Because of my hair type, I have to switch shampoos often to minimize buildup (plus I like using trying out new smells). My hair does not get dry at all, but I wanted to try this shampoo because of the smell and because I love Aussie products. Imagine my surprise when this shampoo left my hair cleaner and with less buildup than any other shampoo I have ever tried! Honestly, I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t market this for oily hair! I have been using this shampoo now for over a year without switching to a different shampoo. It also leaves my hair feeling very light after it dries, and so so soft and shiny. So, I cannot rate it as a person with dry hair, and the effectiveness it has with dry hair, but if you are a person with fine/oily hair, you really should try this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: The smell is awesome (so clean smelling and you can smell it all day), it reduces buildup and leaves hair very light, and softens hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast well packaged.  Love Aussie, great for dry hair.  Have used this for a long time and still love it.  The pump is nice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and its corresponding conditioner has really helped with the texture (4 c hair type), making it easier to comb through after washing, even after rinsing the conditioner out the curls remain defined.  The scent is divine.  I will continue to purchase same.</li>
            <li> I just can not put in words how my hair LOVEs this product. Excellet for dry hair and that faces</li>
            <li> This shampoo gives my hair so much moisture and offers a lot of slip.  It&#x27;s almost as if I don&#x27;t need a conditioner after my wash, but I do use one any way.  I love the smell and the consistency of this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and I use it with the paired conditioner.  I have medium to long normal hair that becomes dry because I live in the desert (of course this is mainly due to my water intake).  I only wash my hair with the shampoo every other day and use the conditioner in between days so I don&#x27;t get build up.  About once every week or two (depending on if it&#x27;s winter or summer) I use a cheap clarifying shampoo just to prevent any normal build up on my hair.  This product is excellent and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down (shampoo or conditioner).  It goes a long way and is the best price per ounce that I have found.  The shampoo lasts me about 4 months and the conditioner about 2.5 months (but I sometimes use it when shaving my legs too!).  Smells great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently noticed that this product is EVEN better when used with &amp;#34;soft water&amp;#34; but still works great with a great lather in hard water.</li>
            <li> Works very good, does not require much shampoo to wash long hair.  Leaves no residue and hair shinny.  They reduced the size of the bottle but kept the same price, now this happened some months ago.  At lease it is a large bottle so it not like you have to buy it every month.</li>
            <li> smells pretty strong. But my hair did not feel smooth after using this for a while. I am stuck with 3 large bottles so i still use it from time to time, but would not buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years with some breaks for tea tree oil shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t strip ones hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same shampoo &amp; conditioner for the past year and I needed to switch it up because I believe my hair was getting too &#x27;used&#x27; to the products I was using therefore they weren&#x27;t working for my hair any longer. So I decided to pick up the 2 big pump bottles of Aussie&#x27;s moist shampoo and conditioner - I AM IN LOVE!! It&#x27;s has a very good strong smell that last ALL DAY and really moisturizes your hair! I love products that actually &#x27;do&#x27; what they say they are suppose too. I also used the hair insurance (heat protectant spray) which I also really like as well. Some of the comments I read about the shampoo said something about if you color your hair the shampoo will strip your hair - I would just like to inform everything that any drugstore shampoo/conditioner you use on your colored hair will strip your hair. If your finding shampoo that will keep your color you&#x27;ll need to go to a salon and get color stay products. But if your looking for an affordable and moisturizing shampoo/conditioner this product is for you!!</li>
            <li> The product was good I love it. But the price is way too expensive. I found the exactly same shampoo in target and it is just 4.99 dollars. Love the product but won&#x27;t buy it again online.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite some time and was wanting to add it to my subscribed deliveries, but what the heck is up with the $$$ on this item.  You can literally buy 4 bottles at Wal-Mart for the price of the 2 pack here.&lt;br /&gt;Normally the &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; items are close to, or better, on their prices than most places, but they sure missed the mark on this one...</li>
            <li> T-Gel did not worked for me, it made the scalp more itchy the next day. I believe if you have a oily and itchy scalp, and sensitive then dandruff shampoos will make it worst.&lt;br /&gt;I changed to regular shampoo after my doctor asked me to use a regular good moisture shampoo since my dandruff is caused due to less moisture in the scalp. After trying several brands, I tried &#x27;Aussie&#x27; which miraculously worked for me. No itch and No dandruff....!!!! Great product..I did not liked the smell though.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo &amp; conditioner because it smells good and is great for my curly hair.  I use very little shampoo and way too much conditioner every week to keep my hair in good health so these pumps are perfect for my needs.  The only complaint I have is that there is A LOT left in the container once you get down to the end, so to use it all you need to throw away the pump and shake it upside, which is not ideal (but is the case with many hair products).</li>
            <li> I have very sensetive skin, and all shampoos irritate my scalp, except for this one. It has a nice scent, that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and is in a large size, which I love. The value is great, and so is the delivery system. The pump keeps working until the last little bit is gone. Please continue to make this size, include the pump, and have it available in&amp;#34;Moist.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love the Aussie shampoo, and even more now that I&#x27;ve found it in a large bottle with a pump.  So convenient.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo, great smell, soft and floral. It is one of the best moisturizing shampoo&#x27;s on the market. Plus the price was perfect!  .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man so I really don&#x27;t care what i wash my hair with.  I saw this on Prime and at that volume/price, I didn&#x27;t really need to look any further for shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Shampoo for years.  I love this product.  But this is one of the few products that I have found on Amazon that is more expensive on Amazon than it is at my local retailer.  I can go to Wal-Mart or Target &amp; get it for between $4.97 to $5.97 a bottle.  I would recommend getting this at your local retailer than here.&lt;br /&gt;  Regardless of where you get it, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I seldom use anything else.</li>
            <li> You will not find a better deal on this shampoo. There are two 30 ounce bottles - I swear this is going to last me at least a year.</li>
            <li> This did not work well for me at all. It stripped my hair just as bad as shampoo that doesn&#x27;t claim to moisturize. It left my hair tangled and in need of A LOT of conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My fiance uses it now (short hair) and it works well for him. I&#x27;m glad since we now have a bottle and a half left of this  (and it does live up to its 100 uses claim!).</li>
            <li> I like the amount, and the way it makes my hair feel. The smell is a bit chemical-y though, which is off-putting but not so much so that I will stop using it.</li>
            <li> I love it, It&#x27;s the best shampoo..... My hair is beautiful thanks to aussie!!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very good and I have 0 frizz!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have always enjoyed using it.  My daughter and I love the way it leaves our hair feeling and smelling.  I&#x27;m more of a Redkin lover but for the price, it leaves me feeling a bit worked over.  This Aussie product gives the same effect but for a fraction of the price and Amazon&#x27;s specials make it an even better buy.  Pair this with the conditioner and it&#x27;s superb.</li>
