            <li>excellent  </li>
            <li>I asked my stylist what shampoo would be the best.</li>
            <li>and I asked my hairstylist what the best color protector shampoo and conditioner was.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo for anyone with colored hair.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell products are all great products; this one included</li>
            <li>and  fly away.  </li>

            <li>Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It feels good when you apply it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product for some time.</li>
            <li>It does add a lot of body, but not the good kind.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel that this shampoo is effectively cleaning my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it is very fine</li>
            <li>The stylist had great things to say and having used PM styling products I thought it was a smart buy.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>i love the product</li>
            <li>Anybody have any suggestions about this or maybe another product that is better</li>
            <li>After checking online I&#x27;ve discovered that it seems to be an issue that many people have and it looks like its just the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Something you could buy at the drug store is better.</li>
            <li>Have had MORE compliments on the gray than on the brown coloring AND the way the shampoo made my hair look.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a better product from this company.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>You can get greasy hair for free!</li>
            <li>Amazon has, by far, the best price for the large size.  </li>
            <li>I too thought I was not washing it out cleanly and tried again, making sure I rinsed my hair.</li>
            <li>This was a great value - much better thank purchasing in my local beauty store.  </li>
            <li>If you shampoo your hair daily this will be perfect for it is so very gentle</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell either.  </li>
            <li>This was not the case after the first use and I was very excited.</li>
            <li>I try to purchase products which meet this standard, and which also gives good results when used.</li>
            <li>It really helps keep color in and is gentle and cleans her long hair wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>The two larger shampoo bottles is a pretty good deal from Amazon (and free shipping).</li>
            <li>Works great and really does help color last longer.</li>
            <li>I am aware that many salon shampoos don&#x27;t lather the way drugstore ones do, so I certainly could have lived with that.  </li>
            <li>I had previously been using the Nexxus color protectant shampoo with great results</li>
            <li>When I used it I noticed significantly less dye washing out in the shower and thought that it would be great.</li>
            <li>I rely on this shampoo and can order it economically online.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I originally thought I was using too much conditioner, but have gradually stopped using the conditioner all together</li>
            <li>If you color your hair get the right shampoo or your hair color will fade.</li>
            <li>This is the right stuff believe me</li>
            <li>The first time I washed my hair it felt kind of gross and greasy</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll quickly find that many others have had similar issues with this</li>
            <li>Good price but not worth it.</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe I hadn&#x27;t rinsed it out</li>
            <li>I have had people comment on how pretty my hair smells.</li>
            <li>I have had the same experience as many others reviewing this product.  </li>
            <li>When I switched to Paul Mitchell Color Protect, the first thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t lather.  </li>
            <li>Now I can get my hair to hang straight and not flying around like it has ststic in It!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I am a former Pantene Pro-V Natural Fusion user, and I liked that product, but I thought I should switch to a gentler shampoo to protect my color and keep my long hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>It does require a long rinsing out, but my hair is so healthy</li>
            <li>If anyone is wondering, I have very thick, full and healthy hair, I saw a review mentioning fine hair</li>
            <li>I really like the Color Protect Shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>BUT for my wife, she really loves this shampoo and won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on color processed hair.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much shampoo...</li>
            <li>--this makes it real shiny and controllable.</li>
            <li>My hair gets very greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day.</li>
            <li>but if I left it to its own devices my hair would look as if I hadn&#x27;t showered in several days.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is also better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>must say, though, that during the first week of use, my fine, wavy (and color treated) hair developed a thicker texture that held flat ironing and styling</li>
            <li>If you style your hair everyday then this might be the shampoo for you as it helped do up-dos very easily, but if you tend to wash and go (like me) in the mornings then I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li>(my wife first tried Just For Men and THAT took hours to do), then I went to a professional and just wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $50.00, which included the tip, each month so let it go completely gray.  </li>
            <li>I recently dyed my hair red, and as most of you know, if you don&#x27;t upkeep it, it will fade fast.</li>
            <li>It said it was good for daily use, which I need because my hair gets very oily and not washing it everyday</li>
            <li>but I was able to wear it down still.  </li>
            <li>Decent value.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s something in those reviewers&#x27; water that is interacting with this particular shampoo?  </li>
            <li>This is ultra gentle shampoo with lots of natural extracts.  </li>
            <li>Steer clear.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended Paul Mitchell Color Protect Shampoo after I had my hair colored its natural brown so that the greys were all covered up.</li>
            <li>all you really need is to add an extra pump or two of shampoo to your hair and massage in  </li>
            <li>it looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in days even directly after blow</li>
            <li>and it keeps my hair moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>At first found my hair to be easier to comb and manage, but each time I wash my hair, it continues to be greasy after it is dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, wavy hair that straightens easily and usually feels silky after styling.</li>
            <li>two quick scrubbings with just a little shampoo each time</li>
            <li>I was so excited, especially when she told me I could use it everyday..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m upset I spent so much on it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo will not make a lot of suds--maybe other people are using too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning to my drugstore habits, and I&#x27;m pretty bummed out that I wasted $30 on this shampoo and conditioner.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li> While that was frustrating, my hair would take a washing or two with different shampoo/conditioner to return to a normal state.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product, I went back to my regular Nexxus and my hair feels fine.</li>
            <li> I then used the conditioner with another shampoo and in a few days it was back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I went to work and had to deal with flat, dull, gross feeling hair all day.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve enjoyed Paul Mitchell hair products but this one was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair dry and oddly unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t think of using any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use other Paul Mitchell products and like them, but not this one.</li>
            <li> I continued using both products and found that my hair was extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> it was so gross and greasy, even with blow drying, that I had to wear it up and shouldn&#x27;t have even wasted time washing it because it looked cleaner before I showered!</li>
            <li> I went to the salon the other day to get my haircut</li>
            <li> After i dried my hair or air dry</li>
            <li> I think peoples dirty hair issues is because this is a low low sulfate and very low lather shampoo</li>
            <li> To the point I don&#x27;t even want to where my hair down</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff for about a week, rinsing longer and longer while using less and less product each day.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry</li>
            <li> After using this with the matching conditioner my hair would feel dirty and very greasy.</li>
            <li> my hair would feels dirty and very greasy after using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> However, when I blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but I will be discontinuing use of these products ASAP.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, my hair looks and feels worse after washing than it did before.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it felt super heavy and greasy and looked awful!</li>
            <li> At least, not at this point.</li>
            <li> Can I give this product a negative star?</li>
            <li> Left my hair dirty and greasy(and</li>
            <li> You could even feel the dirty gritty, greasy texture in my hair.</li>
            <li> With this product, it feels dirty, dry and sort of gummy.</li>
            <li> other thing i noticed was that my hair even smelled dirty.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling dirty and extremely greasy!</li>
            <li> Left a disgusting residue on my hair that made it unmanageable and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> Man, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have never used such an awful product on my hair before.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few washings and each time it made my hair greasy and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Now, after two weeks of use, my hair basically seems dirty all the time.  </li>
            <li> o the dirty hair issue.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews and \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; comments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using both products together, my hair feels greasier and dirtier than before I stepped into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Paul Mitchell, these products are so bad that they have turned me off your products all together</li>
            <li> and it remains disgusting.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible shampoo.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and have to disagree with those who say it leaves their hair feeling greasy and awful!  </li>
            <li> I then had to use a clarifying shampoo three days in a row just to get the nasty feeling out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Awful shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it felt really nasty and unclean.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and keep coming back to this one.  The conditioner is also better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended Paul Mitchell Color Protect Shampoo after I had my hair colored its natural brown so that the greys were all covered up. I really like the Color Protect Shampoo. It is gentle on my hair. And the color does not wash out like it will with regular shampoo. I can actually tell that my hair color lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;And my hair color does not fade. This is a great shampoo for anyone with colored hair. The larger bottle is a money saver too.</li>
            <li> For a guy, I just use any cheaper regular shampoo.  BUT for my wife, she really loves this shampoo and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It really helps keep color in and is gentle and cleans her long hair wonderfully!  She uses the Paul Mitchell color protect conditioner after shampooing.  Great Products!  The two larger shampoo bottles is a pretty good deal from Amazon (and free shipping).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years.  I also use the conditioner.  It does require a long rinsing out, but my hair is so healthy and I get compliments on my hair all the time. I wash it every night and  I&#x27;m 64 so to have all the hair I have and the sheen I am happy with the results! I wouldn&#x27;t think of using any other shampoo. At least, not at this point.</li>
            <li> I use other Paul Mitchell products and like them, but not this one. I have fine, thick, wavy hair that straightens easily and usually feels silky after styling. With this product, it feels dirty, dry and sort of gummy. It does add a lot of body, but not the good kind. Steer clear.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few washings and each time it made my hair greasy and disgusting. At first I thought maybe I hadn&#x27;t rinsed it out well enough so I kept trying and it didn&#x27;t get better. Find a different product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work…Save your money</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve enjoyed Paul Mitchell hair products but this one was a disappointment.  It made my hair dry and oddly unmanageable.  I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell either.  It&#x27;s been relegated to the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> I adore Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li> Great product! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product makes my color shine. It is well worth every penny. I have had people comment on how pretty my hair smells. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell products are all great products; this one included</li>
            <li> Can I give this product a negative star? I just colored my hair a week ago and it&#x27;s stripping the color out. I will now have to get my hair recolored. Not to mention it leaves my hair feeling greasy and looks unwashed. Also when I tried to straighten my hair for the life of me I could not straighten it. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Always great product!</li>
            <li> It was just what i  wanted perfect  described  the same as the picture i will buy again  excellent  i love the product</li>
            <li> After washing hair it has a greasy film on it. Why???  Anybody have any suggestions about this or maybe another product that is better</li>
            <li> Gentle on color processed hair. Pleasant scent. Decent value. This item was packed in a plastic bag so as to protect in the event of a leak which did not occur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a year.  Amazon has, by far, the best price for the large size.  I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews and \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; comments.  Maybe it&#x27;s something in those reviewers&#x27; water that is interacting with this particular shampoo?  I never have had my hair feel greasy, and I&#x27;ll go a couple of days between shampooos.  It definitely makes a difference in terms of color lasting longer.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product for some time.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the Paul Mitchell Color Protect Shampoo &amp; conditioner. At first found my hair to be easier to comb and manage, but each time I wash my hair, it continues to be greasy after it is dry. This was not the case after the first use and I was very excited. I continued using both products and found that my hair was extremely greasy. To the point I don&#x27;t even want to where my hair down &amp; I want to go home and wash it. I originally thought I was using too much conditioner, but have gradually stopped using the conditioner all together and it remains disgusting. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is, but I will be discontinuing use of these products ASAP.</li>
            <li> My wife was amazed at the price and quantity!</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my color preserved until my next salon appointment. I have straight hair. This product is the only one that keeps it silky.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Left a disgusting residue on my hair that made it unmanageable and greasy looking. Thought I didn&#x27;t wash it out all the way so I gave it another try and same thing, feels like a layer of wax in my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but i felt this was necessary. This product is garbage and I&#x27;m upset I spent so much on it. Does not lather at all, leaves my hair snarled even after using conditioner. Left my hair dirty and greasy(and I have thick dry hair).&lt;br /&gt;The other thing i noticed was that my hair even smelled dirty. Not the day of the wash, but the next day it smelled gross. Do not buy this product, use redken instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo after getting my hair dyed with a PM Shine.  The first time I washed my hair it felt kind of gross and greasy but I was able to wear it down still.  Today (3 washes later) it was so gross and greasy, even with blow drying, that I had to wear it up and shouldn&#x27;t have even wasted time washing it because it looked cleaner before I showered!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a salon after a color treatment. The stylist had great things to say and having used PM styling products I thought it was a smart buy. Man, was I wrong.  After using this with the matching conditioner my hair would feel dirty and very greasy. I would notice that if I attempted to style my hair (shoulder length) it would go well enough but if I left it to its own devices my hair would look as if I hadn&#x27;t showered in several days. While that was frustrating, my hair would take a washing or two with different shampoo/conditioner to return to a normal state.  I too thought I was not washing it out cleanly and tried again, making sure I rinsed my hair. Same result. I then used the conditioner with another shampoo and in a few days it was back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. I tried the shampoo again with a non-PM conditioner and same greasy result.  After checking online I&#x27;ve discovered that it seems to be an issue that many people have and it looks like its just the shampoo. If you style your hair everyday then this might be the shampoo for you as it helped do up-dos very easily, but if you tend to wash and go (like me) in the mornings then I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible shampoo. Something you could buy at the drug store is better. It leaves your hair feeling dirty and extremely greasy! I have never used such an awful product on my hair before. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Good price but not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have had the same experience as many others reviewing this product.  I have been growing my hair out, and I recently got it highlighted to cover up some of my newly-acquired grays.  Anyway, I am a former Pantene Pro-V Natural Fusion user, and I liked that product, but I thought I should switch to a gentler shampoo to protect my color and keep my long hair healthy.  When I switched to Paul Mitchell Color Protect, the first thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t lather.  I am aware that many salon shampoos don&#x27;t lather the way drugstore ones do, so I certainly could have lived with that.  However, I don&#x27;t feel that this shampoo is effectively cleaning my hair.  Like other reviewers have said, my hair looks and feels worse after washing than it did before.  With the Pantene, I washed and styled my hair every three days.  Now, after two weeks of use, my hair basically seems dirty all the time.  I&#x27;m returning to my drugstore habits, and I&#x27;m pretty bummed out that I wasted $30 on this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and have to disagree with those who say it leaves their hair feeling greasy and awful!  I have a lot of hair but it is very fine and  fly away.  It doesn&#x27;t take much shampoo...two quick scrubbings with just a little shampoo each time and I amost don&#x27;t need conditioner.  This shampoo will not make a lot of suds--maybe other people are using too much. I do use just a dab of conditioner and work it through from the bottom of the ends and then up through the back and sides. Now I can get my hair to hang straight and not flying around like it has ststic in It!  I also rub a dab of coconut oil in my hands and then again starting at the bottom and ends rub it through my hair--this makes it real shiny and controllable.</li>
            <li> But had to use this AND the color conditioner EVERY day.  The condition HAD to be used each day.  Also grew weary of getting it colored every 4 to 6 weeks (my wife first tried Just For Men and THAT took hours to do), then I went to a professional and just wasn&#x27;t willing to pay $50.00, which included the tip, each month so let it go completely gray.  Have had MORE compliments on the gray than on the brown coloring AND the way the shampoo made my hair look.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair dyed red with Paul Mitchell Shine and not wanting my color to fade I asked my stylist what shampoo would be the best. She said that she had used PM Color Protect when she rinsed my hair and I purchased it and the matching conditioner.  I had previously been using the Nexxus color protectant shampoo with great results but I figured why not buy what my stylist recommended.  I was so excited, especially when she told me I could use it everyday.. My hair gets very greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day. When I used it I noticed significantly less dye washing out in the shower and thought that it would be great. However, when I blow dried my hair I noticed it felt super heavy and greasy and looked awful! It felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks. You could even feel the dirty gritty, greasy texture in my hair. I went to work and had to deal with flat, dull, gross feeling hair all day. The next day I figured that maybe I didn&#x27;t rinse my hair enough so I tried it again with the same results. I tried this stuff for about a week, rinsing longer and longer while using less and less product each day. I then had to use a clarifying shampoo three days in a row just to get the nasty feeling out of my hair. I am so disappointed in this product, I went back to my regular Nexxus and my hair feels fine. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product at all. If anyone is wondering, I have very thick, full and healthy hair, I saw a review mentioning fine hair but I got the same result with a completely different hair type.</li>
            <li> my hair would feels dirty and very greasy after using the shampoo. After i dried my hair or air dry the hair feels oily an unclean. I was expecting a better product from this company.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I think peoples dirty hair issues is because this is a low low sulfate and very low lather shampoo all you really need is to add an extra pump or two of shampoo to your hair and massage in  and it should take care o the dirty hair issue.  This is ultra gentle shampoo with lots of natural extracts.  If you shampoo your hair daily this will be perfect for it is so very gentle</li>
            <li> This shampoo is beyond gross.  After two weeks of daily use (as advertized on the bottle) my hair became so greasy it looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in days even directly after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply do a search of others&#x27; reviews on this product.  You&#x27;ll quickly find that many others have had similar issues with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, though, that during the first week of use, my fine, wavy (and color treated) hair developed a thicker texture that held flat ironing and styling well.  But, by the second week it was so greasy I couldn&#x27;t even get to styling--soooo gross it needed to be washed AGAIN and with something else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think one&#x27;s hair could look dirtier/greasier than before shampooing, but Paul Mitchell nailed it on this one.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff.  You can get greasy hair for free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over a year now. It feels good when you apply it and it keeps my hair moisturized and soft. I color my hair often and this helps keeps my hair color longer.</li>
            <li> had been using product for years from a local hairdresser and now getting a bigger supply.</li>
            <li> Just like the bottle from my hair salon!  This shampoo is great. No complaints!</li>
            <li> This was a great value - much better thank purchasing in my local beauty store.  Works great and really does help color last longer.</li>
            <li> Awful shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using both products together, my hair feels greasier and dirtier than before I stepped into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Paul Mitchell, these products are so bad that they have turned me off your products all together</li>
            <li> recommended by the hair stylist</li>
            <li> If you color your hair get the right shampoo or your hair color will fade. This is the right stuff believe me</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Paul Mitchell products.  Not only does it meet my expectations, but I appreciate this company&#x27;s anti-cruelty stance, i.e., not testing their products on animals.  I try to purchase products which meet this standard, and which also gives good results when used.</li>
            <li> I went to the salon the other day to get my haircut and I asked my hairstylist what the best color protector shampoo and conditioner was. I recently dyed my hair red, and as most of you know, if you don&#x27;t upkeep it, it will fade fast. She recommended Paul Mitchell Color Protect Shampoo and Conditioner. So I purchased it. It said it was good for daily use, which I need because my hair gets very oily and not washing it everyday makes my hair look gross. So I washed my hair with this product the day after my haircut. When I was later blow drying my hair, I was running my fingers through it and it felt really nasty and unclean. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
