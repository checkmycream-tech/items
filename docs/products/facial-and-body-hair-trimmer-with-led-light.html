            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>Great hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>The blade does a very nice job.  </li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it very effectively.  </li>
            <li>Blade is excellent and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>with bright lite.</li>
            <li>I do not always like the bright lights that run across the wall over my mirror</li>
            <li>The BEST thing about this trimmer is the bright light.  </li>
            <li>This is vastly superior to the rotary nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good though.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer, works well.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job.  </li>
            <li>This sounds like a good product, but it did not work FOR US.  </li>
            <li>awesome product, arrived on time, works great, love the light!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t cut real good, but is acceptable for quick trims, I will probably use it now.</li>
            <li>The replacement came quickly and works flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it has the longest &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever found, and the light is very bright.  </li>
            <li>; but I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>But it does work nicely when trying to shave unwanted peach fuzz off of your face.</li>
            <li>Really handy ... works like a charm.</li>
            <li>The light is very bright and the trimmer is comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>Even more than that, the LED light is a great feature.  </li>
            <li>The built-in LED lights up the area and makes it easy to do a good job in a shorter time.  </li>
            <li>I love the light on it!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this, it works great and the light makes it even better.</li>
            <li>We loved the fact that it did have a light.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best trimmer ive ever used!</li>
            <li>I would mostly recommend this product very easy to work with nice eyebrow accessories,and very light weight.</li>
            <li>so the LED light is great for looking for fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but don&#x27;t expect it to cut hairs closely...</li>
            <li>and I love having the light!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through so many of them.</li>
            <li>But I was like, what the hell, I&#x27;ll give it one more go.</li>
            <li>I took it casing apart and cleaned the blades (many times) but the problem persisted.</li>
            <li>The blade is stronger, longer and so much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s at the end of the handle and the battery fits much better.</li>
            <li>and it was much better than using his electric razor.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer, esp.</li>
            <li>Might work better for women or someone with thinner hair</li>
            <li>I bought the Braun Cruzer 6 Body Shaver the day after I tried this one out and had much better results.</li>
            <li>love the lighted feature..helps with locating unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I think I like my Tinkle disposable eyebrow razors better.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Buyer beware- if you do order this item from Brookstone and are not fully satisfied, you will have to pay for the return shipping.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the light!</li>
            <li>I can not tell you how many of these facial/bikini trimmers I have gone through.  </li>
            <li>Many just seem to fall apart in your hands after 4-6 uses.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>satisfied with product</li>
            <li>Feels nice and smooth on the face and no pulling of the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure how well this is going to keep performing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a great job, but the maintenance required to keep it in good condition is more than what I would think is necessary for a tool like this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing is it markets itself on the box as being able to trim nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know if the plastic covering over the top was removable or not.  </li>
            <li>The light is awesome and the blades do an excellent job at quickly trimming hair without pulling it and irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li>The light is wonderful, it casts light on either side of the blade and allows you to see every hair and you can get very close to your brow line and be sure your not trimming too much.</li>
            <li>Love the light as well.</li>
            <li>light is a real plus, bright, and focused....eyebrow adapters worked well for me too....</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li>I was able to clean of my neck line and shape my beard with no issues.</li>
            <li>I like that it stands, but seems like it would break easily if toppled even into the sink.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very quick delivery by ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li>Love the trimmer, works as advertised great for trimming ear hair as well as other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;Great product &amp; outstanding customer service.  </li>
            <li>This product seems to do just fine.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product to remove the fairly fine hair on my arms.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a cheaper one for years that is still working fine.</li>
            <li>The LED is so bright and the clear plastic case lets all the light shine.</li>
            <li>Great for shaping around hairline and outside of ears.  </li>
            <li>It was more powerful than I was used to and has a wider blade</li>
            <li>I like the idea of the led light as well as trimming your face with ease</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the Ferrari of trimmers whereas the others sound like Yugos.</li>
            <li>I really should have just returned it to be honest.</li>
            <li>The light works well</li>
            <li>But I think in time that will smooth out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen a trimmer with a light before and this one is made so well.</li>
            <li>and I do appreciate the light.  </li>
            <li>After using this, I&#x27;ll never buy another trimmer without a light.  </li>
            <li>Shaves very easily and gently and works much more quickly than the one I had been using.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and the light reveals areas in need better than the others (which didn&#x27;t have a light.</li>
            <li>Love the bright light, helps me to see every single hair I need to remove from anywhere on my body.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is so powerful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;ToiletTree saw my original review and sent me another one.</li>
            <li>If you want to use this to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; your nose hairs, you&#x27;d better be okay with smashing it all the way against the inside of your nose and completely shaving away all the hair in your nose, because you will not be &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; your nose hairs.</li>
            <li>That helps so much to see those fine hairs!</li>
            <li>It worked great - longer and better blades were much more efficient than other products I&#x27;ve tried for for varied - and sensitive!</li>
            <li>Thanks, ToiletTree for making such a superior product!</li>
            <li>so I actually did shave a good chunk off my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>So much nicer and better quality over the competition.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as great as other versions of this.</li>
            <li>The trimmer does its job quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>but it is adequate for the price.  </li>
            <li>Batteries die quickly.</li>
            <li>quick shipping, works well</li>
            <li>He likes this 1 better then the high $ 1</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other trimmers and this one, so far, has been the best.</li>
            <li>The LED light makes it much easier to use!  </li>
            <li>You aren&#x27;t supposed to wash it with water, since it isn&#x27;t water proof, and after using it to edge up my hairline, there&#x27;s a decent amount of hair stuck inside of it, which I will have to disassemble the head, clean it with a soft brush, reassemble it, and the lightly lubricate the blade, which all takes more time than it should,</li>
            <li>The light on the trimmer is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Really like the light.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s powerful.</li>
            <li>Def well worth the money.</li>
            <li>have tried many brands, and nothing so far comes even close to the performance and construction of this one.  </li>
            <li>I would not buy another as it is just ok as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>I loved this trimmer when I first started using, but soon the loose plastic casing housing the blades became clogged with hairs.  </li>
            <li>No problem, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several different brands of these trimmers and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>only used a few times, but at this point very happy.</li>
            <li>However, in the last 4-5 months it&#x27;s been catching and pulling hair more and more frequently, even with new batteries, resulting in red bumps, scratches and irritated skin.</li>
            <li>The light does work, but it only shows you the hairs that it&#x27;s NOT cutting!</li>
            <li>This is a good little hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I expected this to be able to clean up my neckline</li>
            <li>So glad I found this trimmer and definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li>first attempt of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second one does work better.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work well at all, but the company sent me a second one, which is better.  </li>
            <li>--one even fell apart the first day.</li>
            <li>But that isn&#x27;t really saying much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>Trying to get it ready to be used..fell apart in my hands..</li>
            <li>This was absolute junk.</li>
            <li>Very responsive customer service.  </li>
            <li>There is a miniscule sliding tab to release head (for cleaning and blade changes), however, even with my small hands, I found getting a grip on the tab with the tip of my nail very challenging (and imperils your nail).  </li>
            <li>I expected slightly better quality</li>
            <li>This product works very well</li>
            <li>I can really see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>My hair clippers don&#x27;t require this much maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>still like most other ones on the market.</li>
            <li>my hair is very fine and this was not a comfortable trimmer at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what all those high raters were thinking.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li>cannot tell you how unexpected that was but certainly appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Tried using again with a brand new battery</li>
            <li>Eventually, the motor slowed down significantly and the blades did not trim at high speed anymore.</li>
            <li>This is second one I&#x27;ve had; the first one broke (my fault), and I ordered this to replace it.</li>
            <li>I have used similar trimmers for years but this is the first with built in lighting.</li>
            <li>I love the small size and portability of this shaver for travel.  </li>
            <li>Long story made short my son fixed the original defective unit and he loves his now.  </li>
            <li>You do have to clean it with a dry brush about every second use.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>This one is definitely different and much nicer.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>Works alright on soft hair</li>
            <li>Instructions to prepare the unit for operation were complete.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is very solidly made (yes, the light does work) and is lasting through daily use.  </li>
            <li>It is most useful to gently remove hair in hospital prior to surgery (they do terrible shave jobs there with cheap razors, if at all), or arms and chest before placing tape from blood draws or ports; and to clear hair for the leads from EKGs which are very sticky!  </li>
            <li>Original comment: Was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, lightweight plastic just like similar products that cost half the price of this one.</li>
            <li>This is the closest I have been able to trim nose and other facial hair that seems to be sprouting in new places every other week</li>
            <li>Does fine job with nose and neck hair, although unit is somewhat wide, so be careful navigating in nostrils....</li>
            <li>The blades simply wouldn&#x27;t cut my hair, it simply pushed my hairs around most of the time, and when&lt;br /&gt;it would actually catch some hairs in the blades, it would just bog down...</li>
            <li>The four star is due to the fact that the shave is not quite as close, but I still prefer this trimmer as it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m half black and my nostrils are a bit more round than people from most other races, and I can barely get this thing in my nose - let alone rotate it to cut my nose hairs.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the nub that holds the blade assembly in place could be a little larger, but so far so good...</li>
            <li>The battery never really fit in right</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this product isn&#x27;t good for my  husbands long back hair  </li>
            <li>The small shape is just right for holding, and the on/off switch is at my finger tips</li>
            <li>I really like this little trimmer</li>
            <li>When I am using on my face to remove the vellus hair (peach fuzz) it lights up those little guys so you really see what you are doing and don&#x27;t miss any areas.  </li>

            <li> and I love having the light!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through so many of them.</li>
            <li> But I was like, what the hell, I&#x27;ll give it one more go.</li>
            <li> I took it casing apart and cleaned the blades (many times) but the problem persisted.</li>
            <li> The blade is stronger, longer and so much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s at the end of the handle and the battery fits much better.</li>
            <li> and it was much better than using his electric razor.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer, esp.</li>
            <li> Might work better for women or someone with thinner hair</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Cruzer 6 Body Shaver the day after I tried this one out and had much better results.</li>
            <li> love the lighted feature..helps with locating unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I think I like my Tinkle disposable eyebrow razors better.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Buyer beware- if you do order this item from Brookstone and are not fully satisfied, you will have to pay for the return shipping.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the light!</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how many of these facial/bikini trimmers I have gone through.  </li>
            <li> Many just seem to fall apart in your hands after 4-6 uses.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> satisfied with product</li>
            <li> Feels nice and smooth on the face and no pulling of the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure how well this is going to keep performing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a great job, but the maintenance required to keep it in good condition is more than what I would think is necessary for a tool like this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing is it markets itself on the box as being able to trim nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know if the plastic covering over the top was removable or not.  </li>
            <li> The light is awesome and the blades do an excellent job at quickly trimming hair without pulling it and irritating the skin.  </li>
            <li> The light is wonderful, it casts light on either side of the blade and allows you to see every hair and you can get very close to your brow line and be sure your not trimming too much.</li>
            <li> Love the light as well.</li>
            <li> light is a real plus, bright, and focused....eyebrow adapters worked well for me too....</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> I was able to clean of my neck line and shape my beard with no issues.</li>
            <li> I like that it stands, but seems like it would break easily if toppled even into the sink.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very quick delivery by ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li> Love the trimmer, works as advertised great for trimming ear hair as well as other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;Great product &amp; outstanding customer service.  </li>
            <li> This product seems to do just fine.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to remove the fairly fine hair on my arms.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a cheaper one for years that is still working fine.</li>
            <li> The LED is so bright and the clear plastic case lets all the light shine.</li>
            <li> Great for shaping around hairline and outside of ears.  </li>
            <li> It was more powerful than I was used to and has a wider blade</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the led light as well as trimming your face with ease</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Ferrari of trimmers whereas the others sound like Yugos.</li>
            <li> I really should have just returned it to be honest.</li>
            <li> The light works well</li>
            <li> But I think in time that will smooth out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a trimmer with a light before and this one is made so well.</li>
            <li> and I do appreciate the light.  </li>
            <li> After using this, I&#x27;ll never buy another trimmer without a light.  </li>
            <li> Shaves very easily and gently and works much more quickly than the one I had been using.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and the light reveals areas in need better than the others (which didn&#x27;t have a light.</li>
            <li> Love the bright light, helps me to see every single hair I need to remove from anywhere on my body.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so powerful!</li>
            <li> /&gt;ToiletTree saw my original review and sent me another one.</li>
            <li> If you want to use this to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; your nose hairs, you&#x27;d better be okay with smashing it all the way against the inside of your nose and completely shaving away all the hair in your nose, because you will not be &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; your nose hairs.</li>
            <li> That helps so much to see those fine hairs!</li>
            <li> It worked great - longer and better blades were much more efficient than other products I&#x27;ve tried for for varied - and sensitive!</li>
            <li> Thanks, ToiletTree for making such a superior product!</li>
            <li> so I actually did shave a good chunk off my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> So much nicer and better quality over the competition.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as great as other versions of this.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does its job quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> but it is adequate for the price.  </li>
            <li> Batteries die quickly.</li>
            <li> quick shipping, works well</li>
            <li> He likes this 1 better then the high $ 1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other trimmers and this one, so far, has been the best.</li>
            <li> The LED light makes it much easier to use!  </li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t supposed to wash it with water, since it isn&#x27;t water proof, and after using it to edge up my hairline, there&#x27;s a decent amount of hair stuck inside of it, which I will have to disassemble the head, clean it with a soft brush, reassemble it, and the lightly lubricate the blade, which all takes more time than it should,</li>
            <li> The light on the trimmer is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Really like the light.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s powerful.</li>
            <li> Def well worth the money.</li>
            <li> have tried many brands, and nothing so far comes even close to the performance and construction of this one.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy another as it is just ok as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> I loved this trimmer when I first started using, but soon the loose plastic casing housing the blades became clogged with hairs.  </li>
            <li> No problem, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different brands of these trimmers and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> only used a few times, but at this point very happy.</li>
            <li> However, in the last 4-5 months it&#x27;s been catching and pulling hair more and more frequently, even with new batteries, resulting in red bumps, scratches and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The light does work, but it only shows you the hairs that it&#x27;s NOT cutting!</li>
            <li> This is a good little hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I expected this to be able to clean up my neckline</li>
            <li> So glad I found this trimmer and definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> first attempt of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second one does work better.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work well at all, but the company sent me a second one, which is better.  </li>
            <li> --one even fell apart the first day.</li>
            <li> But that isn&#x27;t really saying much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really.</li>
            <li> Trying to get it ready to be used..fell apart in my hands..</li>
            <li> This was absolute junk.</li>
            <li> Very responsive customer service.  </li>
            <li> There is a miniscule sliding tab to release head (for cleaning and blade changes), however, even with my small hands, I found getting a grip on the tab with the tip of my nail very challenging (and imperils your nail).  </li>
            <li> I expected slightly better quality</li>
            <li> This product works very well</li>
            <li> I can really see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> My hair clippers don&#x27;t require this much maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> still like most other ones on the market.</li>
            <li> my hair is very fine and this was not a comfortable trimmer at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all those high raters were thinking.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li> cannot tell you how unexpected that was but certainly appreciated.  </li>
            <li> Tried using again with a brand new battery</li>
            <li> Eventually, the motor slowed down significantly and the blades did not trim at high speed anymore.</li>
            <li> This is second one I&#x27;ve had; the first one broke (my fault), and I ordered this to replace it.</li>
            <li> I have used similar trimmers for years but this is the first with built in lighting.</li>
            <li> I love the small size and portability of this shaver for travel.  </li>
            <li> Long story made short my son fixed the original defective unit and he loves his now.  </li>
            <li> You do have to clean it with a dry brush about every second use.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely different and much nicer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> Works alright on soft hair</li>
            <li> Instructions to prepare the unit for operation were complete.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is very solidly made (yes, the light does work) and is lasting through daily use.  </li>
            <li> It is most useful to gently remove hair in hospital prior to surgery (they do terrible shave jobs there with cheap razors, if at all), or arms and chest before placing tape from blood draws or ports; and to clear hair for the leads from EKGs which are very sticky!  </li>
            <li> Original comment: Was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, lightweight plastic just like similar products that cost half the price of this one.</li>
            <li> This is the closest I have been able to trim nose and other facial hair that seems to be sprouting in new places every other week</li>
            <li> Does fine job with nose and neck hair, although unit is somewhat wide, so be careful navigating in nostrils....</li>
            <li> The blades simply wouldn&#x27;t cut my hair, it simply pushed my hairs around most of the time, and when&lt;br /&gt;it would actually catch some hairs in the blades, it would just bog down...</li>
            <li> The four star is due to the fact that the shave is not quite as close, but I still prefer this trimmer as it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black and my nostrils are a bit more round than people from most other races, and I can barely get this thing in my nose - let alone rotate it to cut my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the nub that holds the blade assembly in place could be a little larger, but so far so good...</li>
            <li> The battery never really fit in right</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product isn&#x27;t good for my  husbands long back hair  </li>
            <li> The small shape is just right for holding, and the on/off switch is at my finger tips</li>
            <li> I really like this little trimmer</li>
            <li> When I am using on my face to remove the vellus hair (peach fuzz) it lights up those little guys so you really see what you are doing and don&#x27;t miss any areas.  </li>
            <li> Have gone through several of the other manufacturers trimmers that last only a month or two and stop working all together.  </li>
            <li> Now just the light works so what I have is a weird looking mini flashlight.  </li>
            <li> The eyebrow cutting attachments are also much better quality than the hair trimmers found at Bed Bath and Beyond.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing professional or heavy duty about this.</li>
            <li> now we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I think due to the battery area not holding the battery correctly after a short time.</li>
            <li> Compared to our other two $10 trimmers, this one did not cut as well and actually scratched.  </li>
            <li> The whole thing felt fragile and poorly made, like something from a dollar store.  </li>
            <li> (it simply combs the hair &amp; only cuts a few strands)or for your bikini area (it pulls the hair!).</li>
            <li> Have used it several times for a few months now with no loss of power.</li>
            <li> Read the directions and don&#x27;t get this wet.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any drag and it moves over my face and neck without any problems.</li>
            <li> I could feel the blade getting jammed by the hair and then pulling.  </li>
            <li> Conventional shaving would leave skin too raw for such things.  </li>
            <li> The construction is fluid and does not look like it will fall apart like the ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Just like other reviews have said -</li>
            <li> The one I received was less powerful than my thirty year old lady remington shaver and it pulled like crazy!</li>
            <li> Bought new batteries and it still stopped and started and ran poorly</li>
            <li> I immediately threw out my current trimmer which had grown dull and took longer to trim with.</li>
            <li> not worth the effort to return it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t anything like those other trimmers!</li>
            <li> The blade is very sharp and felt like it would cut my nostril.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> works well, a little tricky with nose hair, but some practice will cure that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have blonde hairs on my face and it is very hard to see them.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> If I could offer the company one suggestion, it would be to make access to the battery a little easier; i.e., without the need for an instructment to remove the cap as one usually doesn&#x27;t keep screwdrivers, knives, or dimes in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> No more hassle of going out to buy expensive razors that last a few weeks.</li>
            <li> it takes up very little space on the sink counter.</li>
            <li> Not sure about nose, inside ears or around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had doubts because I&#x27;ve bought trimmers like this in the past</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Usually with Amazon shippers a prepaid shipping label is emailed for returned items.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical purchasing this as I have purchased small trimmers in the past.  </li>
            <li> I could just return it if the negative reviews were correct.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend on any thick hair.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money!!</li>
            <li> but it caught in the stiff short hairs at the base of a man&#x27;s haircut.  </li>
            <li> Bad product it broke in second used.</li>
            <li> Not good for nose trimming which is why I purchased.</li>
            <li> Awkward to use versus the cylinder head on other trimmers I have viewed.</li>
            <li> Stick to thin hairs like around your ears and stay away from anything thicker.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, yes, but the battery cover is not easy to work with, the LED lights didn&#x27;t work out of the box and after removing the cutting area (as instructed)</li>
            <li> Since I had invested $ and time researching and reading and purchasing other products before purchasing this one I was frustrated.</li>
            <li> #34;how silly that there is a light&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Tried it on my neckline and eyebrows and was disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The blades quit working after only 4 uses. Now just the light works so what I have is a weird looking mini flashlight.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Excellent job of trimming.  Recommend</li>
            <li> Does not jam or irritate like cheaper versions and trims nosehair with one swipe with no discomfort . Have used it several times for a few months now with no loss of power. You do have to clean it with a dry brush about every second use. My only complaint is that the nub that holds the blade assembly in place could be a little larger, but so far so good...</li>
            <li> Works great and I love having the light!</li>
            <li> The blade is very sharp and felt like it would cut my nostril.  Great for shaping around hairline and outside of ears.  Not sure about nose, inside ears or around my eyes.</li>
            <li> There is nothing professional or heavy duty about this. It is cheap, lightweight plastic just like similar products that cost half the price of this one. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This. Is. The. Best. Thing. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through so many of them. Why would I keep buying them you ask? I asked myself the same thing. But I was like, what the hell, I&#x27;ll give it one more go. And that was the best decision I have ever made in my life. Literally. This trumps my marriage by a thousand. But that isn&#x27;t really saying much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No really. It lights up so you can actually see what you are doing so you don&#x27;t shave your eyebrow off. And it&#x27;s powerful.It was more powerful than I was used to and has a wider blade so I actually did shave a good chunk off my eyebrow. And I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Wow. Just. Wow.</li>
            <li> Ordered 4my husband. Has used it awhile. He likes this 1 better then the high $ 1</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product isn&#x27;t good for my  husbands long back hair  (it simply combs the hair &amp; only cuts a few strands)or for your bikini area (it pulls the hair!). But it does work nicely when trying to shave unwanted peach fuzz off of your face.</li>
            <li> I loved this trimmer when I first started using, but soon the loose plastic casing housing the blades became clogged with hairs.  I took it casing apart and cleaned the blades (many times) but the problem persisted. Eventually, the motor slowed down significantly and the blades did not trim at high speed anymore.</li>
            <li> This has a lot of power and does the job. It cuts hair as soon as it touches the hair. You don&#x27;t have to keep going over and over just to get it cut. This is a great product and would recommend to anyone who needs something like this.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the led light as well as trimming your face with ease I would mostly recommend this product very easy to work with nice eyebrow accessories,and very light weight.</li>
            <li> I had doubts because I&#x27;ve bought trimmers like this in the past and they last about one month - I think due to the battery area not holding the battery correctly after a short time. This isn&#x27;t anything like those other trimmers! The blade is stronger, longer and so much better. The LED is so bright and the clear plastic case lets all the light shine. The best part is the battery area. It&#x27;s at the end of the handle and the battery fits much better. This trimmer is so powerful! It&#x27;s the Ferrari of trimmers whereas the others sound like Yugos. This is vastly superior to the rotary nose hair trimmers. It fits in nostrils and cuts the hair rapidly. I cut the hair on my husband&#x27;s neck as soon as it arrived and it was much better than using his electric razor. Faster and cleaner. I love this!!! The eyebrow cutting attachments are also much better quality than the hair trimmers found at Bed Bath and Beyond.  Read the directions and don&#x27;t get this wet.  This is a great deal for a great product.</li>
            <li> Its a piece of cr**.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Pulls your hair it hurts</li>
            <li> I really like this little trimmer</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical purchasing this as I have purchased small trimmers in the past.  This one is definitely different and much nicer.  The blade does a very nice job.  I also thought &amp;#34;how silly that there is a light&amp;#34; but I LOVE IT!  When I am using on my face to remove the vellus hair (peach fuzz) it lights up those little guys so you really see what you are doing and don&#x27;t miss any areas.  So glad I found this trimmer and definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this, it works great and the light makes it even better. It makes it so easy to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, yes, but the battery cover is not easy to work with, the LED lights didn&#x27;t work out of the box and after removing the cutting area (as instructed) the plastic tab to slide back into place couldn&#x27;t be moved.  The whole thing felt fragile and poorly made, like something from a dollar store.  I had it back in the box for a return within 5-10 minutes of opening it.</li>
            <li> Does fine job with nose and neck hair, although unit is somewhat wide, so be careful navigating in nostrils....light is a real plus, bright, and focused....eyebrow adapters worked well for me too....as a disposable grooming product(aren&#x27;t they all), this works well...now we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this cheap piece of junk.  I don&#x27;t know what all those high raters were thinking.</li>
            <li> Trying to get it ready to be used..fell apart in my hands..junk. Would not suggest anyone buy it. I just threw it away..not worth the effort to return it.</li>
            <li> The tip doesn&#x27;t bent, that is why only 4 stars.  It&#x27;s good though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other trimmers and this one, so far, has been the best. The price is right and the light reveals areas in need better than the others (which didn&#x27;t have a light.</li>
            <li> This was absolute junk. I would definitely not recommend this in anyway whatsoever. my hair is very fine and this was not a comfortable trimmer at all. The battery never really fit in right and it was a pain to even get to turn on. I really should have just returned it to be honest. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer, esp. with bright lite. I have blonde hairs on my face and it is very hard to see them. But with the lited trimmer, I can see them all and the trimmer takes care of the rest. There isn&#x27;t any drag and it moves over my face and neck without any problems. The small shape is just right for holding, and the on/off switch is at my finger tips so  I don&#x27;t need to stop, Just feel the switch with my finger and on/off is done.</li>
            <li> Very impressed.  I was constantly replacing the inadequately made trimmers as seen on tv.  I do not always like the bright lights that run across the wall over my mirror so the LED light is great for looking for fine hairs.  The construction is fluid and does not look like it will fall apart like the ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, works well.  This is second one I&#x27;ve had; the first one broke (my fault), and I ordered this to replace it.</li>
            <li> Tried it on my neckline and eyebrows and was disappointed.  I could feel the blade getting jammed by the hair and then pulling.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend on any thick hair.  Stick to thin hairs like around your ears and stay away from anything thicker.  If I had tried to trim my beard off it would have been pulling an jamming on that too.  I expected this to be able to clean up my neckline but it was under powered.  Might work better for women or someone with thinner hair but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  I bought the Braun Cruzer 6 Body Shaver the day after I tried this one out and had much better results. I was able to clean of my neck line and shape my beard with no issues.</li>
            <li> Not good for nose trimming which is why I purchased.</li>
            <li> love the lighted feature..helps with locating unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Original comment: Was a waste of my money. The light does work, but it only shows you the hairs that it&#x27;s NOT cutting! The blades simply wouldn&#x27;t cut my hair, it simply pushed my hairs around most of the time, and when&lt;br /&gt;it would actually catch some hairs in the blades, it would just bog down... I threw this thing away after&lt;br /&gt;my first attempt of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ToiletTree saw my original review and sent me another one. The second one does work better. It&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t cut real good, but is acceptable for quick trims, I will probably use it now. Upgraded my rating from 1 to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Works alright on soft hair but it caught in the stiff short hairs at the base of a man&#x27;s haircut.  Disapponting, as I hoped it would be great for an in between hair cut neck trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different brands of these trimmers and this one is by far the best.  The light is awesome and the blades do an excellent job at quickly trimming hair without pulling it and irritating the skin.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to remove the peach fuzz on my middle-aged face.  It didn&#x27;t work well at all, but the company sent me a second one, which is better.  The light on the trimmer is very helpful.  Very responsive customer service.  Stil ... I think I like my Tinkle disposable eyebrow razors better.</li>
            <li> I have used similar trimmers for years but this is the first with built in lighting. The trimmer does its job quickly and painlessly. I immediately threw out my current trimmer which had grown dull and took longer to trim with. This is a good product!</li>
            <li> There is a miniscule sliding tab to release head (for cleaning and blade changes), however, even with my small hands, I found getting a grip on the tab with the tip of my nail very challenging (and imperils your nail).  It should protrude a touch, but is flush.  I expected slightly better quality but it is adequate for the price.  I like that it stands, but seems like it would break easily if toppled even into the sink.  I&#x27;ve used it to shave my husband&#x27;s neck -- but prefer the regular razor for quicker results.  It is most useful to gently remove hair in hospital prior to surgery (they do terrible shave jobs there with cheap razors, if at all), or arms and chest before placing tape from blood draws or ports; and to clear hair for the leads from EKGs which are very sticky!  Conventional shaving would leave skin too raw for such things.  (My cousin likes his for shaping his intricate beard designs.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it, but don&#x27;t expect it to cut hairs closely...still like most other ones on the market. The light works well</li>
            <li> This product seems to do just fine. I just got it 3 days ago, but I do like it.  It grabs a hair every now and then and makes you wanna scream. But I think in time that will smooth out.  I love the light on it!!  That helps so much to see those fine hairs!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Really like the light.</li>
            <li> Instructions to prepare the unit for operation were complete.  No problems.  Does a good job.  Would recommend it for anyone looking for an alternative to creams</li>
            <li> This sounds like a good product, but it did not work FOR US.  We loved the fact that it did have a light.  Compared to our other two $10 trimmers, this one did not cut as well and actually scratched.  It is set to go to Goodwill.  Since we have tried it several times, I did not feel that we could return the product.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few weeks. Batteries die quickly.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! No more hassle of going out to buy expensive razors that last a few weeks. As a hairy Italian gentleman who takes pride in manscaping, take it from me, this product works! I would give it 10 stars if I could. The quality of the product is great as well. Will not break after a month of use like my last trimmer. Def well worth the money.</li>
            <li> junk, never worked properly and felt like the battery needed replacing. Bought new batteries and it still stopped and started and ran poorly</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer!  I&#x27;ve never seen a trimmer with a light before and this one is made so well.</li>
            <li> This product works very well and I do appreciate the light.  If I could offer the company one suggestion, it would be to make access to the battery a little easier; i.e., without the need for an instructment to remove the cap as one usually doesn&#x27;t keep screwdrivers, knives, or dimes in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Really handy ... works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Bad product it broke in second used.</li>
            <li> only used a few times, but at this point very happy. This is the closest I have been able to trim nose and other facial hair that seems to be sprouting in new places every other week</li>
            <li> It works well and performs well.</li>
            <li> I read earlier reviews on this trimmer and decided to try it.  I am glad I did.  The trimmer is very solidly made (yes, the light does work) and is lasting through daily use.  Others I have purchased fell apart after a month or so--one even fell apart the first day.</li>
            <li> The BEST thing about this trimmer is the bright light.  After using this, I&#x27;ll never buy another trimmer without a light.  It makes ALL the difference.  I highly recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  So much nicer and better quality over the competition.  Have gone through several of the other manufacturers trimmers that last only a month or two and stop working all together.  The light is very bright and the trimmer is comfortable to hold and use.  Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as great as other versions of this.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever had. Love the bright light, helps me to see every single hair I need to remove from anywhere on my body. Blade is excellent and so easy to use. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a sturdier model, but I just received it and we will see if it holds up. The light is wonderful, it casts light on either side of the blade and allows you to see every hair and you can get very close to your brow line and be sure your not trimming too much. I will report back if there are issues with durability.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t bite, works well</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to remove the fairly fine hair on my arms. Gambled on this trimmer thinking I could just return it if the negative reviews were correct. The one I received was less powerful than my thirty year old lady remington shaver and it pulled like crazy! Tried using again with a brand new battery and it didn&#x27;t help at all. No problem, right? Usually with Amazon shippers a prepaid shipping label is emailed for returned items. But not this time!  Buyer beware- if you do order this item from Brookstone and are not fully satisfied, you will have to pay for the return shipping. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I love the small size and portability of this shaver for travel.  Even more than that, the LED light is a great feature.  I can really see what I&#x27;m doing. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a year. It worked great - longer and better blades were much more efficient than other products I&#x27;ve tried for for varied - and sensitive! - areas of body hair. I LOVE the light! However, in the last 4-5 months it&#x27;s been catching and pulling hair more and more frequently, even with new batteries, resulting in red bumps, scratches and irritated skin. Since I had invested $ and time researching and reading and purchasing other products before purchasing this one I was frustrated. I looked again at the reviews here to see if anyone else had had the same issue. I decided to try calling the company, since the owner had personally responded to several reviews. They immediately offered to send a replacement!</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my elderly mother&#x27;s beard and mustache.  Just like other reviews have said - I can not tell you how many of these facial/bikini trimmers I have gone through.  Many just seem to fall apart in your hands after 4-6 uses.  And if you drop it (especially on a tile floor), you may as well just throw it away and get the next one you keep on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands, and nothing so far comes even close to the performance and construction of this one.  Plus, it has the longest &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever found, and the light is very bright.  Thanks, ToiletTree for making such a superior product!</li>
            <li> Love the trimmer, works as advertised great for trimming ear hair as well as other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;Great product &amp; outstanding customer service.  I had a small issue when I first received it and they immediately replaced it no questions asked.  The replacement came quickly and works flawlessly.  Long story made short my son fixed the original defective unit and he loves his now.  I asked the company if I could just pay for the replacement unit rather than return and the President of the company wrote me personally and told me to keep it for the inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how unexpected that was but certainly appreciated.  What a class act &amp; company!!!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it very effectively.  Easy to use.  I love it.</li>
            <li> works well, a little tricky with nose hair, but some practice will cure that.&lt;br /&gt;It replaced a bulky trimmer/shaver set that I had so it takes up very little space on the sink counter.</li>
            <li> This is a good little hair trimmer.  The LED light makes it much easier to use!  Shaves very easily and gently and works much more quickly than the one I had been using.  No nicks or scratches!!  The four star is due to the fact that the shave is not quite as close, but I still prefer this trimmer as it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> satisfied with product</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer ive ever used! Feels nice and smooth on the face and no pulling of the hair. Love the light as well. Awesome product! Would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery by ToiletTree.  I would definitely order again from them.  I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet but will soon.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used!  The built-in LED lights up the area and makes it easy to do a good job in a shorter time.  The trimmer gets close to the skin without pulling the hair.  A well designed and well made device.</li>
            <li> Best  yet! Have tried others but this gets the job done!</li>
            <li> It pinched my skin, for the price I Would not reorder.</li>
            <li> awesome product, arrived on time, works great, love the light!</li>
            <li> Great hair trimmer. Works fine. Easy to use and does a great job. Will buy again from seller. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> quick shipping, works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure how well this is going to keep performing. You aren&#x27;t supposed to wash it with water, since it isn&#x27;t water proof, and after using it to edge up my hairline, there&#x27;s a decent amount of hair stuck inside of it, which I will have to disassemble the head, clean it with a soft brush, reassemble it, and the lightly lubricate the blade, which all takes more time than it should, and I have to do this everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job, but the maintenance required to keep it in good condition is more than what I would think is necessary for a tool like this. My hair clippers don&#x27;t require this much maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is it markets itself on the box as being able to trim nose hairs. I&#x27;m half black and my nostrils are a bit more round than people from most other races, and I can barely get this thing in my nose - let alone rotate it to cut my nose hairs. If you want to use this to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; your nose hairs, you&#x27;d better be okay with smashing it all the way against the inside of your nose and completely shaving away all the hair in your nose, because you will not be &amp;#34;trimming&amp;#34; your nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I use this weekly for trimming my eyebrows, and it does a great job at that!</li>
            <li> This item died after three uses. A waste of money!!</li>
            <li> works satisfactorily.  Nose hair trimming could use some improvement.  Awkward to use versus the cylinder head on other trimmers I have viewed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know if the plastic covering over the top was removable or not.  Not, I guess.  After I paid the shipping charges this cost @ $25 and for that price an additional blade could have been included. I would not buy another as it is just ok as far as I am concerned. I&#x27;ve had a cheaper one for years that is still working fine.</li>
