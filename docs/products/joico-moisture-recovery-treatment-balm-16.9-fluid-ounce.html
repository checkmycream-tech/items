            <li>Most of the good products that work are much more expensive, like Kerastase.</li>
            <li>love it, as i have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Seller shipped item right away.  </li>
            <li>This product left my hair feeling very soft, fresh and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>While it is not my favorite deep moisture treatment (I prefer Kerastase Masquintense), this is a very good product that I use at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough how much my hair love this product!  </li>
            <li>This is therefore a great product to use several times a week for hair that needs extra treatment.</li>
            <li>It made my hair super, super soft, and shiny, and bouncy!  </li>
            <li>And it really, really works!  </li>
            <li>N pretty.</li>
            <li>Products work great with thick and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>use this more as my maintenance, medium (not deep) moisture</li>
            <li>Love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the moisture!</li>
            <li>She really recommend it!</li>
            <li>My husband and I use it in our long hairs and it is absolutely our favorite to moisturize our hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better to restore shine and silkiness to dry or processed hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is one of the only products that truly conditions my fine textured kinky hair for days at a time.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very moisturizing</li>
            <li>The cover was ajar and much of the product was spilled.</li>
            <li>the main positive is the PRICE.</li>
            <li>So I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my dry, coarse hair nice &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>did have to do 1 thing I don&#x27;t normally do.</li>
            <li>I love the recovery shampoo and condition from Joico, but this product wash TOO heavy for me.</li>
            <li>I ended up with lively, shiny, springy, bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>Helps make my hair very soft and seems to help minimize the damage.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft, hydrated</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my transitioning hair supper soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>After air drying, my hair was super soft and had a slight sheen to it.</li>
            <li>However, I contacted Amazon and they quickly sent me a half replacement.</li>
            <li>so my hair is thick but fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time and my thick hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t add enough to make it drip down my hair but enough so that it was less like vaseline and more like putting a conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li>My comb literally slid right through my natural, kinky, thick, coarse hair!!!  </li>
            <li>I have really curly and tightly coiled hair.</li>

            <li> I also use it for my hair weekly to restore damage from chemicals (hair color) and heat (flat irons, blow dryer).  </li>
            <li> It might be a little too moisturizing for thin hair, but for thick hair, that need extra moisture works really good.</li>
            <li> Daughter uses it too &amp; loves it on her long, dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I use this weekly for my daughter&#x27;s very course, thick, long hair and it make it like silk.  </li>
            <li> To fix this problem for me, I actually added a little water and mixed with the conditioner before I applied.</li>
            <li> I have dry hard-to-control-wannabe-wavy/straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and it takes out all my tangles when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I am mixed (black and puerto rican)</li>
            <li> so my hair is very dry</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every single product that promises to end frizz and endless volume.</li>
            <li> I was gliding my wide tooth comb thru my hair while I was rinsing.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few that actually delivers.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m black with bra strap length relaxed 4a/b hair, tends to be on the dry side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to people who have thick and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I guess my hair was a little too dry but</li>
            <li> I am a dark brunette by nature.  </li>
            <li> My 4a/4b hair was dry, dull, and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a heavy conditioner, so it&#x27;s not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> Only four stars cause expensive.</li>

            <li> (I mean conditioner).</li>
            <li> I also felt it in my hand and it was very thick and non-slippery</li>
            <li> and I relax my hair so that&#x27;s worse.  </li>
            <li> But this product weighed my hair down horribly.  </li>

            <li> Superb hair mask treatment!  I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and expensive ones too.  My hair stylist recommended and gave me a tube size as a gift to try.  And it really, really works!  I also recommend this to my friends!</li>

            <li> I got a free sample of this product and love it!  I am African American so my hair is very dry and I relax my hair so that&#x27;s worse.  This product left my hair feeling very soft, fresh and smelling good.  But besides that it was very easy to manage after I rinsed out the product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  Also the shampoo and conditioner that goes with this is also really nice.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  Makes my dry, coarse hair nice &amp; soft.  Daughter uses it too &amp; loves it on her long, dyed hair.</li>
            <li> Products work great with thick and wavy hair.  Seller shipped item right away.  I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing that I don&#x27;t love about this product. It makes my transitioning hair supper soft and manageable. Prevents breakage. I am in love...</li>
            <li> Brilhant hair. Marvilous!</li>
            <li> This is one of the only products that truly conditions my fine textured kinky hair for days at a time.</li>
            <li> Suited the purpose at the time. On to better products</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, and I&#x27;ve got the chance to buy it for a very good price. I do recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because someone recommended the shampoo and conditioner from the same product line.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  My 4a/4b hair was dry, dull, and lifeless.  This conditioner revived my curls.  I ended up with lively, shiny, springy, bouncy curls.  Very impressed!! I NEVER want to run out of the stuff.  To the manufacturer:  PLEASE DON&#x27;T EVER DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT!  It&#x27;s the best immediate response my hair has had to any conditioner I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a heavy conditioner, so it&#x27;s not for everyone.  But my hair LOVED it!  So I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!! My husband and I use it in our long hairs and it is absolutely our favorite to moisturize our hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better to restore shine and silkiness to dry or processed hair.  I use this weekly for my daughter&#x27;s very course, thick, long hair and it make it like silk.  I also use it for my hair weekly to restore damage from chemicals (hair color) and heat (flat irons, blow dryer).  My hair looks so healthy and shiny after using the treatment balm!  I love this product and use it along with the Joico Moisture Recovery Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I already had a tube of this when my hair was relaxed and needless to say, I was not disappointed! this is some good stuff! (I mean conditioner). My comb literally slid right through my natural, kinky, thick, coarse hair!!!  My hair is very moisturized and soft. My search has ended!</li>
            <li> This is the only balm that will work!  I have long hair and it takes out all my tangles when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I haven&#x27;t had a conditioner that detangled, provided slip and moisturized as well as this! I applied and didn&#x27;t even read instructions so I had already had it sitting on my head for an hr before I saw that it should only be in for 5 mins. It just melted my tangles away and softened my hair. I was gliding my wide tooth comb thru my hair while I was rinsing. After air drying, my hair was super soft and had a slight sheen to it. Also I&#x27;m black with bra strap length relaxed 4a/b hair, tends to be on the dry side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to do 1 thing I don&#x27;t normally do. I guess my hair was a little too dry but applying this stuff felt like I was putting vaseline into my hair. I also felt it in my hand and it was very thick and non-slippery like there was no water in it (water&#x27;s the 1st ingredient). To fix this problem for me, I actually added a little water and mixed with the conditioner before I applied. I didn&#x27;t add enough to make it drip down my hair but enough so that it was less like vaseline and more like putting a conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thick curly hair. I have tried almost every single product that promises to end frizz and endless volume. This product is one of the few that actually delivers. While it is not my favorite deep moisture treatment (I prefer Kerastase Masquintense), this is a very good product that I use at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this more as my maintenance, medium (not deep) moisture treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended to me by a great hairdresser. It is ideal for people with thick, curly, frizzy, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- the main positive is the PRICE. You get a lot of bang for your buck. Most of the good products that work are much more expensive, like Kerastase. This is therefore a great product to use several times a week for hair that needs extra treatment. This is also great for those of us who have a lot of long hair and need to use a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;- works on frizz&lt;br /&gt;- helps reduce volume&lt;br /&gt;- makes hair shinny&lt;br /&gt;- reduces tangles&lt;br /&gt;- very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner smells wonderful and keeps my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am a dark brunette by nature.  So when I did the ombré and died my tips blonde the Joico put the life and softness back into my hair. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner. Helps make my hair very soft and seems to help minimize the damage.</li>
            <li> This is the best. I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time and my thick hair has never looked better. I definitely recommend this to people who have thick and dry hair.</li>
            <li> This mask is great product. My hair is soft, shiny, straight, and beautiful. I used Moroccan oil, Redken, Kerasstase, Aveda, etc before. But this one is the best. It might be a little too moisturizing for thin hair, but for thick hair, that need extra moisture works really good. Buy it.</li>
            <li> I have dry hard-to-control-wannabe-wavy/straight hair.  But this product weighed my hair down horribly.  I had to wash my hair 4-5 times to finally wash it off.  I love the recovery shampoo and condition from Joico, but this product wash TOO heavy for me.</li>
            <li> Not bad for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Product came damaged. The cover was ajar and much of the product was spilled. However, I contacted Amazon and they quickly sent me a half replacement.</li>
            <li> great product.  love it, as i have naturally curly hair and it needs a lot of moisture.</li>
            <li> The product arrived perfect and in time.</li>
            <li> I have really curly and tightly coiled hair.This conditioner leaves my hair super soft and moisturized. It has great slip when combing through tangles. It is my go to conditioner when I need extra conditioning.</li>
            <li> Great product. You can really feel the moisture!</li>
            <li> Everything was OK! The product is always being great for my wife&#x27;s hair! She really recommend it! The seller did a good job in this process. Congratulations!</li>
