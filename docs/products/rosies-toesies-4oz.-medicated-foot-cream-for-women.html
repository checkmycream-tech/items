            <li>I like the light feel and the pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Love everything about it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Rosie&#x27;s for about two weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t found a better foot lotion.</li>
            <li>I will for sure be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love the way my feet feel all day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.  </li>
            <li>This feels light and amazing, like covering my feet in silk.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Rosies Toesies.</li>
            <li>Shipping - fabulous!</li>
            <li>Absolutely my favorite.</li>
            <li>When can I get some more?</li>
            <li>I will make sure I always have a tube of this on hand.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot believe how quickly this has helped.</li>
            <li>Rosie&#x27;s Tosies felt so refreshing and smelled delightful, and at the end of my long day, my feet still felt fresh.  </li>
            <li>Rosie&#x27;s Toesies is light and non-greasy, smells heavenly of mint and herbs, and softens and exfoliates my feet while helping me prevent that dreaded athlete&#x27;s foot.  </li>
            <li>I would reccomend this product to anyone who wants to feel a bit of luxury in your own home.  </li>
            <li>given as gifts - it&#x27;s a fantastic gift for the Rosie in your life!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was also excited to see when I opened the package that 1% of the profits are donated to the Rosie the Riveter Trust.  </li>
            <li>Happily took it our the box, opened the cap gave a little squeeze and 2/3 of the lotion shot out of the top of the tube and all over my clothes and floor.</li>
            <li>Works great on my dry feet and also keeps them from itching.  </li>
            <li>Sinks in and makes feet feel great.  </li>
            <li>I really (really) dislike most foot anti-fungal creams.</li>
            <li>Will for sure be back to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Cream dispensed from tube well and scent is mild and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Feet</li>
            <li>relief from the very first application.</li>
            <li>My feet wonderful after long day of running back and forth and standing for hours.</li>
            <li>Or just for someone who wants to have soft, yummy smelling, healthy feet!</li>
            <li>Amazing thing about Amazon is that i&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li>Even though I get tired during the day, my feet are still happy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is perfect for someone who is on their feet all day, such as police and military.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it is a great, non-greasy product that I actually use on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heeling, makes your feet soft, and it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Not to mention spending 8 hours a day in boots in the hot weather.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this product non-greasy, but it is made with real essential oils, which give it a pleasant, light, and natural smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few foot moisturizers and have yet to find anything that softens my feet as quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>Not only did Rosie&#x27;s Toesies cure my athletes foot as fast as any other drug-store anti-fungal, but it felt and smelled good putting it on and made my feet softer!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice how little you need to use (for me a dime size for each foot)</li>
            <li>great product, but last time when I ordered in April, they sent me the product that expired at June 2013, I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble to return it.</li>
            <li>In a matter of a few days, I can already feel an amazing difference.  </li>
            <li>OK, the product is really nice, but at $25 a tube, it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Other foot creams I&#x27;ve tried have felt good at the beginning of my shift but just did not last.  </li>
            <li>It smells mildly like the rosemary and peppermint essential oils and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after application.</li>
            <li>I love my flip flops, but by the end of summer, my feet are a mess.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many foot creams/treatments that I have used, I dont have to cover my feet with socks because of the greasy heavy feel.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday specially since my feet take much abuse from working all day and this lotion leaves my feet so soft!!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Cools my feet and makes them soft!</li>
            <li>I am also amazed at how little you need - a tiny dollup will easily cover your whole foot!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pay much if any attention to my feet and when I tried Rosie&#x27;s Toesies for the occasional athlete&#x27;s foot I found my feet so smooth and soft that I actually wore sandals in public!</li>
            <li>but my feet have never been so soft.</li>
            <li>My feet are soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really think this product has a lot of potential, but not at that price point.</li>
            <li>These days, we just have to be cost conscious.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason i have only purchased this product only 2 times in 2011, was because i could go through 1 4oz tube in a month (applying every day) and at $25 i settled for other creams that were considerably less effective but at 1/3 of the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many others over the years and have never liked one enough to go back to it after the tube was gone.  </li>
            <li>I will stick to what I used last summer that fixed my cracked heels, Miracle of Aloe Miracle Heel Stick.  </li>
            <li>My favorite feature is how well the Vitamins A, and E, and fruit acids actually exfoliate dead skin cells because even though i i scrub my feet twice a week and moisturize every day my feet will still feel rough and dry at night-until i used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>felt incredibly soft after long week of hands on and feet pounding the pavement WORK!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>

            <li> felt incredibly soft after long week of hands on and feet pounding the pavement WORK!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> The dried skin healed up, calouses were decreased (but not to the extent that feed were damaged further), and feet felt a lot better.</li>
            <li> However, after spending nearly a week constantly on my feet in heavy shoes, my feet needed some relief AND some pampering.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foot cream for anyone (male or female) watching their foot-skin be slowly damaged by boots or wear.</li>
            <li> work I&#x27;m standing on my feet literally the entire time and can only wear flats or heels which is very rough on my feet.</li>
            <li> As a detective, my job often entails long hours, for days in a row.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wash my hands after using it, just use the stick to apply and it keeps my heels from cracking as long as I use it.  </li>
            <li> Using this you don&#x27;t need to grate or grind off your dry skin on your feet.  </li>
            <li> I just got another cream with the same active ingredient for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> I had dry spots go away and the itching as well!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just buy lotion with teatree oil in it next time for much less.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for anyone whose feet are trapped in shoes or boots for hours on end.  </li>
            <li> The lotrimin powder completely healed my foot odor and is slowly clearing up the peeling and itching.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way~</li>
            <li> It smells alright, but just seemed like any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t have this when I was in the Army and deployed to Kuwait and Iraq.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price it use to be!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get cracked heels with sandals and have a little bit of athlete&#x27;s foot in my arch with peeling and redness.  </li>
            <li> Give your feet a treat, while at the same time preventing irritating foot problems.  </li>
            <li> Can slow down on use after heels are healed.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but the lotion went to quickly, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> My feet tend to sweat a lot which makes me prone to athlete&#x27;s foot, but with Rosie&#x27;s Toesies, all problematic issues with my feet are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> For the hard to buy for shopper on your holiday list - you now have the solution.</li>
            <li> This is very hard on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Heels cracked and dry, calluses from work boots and feet that are feeling downright ugly and tired.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the smell makes me feel like I am at an expensive spa each and every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> Normally, in the winter months I get horrible cracks in my heels and while using this product I&#x27;ve managed to avoid these painful cracks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really really disappointed.</li>
            <li> plastic tube was horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this! Works great on my dry feet and also keeps them from itching.  Will be buying again when i need lotion for my feet..</li>
            <li> For months I&#x27;ve been struggling with burning and itching on my feet. Didn&#x27;t think it was athlete&#x27;s foot so I just&lt;br /&gt;kept trying foot cream after foot cream to try to get some relief. Nothing worked. Finally I saw Rosie&#x27;s Toesies&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon and decided to give it a try. OMG...relief from the very first application. It smells heavenly but more&lt;br /&gt;importantly it soothes that burning sensation immediately. So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> An amzing product! After 12 years of hitting the streets in booted feet and 15+ years of sweaty running shoes, I have been searching for a product like this!  Rosie&#x27;s Toesie&#x27;s is amazing.  I have tried many others over the years and have never liked one enough to go back to it after the tube was gone.  Rosie&#x27;s Toesies is light and non-greasy, smells heavenly of mint and herbs, and softens and exfoliates my feet while helping me prevent that dreaded athlete&#x27;s foot.  I am a Rosie customer for life now!</li>
            <li> As a detective, my job often entails long hours, for days in a row.  This is very hard on my feet.  Other foot creams I&#x27;ve tried have felt good at the beginning of my shift but just did not last.  Rosie&#x27;s Tosies felt so refreshing and smelled delightful, and at the end of my long day, my feet still felt fresh.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone whose feet are trapped in shoes or boots for hours on end.  Even though I get tired during the day, my feet are still happy!</li>
            <li> I really (really) dislike most foot anti-fungal creams. However, after spending nearly a week constantly on my feet in heavy shoes, my feet needed some relief AND some pampering.  Not only did Rosie&#x27;s Toesies cure my athletes foot as fast as any other drug-store anti-fungal, but it felt and smelled good putting it on and made my feet softer!  A product like this was sorely needed for hard-working feet.  I was also excited to see when I opened the package that 1% of the profits are donated to the Rosie the Riveter Trust.  Love everything about it.  Women deserve Rosies Toesies!</li>
            <li> As an athlete with diabetes, I pay attention to my feet.  Rosies Toesies is the best foot lotion product I&#x27;ve used.  Love the pepperminty smell too!</li>
            <li> Not only is this product non-greasy, but it is made with real essential oils, which give it a pleasant, light, and natural smell.  I am also amazed at how little you need - a tiny dollup will easily cover your whole foot!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using Rosie&#x27;s for about two weeks now, and I haven&#x27;t found a better foot lotion. My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t have this when I was in the Army and deployed to Kuwait and Iraq. I&#x27;d say this is perfect for someone who is on their feet all day, such as police and military. Or just for someone who wants to have soft, yummy smelling, healthy feet! A little bit goes a long way, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. I will for sure be ordering more. For the hard to buy for shopper on your holiday list - you now have the solution.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT~~ I have been using it for only a week but my feet have never been so soft. Love the way my feet feel all day.  Little goes a long way~ Will for sure be back to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Been using Rosie&#x27;s Toesies since August 2011.  I&#x27;ve found that it is a great, non-greasy product that I actually use on a regular basis.  I like the light feel and the pleasant scent.  It&#x27;s also nice how little you need to use (for me a dime size for each foot) so it lasts longer. Normally, in the winter months I get horrible cracks in my heels and while using this product I&#x27;ve managed to avoid these painful cracks.  There was a period of three weeks where I let my supply run out and the cracks came back.  Only a week after re-applying Rosie&#x27;s Toesies just once a day has restored them. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Lotion is the best.  My feet are soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic tube was horrible.  The bottom heat sealed seam had opened and I lost 1/3 of cream.  I emptied into another container and use it daily.  Hence the 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> Rosie&#x27;s Toesies not only prevents athlete&#x27;s foot, it softens and refreshes your feet in just a matter of days. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday specially since my feet take much abuse from working all day and this lotion leaves my feet so soft!! I had dry spots go away and the itching as well! My nails even look better!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on working feet! I don&#x27;t pay much if any attention to my feet and when I tried Rosie&#x27;s Toesies for the occasional athlete&#x27;s foot I found my feet so smooth and soft that I actually wore sandals in public! Thanks for a great product.  Would recommend it for everyone!</li>
            <li> great product, but last time when I ordered in April, they sent me the product that expired at June 2013, I didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble to return it. And indeed it was a good product. But I just order another one, the product arrived today, and it expires in June 2013!!!!!!!! Keep sending customer expired item is just not acceptable.</li>
            <li> Great concept, but not for the amount you get for the price. Sorry, but the lotion went to quickly, especially for the money. I think I&#x27;ll just buy lotion with teatree oil in it next time for much less. I really think this product has a lot of potential, but not at that price point.</li>
            <li> This foot cream worked wonders. The dried skin healed up, calouses were decreased (but not to the extent that feed were damaged further), and feet felt a lot better. I highly recommend this foot cream for anyone (male or female) watching their foot-skin be slowly damaged by boots or wear.</li>
            <li> The perfect cream for your feet... What can I say?!! It&#x27;s heeling, makes your feet soft, and it&#x27;s cruelty free. I use it daily and my feet look and feel great. My feet tend to sweat a lot which makes me prone to athlete&#x27;s foot, but with Rosie&#x27;s Toesies, all problematic issues with my feet are a thing of the past. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My feet feel wonderful!  My feet wonderful after long day of running back and forth and standing for hours. Great product.</li>
            <li> I love my flip flops, but by the end of summer, my feet are a mess.  Not to mention spending 8 hours a day in boots in the hot weather.  Heels cracked and dry, calluses from work boots and feet that are feeling downright ugly and tired.  Enter Rosies Toesis!  In a matter of a few days, I can already feel an amazing difference.  Unlike many foot creams/treatments that I have used, I dont have to cover my feet with socks because of the greasy heavy feel.  This feels light and amazing, like covering my feet in silk.  Not to mention the smell makes me feel like I am at an expensive spa each and every time I use it.  My heels and calluses are already smoother and softer. I honestly cannot believe how quickly this has helped. I would reccomend this product to anyone who wants to feel a bit of luxury in your own home.  Give your feet a treat, while at the same time preventing irritating foot problems.  I LOVE Rosies Toesies.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and Effective!  Cream dispensed from tube well and scent is mild and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Feet felt incredibly soft after long week of hands on and feet pounding the pavement WORK!&lt;br /&gt;Have given as gifts - it&#x27;s a fantastic gift for the Rosie in your life!&lt;br /&gt;Price is great!  Shipping - fabulous!</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite. Great smell, great feeling, great ingredients. When can I get some more?</li>
            <li> Wow! Last time i purchased this was in October 2011 and i loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For work I&#x27;m standing on my feet literally the entire time and can only wear flats or heels which is very rough on my feet. My biggest concerns are moisture and fungal prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this product is incredible! I&#x27;ve tried quite a few foot moisturizers and have yet to find anything that softens my feet as quickly and effectively. It smells mildly like the rosemary and peppermint essential oils and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after application. My favorite feature is how well the Vitamins A, and E, and fruit acids actually exfoliate dead skin cells because even though i i scrub my feet twice a week and moisturize every day my feet will still feel rough and dry at night-until i used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason i have only purchased this product only 2 times in 2011, was because i could go through 1 4oz tube in a month (applying every day) and at $25 i settled for other creams that were considerably less effective but at 1/3 of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But OMG, a random night in 2013 i can&#x27;t sleep -end up browsing on amazon and think of of that lovely foot cream i found on amazon in 2011 and it&#x27;s half the price it use to be!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay, I&#x27;m back. Girl Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sep 19, 2013 UPDATE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just received another tube. Happily took it our the box, opened the cap gave a little squeeze and 2/3 of the lotion shot out of the top of the tube and all over my clothes and floor. Amazing thing about Amazon is that i&#x27;m sending it back. BUT- on the back of the tube it says EXP 06/2013. THAT is unacceptable. I&#x27;m really really disappointed. This may just be a return instead of repurchase. I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> Using this you don&#x27;t need to grate or grind off your dry skin on your feet.  Sinks in and makes feet feel great.  Made in America by a woman for women.  I will make sure I always have a tube of this on hand.</li>
            <li> OK, the product is really nice, but at $25 a tube, it&#x27;s prohibitively expensive.  I just got another cream with the same active ingredient for a fraction of the cost.  These days, we just have to be cost conscious.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a week.  I get cracked heels with sandals and have a little bit of athlete&#x27;s foot in my arch with peeling and redness.  It just didn&#x27;t help anything at all.  It smells alright, but just seemed like any other lotion.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for me, so I returned it.  I also get foot odor.  The lotrimin powder completely healed my foot odor and is slowly clearing up the peeling and itching.  I will stick to what I used last summer that fixed my cracked heels, Miracle of Aloe Miracle Heel Stick.  I don&#x27;t have to wash my hands after using it, just use the stick to apply and it keeps my heels from cracking as long as I use it.  Can slow down on use after heels are healed.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion after every pedicure I get (sort of as protection).  Cools my feet and makes them soft!</li>
