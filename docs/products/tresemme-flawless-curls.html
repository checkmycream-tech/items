            <li>In my quest for finding effective products to enhance and maintain curly hair, Tresemme is an inexpensive and relatively effective line of products to address the needs of curly haired people.  </li>

            <li>This one is nice but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>She got this conditioner and a leave-in kind.</li>
            <li>Thanks Tresemme Flawless Curls.</li>
            <li>9/8/13- I am still loving this product.</li>
            <li>I have parts that tangle very easily</li>
            <li>It makes my curls soft and flawless, I also get compliments on the smell it leaves in my hair!</li>
            <li>BUT, the ingredients aren&#x27;t the most kind.</li>
            <li>Felt nice going through my hair and got it very clean.</li>
            <li>But once I started using this product from the first use I could comb thru (even though my son still cries lol)</li>
            <li>I damaged my beautiful curls when I went through my \\&quot;emo\\&quot; phase which required a lot of hairspray to maintain my hairstyles (which were all straight.)  </li>
            <li>I love the size and this conditioner gives me the slip I need for detangling.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did.</li>

            <li>I added more and let it sit for a while</li>

            <li>Product is just okay.  </li>
            <li>It smells great &amp; works really well</li>
            <li>and it smells ok.</li>
            <li>okay using this for 3/4 days in a row to keep my curls clumped and hydrated.</li>
            <li>however the shipping cost alot more then i realized.</li>

            <li>This stuff works :)</li>

            <li>Cheap and easy to find (Walmart</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>love this conditioner , plus I don&#x27;t use much!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a big bottle for a great price.  </li>
            <li>: Finish with a light anti-frizz serum or moroccan oil, or hairspray, or light gel.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re trying to unload it by offering it dirt cheap on amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I just use this on my hair (co-wash)  its perfect for everyday use, no shampoo</li>
            <li>and this helps smooth it out.</li>
            <li>more than worth it.</li>
            <li>Price was nice and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It was free to ship</li>
            <li>The size and price fit my budget.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo for the best price for my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and this product is good at untangling my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural all my life but decided to go on a healthy hair journey long hair journey for 5-6 months now &amp; this conditioner is the best.</li>
            <li>Upon the first use my hair was extremely happy and soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I use this both as part of my cowashing and as a leave-in (just a small amount) and my hair feels awesome.</li>
            <li>It is worth it!</li>
            <li>Bought this to help moisturize my dry hair and am happy to say that it works.</li>
            <li>Luckily it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and curls are so defined...will reorder more!</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and looks so healthy after using this product!</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well and feels very light on my hair.</li>
            <li>have tried other products that were supposed to be better but they aren&#x27;t as good even though they are twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are natural and need a great conditioner</li>
            <li>Her wild curls are now long awesome spirals and not so puffy or triangle.</li>
            <li>the hair is so much softer and the curls are more defined</li>
            <li>So overall, good for hair?</li>
            <li>I have never had a conditioner with such good slip.</li>
            <li>I love the slip and the curls are really define after my co-washs.</li>
            <li>Keeps my coils super moisturized and defines them as well.</li>
            <li>(it worked but stopped after a while)This helped out tremendously.</li>
            <li>Super.</li>
            <li>Now a year later my curls are completely back and look better than EVER!!!  </li>
            <li>It pretty good but in the boxing the bag was already open and it was spilling out in the box..</li>
            <li>I love it, I use it as a Pre-Poo &amp; conditioner &amp; my hair is sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>So i went from shirley temple to Mufasa from the Lion King after the first traumatizing group shower!</li>
            <li>It has a very smooth texture and good slip when applied to wet natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Flawless Curls Conditioner for a few weeks and it simply does a fabulous job at finger detangles and soothing the hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair actually behaves and curls up nicely without frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>by the time i graduated my hair was thick, healthy and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>When i went through navy boot camp, they cut my super-curly hair short... which was pretty cute, until they told us we couldn&#x27;t have gel or mousse (in bootcamp, who would have thought!?</li>
            <li>Ok so i needed a hydrating condish &amp; found this at walgreens on sale for $4.79 i was torn between all the rest but decided on this particular one b/c it related most to my hair.</li>
            <li>and I could tell the difference right away.</li>
            <li>and I am not shy on the amount since it is economical.  </li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner because its a big bottle for a reasonable price (I&#x27;m a Doll on a Budget), &amp; I am thrilled that I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li>Great detangler for ultra thick type 3/4 hair</li>
            <li>Works even better when it leave it in for an hour mixed with some olive oil</li>
            <li>Came Exactly on time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too expensive and it works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will make my hair somewhat crisp to the touch.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t exactly define my curls but it did detangle and my hair was flowing with the wind.</li>
            <li>Plus when I put my deep conditioner my curls were more</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner and will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li>First time trying this product</li>
            <li>Does a great job of conditioning my seriously damaged hair.</li>
            <li>because Im natural and makes my hair more curly and soft also leaves it hydrated</li>
            <li>Good as usual</li>
            <li>This works very well at leaving my hair feel soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Your curls are missing out if they&#x27;ve never tasted this conditioner&#x27;s goodness!! :p</li>
            <li>Or, dry to about 75% or more and use a diffuser to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has long, straight hair, and I&#x27;m sure it will work well for her.</li>
            <li>I almost don&#x27;t even need to use gel in my hair because this is such a good conditioner that if I comb my hair in the shower after applying I can just pat dry my hair and go.</li>
            <li>and it comes straight to my front door...</li>
            <li>Simple, cheap, not as toxic, and ultra conditioning was what I needed, and this product delivered it all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very god for co washing, causes build up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got to say, I&#x27;m really amazed.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how it works with the upcoming DC summer, but I have high hopes!</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Really shows off curls</li>
            <li>Turn head over or to the side and gently scrunch in a curl lotion cream or lotion.</li>
            <li>You will eventually know how much to use without making your hair greasy, crunchy, etc.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does absolutely nothing for my hair as a conditioner, but it works wonders as a curl creme.</li>
            <li>Use a micro-cloth towel or 100% cotton item (I use men&#x27;s 100% undershirts) to continue gently scrunching hair to remove excess moisture.</li>
            <li>I have very long/medium (About 17 inches?</li>
            <li>Detangling was so much easier.</li>
            <li>I missed my curls so much when I changed my style.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty smooth and shiny, but no curls or waves to speak of, even when I let it air dry.</li>
            <li>It easily detanglers long dryish hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner didn&#x27;t do any better than other non-curly hair conditioners.</li>
            <li>the other products (hair milk &amp; gel) from this line. :)</li>
            <li>Let hair air dry completely, and avoid touching.</li>
            <li>Others with curly hair (mine is also long) know how important a conditioner is for maintaining their hair.</li>
            <li>I normally research any conditioner I purchase because I have very curly hair and use the no poo method.</li>
            <li>The best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used is the Kerastase Oleo Curl, which is very, very expensive.</li>
            <li>is a new staple!</li>
            <li>Yes I&#x27;m a conditioner freak and co-wash a lot, particularly during the spring and summer time.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner was ok, it wasn&#x27;t the worst one I have ever used and wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>I sometimes leave it in and it keeps my hair decently hydrated.</li>
            <li>Even with relatively tempered length of my hair this works tremendously to bring out the curls I do have.</li>
            <li>The reason I give it 4 is because it burned my eye more than the other conditioners that I used so far.</li>
            <li>It was then that i discovered that putting a tiny bit of conditioner in my hair in place of gel was not only effective in taming the mane, but it also left my curls soft instead of crunchy!</li>
            <li>It tames my frizzy hair and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>I keeps my hair very soft and it helps it to grow.  </li>
            <li>I bought it when the local store was out of my other co-wash favorite</li>
            <li>Then I saw it in my local grocery store, how convenient, right next to the one I really wanted.  </li>
            <li>the smell is amazing and it stays with you for a few days even after adding other products.made my hair very silky.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair (3C/4A) and my hair LOVES this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never dried straighter in my life.</li>
            <li>Then wash off completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one thing it did do is leave my hair soft, which is why I didn&#x27;t quite want to rate it as drastically as one star.</li>
            <li>For those of you with sensitive nose idk how u will do with this</li>
            <li>If your in a more kinkier hair type--like myself--you might appreciate this conditioner since it&#x27;s thick, moisturizes and washes out well.  </li>
            <li>My husband of mixed decent also likes this conditioner to keep his fro soft.</li>
            <li>This is a very reasonably priced conditioner that does help my dry frizzy curls for a fraction of some the salon brands,  I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>it lasts long and it is very affordable.</li>
            <li>Start with minimal product the first time you do this.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not bad, it just smells like heavy perfume to me).</li>
            <li>tames my frizzy, and can be left in for daily curl control, also its really slippery</li>
            <li>Lost some of the conditioner due to the top was not screwed on tight.  </li>
            <li>I was reluctant to try this conditioner because I&#x27;ve tried TRESemme products before and was not impressed, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does what it says; it hydrates very well, still has a lot of slip and it last a long time I just ran out of my bottle</li>
            <li>Barely moisturized my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Now, old enough to research and study what to do she found this idea about not using shampoo on the internet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly thick and awfully dry most of the time.  </li>
            <li>and this makes it look so much cuter than any other conditioner I used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very curly and thick and everyone else including myself in the family have straight hair</li>
            <li>I tried not flat ironing my hair and not using hairspray anymore, but that did not restore my hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> In my quest for finding effective products to enhance and maintain curly hair, Tresemme is an inexpensive and relatively effective line of products to address the needs of curly haired people.  </li>
            <li> Loving the consistency of the conditioner...gives my hair the needed slip for detangling.</li>
            <li> This one is nice but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> She got this conditioner and a leave-in kind.</li>
            <li> Thanks Tresemme Flawless Curls.</li>
            <li> 9/8/13- I am still loving this product.</li>
            <li> I have parts that tangle very easily</li>
            <li> It makes my curls soft and flawless, I also get compliments on the smell it leaves in my hair!</li>
            <li> BUT, the ingredients aren&#x27;t the most kind.</li>
            <li> Felt nice going through my hair and got it very clean.</li>
            <li> But once I started using this product from the first use I could comb thru (even though my son still cries lol)</li>
            <li> I damaged my beautiful curls when I went through my \\&quot;emo\\&quot; phase which required a lot of hairspray to maintain my hairstyles (which were all straight.)  </li>
            <li> I love the size and this conditioner gives me the slip I need for detangling.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love of my [curls&#x27;]</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this stuff.</li>

            <li> /&gt;After one use, I am in love, and I already know I will repurchase and use this item.</li>

            <li> Cheap and easy to find (Walmart</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> love this conditioner , plus I don&#x27;t use much!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big bottle for a great price.  </li>
            <li> : Finish with a light anti-frizz serum or moroccan oil, or hairspray, or light gel.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re trying to unload it by offering it dirt cheap on amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just use this on my hair (co-wash)  its perfect for everyday use, no shampoo</li>
            <li> and this helps smooth it out.</li>
            <li> more than worth it.</li>
            <li> Price was nice and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It was free to ship</li>
            <li> The size and price fit my budget.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo for the best price for my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and this product is good at untangling my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural all my life but decided to go on a healthy hair journey long hair journey for 5-6 months now &amp; this conditioner is the best.</li>
            <li> Upon the first use my hair was extremely happy and soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I use this both as part of my cowashing and as a leave-in (just a small amount) and my hair feels awesome.</li>
            <li> It is worth it!</li>
            <li> Bought this to help moisturize my dry hair and am happy to say that it works.</li>
            <li> Luckily it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and curls are so defined...will reorder more!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and looks so healthy after using this product!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well and feels very light on my hair.</li>
            <li> have tried other products that were supposed to be better but they aren&#x27;t as good even though they are twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are natural and need a great conditioner</li>
            <li> Her wild curls are now long awesome spirals and not so puffy or triangle.</li>
            <li> the hair is so much softer and the curls are more defined</li>
            <li> So overall, good for hair?</li>
            <li> I have never had a conditioner with such good slip.</li>
            <li> I love the slip and the curls are really define after my co-washs.</li>
            <li> Keeps my coils super moisturized and defines them as well.</li>
            <li> (it worked but stopped after a while)This helped out tremendously.</li>
            <li> Super.</li>
            <li> Now a year later my curls are completely back and look better than EVER!!!  </li>
            <li> It pretty good but in the boxing the bag was already open and it was spilling out in the box..</li>
            <li> I love it, I use it as a Pre-Poo &amp; conditioner &amp; my hair is sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> So i went from shirley temple to Mufasa from the Lion King after the first traumatizing group shower!</li>
            <li> It has a very smooth texture and good slip when applied to wet natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Flawless Curls Conditioner for a few weeks and it simply does a fabulous job at finger detangles and soothing the hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair actually behaves and curls up nicely without frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> by the time i graduated my hair was thick, healthy and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> When i went through navy boot camp, they cut my super-curly hair short... which was pretty cute, until they told us we couldn&#x27;t have gel or mousse (in bootcamp, who would have thought!?</li>
            <li> Ok so i needed a hydrating condish &amp; found this at walgreens on sale for $4.79 i was torn between all the rest but decided on this particular one b/c it related most to my hair.</li>
            <li> and I could tell the difference right away.</li>
            <li> and I am not shy on the amount since it is economical.  </li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because its a big bottle for a reasonable price (I&#x27;m a Doll on a Budget), &amp; I am thrilled that I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li> Great detangler for ultra thick type 3/4 hair</li>
            <li> Works even better when it leave it in for an hour mixed with some olive oil</li>
            <li> Came Exactly on time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive and it works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will make my hair somewhat crisp to the touch.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t exactly define my curls but it did detangle and my hair was flowing with the wind.</li>
            <li> Plus when I put my deep conditioner my curls were more</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner and will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product</li>
            <li> Does a great job of conditioning my seriously damaged hair.</li>
            <li> because Im natural and makes my hair more curly and soft also leaves it hydrated</li>
            <li> Good as usual</li>
            <li> This works very well at leaving my hair feel soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Your curls are missing out if they&#x27;ve never tasted this conditioner&#x27;s goodness!! :p</li>
            <li> Or, dry to about 75% or more and use a diffuser to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, straight hair, and I&#x27;m sure it will work well for her.</li>
            <li> I almost don&#x27;t even need to use gel in my hair because this is such a good conditioner that if I comb my hair in the shower after applying I can just pat dry my hair and go.</li>
            <li> and it comes straight to my front door...</li>
            <li> Simple, cheap, not as toxic, and ultra conditioning was what I needed, and this product delivered it all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very god for co washing, causes build up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say, I&#x27;m really amazed.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it works with the upcoming DC summer, but I have high hopes!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Really shows off curls</li>
            <li> Turn head over or to the side and gently scrunch in a curl lotion cream or lotion.</li>
            <li> You will eventually know how much to use without making your hair greasy, crunchy, etc.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does absolutely nothing for my hair as a conditioner, but it works wonders as a curl creme.</li>
            <li> Use a micro-cloth towel or 100% cotton item (I use men&#x27;s 100% undershirts) to continue gently scrunching hair to remove excess moisture.</li>
            <li> I have very long/medium (About 17 inches?</li>
            <li> Detangling was so much easier.</li>
            <li> I missed my curls so much when I changed my style.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty smooth and shiny, but no curls or waves to speak of, even when I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It easily detanglers long dryish hair.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner didn&#x27;t do any better than other non-curly hair conditioners.</li>
            <li> the other products (hair milk &amp; gel) from this line. :)</li>
            <li> Let hair air dry completely, and avoid touching.</li>
            <li> Others with curly hair (mine is also long) know how important a conditioner is for maintaining their hair.</li>
            <li> I normally research any conditioner I purchase because I have very curly hair and use the no poo method.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used is the Kerastase Oleo Curl, which is very, very expensive.</li>
            <li> is a new staple!</li>
            <li> Yes I&#x27;m a conditioner freak and co-wash a lot, particularly during the spring and summer time.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner was ok, it wasn&#x27;t the worst one I have ever used and wasn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> I sometimes leave it in and it keeps my hair decently hydrated.</li>
            <li> Even with relatively tempered length of my hair this works tremendously to bring out the curls I do have.</li>
            <li> The reason I give it 4 is because it burned my eye more than the other conditioners that I used so far.</li>
            <li> It was then that i discovered that putting a tiny bit of conditioner in my hair in place of gel was not only effective in taming the mane, but it also left my curls soft instead of crunchy!</li>
            <li> It tames my frizzy hair and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li> I keeps my hair very soft and it helps it to grow.  </li>
            <li> I bought it when the local store was out of my other co-wash favorite</li>
            <li> Then I saw it in my local grocery store, how convenient, right next to the one I really wanted.  </li>
            <li> the smell is amazing and it stays with you for a few days even after adding other products.made my hair very silky.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair (3C/4A) and my hair LOVES this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never dried straighter in my life.</li>
            <li> Then wash off completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one thing it did do is leave my hair soft, which is why I didn&#x27;t quite want to rate it as drastically as one star.</li>
            <li> For those of you with sensitive nose idk how u will do with this</li>
            <li> If your in a more kinkier hair type--like myself--you might appreciate this conditioner since it&#x27;s thick, moisturizes and washes out well.  </li>
            <li> My husband of mixed decent also likes this conditioner to keep his fro soft.</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonably priced conditioner that does help my dry frizzy curls for a fraction of some the salon brands,  I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> it lasts long and it is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Start with minimal product the first time you do this.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not bad, it just smells like heavy perfume to me).</li>
            <li> tames my frizzy, and can be left in for daily curl control, also its really slippery</li>
            <li> Lost some of the conditioner due to the top was not screwed on tight.  </li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try this conditioner because I&#x27;ve tried TRESemme products before and was not impressed, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does what it says; it hydrates very well, still has a lot of slip and it last a long time I just ran out of my bottle</li>
            <li> Barely moisturized my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Now, old enough to research and study what to do she found this idea about not using shampoo on the internet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly thick and awfully dry most of the time.  </li>
            <li> and this makes it look so much cuter than any other conditioner I used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very curly and thick and everyone else including myself in the family have straight hair</li>
            <li> I tried not flat ironing my hair and not using hairspray anymore, but that did not restore my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it does tame my frizzy prone hair and the real reason I buy this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners that were all natural and none of them works even close to this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair, instead I have dead straight hair that constantly get either too dry or too oily.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a conditioner for my long, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Flat ironing my hair and using hairspray messed my curls up.  </li>
            <li> So I picked this shampoo and conditoner and stopped flat ironing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I then applied whipped shea butter and flat twist.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Instead of curls, my hair was half wavy and half straight.  </li>
            <li> When the above routine stops working (after a few days my hair begins to look weighed down and dull), that&#x27;s when I shampoo.or hairspray, or light gel.</li>
            <li> I have used it no more than a few times so far but the feeling I get from using this conditioner is very soft.</li>
            <li> so no big deal and only a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> My local wags no longer carries this, but I will be hunting this down anywhere else.</li>
            <li> if you follow the tightly curly method like I do occasionally, this works well.</li>
            <li> I put this on sopping wet hair and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> While hair is sopping wet, untangle and part as desired using a wide tooth</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter have had trouble with her hair for years.</li>
            <li> I have extremely kinky hair</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and have been pulling my hair out.....</li>
            <li> with other conditioners, but not with this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t curly, but the other tresemme conditioners don&#x27;t detangle ad well as this one does.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to figure out what was causing it, but after reading about other people experiencing TRESemme breakouts, I stopped using the conditioner and everything cleared up.</li>
            <li> main complaint is that products for curly hair usually contain alcohol which leaves hair curly but somewhat dried out.</li>
            <li> but I wrongly ordered curly ones because I have straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have THIN HAIR that doesn&#x27;t usually tangle all that much.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well without weighing my curls down.</li>
            <li> My hair was so weighed down that half my curl was gone.</li>
            <li> When the above routine stops working (after a few days my hair begins to look weighed down and dull), that&#x27;s when I shampoo.</li>
            <li> I usually put it in after my hair is half dry just to sort of tame</li>
            <li> little by little.  </li>
            <li> I had this sitting around my home for quite a few weeks before I used it.</li>
            <li> Threw it out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair very hydrated, my dandruff is gone and even gives my boring dead straight hair with some tendency to waves.</li>
            <li> I would like to say that for the longest time, I disliked tresemme conditioners.</li>

            <li> EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> Thick and extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very tight curly hair that tangles a lot and</li>
            <li> My hair is air drying, is pillow-soft, detangled, and fluffy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what &amp;#34;flawless curls&amp;#34; means unless TRESemme considers the curls themselves to be the flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it a tad hard to word a review about something like this.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> If your hair likes thick, creamy products this is the conditioner for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a conditioner that moisturizes my curls without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have very long wavy to curly hair that suffers from frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since tried less expensive keratin-infused products, but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> is because it&#x27;s very thick and</li>
            <li> but It was a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that I HATE the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I have to either wash it or use dry shampoo :(</li>
            <li> Black ladies please try this I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite shocked at how bad this product is for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I tend to add this to s spray bottle with water because I hate the mess</li>
            <li> or ill give it to my mum</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but it exceed expectations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if there was a bad lot that came off the manufacturing floor</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Talks about curls!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good as usual but I wrongly ordered curly ones because I have straight hair. well I guess It would still work. or ill give it to my mum</li>
            <li> It pretty good but in the boxing the bag was already open and it was spilling out in the box..</li>
            <li> Yes I&#x27;m a conditioner freak and co-wash a lot, particularly during the spring and summer time.  I&#x27;ve been using this Flawless Curls Conditioner for a few weeks and it simply does a fabulous job at finger detangles and soothing the hair.  If your in a more kinkier hair type--like myself--you might appreciate this conditioner since it&#x27;s thick, moisturizes and washes out well.  I put this on sopping wet hair and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Great product for Natural Styles. It has a very smooth texture and good slip when applied to wet natural hair. Black ladies please try this I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well and feels very light on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great that I can buy this and it comes straight to my front door... I hate picking stuff like this up at the store.</li>
            <li> I use this for my cowash. No complaints. I love the size and this conditioner gives me the slip I need for detangling. This will be a staple in my hair care regimen</li>
            <li> If your hair likes thick, creamy products this is the conditioner for you. I transitioned from VO5 to this. Boy am I glad I did. Upon the first use my hair was extremely happy and soooo soft. I had this sitting around my home for quite a few weeks before I used it. It kept my hair moisturized for about three days after applying it as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair (3C/4A) and my hair LOVES this stuff.  It instantly works the minute I put it on.  No need to do extensive overnight conditioning or anything.  I&#x27;ve tried other conditioners that were all natural and none of them works even close to this.  It&#x27;s a big bottle for a great price.  It has a strong, but neutral smell.  I recommend this to people with coarser hair.</li>
            <li> Love of my [curls&#x27;] Life!!!i purchased the at walgreens on clearance for about 0.15 cents, and decided to try it only because i had a coupon. I am in LOVE with this stuff. It does EVERYTHING the label claims and more. Keeps my coils super moisturized and defines them as well. My local wags no longer carries this, but I will be hunting this down anywhere else. Your curls are missing out if they&#x27;ve never tasted this conditioner&#x27;s goodness!! :p</li>
            <li> My hair has never dried straighter in my life. It&#x27;s pretty smooth and shiny, but no curls or waves to speak of, even when I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend uses this and she said it works great for her hair and I would have to agree it does work. overall it does what it says</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Barely moisturized my wavy hair. Threw it out after a few uses. Good thing it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help moisturize my dry hair and am happy to say that it works. The price and reviews on youtube convinced me to try this conditioner. My hair has responded well to this product. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Simple, cheap, not as toxic, and ultra conditioning was what I needed, and this product delivered it all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap and easy to find (Walmart $3.98)&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice, light and is NOT overpowering&lt;br /&gt;- Amazing slip! Great detangler for ultra thick type 3/4 hair&lt;br /&gt;- Great DC treatment&lt;br /&gt;- Multi-use product! Rinse out conditioner, leave in conditioner, and deep conditioner&lt;br /&gt;- Has good conditioning agents in it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing my hair remained detangled and pillow soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed. My hair is air drying, is pillow-soft, detangled, and fluffy! I am very impressed! I&#x27;ve never had this kind of result before with ANYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one use, I am in love, and I already know I will repurchase and use this item. I will no longer need to search for a conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, *Cetearyl Alcohol, *Dimethicone, *Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, *Behentrimonium Chloride, Thiamine HC, Ascorbic acid, Tocopheryl acetate, *Panthenol, Niacinmine, Biotin, Fragrance, Lactic acid, Dipropylene Glycol, Potassium Chloride, *Amodimethicone, Disodium edta, DMDM hydantoin, *Centrimonium Chloride, PEG-150 Disterate, Polysorbate 20, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better with out drying I just was and tresemme spray curling product and I&#x27;m good to go</li>
            <li> Does a great job of conditioning my seriously damaged hair. Works even better when it leave it in for an hour mixed with some olive oil</li>
            <li> tames my frizzy, and can be left in for daily curl control, also its really slippery so it makes detangling easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not very god for co washing, causes build up.</li>
            <li> My go to conditioner! I use this for my kimmaytube leave in and it works along with it perfectly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got to say, I&#x27;m really amazed. This works great for my curly, 4b/c hair and makes it so soft--even after it dries! I use this both as part of my cowashing and as a leave-in (just a small amount) and my hair feels awesome. We&#x27;ll see how it works with the upcoming DC summer, but I have high hopes!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this with my curly, frizzy hair. It&#x27;s amazing!! It leaves my hair silky, smooth, and no frizz! I&#x27;ve already recommended this product to family and friends!</li>
            <li> I have extremely kinky hair and this makes it look so much cuter than any other conditioner I used. I think I will always like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair, instead I have dead straight hair that constantly get either too dry or too oily. And I had some dandruff that wouldn&#x27;t go away even after using head and shoulders (it worked but stopped after a while)This helped out tremendously. This leaves my hair very hydrated, my dandruff is gone and even gives my boring dead straight hair with some tendency to waves.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. Ordered as subscribe and save. great price, great product. Helps keep the flowing locks in order.</li>
            <li> Came Exactly on time. Product is so smooth and lovely. Smells amazing. Would definitely purchase again. A lot of product for price. Will last a while.</li>
            <li> I have very long wavy to curly hair that suffers from frizz. This conditioner didn&#x27;t do any better than other non-curly hair conditioners. There is another TRESemme conditioner with silk protein [[ASIN:B005UDYTGI TRESemme Healthy Body 24 Hour Body Conditioner, 32 oz, 2 pk]] that works better. When I use that product in combination with [[ASIN:B005GQ6HUK Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Leave-in]] my hair actually behaves and curls up nicely without frizz.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the size and price. I normally research any conditioner I purchase because I have very curly hair and use the no poo method. This conditioner was ok, it wasn&#x27;t the worst one I have ever used and wasn&#x27;t the best. My hair was manageable after using it but I have had better.</li>
            <li> loved but no longer on subscribe and save with amazon</li>
            <li> Really a great conditioner tames the tangles and leaves hair feeling and looking great a good value for the money</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have extremely curly hair and have been pulling my hair out.....literally....with other conditioners, but not with this product.  It has a wonderful detangler and my hair reacts great to it.  My curls are more defined, too.</li>
            <li> Lost some of the conditioner due to the top was not screwed on tight.  The conditioner did not ruin anything else in the box, but the box was trashed. Still going to keep ordering.  This is my third shipment with only one boo-boo.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I love this conditioner as a cowash. It has excellent slip and it makes my hair super soft and moisturized. It&#x27;s not too expensive and it works great!</li>
            <li> I would like to say that for the longest time, I disliked tresemme conditioners. They just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different about this one but It was a game changer for me. I have very tight curly hair that tangles a lot and this conditioner makes it easier for me to detangle my hair! I tend to add this to s spray bottle with water because I hate the mess (I detangle before I wash) and it works the same. My only gripe is that I HATE the way it smells. It&#x27;s overly flowery and it LINGERS like most tresemme conditioners. I sometimes leave it in and it keeps my hair decently hydrated. NOTE: if you follow the tightly curly method like I do occasionally, this works well. I used to use aussie moist but it made my hair feel chalky and I don&#x27;t get that with this. It&#x27;s a staple for me.</li>
            <li> i love this conditioner the smell is amazing and it stays with you for a few days even after adding other products.made my hair very silky.</li>
            <li> I have a mixed race son, his hair has always been an issue!!.,! Always tangling.... But once I started using this product from the first use I could comb thru (even though my son still cries lol) the hair is so much softer and the curls are more defined</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. It moisturizes well without weighing my curls down. And it&#x27;s inexpensive. I spend $35 on my shampoo, but this $4 conditioner is the perfect complement.</li>
            <li> Not the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had but you get a LOT of it. So hopefully you like it if you buy it. Luckily it&#x27;s super cheap.</li>
            <li> I use this and the flawless curls shampoo. It tames my frizzy hair and leaves it very soft. Will continue to buy this!</li>
            <li> Tresemme products are great and amazing. I love that they all work so well together. Always look for the deals. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a good conditioner but it is not available anymore with amazon subscribe program....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they continue it again</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I bought it when the local store was out of my other co-wash favorite and I have been hooked ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the best slip and detangles my hair like nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great for gently cleansing my hair without stripping it and it is an excellent detangler on my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products that were supposed to be better but they aren&#x27;t as good even though they are twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Tresemme never discontinues this one!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Make sure to mix it in for 2-3 mins. Then wash off completely. Really shows off curls</li>
            <li> This is the (second) best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. I have fine, curly hair, but a lot of it. It&#x27;s difficult to find a conditioner that moisturizes my curls without weighing it down. I&#x27;ve tried all types of conditioners throughout my life. The best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used is the Kerastase Oleo Curl, which is very, very expensive. I&#x27;ve since tried less expensive keratin-infused products, but nothing worked. I was reluctant to try this conditioner because I&#x27;ve tried TRESemme products before and was not impressed, but this product is amazing. Great value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips for Using this Product / Tips for Rocking Curly Hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. DO NOT SHAMPOO YOUR HAIR EVERYDAY*. If you need to refresh your curls, condition your hair without shampooing, but avoid working conditioner into your roots. Leave the conditioner in for a couple minutes (this is when I using lather up and wash my face). Wash thoroughly and use fingers to remove tangles. Massage scalp to remove excess oil from roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. While hair is sopping wet, untangle and part as desired using a wide tooth comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Turn head over or to the side and gently scrunch in a curl lotion cream or lotion. Start with minimal product the first time you do this. You will eventually know how much to use without making your hair greasy, crunchy, etc. I actually use Organix Moroccan Argan Creme Conditioner. This conditioner does absolutely nothing for my hair as a conditioner, but it works wonders as a curl creme. My hair is touchably soft and shiny, and my curls are perfect (unless weather is absolutely terrible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Use a micro-cloth towel or 100% cotton item (I use men&#x27;s 100% undershirts) to continue gently scrunching hair to remove excess moisture. Use fingers to set curls if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Let hair air dry completely, and avoid touching. Or, dry to about 75% or more and use a diffuser to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Optional: Finish with a light anti-frizz serum or moroccan oil, or hairspray, or light gel. I seldom need any of these products, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I SHAMPOO my hair 2x per week max. When the above routine stops working (after a few days my hair begins to look weighed down and dull), that&#x27;s when I shampoo.or hairspray, or light gel. I seldom need any of these products, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I SHAMPOO my hair 2x per week max. When the above routine stops working (after a few days my hair begins to look weighed down and dull), that&#x27;s when I shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite shocked at how bad this product is for curly hair. Others with curly hair (mine is also long) know how important a conditioner is for maintaining their hair. This conditioner does the opposite of everything you&#x27;d want. I&#x27;m wondering if there was a bad lot that came off the manufacturing floor and they&#x27;re trying to unload it by offering it dirt cheap on amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slip: A lot of reviewers here have talked about the good slip. All I can think is that they must all be paid reviewers? I couldn&#x27;t even get my fingers through my hair with this stuff. I added more and let it sit for a while and it still took me over 20 minutes to get a wide-toothed shower comb through my hair. I have THIN HAIR that doesn&#x27;t usually tangle all that much. I might as well have thrown a handful of pudding in my hair for all this stuff did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curl: They should change &amp;#34;Flawless Curls&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Relaxer.&amp;#34; Although I didn&#x27;t see &#x27;cones listed in the ingredients, there was definitely something plastic-y and unnatural going on in there. My hair was so weighed down that half my curl was gone. Even my good gel couldn&#x27;t fight the power of this conditioner. I&#x27;m not sure what &amp;#34;flawless curls&amp;#34; means unless TRESemme considers the curls themselves to be the flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing it did do is leave my hair soft, which is why I didn&#x27;t quite want to rate it as drastically as one star. My daughter has long, straight hair, and I&#x27;m sure it will work well for her. Oh, it smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> I am african american and I just use this on my hair (co-wash)  its perfect for everyday use, no shampoo</li>
            <li> Loving the feel of my hair after using this! I have parts that tangle very easily and this helps smooth it out. The scent is great too!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  It easily detanglers long dryish hair.  My hair isn&#x27;t curly, but the other tresemme conditioners don&#x27;t detangle ad well as this one does.</li>
            <li> Ah, Well. I find it a tad hard to word a review about something like this.&lt;br /&gt;But I suppose I should explain my hair type. I have very long/medium (About 17 inches? Maybe a bit longer when it&#x27;s straightened.)  Thick and extremely curly hair. Like.. Super. Curly. Like think of curls then Triple it.  It&#x27;s incredibly thick and awfully dry most of the time.  I use this as a leave in. I usually put it in after my hair is half dry just to sort of tame everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will make my hair somewhat crisp to the touch. But that doesn&#x27;t bother me. It looks good.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not entirely moisturizing but it does tame my frizzy prone hair and the real reason I buy this is because it&#x27;s very thick and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this bottle actually lasts me a couple months. It&#x27;s not perfect but I like it.</li>
            <li> I swear by this conditioner! It makes my curls soft and flawless, I also get compliments on the smell it leaves in my hair! 5 stars for Tresemmé!</li>
            <li> Product is just okay.  In my quest for finding effective products to enhance and maintain curly hair, Tresemme is an inexpensive and relatively effective line of products to address the needs of curly haired people.  However, I am yet to find the one product line that satisfies 100%...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main complaint is that products for curly hair usually contain alcohol which leaves hair curly but somewhat dried out.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and it definitely helps my hair curl but on the second day my hair is oily and I have to either wash it or use dry shampoo :(</li>
            <li> I have used it no more than a few times so far but the feeling I get from using this conditioner is very soft. The reason I give it 4 is because it burned my eye more than the other conditioners that I used so far. I like the product overall.</li>
            <li> Loving the consistency of the conditioner...gives my hair the needed slip for detangling. My hair is soft and curls are so defined...will reorder more!</li>
            <li> I loved this conditioner. It gave my wavy hair have shiny, bouncy curls when I styled it. I always got compliments on my hair. BUT, the ingredients aren&#x27;t the most kind. This conditioner made my chest and back breakout. It took me a while to figure out what was causing it, but after reading about other people experiencing TRESemme breakouts, I stopped using the conditioner and everything cleared up. So overall, good for hair? Maybe. Good for skin? No way.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because its a big bottle for a reasonable price (I&#x27;m a Doll on a Budget), &amp; I am thrilled that I decided to try it. I have 3C hair with patches of 3B &amp; 4A &amp; this conditioner is a new staple! I love it, I use it as a Pre-Poo &amp; conditioner &amp; my hair is sooooo soft! I&#x27;ve been natural all my life but decided to go on a healthy hair journey long hair journey for 5-6 months now &amp; this conditioner is the best. P.S. It smells great &amp; works really well w/ the other products (hair milk &amp; gel) from this line. :)</li>
            <li> Even with relatively tempered length of my hair this works tremendously to bring out the curls I do have.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff.  My hair is feels so great.</li>
            <li> more than worth it. it lasts long and it is very affordable. and it smells ok. very happy with the product</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonably priced conditioner that does help my dry frizzy curls for a fraction of some the salon brands,  I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> ~NOTE~ This is my firs time using ANY TREsemme product.&lt;br /&gt;I got mine from Walmart ($5.50)for the 39 oz. bottle. It didn&#x27;t exactly define my curls but it did detangle and my hair was flowing with the wind. lol. Detangling was so much easier. Plus when I put my deep conditioner my curls were more defined!&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner , plus I don&#x27;t use much!!</li>
            <li> This is great for co-washing my 3b/3c curly hair. It has great slip, nice smell and it&#x27;s pretty thick. Price was nice and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave residue and doesn&#x27;t make me break out where my hair dries on my shoulders/back. It&#x27;s also &amp;#34;layerable&amp;#34; - which is what a lot of people with curly hair do. Basically I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair with shampoo but still feel okay using this for 3/4 days in a row to keep my curls clumped and hydrated. I almost don&#x27;t even need to use gel in my hair because this is such a good conditioner that if I comb my hair in the shower after applying I can just pat dry my hair and go. It&#x27;s also a giant container, which I appreciate since I go through about 4 or 5 bottles of conditioner before I finish even one shampoo. I definitely recommend to my fellow curlies!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner and will definitely be ordering again. My hair feels so soft and looks so healthy after using this product!</li>
            <li> I always buy Tresemme flawless curls collection. I use the conditioner as a leave in to help style my hair and keep the curls in place.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to work with hair. She is planning to hopefully become a beautician someday. Anyway, she says that TRESemme products are the best. She doesn&#x27;t like using anything else.</li>
            <li> I use the TreSemme Flawless Curls conditioner, shampoo...and styling gel-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the results. Seems to both hold curl well and help with humidity&#x27;s frizz issues.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo for the best price for my thick, curly hair. My husband of mixed decent also likes this conditioner to keep his fro soft.</li>
            <li> I find it really good because Im natural and makes my hair more curly and soft also leaves it hydrated I recommend it</li>
            <li> does what it says! like the product good for curly hair. however the shipping cost alot more then i realized. but the bottle lasted me a month</li>
            <li> This product works as described, luv it!  Was skeptical but it exceed expectations.  It is worth it!</li>
            <li> Well, I wanted the Naturals, and I accidentally got this.  Then I saw it in my local grocery store, how convenient, right next to the one I really wanted.  It was free to ship so no big deal and only a few bucks.  I co-wash my hair with this and I am not shy on the amount since it is economical.  Felt nice going through my hair and got it very clean. Still will use this brand but want Naturals for curly hair.  This one is nice but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter have had trouble with her hair for years. It&#x27;s very curly and thick and everyone else including myself in the family have straight hair so I had no idea how to help. Now, old enough to research and study what to do she found this idea about not using shampoo on the internet. I had my doubts. She got this conditioner and a leave-in kind. She was terribly pleased. Her wild curls are now long awesome spirals and not so puffy or triangle. She has now abandoned her straightener and is completely happy with her hair now. It&#x27;s just what we were looking for! This stuff works :)</li>
            <li> First time trying this product and I love it. The size and price fit my budget. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> When i went through navy boot camp, they cut my super-curly hair short... which was pretty cute, until they told us we couldn&#x27;t have gel or mousse (in bootcamp, who would have thought!? lol). So i went from shirley temple to Mufasa from the Lion King after the first traumatizing group shower! It was then that i discovered that putting a tiny bit of conditioner in my hair in place of gel was not only effective in taming the mane, but it also left my curls soft instead of crunchy! by the time i graduated my hair was thick, healthy and gorgeous. I haven&#x27;t bought gel since!</li>
            <li> OMG this conditioner is great my curls are beautiful. I have 4b/c hair and I could tell the difference right away. I have never had a conditioner with such good slip. I am going to have to stock up on this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  I keeps my hair very soft and it helps it to grow.  My hair is naturally curly and this product is good at untangling my hair.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a conditioner for my long, coarse hair.  This works very well at leaving my hair feel soft and clean.  I found it worked best with leaving the product on my hair for two minutes or longer before rinsing.  I only gave four stars because I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent (it&#x27;s not bad, it just smells like heavy perfume to me).</li>
            <li> I damaged my beautiful curls when I went through my \\&quot;emo\\&quot; phase which required a lot of hairspray to maintain my hairstyles (which were all straight.)  Flat ironing my hair and using hairspray messed my curls up.  Instead of curls, my hair was half wavy and half straight.  I missed my curls so much when I changed my style.  I tried not flat ironing my hair and not using hairspray anymore, but that did not restore my hair.  So I picked this shampoo and conditoner and stopped flat ironing my hair.  After about 1 month I noticed my curls were coming back, little by little.  Now a year later my curls are completely back and look better than EVER!!!  I love my hair!!!  Thanks Tresemme Flawless Curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it on my natural hair. I love the slip and the curls are really define after my co-washs. I highly recommend this product if you are natural and need a great conditioner and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Ok so i needed a hydrating condish &amp; found this at walgreens on sale for $4.79 i was torn between all the rest but decided on this particular one b/c it related most to my hair. I added vatika oil to it for deep treatment and sat under my steamer 4 abt 20 mins. This conditioner has slip like no conditioner that i have ever used! Detangling was a breeze i didnt even have to use my tangle teezer i just finger detangle. After rinsing my hair was shiny, and surprisinly my curls were defined!! I then applied whipped shea butter and flat twist. Leaves my hair weightless and hydrated, I can tell my hair loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE*** 9/8/13- I am still loving this product. I washed &amp; conditioned yesterday and today I can&#x27;t stop smelling my hair! For those of you with sensitive nose idk how u will do with this but I personally LOVE the scent. This conditioner does what it says; it hydrates very well, still has a lot of slip and it last a long time I just ran out of my bottle and I bought it in May!. I think this is definitely a staple for me.</li>
