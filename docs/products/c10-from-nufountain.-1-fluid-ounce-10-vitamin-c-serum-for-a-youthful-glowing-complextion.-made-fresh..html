    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>This Vit C Serum is wonderful.</li>
            <li>So this product is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my skin look great.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is great.  </li>
            <li>lol I&#x27;ve been using it for maybe 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Happy</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin and absorbs and dries with out any trace.</li>
            <li>Good Product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waking up to clearer more even toned skin every day this week!  </li>
            <li>I also really liked the card that came with the serum which explains how to use the product and store it.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped fast and arrived in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product, but when I tried to reorder it on Amazon, I was told it was no longer in stock&lt;</li>
            <li>Even at that, it still came pretty quickly, with excellent instructions &amp; well packaged.</li>
            <li>that most ladies want to target, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
            <li>Most of the pricey brands don&#x27;t get even close to NuFountain&#x27;s marks.</li>
            <li>The areas that I&#x27;ve seen the best results are probably my neck and upper chest areas, which had been neglected for some time and were showing sun damage and age.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your skin can tolerate it well before moving up to the 20% Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product has no smell and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>A quick google search will tell you how important Vitamin C is for healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I also have problems with acne and the brown marks that it leaves, so I am hoping that this will help prevent that from happening, but so far so good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line:  If you are young and already have nice healthy skin, you should be using Vitamin C to maintain that youthful skin.  </li>
            <li>, I think it works better if you exfoliate first.</li>
            <li>After using this serum for several weeks, my face has a nice healthy glow that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.  </li>
            <li>My skin is looking more vibrant and healthier.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m mainly giving it three stars because I&#x27;ve made homemade vitamin serums that felt better than this--</li>
            <li>Best part of this is that it is a fresh product, but one entire bottle used as directed on only one spot with no visible results.</li>
            <li>You can tell upon receiving it that it is fresh.</li>
            <li>Since Vitamin C serums oxidize when exposed to air, you would think that with all this *fresh* talk that the product would be in a pump dispenser to keep air out.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d rather have a fresh batch whenever I want with a liquid like this).</li>
            <li>right up until it too, gave me heinous acne.  </li>
            <li>So use it fast or do what I do and transfer it to a clean pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>The product is great and after just a few days of usage, my skin already looks brighter!</li>
            <li>I will definitely reorder and may move up to the higher concentration if my skin will handle it! :)  </li>
            <li>Very fast, prompt, delivery.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and originally ordered the 10%.</li>
            <li>This came extremely fast and freshly made.</li>
            <li>The skin on my upper chest now glows and looks much better.  </li>
            <li>Open containers are easily spilled and I knocked over the first bottle right away and had to replace it.</li>
            <li>I gave it a high review because it came fast and was very fresh and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>As far as how it wears it doesn&#x27;t actually wear like a serum because it basically applies like water and feels like nothing once it dries; that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing imo, but it&#x27;s easy to make a DIY vitamin c serum exactly like this for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I just gave it an okay rating because I haven&#x27;t had the product that long.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product when mixed with my moisturizer and vitamin E. Just don&#x27;t use too much vitamin E because my face became very oily and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Also for the price this product is amazing and contains minimal ingredients which my sensitive skin loves!</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be a clear color when its fresh.</li>
            <li>How do I know what is really in here.</li>
            <li>Absolute rubbish.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the freshest form of topical Vitamin C available.  </li>
            <li>But if you are someone who wants to erase every wrinkle, sage and sign of aging from your face, skip the serum and call a plastic surgeon because nothing in a bottle is going to satisfy you.  </li>
            <li>but I actually preferred NuFountain&#x27;s oil free C20+</li>
            <li>It was nicely packaged and comes with a few instruction cards.</li>
            <li>One of the reasons I decided on the NuFountain when there are so many other products like this</li>
            <li>in fact, the main reason i ordered it was for the bottle</li>
            <li>i had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>I appreciate that the company and their products are ranked highly on [...].</li>
            <li>Was highly recommended to me by the Woman who does my facials at the Spa.  </li>
            <li>If you are a little older and have signs of aging and sun damage, you should be using Vitamin C to repair damaged skin and restore that healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a little over a week and love it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I never received my first shipment of the serum, but upon notifying customer service, they promptly sent me another one the next day</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks exactly the same.</li>
            <li>so far is doing wonders!  </li>
            <li>I might repurchase the higher concentration next time to try.</li>
            <li>(Vitamin C loses its potency fairly quickly, so if it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for a whole before you bought it, chances are it is no longer efffective); and (3) does my current cream or lotion even contain enough Vitamin C to be effective, because many of them actually contain very little Vitmin</li>
            <li>Do not be alarmed that the serum is clear.  </li>
            <li>You want Vitamin C to be clear.  </li>
            <li>I have read that everyone should be using this type of vitamin c and percentage on their face once a day to keep their skin young looking.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin but have not noticed any change since using this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am 48 years old with oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and my face is improving daily.</li>
            <li>and all I got was the same old skin tone I had .....</li>
            <li>I can recommend this serum because there does seem to be an improvement, there&#x27;s no smell, and once the serum dries (in a few seconds), you can put make-up, sunscreen or whatever right over it without interfering with it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it quite long enough to say that it does what it says; however, I have noticed my face in particular does appear brighter.</li>
            <li>i have to hold the dropper up to my face and dispense and hold my other finger ready to rub it in, if that makes sense at all</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product based on the reviews and the minimal ingredients but it made my skin red and irritated.  </li>

            <li> how long has that cream or lotion that I currently use been sitting on the shelf before I bought it</li>
            <li> unknown future ordering.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less drying because it&#x27;s only 10%</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor...get a pure product, save yourself a ton of money and get a company that will stand behind its product.</li>
            <li> serum (the ferulic one in the pump bottle) to this because it was like a real serum and for a few days at least, it made my skin GLOW...</li>
            <li> It feels like water, you have to be careful putting it in.</li>
            <li> My face no longer feels oily; usually by the end of the day my makeup has somewhat rubbed off or you can see the oiliness on my face, but since using this my face is no longer oily and my makeup actually stays put!  </li>
            <li> All cosmetic products should disclose the amount of the active ingredient!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve finally realized that using vitamin c topically is not a good idea for me, but if that wasn&#x27;t the case, I would prefer to either DIY or use NuFountain&#x27;s C20</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re currently using a Vitamin C cream or lotion, ask yourself these questions:  (1) do I need/want all of the fillers and perfumes that come packaged in a cream or lotion, or do I want pure Vitamin C; (2)</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s crazy how fast it happens)</li>
            <li> It is not at all irritating either, so i&#x27;m considering trying the next level up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a few weeks and see no improvement.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Those pesky rings that had appeared on my neck from aging are now irrelevant and barely noticable.  </li>
            <li> This products, has the consistency, small and texture of water.</li>
            <li> My complexion had become dull and ruddy.  </li>
            <li> Dull</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make the least bit of sense to make you expose it to air every time you use it.</li>
            <li> This serum gives me a face full of nasty whiteheads every time I try to use it</li>
            <li> what a ridiculous claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also dont be afraid if you get some in your mouth -- it just tastes sour.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not fond of wasting my money on products that don&#x27;t work, or of products that contain unnecessary ingredients that I cannot even pronounce.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if I am an idiot buying nothing?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my second time ordering NuFountain Vitamin C. I have very sensitive skin and originally ordered the 10%. I am now using the 20%, and have had no problems with my skin. I like the freshness of the product (handwritten date on label when it was made).  I use this in conjunction with Beta-1 cream. Very fast, prompt, delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a week and love it.  My face no longer feels oily; usually by the end of the day my makeup has somewhat rubbed off or you can see the oiliness on my face, but since using this my face is no longer oily and my makeup actually stays put!  I also have problems with acne and the brown marks that it leaves, so I am hoping that this will help prevent that from happening, but so far so good, I haven&#x27;t had any acne breakouts yet!</li>
            <li> I never received my first shipment of the serum, but upon notifying customer service, they promptly sent me another one the next day and I was very impressed.  The product is great and after just a few days of usage, my skin already looks brighter!</li>
            <li> This Vit C Serum is wonderful. You can tell upon receiving it that it is fresh. It is supposed to be a clear color when its fresh. I also really liked the card that came with the serum which explains how to use the product and store it. The serum works just like it supposed to. Also dont be afraid if you get some in your mouth -- it just tastes sour. But if you get some in your eye it will sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look great.  It&#x27;s a winner and I plan to continue using it.  I would have rated it 5 stars except for the packaging.  Open containers are easily spilled and I knocked over the first bottle right away and had to replace it.</li>
            <li> I have read that everyone should be using this type of vitamin c and percentage on their face once a day to keep their skin young looking. Often there is a caution that you might feel a tingling sensation or warming sensation, I have used this product for several weeks. It feels like water. It looks like water. My skin feels and looks exactly the same. I wonder if I am an idiot buying nothing? I don&#x27;t know who this company is? But all of a sudden, I want to buy from a company I have heard of. How do I know what is really in here. I don&#x27;t. Maybe if I believe it&#x27;s snake oil, it will work.</li>
            <li> Absolute rubbish. This products, has the consistency, small and texture of water. I refuse to believe this is a &amp;#34;SERUM&amp;#34; what a ridiculous claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product. My skin is looking more vibrant and healthier. I am 62 years old and my face is improving daily.</li>
            <li> Best part of this is that it is a fresh product, but one entire bottle used as directed on only one spot with no visible results.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product based on the reviews and the minimal ingredients but it made my skin red and irritated.  My skin is VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li> I just gave it an okay rating because I haven&#x27;t had the product that long. It feels good on the skin and absorbs and dries with out any trace. I doubt that it is any miracle but don&#x27;t see that it can hurt.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great.  It actually tells you the amount you are getting.  All cosmetic products should disclose the amount of the active ingredient!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product when mixed with my moisturizer and vitamin E. Just don&#x27;t use too much vitamin E because my face became very oily and I have dry skin. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wish I had looked up Vitamin C serum years ago!  This product (although I&#x27;ve only used 1 week) so far is doing wonders!  I&#x27;ve been waking up to clearer more even toned skin every day this week!  I have very very sensitive skin and this has not caused any problems.  The item was shipped fast and arrived in perfect condition.  I will definitely reorder and may move up to the higher concentration if my skin will handle it! :)  Also for the price this product is amazing and contains minimal ingredients which my sensitive skin loves!</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but when I tried to reorder it on Amazon, I was told it was no longer in stock&lt;br /&gt;with unknown future ordering.  Therefore I ordered a different brand when the bottle ran out.</li>
            <li> i had high hopes for this but i feel it didn&#x27;t do anything. It feels like water, you have to be careful putting it in. i have to hold the dropper up to my face and dispense and hold my other finger ready to rub it in, if that makes sense at all lol I&#x27;ve been using it for maybe 3 weeks and I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin, I think it works better if you exfoliate first. I might repurchase the higher concentration next time to try.</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I decided on the NuFountain when there are so many other products like this out there was the fact that the serum isn&#x27;t made up until you order it. Even at that, it still came pretty quickly, with excellent instructions &amp; well packaged. I haven&#x27;t used it quite long enough to say that it does what it says; however, I have noticed my face in particular does appear brighter. I also don&#x27;t have a lot of the crows feet, etc. that most ladies want to target, so I can&#x27;t speak to that. I can recommend this serum because there does seem to be an improvement, there&#x27;s no smell, and once the serum dries (in a few seconds), you can put make-up, sunscreen or whatever right over it without interfering with it.</li>
            <li> Since Vitamin C serums oxidize when exposed to air, you would think that with all this *fresh* talk that the product would be in a pump dispenser to keep air out. Doesn&#x27;t make the least bit of sense to make you expose it to air every time you use it. So use it fast or do what I do and transfer it to a clean pump dispenser. You can get amber ones on eBay. You shouldn&#x27;t have to do this but if NuFountain won&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin but have not noticed any change since using this product.  It is not at all irritating either, so i&#x27;m considering trying the next level up.</li>
            <li> I will order this product again and I like that it is made to order! I might order the C20 next time.</li>
            <li> This came extremely fast and freshly made. It was nicely packaged and comes with a few instruction cards. The product has no smell and is easy to apply. I did a thorough search for vitamin c and you won&#x27;t find one priced like his. I appreciate that the company and their products are ranked highly on [...]. No concerning ingredients and the company is transparent. Most of the pricey brands don&#x27;t get even close to NuFountain&#x27;s marks. Do yourself a favor...get a pure product, save yourself a ton of money and get a company that will stand behind its product.</li>
            <li> A quick google search will tell you how important Vitamin C is for healthy skin.  It is essential for collagen production.  If you&#x27;re currently using a Vitamin C cream or lotion, ask yourself these questions:  (1) do I need/want all of the fillers and perfumes that come packaged in a cream or lotion, or do I want pure Vitamin C; (2) how long has that cream or lotion that I currently use been sitting on the shelf before I bought it (Vitamin C loses its potency fairly quickly, so if it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for a whole before you bought it, chances are it is no longer efffective); and (3) does my current cream or lotion even contain enough Vitamin C to be effective, because many of them actually contain very little Vitmin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not fond of wasting my money on products that don&#x27;t work, or of products that contain unnecessary ingredients that I cannot even pronounce.  So this product is perfect for me.  No fillers, no perfumes, no harmful ingredients to worry about, and it&#x27;s the freshest form of topical Vitamin C available.  Do not be alarmed that the serum is clear.  You want Vitamin C to be clear.  If it is yellow, then it has oxidized and is therefor ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 48 years old with oily skin.  My complexion had become dull and ruddy.  After using this serum for several weeks, my face has a nice healthy glow that I haven&#x27;t seen in years.  The areas that I&#x27;ve seen the best results are probably my neck and upper chest areas, which had been neglected for some time and were showing sun damage and age.  The skin on my upper chest now glows and looks much better.  Those pesky rings that had appeared on my neck from aging are now irrelevant and barely noticable.  I also use this on the backs of my hands and see an improvement in skin tone there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend following the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions regarding storage and application.  I keep mine in the darkest spot I could find in the refrigerator.  I use it daily each morning after cleansing and follow up with Burt&#x27;s Bees Carrot Cream as a moisturizer.  Every now and then I&#x27;ll use the Serum at night as well.  If you have never used a Vitamin C product, I would recommend starting with the 10% Serum.  Make sure your skin can tolerate it well before moving up to the 20% Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  If you are young and already have nice healthy skin, you should be using Vitamin C to maintain that youthful skin.  If you are a little older and have signs of aging and sun damage, you should be using Vitamin C to repair damaged skin and restore that healthy glow.  So do you skin a favor and try this serum.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  But if you are someone who wants to erase every wrinkle, sage and sign of aging from your face, skip the serum and call a plastic surgeon because nothing in a bottle is going to satisfy you.  I personally will never be without this Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a few weeks and see no improvement.  I will continue to use it for the recommended 8 weeks and then make a final determination.  At the moment, i feel like I threw $20 away.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on the skin!  Was highly recommended to me by the Woman who does my facials at the Spa.  Happy I purchased.</li>
            <li> C stings on my skin and I get red bumps, but that is not the products fault. It seems I don&#x27;t tolerate C serums. .  I gave it a high review because it came fast and was very fresh and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  I have seen the difference in my skin since using this vitamin c.  I believe my skin looks tighter.  I use to use obagi but the serum made my clothes and sheets yellow.  NuFountain doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Consistency is like water. Not a serum. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This serum gives me a face full of nasty whiteheads every time I try to use it (it&#x27;s crazy how fast it happens) but I&#x27;m mainly giving it three stars because I&#x27;ve made homemade vitamin serums that felt better than this--in fact, the main reason i ordered it was for the bottle so I could try it out and do just that when I was done with it (I&#x27;d rather have a fresh batch whenever I want with a liquid like this). As far as how it wears it doesn&#x27;t actually wear like a serum because it basically applies like water and feels like nothing once it dries; that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing imo, but it&#x27;s easy to make a DIY vitamin c serum exactly like this for a fraction of the price. It&#x27;s less drying because it&#x27;s only 10% but I actually preferred NuFountain&#x27;s oil free C20+ serum (the ferulic one in the pump bottle) to this because it was like a real serum and for a few days at least, it made my skin GLOW...right up until it too, gave me heinous acne.  So I&#x27;ve finally realized that using vitamin c topically is not a good idea for me, but if that wasn&#x27;t the case, I would prefer to either DIY or use NuFountain&#x27;s C20+ instead of this one.</li>
            <li> Used it to the very last drop there was no different in my skin was expecting radiant skin and all I got was the same old skin tone I had ..... Dull</li>
