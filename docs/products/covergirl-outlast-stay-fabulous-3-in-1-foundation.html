    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>so I was impressed with that as well.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best foundations for keeping my oily skin at bay so that I don&#x27;t have to blot every 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful foundation.</li>
            <li>Entirely impressed, and don&#x27;t think I will ever switch unless they decide to discontinue.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that this product has appeared on the market.</li>
            <li>THIS FOUNDATION IS AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>I used this for prom and my senior photos and my face looked flawless</li>
            <li>I have the hardest time with both of those and this foundation was perfect for that.</li>
            <li>And the price was attractive too!</li>
            <li>mix well to make my perfect foundation color</li>
            <li>The lightest shade, 805, is perfect for my NW15 skin-tone.</li>
            <li>I mix this with The Smashbox Dtudi Skin foundation, which creates a perfect satin finish and wears without blotting for 12 hours plus.</li>
            <li>I can never find the correct color and this shade is just wonderful!</li>
            <li>lol!</li>
            <li>covergirl outlast is the best</li>
            <li>It is medium coverage and looks flawless.</li>
            <li>My skin continues to look flawless!</li>
            <li>This is the best drugstore foundation I have tried yet.</li>
            <li>shipping on this item was great though!</li>
            <li>Since Max Factor decided to stop making the world&#x27;s greatest foundation, and since Maybelline discontinued their water-based faux-natural line of acceptable substitutes, I decided to try this Cover Girl foundation.</li>
            <li>I even took a nap and the application was still perfect by the time I woke up.</li>
            <li>This makeup makes me look like I have flawless skin (HAH), and I thought this is it</li>
            <li>The color I chose (Ivory) matches my skin almost perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product ( like everything else I&#x27;ve owned by CG) and will indeed buy it again!</li>
            <li>I love that this has a pump too!!!</li>
            <li>And I was stunned at how beautifully it covered my redness and imperfection, and how perfectly she matched it to my skintone!&lt;br /&gt;See product here: http://www.lancome-usa.com/Teint-Idole-Ultra-24H/3605970267995,default,pd.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This blends perfectly into my skin and provides really great coverage.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>flawless finish and a good deal.</li>
            <li>Great color, coverage, finish... everything.</li>
            <li>Really great product, can&#x27;t wait to do my makeup again tomorrow.</li>
            <li>yours truly, a happy covergirl(:</li>
            <li>This product was great.</li>
            <li>But I suppose that you don&#x27;t have to, as the standalone product is still great.</li>
            <li>Medium coverage and great for oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is a really great foundation.</li>
            <li>It does stay all day though, coverage is great</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>For the price and what it does, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be great for covering my pores and acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I can use this foundation as is for great coverage or mix it with moisturizer for lighter coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not giving up on though, because when it does go smoothly, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>It matches my skin tone perfectly which was just a bonus on top of how well it works.</li>
            <li>The lightest color, Ivory, is a great match for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and this comes in my shade, which most others do not.</li>
            <li>so that was good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I could not have been more happy because the shade matched just about as perfectly to my skintone as the Lancome did, went on smoothly, and lasted throughout my workday, without a touch up!</li>
            <li>The color is good, though.</li>
            <li>I do use a fair powder to set my foundation</li>
            <li>I assumed the coverage would be good, because it has concealer built in.</li>
            <li>One, it has a pump, and a good one at that.</li>
            <li>i like cover girl foundation and this one was good ( but the concealer are my fav)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it was a good price.</li>
            <li>Looks good.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li>: The Coverage is good...</li>
            <li>Good foundation.</li>
            <li>It does offer good coverage.</li>
            <li>I loved the texture, the finish, and the staying power of this foundation.  </li>
            <li>It has good coverage and</li>
            <li>Good coverage, Not Oily.</li>
            <li>and I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous</li>
            <li>I have never received so many compliments on how beautiful my skin was.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and provides great coverage.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a flawless full coverage foundation, this is your magic potion!</li>
            <li>Love this foundation and it was great.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply, and has good coverage.</li>
            <li>Favorite foundation!</li>
            <li>I also love that it had spf in it too!</li>
            <li>I am so in love!  </li>
            <li>I forget to powder, and the foundation does its magic even until 10 PM!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I was chosen to try it!</li>
            <li>So I love makeup!  </li>
            <li>I would say that you could go a shade or two lighter, so that when it darkens it matches your skin tone, but the lightest shade they have is perfect for me before oxidization kicks in, so that doesn&#x27;t help me, but hopefully it helps some of y&#x27;all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just to be positive LOVE the pump!  </li>
            <li>Nice dewy glow finish, which I love!</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>Depending how you apply it, this foundation goes on great, and can apply from light to a heavier coverage.</li>
            <li>The pump on the bottle is very convenient, (and the fact that it closes is freakin&#x27; great!)</li>
            <li>I see many people give good reviews...</li>
            <li>The thing I like about this product is that it stays mostly all day,  and it does give you good coverage.</li>
            <li>but this opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase and am tempted to go stock up</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t ever look cakey and the colors match my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>This foundation is AMAZING for oily skin, it last all day on the skin has a great coverage and feels light on the skin, also very happy with the shade it fits perfectly my fair skin</li>
            <li>My skin has a good finish and is not shiny, I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts all day, but its better than most of the foundations I have tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to blend.</li>
            <li>will have a natural, flawless look after application.</li>
            <li>However, I was far from impressed.</li>
            <li>ALL opinions​ are my own. , and can I say I truly love this foundation.</li>
            <li>Best of all it really lasts and stays shine free.</li>
            <li>so I went online and got a bunch of drugstore brands with good ratings (Covergirl outlast,  L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al True Match,  Maybelline Dream Matte Mouse,  Rimmel Stay Matte, Maybelline Age Rewind concealer,  etc.)  </li>
            <li>It is very light, and it looks and feels like I am not even wearing foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels very cheap.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>and I sure couldn&#x27;t show all my flaws for the pictures.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Just love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I still love my Perspectives,  but decide to save it for the days when I don&#x27;t have time for an applicator.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer sure.</li>
            <li>There are many shades from which to choose.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that helps it match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>For one, I love the feeling of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>I love the color and finish of this foundation.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation to-date.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many foundations and I feel that they&#x27;ve all just been &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I also love the coverage it gives me.</li>
            <li>For me,this is a great product and doesn&#x27;t have any real cons/flaws.</li>
            <li>I  tested my COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>am overall very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I like it bud ned to try another color that fix me better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve repurchased it probably five times now and the BEST thing about this is the ivory color actually matches ivory skin tones.</li>
            <li>I still had to use concelear on top of foundation which for me is always a must</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li>It provides a great coverage and matches my skin tone very closely.</li>
            <li>I moisturizer, put this on with a  makeup sponge and use some setting powder on top along with my blush</li>
            <li>I LOVE this liquid foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.</li>
            <li>but my face looks a lot better with this product.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t know, some people who place more value in their ability to wipe off their makeup at the end of the night might rate that a plus.</li>
            <li>Fabulous coverage!  </li>
            <li>I just love this foundation for so many reasons</li>
            <li>was able to find a color that works for my skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no foundation I use that I don&#x27;t set with a bit of finishing powder or even mineral foundation powder on top.</li>
            <li>I have been using this ever since, and would highly recommend it as a great budget substitute for pricier foundations.</li>
            <li>That saves both time and money, and it not only goes on easily, but it looks great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a pretty good product but could use some improvement.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation, I have oily/mixed skin and also sensitive, this is great.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I had to put on a lot more concealer on top of it than I thought, as the coverage was not as full as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>it has the best coverage of any foundation that I have tried and it makes my skin feel like I have absolutely no makeup on.</li>
            <li>I was normally using the Clean Collection with oil con control user, but with this 3 in 1 foundation, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s such a good coverage foundation!</li>
            <li>It is easy to blend and it is buildable.</li>
            <li>Holy cow this is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Also I am quite fair and this shade seems to be a decent match.  </li>
            <li>but I think it offers many good qualities.</li>
            <li>If you want a more in depth I have a full review on my blog [...]</li>
            <li>Hands down the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Great medium/ to full coverage, not heavy on the face at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It indeed was long-wearing, I even slept with it on and it looked fine, even though I&#x27;m a side-sleeper</li>
            <li>I have not had issues with this foundation rubbing off as some others have mentioned, but then I always, always, set my foundation with a finishing powder and some silica powder to blur fine lines and absorb sebum.</li>
            <li>I had been a loyal user of Prescriptives foundation for more than a decade.</li>
            <li>It applies nicely, has good medium coverage, and lasts a fairly long time on my oily skin (I have yet to find a foundation that fully controls oil).</li>
            <li>will buy more and this product is highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li>However, it did not make a huge difference in how my skin looks already.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fabulous foundation.</li>
            <li>I either use a stippling brush (the $3 I got from e.l.f, or the Real Techniques Expert Face brush which is all around amazing).</li>
            <li>I received this product for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try after reading all the fantastic reviews and seeing that it was a 3-in-1 foundation.</li>
            <li>i use a light hand</li>
            <li>i light that there is no smells to it</li>
            <li>but light scent&lt;br /&gt;-Pump</li>
            <li>Got this product in a free trial from an Influenster Vox Box.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I recommend any woman to try the Stay Fabulous foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I finally found a product that works!</li>
            <li>and my complexion is light; this product conceals</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, it looked perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, especially at the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Loved how clear and light this felt on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and this color blended perfectly and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li>I very rarely have to touch my face in the two weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with admitting that I wear a lot of makeup and like full coverage.</li>
            <li>This foundation works pretty much as advertised, surprisingly.</li>
            <li>This is the only review I have ever felt compelled to write because all I can say is - Amazing Foundation!</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is the makeup the Wicked Witch wore when Dorothy threw water on her</li>
            <li>I usually get medium beige colors in makeup, and this one looked great!  </li>
            <li>The color Ivory is perfect for my super pale skin.</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t emphasize the very fine lines I have around my eyes, it was very streaky and seemed to emphasize every pore on my face.  </li>
            <li>I like it and my skin feels clean and even.</li>
            <li>and I can get full coverage with when applying with a stipple brush or with elf powder brush.</li>
            <li>means that I have at times very red patches on my face, and I need good coverage that won&#x27;t fade throughout the day or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The formula is the perfect consistency, not too runny and not too thick.</li>
            <li>Also the coverage is quite full too.  </li>
            <li>I use one pump for full coverage.</li>
            <li>I will note, that I feel like I don&#x27;t need as much concealer, so that makes the job of the concealer easier and more reliable.</li>
            <li>It also lasted ALL day true to its name.</li>
            <li>Ugh, I really wanted to LOVE this foundation.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make me oily like Loreal True Match (N6).</li>
            <li>It has SPF 20, so is a good buy for daily use.</li>
            <li>product is true to its word and does \\&quot;outlast - stay</li>
            <li>I do not even need to use oil absorbing sheets or more powder even once throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I probably couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff, it literally lasts forever.</li>
            <li>It gives you medium to full coverage.  </li>
            <li>It looks like it is too light when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>Degree of moisture is enough, but also a good concealer functions very much like</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite foundation, and believe me I tried a lot, and lost lots of money buying them.</li>
            <li>The verdict : they are all good so long as used with the right applicators.</li>
            <li>So for the past 4 years, I only used BB cream, which although light, and apparently good for my skin, did not give me good coverage at all.</li>
            <li>I suppose, if one wants to rebel against the trend today to minimize pores and fine lines, this would be a place to start.</li>
            <li>It has pretty good coverage , i actually really enjoy the smell unlike other people on here.</li>
            <li>A little oily on my skin, but provides great coverage.</li>
            <li>It does set faster than some other foundations or tinted moisturizers, but apply and blend it quickly; touch up with powder, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>But is it really worth 5X the price?  </li>
            <li>and I received this product complimentary from influenster</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the golden tan right now since its summer.</li>
            <li>The reviews are right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s medium to full, depending on how much of it you apply.</li>
            <li>This foundation works really good, but it does have some down sides.</li>
            <li>always buying the lightest shade available and often that isn&#x27;t light enough</li>
            <li>me, were you aware that you have three heads?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I seem to have received more complements on my skin when using Covergirl Outlast + sponge (it could be sheer coincidence though.)  </li>
            <li>Most often, I do not apply a moisturizer prior to applying the Cover Girl Outlast.  </li>
            <li>I took the expensive make-up bottle to the store to compare to all the Cover Girl Outlast shades &amp; found a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>When I first placed the product on my face</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s the first</li>
            <li>The finish is pretty matte, although I still always set my foundation with powder to ensure longevity.</li>
            <li>And three, it has a cap just for extra protection, and not one of those flimsy ones that many foundations have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thought it would cover more, its like medium coverage, and I dont like to use several layers of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied this with my real techniques stippling brush (amaze) I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li>After trying many different foundations over the years, I found this product and gave it a try</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this unless you have really oily skin!</li>
            <li>I was (am) hoping to find a makeup that can go on and actually last more than a couple of hours without needing a touch-up, but this is not it.</li>
            <li>I was VERY impressed after trying this, and it is difficult for a liquid foundation to impress me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t exactly the look I was going for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get you, my pretty...&#x27;</li>
            <li>Absolute perfection!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line (in my opinion):There is so much better out there for the same price.</li>
            <li>got the medium beige color which matches my skin tone pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I loved Revlon Colorstay foundation for oily skin but even after setting it with powder, it was oily after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Good product, can get heavy though</li>
            <li>I like this foundation a little less than the Ready, Set, Gorgeous, but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li>It covered very well with a nice, even, matte finish, yet felt light and comfortable on my skin, not dry or tight at all as some long-wearing foundations can be.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m young, I have large pores, acne, and light acne discoloration from my adolescence.</li>
            <li>I saw the positive review on this and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard plenty of positive comments about it on beauty blogs</li>
            <li>I read a lot of positive reviews of this product, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try...</li>
            <li>After browsing, I finally decided to simply make a purchase, and decided on the Covergirl Outlast because I have such incredibly oily skin</li>
            <li>I deal with acne around my &amp;#34;time of the month&amp;#34; and some acne scaring on my cheeks and one layer of this foundation covers pretty much everything.</li>
            <li>Great foundation soft long lasting.</li>
            <li>This make-up is indeed very long lasting, provides good coverage, has a matte finish plus the SPF20 sun screen.  </li>
            <li>It Made my pores look large and set into wrinkles...  is very noticeable that I&#x27;m wearing make up...</li>
            <li>this shade is a near perfect match, and it doesn&#x27;t have any weird undertones.</li>
            <li>The packaging overall is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes a lot to cover entire face, Doesn&#x27;t Make Huge Difference In Skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just my skin or what, but it went on very patchy and its consistency was almost like wall spackle on my face.</li>
            <li>ofcourse is NOT what anyone wants to hear, when trying to cover up a flaw.</li>
            <li>Lasts whole day without being oily or any smudge.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Also, it covers my acne scars and breakouts very well compared to the Colorstay.</li>
            <li>and I am really considering purchasing a lighter shade this winter.</li>
            <li>This way, it applies very evenly and doesn&#x27;t streak at all.</li>
            <li>One thing that really stands out about the formula is that despite being matte and full-coverage, it still *feels* lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>high recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It performs much like high-end.</li>
            <li>I really like the staying power of this foundation.</li>
            <li>feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drys fast.</li>
            <li>product is reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of expensive brands of foundation, but so far this is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li>On a different note,  I do still think my Perspectives foundation leaves a more natural look than the drugstore ones.  </li>
            <li>The texture is not oily at all, which is a big relief since my skin is already oily enough on its own.</li>
            <li>For one, it seems to dry super quick.</li>
            <li>It covers my acne, acne scars, rosacea, and looks natural!!!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have such sensitivities, I HIGHLY recommend for it&#x27;s beautiful long lasting finish.</li>
            <li>Within an hour of using all other foundation/primer combinations, I needed to use oil absorbing sheets and more powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So even though this foundation does cover everything well and last  ALL day, I still use primer and concealer just to make sure that I&#x27;m looking my absolute best.&lt;br /&gt;Also, another small but important thing that I like: the bottle!</li>
            <li>Technically, I have combination/oily, but simply sitting at my desk, my t-zone becomes incredibly shiny, and no amount of powder and keep the shininess down, even blotting oil paper never seemed to do the trick).</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because it kind of made my skin look flakey, but overall it didn&#x27;t break me out and it didn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, Lancome is kind of pricy, and I was not able to afford to buy it again after that, so I had to find something that would do the trick just about as well, at a lower price.</li>
            <li>and then so I was looking for a full coverage foundation that would last all day and not slide off my face.</li>
            <li>I used it for a full month seeing if my skin was actually breaking out or if it was the foundation</li>
            <li>I put that the product should only be applied once, because I couldn&#x27;t stand it on my face for more than maybe ten minutes</li>
            <li>I use to use foundation about a couple years back, but stopped because I realized it simply made my face more oily.</li>
            <li>Overall, I definitely recommend this to my oily skinned friends :)</li>
            <li>i am ivory to classic ivory and cover girl foundation formulas  </li>
            <li>decent oil control</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little darker than I like because my skin is VERY light.</li>
            <li>I received my foundation with high expectations, and walked away with high expectations.</li>
            <li>I have a ton of it, high end to drug store</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is mostly dry/ normal, but a little oily on the t-zone.</li>
            <li>My favorite budget long last makeup!&lt;br</li>
            <li>its a normal foundation for the every day use.</li>
            <li>(mac nw15)I sincerely recommend it for people with oily skin that look for long lasting foundation!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using the Cover Girl Ready Set Gorgeous foundation which I think is similar to this one and comes in a convenient squeeze tube, but the lightest color is too dark for me.</li>
            <li>foundation goes on smooth, and almost becomes a matte, powder formula immediately, giving the face and extremely airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>After a couple of tries I was able to get it on well enough that some mineral makeup covered up what was lacking, but it still didn&#x27;t pass the long-wearing test.</li>
            <li>Plus, they probably made the best packaging as I hate it when foundations are simply twist open bottles that could easily spill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it i was in shock, because it actually works!</li>
            <li>Since I bought the same shade I use in other Cover Girl products, this was an interesting discovery.</li>
            <li>short: I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for full, long lasting coverage, who doesn&#x27;t mind that at the first hint of moisture the color will melt from your face faster than you can say &#x27;</li>
            <li>I love trying new foundations because its so hard to find one that works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy at all which is so great because usually I feel like my makeup is heavy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide full coverage as other</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like someone leaning over and loudly whispering, &amp;#34;Excuse</li>
            <li>Blend it in a bit, and I look so natural.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really dependent upon your personal preference.</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne-prone skin with a lot of dark spots that require a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li>Great coverage but a bit thick / heavy.</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>I am regular Covergil product user and this new foundation takes the cake for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it with both sponge and brush application, and decided that it&#x27;s likely to be the type of moisturizer I&#x27;m using that just doesn&#x27;t jive with this particular formula.</li>
            <li>I even tried several of the high end brands.</li>
            <li>some to note: the foundation is very similar to revlon colorstay in staying power, finish, and consistency, although I think it may actually have better coverage as it is a little thicker.</li>
            <li>So unless you&#x27;re quick with your applicator or fingers, this is going to look a little off.</li>
            <li>and I still think that they are very similar, but this formula seems a little more moist and doesn&#x27;t dry down and set quite as fast, so you can really blend it or layer it as needed.</li>
            <li>but i really don&#x27;t break out anymore though i do have some acne scaring left and the occasional horomonol bump.</li>
            <li>It was hard to beat, especially because I barely needed any concealer on top of it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product is a primer, concealer, and foundation without a cakey thick feel!</li>
            <li>With careful blending, I could easily use this on-the-go without it being to dark.</li>
            <li>On a high note, I have very, very pale skin, and the color was exactly right..</li>
            <li>That was the general consensus on youtube as well.  </li>
            <li>I put it on at 11 in the morning and its still there without barely a touch up at 11 at night.  </li>
            <li>I have some spots and scars and it does a good job covering many of them -- though the worst ones would truly only vanish with a laser --</li>
            <li>My skin is normal to dry...</li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t even want to go on my nose other than to sit in my pores and look sheer over the rest of it.</li>
            <li>I am excited to say the least.  </li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t care about stupid things like that, because if it was a good foundation otherwise it didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>It also passed the hot California summer sweat test, except that it does wear off a little where my sunglasses touch my face when I&#x27;m perspiring.  </li>
            <li>But I definitely won&#x27;t be wearing it for work, the beach, a wedding (seriously do NOT cry in this stuff!) or any other place where I might risk getting water on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I work a physical job that has me sweating bullets ten minutes into my shift, so waterproof, or at least water resistant, is important for me and something I&#x27;ve sort of come to expect from a makeup that advertises itself as &#x27;longwear.&#x27;</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m telling you I have worn a TON of foundations in search of my One True Color, and of all the products I&#x27;ve worn this one stands up to water the least.</li>
            <li>But then, all the other foundations have a lot to live up to!</li>
            <li>I previously compared this foundation with the Ready, Set,</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and it covered it and it stayed covered for at least 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and this is the first foundation that I have tried that keeps my face from being an oily mess by the end of the day!  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> so I was impressed with that as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best foundations for keeping my oily skin at bay so that I don&#x27;t have to blot every 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful foundation.</li>
            <li> Entirely impressed, and don&#x27;t think I will ever switch unless they decide to discontinue.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that this product has appeared on the market.</li>
            <li> THIS FOUNDATION IS AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I used this for prom and my senior photos and my face looked flawless</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time with both of those and this foundation was perfect for that.</li>
            <li> And the price was attractive too!</li>
            <li> mix well to make my perfect foundation color</li>
            <li> The lightest shade, 805, is perfect for my NW15 skin-tone.</li>
            <li> I mix this with The Smashbox Dtudi Skin foundation, which creates a perfect satin finish and wears without blotting for 12 hours plus.</li>
            <li> I can never find the correct color and this shade is just wonderful!</li>
            <li> lol!</li>
            <li> covergirl outlast is the best</li>
            <li> It is medium coverage and looks flawless.</li>
            <li> My skin continues to look flawless!</li>
            <li> This is the best drugstore foundation I have tried yet.</li>
            <li> shipping on this item was great though!</li>
            <li> Since Max Factor decided to stop making the world&#x27;s greatest foundation, and since Maybelline discontinued their water-based faux-natural line of acceptable substitutes, I decided to try this Cover Girl foundation.</li>
            <li> I even took a nap and the application was still perfect by the time I woke up.</li>
            <li> This makeup makes me look like I have flawless skin (HAH), and I thought this is it</li>
            <li> The color I chose (Ivory) matches my skin almost perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product ( like everything else I&#x27;ve owned by CG) and will indeed buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love that this has a pump too!!!</li>
            <li> And I was stunned at how beautifully it covered my redness and imperfection, and how perfectly she matched it to my skintone!&lt;br /&gt;See product here: http://www.lancome-usa.com/Teint-Idole-Ultra-24H/3605970267995,default,pd.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This blends perfectly into my skin and provides really great coverage.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> flawless finish and a good deal.</li>
            <li> Great color, coverage, finish... everything.</li>
            <li> Really great product, can&#x27;t wait to do my makeup again tomorrow.</li>
            <li> yours truly, a happy covergirl(:</li>
            <li> This product was great.</li>
            <li> But I suppose that you don&#x27;t have to, as the standalone product is still great.</li>
            <li> Medium coverage and great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really great foundation.</li>
            <li> It does stay all day though, coverage is great</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> For the price and what it does, it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great for covering my pores and acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I can use this foundation as is for great coverage or mix it with moisturizer for lighter coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving up on though, because when it does go smoothly, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> It matches my skin tone perfectly which was just a bonus on top of how well it works.</li>
            <li> The lightest color, Ivory, is a great match for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and this comes in my shade, which most others do not.</li>
            <li> so that was good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I could not have been more happy because the shade matched just about as perfectly to my skintone as the Lancome did, went on smoothly, and lasted throughout my workday, without a touch up!</li>
            <li> The color is good, though.</li>
            <li> I do use a fair powder to set my foundation</li>
            <li> I assumed the coverage would be good, because it has concealer built in.</li>
            <li> One, it has a pump, and a good one at that.</li>
            <li> i like cover girl foundation and this one was good ( but the concealer are my fav)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it was a good price.</li>
            <li> Looks good.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> : The Coverage is good...</li>
            <li> Good foundation.</li>
            <li> It does offer good coverage.</li>
            <li> I loved the texture, the finish, and the staying power of this foundation.  </li>
            <li> It has good coverage and</li>
            <li> Good coverage, Not Oily.</li>
            <li> and I really loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous</li>
            <li> I have never received so many compliments on how beautiful my skin was.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and provides great coverage.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a flawless full coverage foundation, this is your magic potion!</li>
            <li> Love this foundation and it was great.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply, and has good coverage.</li>
            <li> Favorite foundation!</li>
            <li> I also love that it had spf in it too!</li>
            <li> I am so in love!  </li>
            <li> I forget to powder, and the foundation does its magic even until 10 PM!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I did!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad that I was chosen to try it!</li>
            <li> So I love makeup!  </li>
            <li> I would say that you could go a shade or two lighter, so that when it darkens it matches your skin tone, but the lightest shade they have is perfect for me before oxidization kicks in, so that doesn&#x27;t help me, but hopefully it helps some of y&#x27;all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just to be positive LOVE the pump!  </li>
            <li> Nice dewy glow finish, which I love!</li>
            <li> Its amazing.</li>
            <li> Depending how you apply it, this foundation goes on great, and can apply from light to a heavier coverage.</li>
            <li> The pump on the bottle is very convenient, (and the fact that it closes is freakin&#x27; great!)</li>
            <li> I see many people give good reviews...</li>
            <li> The thing I like about this product is that it stays mostly all day,  and it does give you good coverage.</li>
            <li> but this opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase and am tempted to go stock up</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t ever look cakey and the colors match my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> This foundation is AMAZING for oily skin, it last all day on the skin has a great coverage and feels light on the skin, also very happy with the shade it fits perfectly my fair skin</li>
            <li> My skin has a good finish and is not shiny, I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts all day, but its better than most of the foundations I have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to blend.</li>
            <li> will have a natural, flawless look after application.</li>
            <li> However, I was far from impressed.</li>
            <li> ALL opinions​ are my own. , and can I say I truly love this foundation.</li>
            <li> Best of all it really lasts and stays shine free.</li>
            <li> so I went online and got a bunch of drugstore brands with good ratings (Covergirl outlast,  L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al True Match,  Maybelline Dream Matte Mouse,  Rimmel Stay Matte, Maybelline Age Rewind concealer,  etc.)  </li>
            <li> It is very light, and it looks and feels like I am not even wearing foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels very cheap.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.  </li>
            <li> and I sure couldn&#x27;t show all my flaws for the pictures.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Just love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still love my Perspectives,  but decide to save it for the days when I don&#x27;t have time for an applicator.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer sure.</li>
            <li> There are many shades from which to choose.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that helps it match my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> For one, I love the feeling of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> I love the color and finish of this foundation.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation to-date.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many foundations and I feel that they&#x27;ve all just been &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I also love the coverage it gives me.</li>
            <li> For me,this is a great product and doesn&#x27;t have any real cons/flaws.</li>
            <li> I  tested my COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.</li>
            <li> am overall very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like it bud ned to try another color that fix me better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased it probably five times now and the BEST thing about this is the ivory color actually matches ivory skin tones.</li>
            <li> I still had to use concelear on top of foundation which for me is always a must</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li> It provides a great coverage and matches my skin tone very closely.</li>
            <li> I moisturizer, put this on with a  makeup sponge and use some setting powder on top along with my blush</li>
            <li> I LOVE this liquid foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this foundation.</li>
            <li> but my face looks a lot better with this product.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t know, some people who place more value in their ability to wipe off their makeup at the end of the night might rate that a plus.</li>
            <li> Fabulous coverage!  </li>
            <li> I just love this foundation for so many reasons</li>
            <li> was able to find a color that works for my skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no foundation I use that I don&#x27;t set with a bit of finishing powder or even mineral foundation powder on top.</li>
            <li> I have been using this ever since, and would highly recommend it as a great budget substitute for pricier foundations.</li>
            <li> That saves both time and money, and it not only goes on easily, but it looks great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a pretty good product but could use some improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation, I have oily/mixed skin and also sensitive, this is great.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I had to put on a lot more concealer on top of it than I thought, as the coverage was not as full as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> it has the best coverage of any foundation that I have tried and it makes my skin feel like I have absolutely no makeup on.</li>
            <li> I was normally using the Clean Collection with oil con control user, but with this 3 in 1 foundation, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a good coverage foundation!</li>
            <li> It is easy to blend and it is buildable.</li>
            <li> Holy cow this is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Also I am quite fair and this shade seems to be a decent match.  </li>
            <li> but I think it offers many good qualities.</li>
            <li> If you want a more in depth I have a full review on my blog [...]</li>
            <li> Hands down the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Great medium/ to full coverage, not heavy on the face at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It indeed was long-wearing, I even slept with it on and it looked fine, even though I&#x27;m a side-sleeper</li>
            <li> I have not had issues with this foundation rubbing off as some others have mentioned, but then I always, always, set my foundation with a finishing powder and some silica powder to blur fine lines and absorb sebum.</li>
            <li> I had been a loyal user of Prescriptives foundation for more than a decade.</li>
            <li> It applies nicely, has good medium coverage, and lasts a fairly long time on my oily skin (I have yet to find a foundation that fully controls oil).</li>
            <li> will buy more and this product is highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li> However, it did not make a huge difference in how my skin looks already.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous foundation.</li>
            <li> I either use a stippling brush (the $3 I got from e.l.f, or the Real Techniques Expert Face brush which is all around amazing).</li>
            <li> I received this product for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after reading all the fantastic reviews and seeing that it was a 3-in-1 foundation.</li>
            <li> i use a light hand</li>
            <li> i light that there is no smells to it</li>
            <li> but light scent&lt;br /&gt;-Pump</li>
            <li> Got this product in a free trial from an Influenster Vox Box.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I recommend any woman to try the Stay Fabulous foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I finally found a product that works!</li>
            <li> and my complexion is light; this product conceals</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, it looked perfect.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, especially at the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Loved how clear and light this felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this color blended perfectly and doesn&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> I very rarely have to touch my face in the two weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with admitting that I wear a lot of makeup and like full coverage.</li>
            <li> This foundation works pretty much as advertised, surprisingly.</li>
            <li> This is the only review I have ever felt compelled to write because all I can say is - Amazing Foundation!</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is the makeup the Wicked Witch wore when Dorothy threw water on her</li>
            <li> I usually get medium beige colors in makeup, and this one looked great!  </li>
            <li> The color Ivory is perfect for my super pale skin.</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t emphasize the very fine lines I have around my eyes, it was very streaky and seemed to emphasize every pore on my face.  </li>
            <li> I like it and my skin feels clean and even.</li>
            <li> and I can get full coverage with when applying with a stipple brush or with elf powder brush.</li>
            <li> means that I have at times very red patches on my face, and I need good coverage that won&#x27;t fade throughout the day or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The formula is the perfect consistency, not too runny and not too thick.</li>
            <li> Also the coverage is quite full too.  </li>
            <li> I use one pump for full coverage.</li>
            <li> I will note, that I feel like I don&#x27;t need as much concealer, so that makes the job of the concealer easier and more reliable.</li>
            <li> It also lasted ALL day true to its name.</li>
            <li> Ugh, I really wanted to LOVE this foundation.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make me oily like Loreal True Match (N6).</li>
            <li> It has SPF 20, so is a good buy for daily use.</li>
            <li> product is true to its word and does \\&quot;outlast - stay</li>
            <li> I do not even need to use oil absorbing sheets or more powder even once throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I probably couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff, it literally lasts forever.</li>
            <li> It gives you medium to full coverage.  </li>
            <li> It looks like it is too light when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li> Degree of moisture is enough, but also a good concealer functions very much like</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite foundation, and believe me I tried a lot, and lost lots of money buying them.</li>
            <li> The verdict : they are all good so long as used with the right applicators.</li>
            <li> So for the past 4 years, I only used BB cream, which although light, and apparently good for my skin, did not give me good coverage at all.</li>
            <li> I suppose, if one wants to rebel against the trend today to minimize pores and fine lines, this would be a place to start.</li>
            <li> It has pretty good coverage , i actually really enjoy the smell unlike other people on here.</li>
            <li> A little oily on my skin, but provides great coverage.</li>
            <li> It does set faster than some other foundations or tinted moisturizers, but apply and blend it quickly; touch up with powder, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> But is it really worth 5X the price?  </li>
            <li> and I received this product complimentary from influenster</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the golden tan right now since its summer.</li>
            <li> The reviews are right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s medium to full, depending on how much of it you apply.</li>
            <li> This foundation works really good, but it does have some down sides.</li>
            <li> always buying the lightest shade available and often that isn&#x27;t light enough</li>
            <li> me, were you aware that you have three heads?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I seem to have received more complements on my skin when using Covergirl Outlast + sponge (it could be sheer coincidence though.)  </li>
            <li> Most often, I do not apply a moisturizer prior to applying the Cover Girl Outlast.  </li>
            <li> I took the expensive make-up bottle to the store to compare to all the Cover Girl Outlast shades &amp; found a perfect match.  </li>
            <li> When I first placed the product on my face</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s the first</li>
            <li> The finish is pretty matte, although I still always set my foundation with powder to ensure longevity.</li>
            <li> And three, it has a cap just for extra protection, and not one of those flimsy ones that many foundations have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thought it would cover more, its like medium coverage, and I dont like to use several layers of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied this with my real techniques stippling brush (amaze) I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> After trying many different foundations over the years, I found this product and gave it a try</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this unless you have really oily skin!</li>
            <li> I was (am) hoping to find a makeup that can go on and actually last more than a couple of hours without needing a touch-up, but this is not it.</li>
            <li> I was VERY impressed after trying this, and it is difficult for a liquid foundation to impress me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t exactly the look I was going for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get you, my pretty...&#x27;</li>
            <li> Absolute perfection!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line (in my opinion):There is so much better out there for the same price.</li>
            <li> got the medium beige color which matches my skin tone pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I loved Revlon Colorstay foundation for oily skin but even after setting it with powder, it was oily after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Good product, can get heavy though</li>
            <li> I like this foundation a little less than the Ready, Set, Gorgeous, but it&#x27;s still good.</li>
            <li> It covered very well with a nice, even, matte finish, yet felt light and comfortable on my skin, not dry or tight at all as some long-wearing foundations can be.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m young, I have large pores, acne, and light acne discoloration from my adolescence.</li>
            <li> I saw the positive review on this and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard plenty of positive comments about it on beauty blogs</li>
            <li> I read a lot of positive reviews of this product, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try...</li>
            <li> After browsing, I finally decided to simply make a purchase, and decided on the Covergirl Outlast because I have such incredibly oily skin</li>
            <li> I deal with acne around my &amp;#34;time of the month&amp;#34; and some acne scaring on my cheeks and one layer of this foundation covers pretty much everything.</li>
            <li> Great foundation soft long lasting.</li>
            <li> This make-up is indeed very long lasting, provides good coverage, has a matte finish plus the SPF20 sun screen.  </li>
            <li> It Made my pores look large and set into wrinkles...  is very noticeable that I&#x27;m wearing make up...</li>
            <li> this shade is a near perfect match, and it doesn&#x27;t have any weird undertones.</li>
            <li> The packaging overall is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a lot to cover entire face, Doesn&#x27;t Make Huge Difference In Skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just my skin or what, but it went on very patchy and its consistency was almost like wall spackle on my face.</li>
            <li> ofcourse is NOT what anyone wants to hear, when trying to cover up a flaw.</li>
            <li> Lasts whole day without being oily or any smudge.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Also, it covers my acne scars and breakouts very well compared to the Colorstay.</li>
            <li> and I am really considering purchasing a lighter shade this winter.</li>
            <li> This way, it applies very evenly and doesn&#x27;t streak at all.</li>
            <li> One thing that really stands out about the formula is that despite being matte and full-coverage, it still *feels* lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> high recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It performs much like high-end.</li>
            <li> I really like the staying power of this foundation.</li>
            <li> feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drys fast.</li>
            <li> product is reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of expensive brands of foundation, but so far this is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> On a different note,  I do still think my Perspectives foundation leaves a more natural look than the drugstore ones.  </li>
            <li> The texture is not oily at all, which is a big relief since my skin is already oily enough on its own.</li>
            <li> For one, it seems to dry super quick.</li>
            <li> It covers my acne, acne scars, rosacea, and looks natural!!!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have such sensitivities, I HIGHLY recommend for it&#x27;s beautiful long lasting finish.</li>
            <li> Within an hour of using all other foundation/primer combinations, I needed to use oil absorbing sheets and more powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So even though this foundation does cover everything well and last  ALL day, I still use primer and concealer just to make sure that I&#x27;m looking my absolute best.&lt;br /&gt;Also, another small but important thing that I like: the bottle!</li>
            <li> Technically, I have combination/oily, but simply sitting at my desk, my t-zone becomes incredibly shiny, and no amount of powder and keep the shininess down, even blotting oil paper never seemed to do the trick).</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because it kind of made my skin look flakey, but overall it didn&#x27;t break me out and it didn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, Lancome is kind of pricy, and I was not able to afford to buy it again after that, so I had to find something that would do the trick just about as well, at a lower price.</li>
            <li> and then so I was looking for a full coverage foundation that would last all day and not slide off my face.</li>
            <li> I used it for a full month seeing if my skin was actually breaking out or if it was the foundation</li>
            <li> I put that the product should only be applied once, because I couldn&#x27;t stand it on my face for more than maybe ten minutes</li>
            <li> I use to use foundation about a couple years back, but stopped because I realized it simply made my face more oily.</li>
            <li> Overall, I definitely recommend this to my oily skinned friends :)</li>
            <li> i am ivory to classic ivory and cover girl foundation formulas  </li>
            <li> decent oil control</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little darker than I like because my skin is VERY light.</li>
            <li> I received my foundation with high expectations, and walked away with high expectations.</li>
            <li> I have a ton of it, high end to drug store</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is mostly dry/ normal, but a little oily on the t-zone.</li>
            <li> My favorite budget long last makeup!&lt;br</li>
            <li> its a normal foundation for the every day use.</li>
            <li> (mac nw15)I sincerely recommend it for people with oily skin that look for long lasting foundation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using the Cover Girl Ready Set Gorgeous foundation which I think is similar to this one and comes in a convenient squeeze tube, but the lightest color is too dark for me.</li>
            <li> foundation goes on smooth, and almost becomes a matte, powder formula immediately, giving the face and extremely airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> After a couple of tries I was able to get it on well enough that some mineral makeup covered up what was lacking, but it still didn&#x27;t pass the long-wearing test.</li>
            <li> Plus, they probably made the best packaging as I hate it when foundations are simply twist open bottles that could easily spill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it i was in shock, because it actually works!</li>
            <li> Since I bought the same shade I use in other Cover Girl products, this was an interesting discovery.</li>
            <li> short: I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for full, long lasting coverage, who doesn&#x27;t mind that at the first hint of moisture the color will melt from your face faster than you can say &#x27;</li>
            <li> I love trying new foundations because its so hard to find one that works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy at all which is so great because usually I feel like my makeup is heavy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide full coverage as other</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like someone leaning over and loudly whispering, &amp;#34;Excuse</li>
            <li> Blend it in a bit, and I look so natural.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really dependent upon your personal preference.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin with a lot of dark spots that require a full coverage foundation.</li>
            <li> Great coverage but a bit thick / heavy.</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> I am regular Covergil product user and this new foundation takes the cake for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it with both sponge and brush application, and decided that it&#x27;s likely to be the type of moisturizer I&#x27;m using that just doesn&#x27;t jive with this particular formula.</li>
            <li> I even tried several of the high end brands.</li>
            <li> some to note: the foundation is very similar to revlon colorstay in staying power, finish, and consistency, although I think it may actually have better coverage as it is a little thicker.</li>
            <li> So unless you&#x27;re quick with your applicator or fingers, this is going to look a little off.</li>
            <li> and I still think that they are very similar, but this formula seems a little more moist and doesn&#x27;t dry down and set quite as fast, so you can really blend it or layer it as needed.</li>
            <li> but i really don&#x27;t break out anymore though i do have some acne scaring left and the occasional horomonol bump.</li>
            <li> It was hard to beat, especially because I barely needed any concealer on top of it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product is a primer, concealer, and foundation without a cakey thick feel!</li>
            <li> With careful blending, I could easily use this on-the-go without it being to dark.</li>
            <li> On a high note, I have very, very pale skin, and the color was exactly right..</li>
            <li> That was the general consensus on youtube as well.  </li>
            <li> I put it on at 11 in the morning and its still there without barely a touch up at 11 at night.  </li>
            <li> I have some spots and scars and it does a good job covering many of them -- though the worst ones would truly only vanish with a laser --</li>
            <li> My skin is normal to dry...</li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t even want to go on my nose other than to sit in my pores and look sheer over the rest of it.</li>
            <li> I am excited to say the least.  </li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t care about stupid things like that, because if it was a good foundation otherwise it didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> It also passed the hot California summer sweat test, except that it does wear off a little where my sunglasses touch my face when I&#x27;m perspiring.  </li>
            <li> But I definitely won&#x27;t be wearing it for work, the beach, a wedding (seriously do NOT cry in this stuff!) or any other place where I might risk getting water on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I work a physical job that has me sweating bullets ten minutes into my shift, so waterproof, or at least water resistant, is important for me and something I&#x27;ve sort of come to expect from a makeup that advertises itself as &#x27;longwear.&#x27;</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m telling you I have worn a TON of foundations in search of my One True Color, and of all the products I&#x27;ve worn this one stands up to water the least.</li>
            <li> But then, all the other foundations have a lot to live up to!</li>
            <li> I previously compared this foundation with the Ready, Set,</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and it covered it and it stayed covered for at least 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and this is the first foundation that I have tried that keeps my face from being an oily mess by the end of the day!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a thin consistency, but it&#x27;s not smooth or nice to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;People buy the long lasting types of makeup for various reasons, but in my case the reason I need</li>
            <li> I am normally 100% devoted to my Revlon Colorstay foundation, but since it was summer time and my skin had gotten a little darker, I thought I&#x27;d try this product.</li>
            <li> the color actually matches my face (not too pink, not too yellow, but I understand that issue is a personal one since not everyone has my same skin tone).</li>
            <li> You want to do small areas at a time, for it sets fast still giving time to spread it.</li>
            <li> and it goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a long journey to find a foundation that I actually like.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as oily as I used to be, I still have the T-zone area that keeps makeup from lasting.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, buildible, oil control, long lasting, etc.</li>
            <li> I freaking LOVED this stuff, but it broke me out :(  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t feel overly dry on my face, and all this while still covering the red spots on my acne prone face and not breaking me out.</li>
            <li> If this wasn&#x27;t bad enough, I immediately got a huge zit near my chin after wearing it one time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not look like I have foundation on, and have recently realized that I stopped using powder on my face.</li>
            <li> As for oil control, I did notice a difference, but it was not a complete miracle.</li>
            <li> Last year,  I got into the kick of trying drugstore foundations,  in part,  because I was curious of all sorts of applicators (brushes,  sponges,  </li>
            <li> long wearing&lt;br /&gt;-Provides</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m pale enough that I actually bought this with the intention to mix in a white foundation with it, that mixing shade hasn&#x27;t arrived yet</li>
            <li> It really is pretty tenacious at staying on one&#x27;s face, but I&#x27;ve had some issues with this particular formula getting a little weird when coupled with my moisturizer, so I&#x27;m trying it in different combinations.</li>
            <li> It will do so with an odd yellowy tint that is outside the range of human skin tones.</li>
            <li> After trying several brands that I did NOT like due to one reason or another, I came across CoverGirl Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have face spots due to pregnancy and this is the only thing I have found within my $ means to conceal.</li>
            <li> And, I had to re-apply concealer and powder halfway through my day, because it did not stay on very long, even with a layer of powder on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any other foundation, even high end, expensive, \\&quot;oil controlling\\&quot; foundations have not helped me this much.  </li>
            <li> Someone with dry skin may not like this product.</li>
            <li> So if you have dry skin already or even somewhat oily skin this stuff is not for you.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cakey, powdery look&lt;br /&gt;Not buildable&lt;br /&gt;bad for dry skin</li>
            <li> I normally wear a much more expensive brand of long-wearing foundation but doubt that I will continue buying the expensive brand in the future.  </li>
            <li> That yellowy green color is really in right now, though, so at least that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I used a sponge applicator and used maybe half a pea sized amount covered my entire face.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a win, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Every other ivory foundation I&#x27;ve bought has been way too dark for me and makes it obvious I&#x27;m wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I even tapped on a little extra under my eyes as concealer, since that&#x27;s supposed to be a part of its 3-in-1 properties, and I didn&#x27;t need a separate concealer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) I have bad acne</li>
            <li> I doubt it will make others break out as badly as it did mine, because most people are not as acne-prone as I am.</li>
            <li> Too pink toned for me</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, it makes my cheeks look chalky and it really accentuates the creases by the side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I had been using Cover Girl&#x27;s \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; foundation, which was a product that excelled it being mediocre: it did its job, provided coverage, cost $5 at Target, and, like a Applebee&#x27;s entree, fell right into the realm of \\&quot;it&#x27;ll do\\&quot; without being horrible or great.</li>
            <li> I only have to use a small bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 other friends try it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m looking at other options.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake or sink into pores (as long as you haven&#x27;t moisturized too heavily)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand that wet face look!</li>
            <li> I mean, I barely splashed my face and the product vanished like my cat at bath time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product that boasts good coverage and wearability.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mark it down for that, however, since I&#x27;ve never found a foundation that can avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eventually, it settled down into my pores to fill each one with yellowy foundation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cover my freckles up and other impurities with this!</li>
            <li> My face was less shiny at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> smear it on my face, where it doesn&#x27;t blend, just smears around and turns me an odd yellowish color.</li>
            <li> do wonder if the name is a little misleading.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any oxidation, which typically even the slightest bit shows up on my pale self</li>
            <li> and i feel really not comfortable when it is on my face.</li>
            <li> I discovered this because I was shopping at my local mall, and was approached in Macy&#x27;s by one of the ladies from behind the Lancome counter.</li>
            <li> But, after a few days my face broke out.</li>
            <li> and all, if it hadn&#x27;t broken me out, I would have finished the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> i wore this foundation a few times it medium coverage</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, this may make your skin shine after a few hours despite its claim that states otherwise.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> when I say bad, I mean acne HUGE pores all around my face..</li>
            <li> Plus there&#x27;s no strong scent, which is an added bonus to me.</li>
            <li> not easy to apply but like the color</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal was, but I didn&#x27;t like this at all.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Dior or Nars foundation</li>
            <li> I have never used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not sure when that day will be.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use Covergirl products.</li>
            <li> Also it doesnt have the annoying mint fresh feeling covergirl is known for.</li>
            <li> I am pretty upset that covergirl made such a terrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very uneven skin color around my nose and cheeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very pale girl -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s hard to quantify, but you can tell that it&#x27;s a lower end</li>
            <li> It covers well, but is a little thin.</li>
            <li> I may only need a little concealer on a bad spot if I have one.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was making me crazy, however, since it seemed design to give me enough foundation for a week every time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> When someone in a video claims they have oily skin, they do not understand what I mean</li>
            <li> but I went on vacation and got a serious tan.  </li>
            <li> I was never very happy with my skin, and it was much worse when I had to go to bed late, and woke up with a swollen face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Or maybe they are bad for various reasons like the coverage, shade, etc.)</li>
            <li> &quot;  This foundation in not good as it sets in to your skin and stays there causing dryness.</li>
            <li> My face felt so stiff and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I hardly used any of the foundation in those areas but it certainly brought out the worst!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wear it because it is irritating.  </li>
            <li> not the worse foundation that I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on thin and light.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mess up too badly on those groggy mornings before 6AM shifts.</li>
            <li> It hadn&#x27;t broken out in a few months, so this was very disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what, but the product was thick and looked wrong on my face.</li>
            <li> concealer combination that made it weird..  </li>
            <li> may be i chose the wrong one.</li>
            <li> so I tend to be wary of liquid foundations -</li>
            <li> but this did not stay on my skin which was weird.</li>
            <li> I have random bumps on my chin now that I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve always had bad luck with covergirl</li>
            <li> Within a week of me using this i started breaking out like CRAZY, i&#x27;m talking under the skin clusters of acne.</li>
            <li> I took out a star because the foundation tends to oxidize on me, but not too badly.</li>
            <li> Again, might just be a bad batch, or my skin.</li>
            <li> Problem is that it broke me out so, so bad</li>
            <li> so bad and leaves patches everywhere.</li>
            <li> However, within about 15 minutes, the formula darkens a shade or two, giving you ugly makeup mask face.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in covergirl.</li>
            <li> I hate caking on makeup.</li>
            <li> Awful made me breakout so bad and dryed out my skin and made it so flakey.</li>
            <li> What made it worst</li>
            <li> but like I said just dries my skin horribly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Favorite foundation!:) I have bad acne and I can get full coverage with when applying with a stipple brush or with elf powder brush. I bought over 20 bottles of this in the last 2 years</li>
            <li> The reviews are right. It&#x27;s a fabulous foundation. I was skeptical, but  so glad I tried it. Try it! Can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
            <li> Great color, coverage, finish... everything. While I&#x27;m pale enough that I actually bought this with the intention to mix in a white foundation with it, that mixing shade hasn&#x27;t arrived yet so I gave this a shot without. With careful blending, I could easily use this on-the-go without it being to dark. I didn&#x27;t notice any oxidation, which typically even the slightest bit shows up on my pale self so I was impressed with that as well. Lasted all day, too! Really great product, can&#x27;t wait to do my makeup again tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used! The color Ivory is perfect for my super pale skin. It covers my acne, acne scars, rosacea, and looks natural!!! I also love that it had spf in it too!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best foundations for keeping my oily skin at bay so that I don&#x27;t have to blot every 2 hours.  I get compliments about my skin when I wear it and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I took out a star because the foundation tends to oxidize on me, but not too badly.</li>
            <li> I put that the product should only be applied once, because I couldn&#x27;t stand it on my face for more than maybe ten minutes.. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what, but the product was thick and looked wrong on my face. I don&#x27;t know if it was just my skin or what, but it went on very patchy and its consistency was almost like wall spackle on my face. Not sure what the deal was, but I didn&#x27;t like this at all. Think it might be the primer + foundation+ concealer combination that made it weird..  Again, might just be a bad batch, or my skin. On a high note, I have very, very pale skin, and the color was exactly right.. so that was good. Still not going to wear this, but I do like others from Covergirl.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful foundation. It goes on very smooth and provides great coverage. I only have to use a small bit and it goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.  I am a over priced makeup junkie and this foundation has changed me.  I am so in love!  I usually wear Dior or Nars foundation but I went on vacation and got a serious tan.  I was darker than my darker foundation shade and we were not on vacation where I could get to the mall.  What made it worst I was going to be in a wedding and I sure couldn&#x27;t show all my flaws for the pictures.  I purchased this product with hopes it would work.  I have never received so many compliments on how beautiful my skin was.  I am hooked!</li>
            <li> may be i chose the wrong one. it is not my skin color and i feel really not comfortable when it is on my face.</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s really good for the price.</li>
            <li> My favorite budget long last makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People buy the long lasting types of makeup for various reasons, but in my case the reason I need it is because I have rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;This means that I have at times very red patches on my face, and I need good coverage that won&#x27;t fade throughout the day or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a creme compact, but realized after awhile that while I thought my makeup was covering my redness, it WAS NOT. The makeup had already faded away after only a couple of hours. I discovered this because I was shopping at my local mall, and was approached in Macy&#x27;s by one of the ladies from behind the Lancome counter. She asked me if she could help me find anything, then leaned over and said...&amp;#34;do you have rosacea?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ofcourse is NOT what anyone wants to hear, when trying to cover up a flaw. It&#x27;s like someone leaning over and loudly whispering, &amp;#34;Excuse me, were you aware that you have three heads?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, she led me over and painted Lancome&#x27;s Teint Idole Ultra 24 HR foundation onto my face. And I was stunned at how beautifully it covered my redness and imperfection, and how perfectly she matched it to my skintone!&lt;br /&gt;See product here: http://www.lancome-usa.com/Teint-Idole-Ultra-24H/3605970267995,default,pd.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Lancome is kind of pricy, and I was not able to afford to buy it again after that, so I had to find something that would do the trick just about as well, at a lower price. After trying several brands that I did NOT like due to one reason or another, I came across CoverGirl Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not have been more happy because the shade matched just about as perfectly to my skintone as the Lancome did, went on smoothly, and lasted throughout my workday, without a touch up! I have been using this ever since, and would highly recommend it as a great budget substitute for pricier foundations.</li>
            <li> I use to use foundation about a couple years back, but stopped because I realized it simply made my face more oily. So for the past 4 years, I only used BB cream, which although light, and apparently good for my skin, did not give me good coverage at all. Although I&#x27;m young, I have large pores, acne, and light acne discoloration from my adolescence. I was never very happy with my skin, and it was much worse when I had to go to bed late, and woke up with a swollen face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I had to do something since someone in their 20&#x27;s can&#x27;t just go around hating their skin for the rest of their life. I began researching different types of foundations on Youtube and watched hundreds of recommendations by beauty gurus. After browsing, I finally decided to simply make a purchase, and decided on the Covergirl Outlast because I have such incredibly oily skin (I&#x27;m not even joking. When someone in a video claims they have oily skin, they do not understand what I mean when I say I have oily skin. Technically, I have combination/oily, but simply sitting at my desk, my t-zone becomes incredibly shiny, and no amount of powder and keep the shininess down, even blotting oil paper never seemed to do the trick). I received my foundation with high expectations, and walked away with high expectations. The formula is the perfect consistency, not too runny and not too thick. Plus, they probably made the best packaging as I hate it when foundations are simply twist open bottles that could easily spill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foundation goes on smooth, and almost becomes a matte, powder formula immediately, giving the face and extremely airbrushed look. I either use a stippling brush (the $3 I got from e.l.f, or the Real Techniques Expert Face brush which is all around amazing). Blend it in a bit, and I look so natural. I absolutely do not look like I have foundation on, and have recently realized that I stopped using powder on my face. Once the foundation goes on, it stays so matte I forget to powder, and the foundation does its magic even until 10 PM! So from 8 AM to 10 PM, I never had to blot once, even in the humid, summer months. Entirely impressed, and don&#x27;t think I will ever switch unless they decide to discontinue. But then, all the other foundations have a lot to live up to!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wear it because it is irritating.  It also emphasizes lines.  The color is good, though.</li>
            <li> WOW. This can cover anything! I cover my freckles up and other impurities with this! Doesn&#x27;t make my skin irritated or break out. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of expensive brands of foundation, but so far this is the BEST!!! Lasts whole day without being oily or any smudge.&lt;br /&gt;You will have a natural, flawless look after application. Just love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more and this product is highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li> I am normally 100% devoted to my Revlon Colorstay foundation, but since it was summer time and my skin had gotten a little darker, I thought I&#x27;d try this product. I&#x27;m so glad that I did! The pump on the bottle is very convenient, (and the fact that it closes is freakin&#x27; great!) and I do not need a brush to apply it so I don&#x27;t mess up too badly on those groggy mornings before 6AM shifts. As for oil control, I did notice a difference, but it was not a complete miracle. I still had to blot my face a couple of times, no biggie. Also, it covers my acne scars and breakouts very well compared to the Colorstay. Overall, I really like this product and I am really considering purchasing a lighter shade this winter.</li>
            <li> I had been a loyal user of Prescriptives foundation for more than a decade. Last year,  I got into the kick of trying drugstore foundations,  in part,  because I was curious of all sorts of applicators (brushes,  sponges,  you name it) I have never used in the past.  One thingiI noticed with these applicators was that they absorb a lot of products.  Prescriptives costs around $40 a bottle.  It was simply too pricey to use with those applicators so I went online and got a bunch of drugstore brands with good ratings (Covergirl outlast,  L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al True Match,  Maybelline Dream Matte Mouse,  Rimmel Stay Matte, Maybelline Age Rewind concealer,  etc.)  The verdict : they are all good so long as used with the right applicators. I seem to have received more complements on my skin when using Covergirl Outlast + sponge (it could be sheer coincidence though.)  I still love my Perspectives,  but decide to save it for the days when I don&#x27;t have time for an applicator.  Not sure when that day will be.  On a different note,  I do still think my Perspectives foundation leaves a more natural look than the drugstore ones.  But is it really worth 5X the price?  I&#x27;m no longer sure.</li>
            <li> Awful made me breakout so bad and dryed out my skin and made it so flakey. I&#x27;ve had 3 other friends try it and it made them breakout to went back to using SEPHORA</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! it has the best coverage of any foundation that I have tried and it makes my skin feel like I have absolutely no makeup on. I would recommend this product to anyone and I will definitely be buying again. I received this product for free for testing purposes and I&#x27;m so glad that I was chosen to try it! I will never buy a different brand of foundation again. yours truly, a happy covergirl(:</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, especially at the reasonable price.  I normally wear a much more expensive brand of long-wearing foundation but doubt that I will continue buying the expensive brand in the future.  This make-up is indeed very long lasting, provides good coverage, has a matte finish plus the SPF20 sun screen.  Most often, I do not apply a moisturizer prior to applying the Cover Girl Outlast.  It stays put from morning until bedtime. There are many shades from which to choose.  I took the expensive make-up bottle to the store to compare to all the Cover Girl Outlast shades &amp; found a perfect match.  I am very happy that this product has appeared on the market.</li>
            <li> So I love makeup!  I have a ton of it, high end to drug store and this is the first foundation that I have tried that keeps my face from being an oily mess by the end of the day!  I loved Revlon Colorstay foundation for oily skin but even after setting it with powder, it was oily after a few hours.  I have been wearing this foundation for 12 hours now and all I did was set it with powder.  No blotting or touch ups and my face has the slightest of sheen to it in the T zone.  As an experiment, I just felt my face and it feelts as if I have no makeup on!  It&#x27;s not heavy at all which is so great because usually I feel like my makeup is heavy by the end of the day. THIS FOUNDATION IS AMAZING!!! Also the coverage is quite full too.  It is easy to blend and it is buildable. Any other foundation, even high end, expensive, \\&quot;oil controlling\\&quot; foundations have not helped me this much.  I am excited to say the least.  Also I am quite fair and this shade seems to be a decent match.  I do use a fair powder to set my foundation so I&#x27;m sure that helps it match my skin tone.  Overall, I definitely recommend this to my oily skinned friends :)</li>
            <li> This product was great. I am a teenager and have breakouts now and then so I was looking for a full coverage foundation that would last all day and not slide off my face. I used this for prom and my senior photos and my face looked flawless it also lasted all day and did not get cakey. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin with a lot of dark spots that require a full coverage foundation. I decided to give this a try after reading all the fantastic reviews and seeing that it was a 3-in-1 foundation. I assumed the coverage would be good, because it has concealer built in. However, I was far from impressed. Before, I had been using the Revlon Colorstay for oily skin, and it lasted all day and did not make me break out. It was hard to beat, especially because I barely needed any concealer on top of it. The Covergirl Outlast, however, was a different story. For one, I did not like the way it smelled. I have no idea what it reminded me of, but it made me sort of gag. But I really don&#x27;t care about stupid things like that, because if it was a good foundation otherwise it didn&#x27;t matter. But, after a few days my face broke out. It hadn&#x27;t broken out in a few months, so this was very disappointing for me. On top of that, I had to put on a lot more concealer on top of it than I thought, as the coverage was not as full as I had anticipated. And, I had to re-apply concealer and powder halfway through my day, because it did not stay on very long, even with a layer of powder on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, there were things I like about this foundation. For one, I love the feeling of it on my skin. It is very light, and it looks and feels like I am not even wearing foundation. That is a definite pro. It was not cakey at all, which was something I would change about the Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, if it hadn&#x27;t broken me out, I would have finished the entire bottle. I doubt it will make others break out as badly as it did mine, because most people are not as acne-prone as I am. Yet, after using about a third of the bottle I went back to the Revlon Colorstay, and I stopped breaking out. I thought this would be a win, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading about the rave reviews on beauty blogs. I had a coupon an thought \\&quot;ok, let&#x27;s try this.\\&quot;  This foundation in not good as it sets in to your skin and stays there causing dryness. When I first placed the product on my face I felt that the product just was glued to my face. I will stick with my mainstay of Revlon Colorstay, Rimmell lasting finish, or Neutrogena Shine control. I returned the cover girl foundation the same day.</li>
            <li> My face was less shiny at the end of the day. Someone with dry skin may not like this product.</li>
            <li> I love the color and finish of this foundation. I have the hardest time with both of those and this foundation was perfect for that. And the price was attractive too!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation to-date.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many foundations and I feel that they&#x27;ve all just been &amp;#34;okay.&amp;#34; Nothing stands out, no reason to re-buy. (Or maybe they are bad for various reasons like the coverage, shade, etc.) I&#x27;m a very pale girl - always buying the lightest shade available and often that isn&#x27;t light enough or it&#x27;s too orange.&lt;br /&gt;But this shade is a near perfect match, and it doesn&#x27;t have any weird undertones. So that&#x27;s the first plus! I also love the coverage it gives me. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s medium to full, depending on how much of it you apply. I use one pump for full coverage. It&#x27;s also very easy to blend. I use a flat-top buffer brush or stippling brush, personally. This way, it applies very evenly and doesn&#x27;t streak at all. The finish is pretty matte, although I still always set my foundation with powder to ensure longevity. One thing that really stands out about the formula is that despite being matte and full-coverage, it still *feels* lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;I do wonder if the name is a little misleading. 3-in-1 implies that it takes the place of not only your foundation, but your primer and concealer too. I still use those additional products, however. But I suppose that you don&#x27;t have to, as the standalone product is still great. It&#x27;s really dependent upon your personal preference. I&#x27;m fine with admitting that I wear a lot of makeup and like full coverage. So even though this foundation does cover everything well and last  ALL day, I still use primer and concealer just to make sure that I&#x27;m looking my absolute best.&lt;br /&gt;Also, another small but important thing that I like: the bottle! One, it has a pump, and a good one at that. Two, it LOCKS, meaning that when you&#x27;re not using that, product isn&#x27;t going to come out. And three, it has a cap just for extra protection, and not one of those flimsy ones that many foundations have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah! For me,this is a great product and doesn&#x27;t have any real cons/flaws. I can see myself continuing to buy it for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation and it was great. If you have dry skin I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this because it kind of made my skin look flakey, but overall it didn&#x27;t break me out and it didn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Good product, can get heavy though</li>
            <li> i like cover girl foundation and this one was good ( but the concealer are my fav)  i wore this foundation a few times it medium coverage but i guess you can build it up i use a light hand i light that there is no smells to it and it has some spf i am ivory to classic ivory and cover girl foundation formulas  mix well to make my perfect foundation color I  tested my COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> its a normal foundation for the every day use. not too especial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it would cover more, its like medium coverage, and I dont like to use several layers of foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was a good price.</li>
            <li> Finally a foundation I can use.  I&#x27;ve been on a long journey to find a foundation that I actually like. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve always had bad luck with covergirl, I detest their products!  My skin is mostly dry/ normal, but a little oily on the t-zone. I have some red acne spots on my chin and nose area and between my brows. I applied this with my real techniques stippling brush (amaze) I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The first time I applied it i was in shock, because it actually works! I woudln&#x27;t say that you don&#x27;t need concealer, because I do have undereye darkness, and redness around my nostrils, but who doesn&#x27;t? I will note, that I feel like I don&#x27;t need as much concealer, so that makes the job of the concealer easier and more reliable. If you&#x27;re looking for a flawless full coverage foundation, this is your magic potion!</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Full coverage but lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-Does NOT accentuate pores&lt;br /&gt;-Very long wearing&lt;br /&gt;-Provides decent oil control&lt;br /&gt;-Pleasant but light scent&lt;br /&gt;-Pump dispenser&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Can&#x27;t think of one!</li>
            <li> I see many people give good reviews... The thing I like about this product is that it stays mostly all day,  and it does give you good coverage. Problem is that it broke me out so, so bad :/ when I say bad, I mean acne HUGE pores all around my face.. I was so upset that it made my face breakout, cause it&#x27;s such a good coverage foundation!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. The lightest shade, 805, is perfect for my NW15 skin-tone. The finish is matte, but not chalky. I mix this with The Smashbox Dtudi Skin foundation, which creates a perfect satin finish and wears without blotting for 12 hours plus. This is my third bottle, and I will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li> flawless finish and a good deal.</li>
            <li> Got this product in a free trial from an Influenster Vox Box. I love trying new foundations because its so hard to find one that works well. It matches my skin tone perfectly which was just a bonus on top of how well it works. I have very oily skin so I tend to be wary of liquid foundations - but this one does not add a film or greasy feeling. It also lasted ALL day true to its name. No pores or blemishes appeared at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am overall very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I received this product from influenster in the IDO voxbox for testing purpose.ALL opinions​ are my own. , and can I say I truly love this foundation. Great medium/ to full coverage, not heavy on the face at all. Still feels like your skin, doesn&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; feeling at all. Nice dewy glow finish, which I love! high recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Loved how clear and light this felt on my skin. It was a match to my skin and I received this product complimentary from influenster but this opinion is all my own.</li>
            <li> I like it bud ned to try another color that fix me better</li>
            <li> After trying many different foundations over the years, I found this product and gave it a try and now it&#x27;s the only one I will use! I&#x27;ve repurchased it probably five times now and the BEST thing about this is the ivory color actually matches ivory skin tones. Every other ivory foundation I&#x27;ve bought has been way too dark for me and makes it obvious I&#x27;m wearing makeup. This blends perfectly into my skin and provides really great coverage. Definitely recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> For being drugstore makeup. It performs much like high-end. Medium coverage and great for oily skin. I have mild acne and it covered it and it stayed covered for at least 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I also have oily skin and it held up!</li>
            <li> Ugh, I really wanted to LOVE this foundation. It has pretty good coverage , i actually really enjoy the smell unlike other people on here. It looks so lightweight but covers acne and scars! I still had to use concelear on top of foundation which for me is always a must but as a base it was really great. Within a week of me using this i started breaking out like CRAZY, i&#x27;m talking under the skin clusters of acne. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne through out my teen years but i really don&#x27;t break out anymore though i do have some acne scaring left and the occasional horomonol bump. I used it for a full month seeing if my skin was actually breaking out or if it was the foundation but it definatly was. I stopped using this and my skin cleared up. If you ane prone skin DON&#x27;T USE THIS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought multiples of this.  It&#x27;s a little darker than I like because my skin is VERY light.</li>
            <li> Too pink toned for me I gave it to a friend</li>
            <li> This is a really great foundation. The lightest color, Ivory, is a great match for my fair skin. It applies nicely, has good medium coverage, and lasts a fairly long time on my oily skin (I have yet to find a foundation that fully controls oil). My one complain is that when you get to the bottom 1/5 of the bottle the pump can&#x27;t get the last of the product. I had to scoop quite a bit out and put it in a jar, and it probably lasted me 3-4 weeks. It&#x27;s pretty annoying. I&#x27;ve gone through 2 bottles but I&#x27;m hesitant to buy another. I&#x27;m currently using the Cover Girl Ready Set Gorgeous foundation which I think is similar to this one and comes in a convenient squeeze tube, but the lightest color is too dark for me. I might come back to this 3 in 1 foundation but I&#x27;m looking at other options.</li>
            <li> I really like the staying power of this foundation. Its amazing. It also doesn&#x27;t make me oily like Loreal True Match (N6). I put it on in the morning at 7am and it lasts until 10pm when I get home. I&#x27;m using the golden tan right now since its summer. I hope I can find a matching color when winter comes around and my tan fades. Definitely try it! I don&#x27;t usually use Covergirl products. I saw the positive review on this and decided to try it out. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite foundation. It goes on smooth and lasts all day. It provides a great coverage and matches my skin tone very closely.</li>
            <li> Great foundation soft long lasting.</li>
            <li> Holy cow this is the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used! I hate caking on makeup. I deal with acne around my &amp;#34;time of the month&amp;#34; and some acne scaring on my cheeks and one layer of this foundation covers pretty much everything. I may only need a little concealer on a bad spot if I have one.  I moisturizer, put this on with a  makeup sponge and use some setting powder on top along with my blush and I&#x27;m good to go! I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> not easy to apply but like the color</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this unless you have really oily skin! I have somewhat oily skin and this stuff dries out my skin so bad and leaves patches everywhere. My face felt so stiff and uncomfortable. So if you have dry skin already or even somewhat oily skin this stuff is not for you. It does stay all day though, coverage is great but like I said just dries my skin horribly</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product is a primer, concealer, and foundation without a cakey thick feel! I can never find the correct color and this shade is just wonderful! I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase and am tempted to go stock up lol!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You put it on, and it has an airbrush feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drys fast. No mess. Lasts all day. No caky feel.</li>
            <li> covergirl outlast is the best</li>
            <li> I actually like this foundation a lot. It is medium coverage and looks flawless. It doesn&#x27;t ever look cakey and the colors match my skin nicely. I have 842 medium beige. I love that this has a pump too!!! The only thing that I don&#x27;t think it has is lasting power I have dry skin but this did not stay on my skin which was weird.</li>
            <li> I like the foundation. Looks good. Covers well. Only thing, it breaks me out. I have random bumps on my chin now that I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have face spots due to pregnancy and this is the only thing I have found within my $ means to conceal. Like that it has SPF. I let my moisturizer sink in 1-2 min and apply this over it. You want to do small areas at a time, for it sets fast still giving time to spread it. Also it doesnt have the annoying mint fresh feeling covergirl is known for. Definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal to dry... but with this it felted like a desert, if you don&#x27;t like powdery finishes&lt;br /&gt;then skip this one... It Made my pores look large and set into wrinkles...  is very noticeable that I&#x27;m wearing make up...&lt;br /&gt;Is not the worse foundation that I&#x27;ve ever tried but I will not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The Coverage is good...&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cakey, powdery look&lt;br /&gt;Not buildable&lt;br /&gt;bad for dry skin</li>
            <li> Not nearly as oily as I used to be, I still have the T-zone area that keeps makeup from lasting. I was (am) hoping to find a makeup that can go on and actually last more than a couple of hours without needing a touch-up, but this is not it. First of all, it doesn&#x27;t even want to go on my nose other than to sit in my pores and look sheer over the rest of it. After a couple of tries I was able to get it on well enough that some mineral makeup covered up what was lacking, but it still didn&#x27;t pass the long-wearing test. To make matters worse, it makes my cheeks look chalky and it really accentuates the creases by the side of my mouth. I hardly used any of the foundation in those areas but it certainly brought out the worst! Very disappointed in this product that boasts good coverage and wearability.</li>
            <li> Good foundation. A little oily on my skin, but provides great coverage. I purchased a lighter tone for highlight and contour, and it works well. If you have oily skin, this may make your skin shine after a few hours despite its claim that states otherwise. It has SPF 20, so is a good buy for daily use.</li>
            <li> This foundation is AMAZING for oily skin, it last all day on the skin has a great coverage and feels light on the skin, also very happy with the shade it fits perfectly my fair skin (mac nw15)I sincerely recommend it for people with oily skin that look for long lasting foundation!</li>
            <li> Love this foundation. I&#x27;ve heard plenty of positive comments about it on beauty blogs so I decided to give it a try. It does offer good coverage. I have some spots and scars and it does a good job covering many of them -- though the worst ones would truly only vanish with a laser -- but my face looks a lot better with this product. It does set faster than some other foundations or tinted moisturizers, but apply and blend it quickly; touch up with powder, and you&#x27;re good to go. For the price and what it does, it&#x27;s a great value. Plus there&#x27;s no strong scent, which is an added bonus to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is supposed to have a primer and concealer in addition to being a foundation.  I thought this would be great for covering my pores and acne-prone skin.  Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t.  While it didn&#x27;t emphasize the very fine lines I have around my eyes, it was very streaky and seemed to emphasize every pore on my face.  If this wasn&#x27;t bad enough, I immediately got a huge zit near my chin after wearing it one time. I don&#x27;t believe this is a coincidence, because my acne has been well-managed using Boscia&#x27;s BB cream.  I&#x27;ve seen rave reviews for this product, but I&#x27;d warn against it if you are oily, acne-prone, and/or have big pores.</li>
            <li> Degree of moisture is enough, but also a good concealer functions very much like</li>
            <li> I loved the texture, the finish, and the staying power of this foundation.  I put it on at 11 in the morning and its still there without barely a touch up at 11 at night.  However, within about 15 minutes, the formula darkens a shade or two, giving you ugly makeup mask face.  I tried adding primer underneath, thinking maybe blocking out oil might help, but no.  I would say that you could go a shade or two lighter, so that when it darkens it matches your skin tone, but the lightest shade they have is perfect for me before oxidization kicks in, so that doesn&#x27;t help me, but hopefully it helps some of y&#x27;all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just to be positive LOVE the pump!  The packaging overall is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some to note: the foundation is very similar to revlon colorstay in staying power, finish, and consistency, although I think it may actually have better coverage as it is a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of positive reviews of this product, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try...and I was very pleased.  It covered very well with a nice, even, matte finish, yet felt light and comfortable on my skin, not dry or tight at all as some long-wearing foundations can be.  I even tapped on a little extra under my eyes as concealer, since that&#x27;s supposed to be a part of its 3-in-1 properties, and I didn&#x27;t need a separate concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It indeed was long-wearing, I even slept with it on and it looked fine, even though I&#x27;m a side-sleeper and my face is pressed against the pillow.  It also passed the hot California summer sweat test, except that it does wear off a little where my sunglasses touch my face when I&#x27;m perspiring.  I don&#x27;t mark it down for that, however, since I&#x27;ve never found a foundation that can avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation, I have oily/mixed skin and also sensitive, this is great. My skin has a good finish and is not shiny, I wouldn&#x27;t say it lasts all day, but its better than most of the foundations I have tried. Doesn&#x27;t provide full coverage as other but I think it offers many good qualities. This is my new favorite foundation, and believe me I tried a lot, and lost lots of money buying them. This is a winner product.</li>
            <li> I am regular Covergil product user and this new foundation takes the cake for me! I was normally using the Clean Collection with oil con control user, but with this 3 in 1 foundation, it&#x27;s great. I don&#x27;t have to put on any concealer at all, my T-zone area where I always perspired through the makeup is not visible. I very rarely have to touch my face in the two weeks I have been using it. My skin continues to look flawless! I recommend any woman to try the Stay Fabulous foundation.</li>
            <li> I like it and my skin feels clean and even.</li>
            <li> This is the only review I have ever felt compelled to write because all I can say is - Amazing Foundation! Over the years, I have used countless drug store and department store foundations and primers to try and combat my oily t-zone. Within an hour of using all other foundation/primer combinations, I needed to use oil absorbing sheets and more powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is true to its word and does \\&quot;outlast - stay fabulous\\&quot; all day. I do not even need to use oil absorbing sheets or more powder even once throughout the day. I can use this foundation as is for great coverage or mix it with moisturizer for lighter coverage. It also pairs well with the Covergirl Simply Ageless Concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I finally found a product that works!</li>
            <li> This is the best drugstore foundation I have tried yet. I used a sponge applicator and used maybe half a pea sized amount covered my entire face. I have sun spots and redness and this foundation covered every bit of it. I have fair skin and this color blended perfectly and doesn&#x27;t look fake. It does not sink into my pores, which I was worried about since I have combination skin/T-zone problems. I was VERY impressed after trying this, and it is difficult for a liquid foundation to impress me.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in covergirl. It was oily and it did NOT blend at all! Clumpy and separated on my nose.. I am pretty upset that covergirl made such a terrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping on this item was great though!</li>
            <li> Since Max Factor decided to stop making the world&#x27;s greatest foundation, and since Maybelline discontinued their water-based faux-natural line of acceptable substitutes, I decided to try this Cover Girl foundation. I had been using Cover Girl&#x27;s \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; foundation, which was a product that excelled it being mediocre: it did its job, provided coverage, cost $5 at Target, and, like a Applebee&#x27;s entree, fell right into the realm of \\&quot;it&#x27;ll do\\&quot; without being horrible or great. The bottle was making me crazy, however, since it seemed design to give me enough foundation for a week every time I tried to use it. This one had a pump, plus, three in one! I can put three things on my face ALL AT THE SAME TIME? SIGN ME UP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how this product works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smear it on my face, where it doesn&#x27;t blend, just smears around and turns me an odd yellowish color. Since I bought the same shade I use in other Cover Girl products, this was an interesting discovery. Still I persevered. I smeared that yellowish foundation all over my face and tried to force it to blend. It didn&#x27;t. Eventually, it settled down into my pores to fill each one with yellowy foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t exactly the look I was going for. I suppose, if one wants to rebel against the trend today to minimize pores and fine lines, this would be a place to start. This foundation knows you have pores. It will find them. It will clog them. It will do so with an odd yellowy tint that is outside the range of human skin tones. That yellowy green color is really in right now, though, so at least that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is the makeup the Wicked Witch wore when Dorothy threw water on her and she melted into a pile of goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man, I was so prepared to sing the praises of this makeup. It has good coverage and the color actually matches my face (not too pink, not too yellow, but I understand that issue is a personal one since not everyone has my same skin tone). It even lasts well when you&#x27;re doing...well, nothing. I even took a nap and the application was still perfect by the time I woke up. It doesn&#x27;t cake or sink into pores (as long as you haven&#x27;t moisturized too heavily), it doesn&#x27;t feel overly dry on my face, and all this while still covering the red spots on my acne prone face and not breaking me out. This makeup makes me look like I have flawless skin (HAH), and I thought this is it, this is the one, I have finally found the product that I can stick with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I got water on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I understand this is not an issue everyone cares about, which is why I rated this product four stars. But I&#x27;m telling you I have worn a TON of foundations in search of my One True Color, and of all the products I&#x27;ve worn this one stands up to water the least. I mean, I barely splashed my face and the product vanished like my cat at bath time. Now I don&#x27;t know, some people who place more value in their ability to wipe off their makeup at the end of the night might rate that a plus. But I work a physical job that has me sweating bullets ten minutes into my shift, so waterproof, or at least water resistant, is important for me and something I&#x27;ve sort of come to expect from a makeup that advertises itself as &#x27;longwear.&#x27; Now I know better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ll still use this product, and I&#x27;ll probably finish off the bottle, and if there&#x27;s ever a sale I may even buy this product again. But I definitely won&#x27;t be wearing it for work, the beach, a wedding (seriously do NOT cry in this stuff!) or any other place where I might risk getting water on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for full, long lasting coverage, who doesn&#x27;t mind that at the first hint of moisture the color will melt from your face faster than you can say &#x27;I&#x27;ll get you, my pretty...&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for years, and I hope they never quit making it!  Fabulous coverage!  I have very uneven skin color around my nose and cheeks and my complexion is light; this product conceals so I don&#x27;t have to put a concealer on my face.  That saves both time and money, and it not only goes on easily, but it looks great!</li>
            <li> I just love this foundation for so many reasons it&#x27;s probably one of my all time favorites!! I probably couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff, it literally lasts forever. If you want a more in depth I have a full review on my blog [...]</li>
            <li> Absolute perfection! Comparable to Estee Lauder Double Wear. I actually prefer this cover girl foundation!! Lightweight, buildible, oil control, long lasting, etc. Will never be out of this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of foundations looking for one that didn&#x27;t melt by noon. I even tried several of the high end brands. After reading the reviews for Outlast on Amazon, I decided to try it. I now have it arriving regularly so I don&#x27;t run out. I&#x27;m very fair and this comes in my shade, which most others do not. Best of all it really lasts and stays shine free. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This foundation works pretty much as advertised, surprisingly. It is very easy to apply, and has good coverage. The color I chose (Ivory) matches my skin almost perfectly. The texture is not oily at all, which is a big relief since my skin is already oily enough on its own. However, it did not make a huge difference in how my skin looks already. Also, it seems that I have to use several pumps of the foundation to get it to actually cover my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a pretty good product but could use some improvement. Pros: Good coverage, Not Oily. Cons: Takes a lot to cover entire face, Doesn&#x27;t Make Huge Difference In Skin.</li>
            <li> This foundation works really good, but it does have some down sides. For one, it seems to dry super quick. So unless you&#x27;re quick with your applicator or fingers, this is going to look a little off. It covers well, but is a little thin. I cover up my naturally red cheeks and it does well. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product ( like everything else I&#x27;ve owned by CG) and will indeed buy it again!</li>
            <li> I freaking LOVED this stuff, but it broke me out :(  Probably the silicones.  If you don&#x27;t have such sensitivities, I HIGHLY recommend for it&#x27;s beautiful long lasting finish.</li>
            <li> Great coverage but a bit thick / heavy.</li>
            <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;This product is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on thin and light.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to find a color that works for my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;It feels very cheap. I know that&#x27;s hard to quantify, but you can tell that it&#x27;s a lower end product.&lt;br /&gt;It has a thin consistency, but it&#x27;s not smooth or nice to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for my skin, but it might work for teens with oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line (in my opinion):There is so much better out there for the same price.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin and I really loved this product.  I saw a lot of review for this product on YouTube, so I thought I would give it a try.  It gives you medium to full coverage.  The finish is matte.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.  In fact, I feel like I&#x27;m wearing nothing.  I don&#x27;t use a primer or powder with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I got the medium beige color which matches my skin tone pretty well.  It looks like it is too light when I first put it on.  After a few minutes, it looked perfect.  That was the general consensus on youtube as well.  I usually get medium beige colors in makeup, and this one looked great!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this foundation a little less than the Ready, Set, Gorgeous, but it&#x27;s still good. It really is pretty tenacious at staying on one&#x27;s face, but I&#x27;ve had some issues with this particular formula getting a little weird when coupled with my moisturizer, so I&#x27;m trying it in different combinations. You know how with some moisturizers and foundations, you get a binding effect, so that the foundation seems to shift in patches or ball up? I&#x27;ve had that happen. I&#x27;ve tried it with both sponge and brush application, and decided that it&#x27;s likely to be the type of moisturizer I&#x27;m using that just doesn&#x27;t jive with this particular formula. I&#x27;m not giving up on though, because when it does go smoothly, it&#x27;s great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update! I did try using a different moisturizer with this foundation and had no weirdness in the application. I suspect that the problem lies with the serum types that have silicones or dimethicones in them. I previously compared this foundation with the Ready, Set, Gorgeous and I still think that they are very similar, but this formula seems a little more moist and doesn&#x27;t dry down and set quite as fast, so you can really blend it or layer it as needed. I have not had issues with this foundation rubbing off as some others have mentioned, but then I always, always, set my foundation with a finishing powder and some silica powder to blur fine lines and absorb sebum. There is no foundation I use that I don&#x27;t set with a bit of finishing powder or even mineral foundation powder on top. I can&#x27;t stand that wet face look!</li>
            <li> Depending how you apply it, this foundation goes on great, and can apply from light to a heavier coverage. I use it with a primer and it stays on well and isn&#x27;t streaky or oily feeling at all...love this foundation!</li>
