            <li>They loved them!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a great hit.</li>
            <li>This one is great.</li>
            <li>The shipping time took longer than I would have liked and</li>
            <li>It is very fun and does a great job brushing.</li>
            <li>Great novelity brush, son wes excited to decorate it.  </li>
            <li>He loved to decorate it and being a powered toothbrush he was able to get a better cleaning each night.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than Playdoh, good for their teeth, and lots of fun to create and use, while they lasted!]</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a great brush to see if your child is interested in and will use an electric brush.</li>
            <li>My kids love these.</li>
            <li>And, I can get the job done faster, and better, since it&#x27;s a rotating electric toothbrush.   </li>
            <li>He really enjoyed picking out the stickers we wanted to use to decorate it.  </li>
            <li>We love this.</li>
            <li>If the battery had lasted longer, it would&#x27;ve been much better.</li>
            <li>The kids will need help getting the stickers out to put on the brush because they don&#x27;t peel off easily but the stickers are cute and the kids love em.</li>
            <li>Bought for my once removed children who really like it and enjoy brushing with it, I would say that it is a great product.</li>
            <li>They enjoy personalizing them and I enjoy them brushing their teeth without arguing!</li>
            <li>The screw that holds the battery compartment gets stripped too easily.</li>
            <li>The spinbrush is fine, it just didn&#x27;t come in time for Christmas like it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>when the brush arrived it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Bought another and it died quickly too.</li>
            <li>This son particularly wanted his own My Way brush that was unique to him, but not pink or girly.</li>
            <li>Awesome and fun, but too expensive.</li>
            <li>We have made it a reward to be able to pick out a sticker and put it on the toothbrush...but only if he does not cry or fight during brushing.</li>
            <li>My son, 7yr, is still in the first stickers</li>
            <li>A normal tooth brush isn&#x27;t as much fun.</li>
            <li>This has worked really well so far.   </li>
            <li>addendum, these didn&#x27;t last too long, mostly because my kids kept dropping them, when they were turned on (into the running water and the pooled water below).</li>
            <li>I carefully selected this version after viewing the pictures and reading all of the other reviewers that mentioned &amp;#34;son&amp;#34; &amp;#34;son&amp;#34; and more &amp;#34;son,&amp;#34; since my daughter already had this pink version and loved it, and my other son had a Spiderman Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>My guys put almost the entire package of stickers on the brush stacking them on top of each other on their brushes so that not an inch shows.</li>
            <li>but I was lazy and my kids love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>This has a pretty short life span.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product looking for a better solution for my 5 yr old little GIRL!</li>
            <li>We have since switched to Sonicare and love it for the little ones for its efficiency, quiet vibration, and timer.</li>
            <li>This completely stopped working after one week of use.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old LOVES this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My son is 7 years old and needed to bring it up a notch when it came to using a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>NOT A LITTLE BOY.</li>
            <li>Be willing to risk an entirely pink and rainbow Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>Finally, something that makes my stubborn 2 year old brush his teeth easier.</li>
            <li>The button to turn the brush on is nice and big and can either be pushed up to keep it on or pushed a little to make it pulse and stop (not sure if this is an on-purpose feature or just how ours works).  </li>
            <li>I only gave this 4 stars, since the brush is not changeable, and I will have to buy a whole new toothbrush in a few months.   </li>
            <li>Cool but pretty useless.</li>
            <li>Think it was just a little too much water for the electric parts (which of course aren&#x27;t meant to be submerged, if only briefly).</li>

            <li> This completely stopped working after one week of use. When I went to replace the batteries it was impossible to get the little screw out. I have contacted the manufacturer and am waiting for a reply.</li>
            <li> Be willing to risk an entirely pink and rainbow Spinbrush. I carefully selected this version after viewing the pictures and reading all of the other reviewers that mentioned &amp;#34;son&amp;#34; &amp;#34;son&amp;#34; and more &amp;#34;son,&amp;#34; since my daughter already had this pink version and loved it, and my other son had a Spiderman Spinbrush. This son particularly wanted his own My Way brush that was unique to him, but not pink or girly. No such luck. I&#x27;m going to try to contact the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> My kids love these. Only toothbrush I buy. They enjoy personalizing them and I enjoy them brushing their teeth without arguing!</li>
            <li> Finally, something that makes my stubborn 2 year old brush his teeth easier. He is still not a huge fan of tooth brushing time, but this has made it SOOOO much easier. And, I can get the job done faster, and better, since it&#x27;s a rotating electric toothbrush.   We have made it a reward to be able to pick out a sticker and put it on the toothbrush...but only if he does not cry or fight during brushing. This has worked really well so far.   I only gave this 4 stars, since the brush is not changeable, and I will have to buy a whole new toothbrush in a few months.   I recommend ths for easier toddler toothbrushing time!</li>
            <li> Died after a month, changing battery did not fix it. Designs that came with ours were lame.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old LOVES this toothbrush.  He really enjoyed picking out the stickers we wanted to use to decorate it.  It is very fun and does a great job brushing.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a kindergartner and some toddlers and it was a big hit. The kids will need help getting the stickers out to put on the brush because they don&#x27;t peel off easily but the stickers are cute and the kids love em. Dinosaurs, sports, airplanes and letters to add their names, among others (girls&#x27; brush has dog, kitty, flowers, stars, etc.) I bet some children just put a couple stickers on theirs. My guys put almost the entire package of stickers on the brush stacking them on top of each other on their brushes so that not an inch shows. The button to turn the brush on is nice and big and can either be pushed up to keep it on or pushed a little to make it pulse and stop (not sure if this is an on-purpose feature or just how ours works).  For the money (and granted we&#x27;ve only had em a week), it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[An addendum, these didn&#x27;t last too long, mostly because my kids kept dropping them, when they were turned on (into the running water and the pooled water below). Think it was just a little too much water for the electric parts (which of course aren&#x27;t meant to be submerged, if only briefly). I would still buy them again or give them as gifts. Cheaper than Playdoh, good for their teeth, and lots of fun to create and use, while they lasted!]</li>
            <li> I have been giving these as presents for our kids&#x27; close friends for the past 2 years. They&#x27;re a great hit.</li>
            <li> Could have gotten it for half the price at a local store but I was lazy and my kids love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The spinbrush is fine, it just didn&#x27;t come in time for Christmas like it was supposed to. The toothfairy had to bring it instead!</li>
            <li> Got this as a Halloween gift for my employees child after finding the girls version at CVS.  They loved them!</li>
            <li> We love this. My son, 7yr, is still in the first stickers and I guess it will take a while till we go through all of them. Also, the brush itself keeps its form and cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> My stepson got one for Christmas and really loves using this everyday. A normal tooth brush isn&#x27;t as much fun.</li>
            <li> Bought for my once removed children who really like it and enjoy brushing with it, I would say that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great novelity brush, son wes excited to decorate it.  As with any low in electronic toothbrush, does not allow replacement head.</li>
            <li> The screw that holds the battery compartment gets stripped too easily. It&#x27;s a teeny tiny screw...also the batteries don&#x27;t last that long in them. I like this brush though because of the small spinning head. Especially for my toddlers small teeth.</li>
            <li> Battery died after a few days! Bought another and it died quickly too. And it&#x27;s impossible to put new batteries in it. Cool but pretty useless. We have since switched to Sonicare and love it for the little ones for its efficiency, quiet vibration, and timer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product looking for a better solution for my 5 yr old little GIRL! The shipping time took longer than I would have liked and when the brush arrived it worked just fine. Wrong stickers seeing as my little one is a girl... NOT A LITTLE BOY. PLEASE NOTE IT MAKES A SLIGHTLY WEIRD NOISE. NOT LOAD JUST ODD. LIKE A SMALL DRILL. But all in all it will get her thru this school year.</li>
            <li> Awesome and fun, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> My son is 7 years old and needed to bring it up a notch when it came to using a toothbrush. This one is great. He loved to decorate it and being a powered toothbrush he was able to get a better cleaning each night.</li>
            <li> The battery died after only couple of weeks and we couldn&#x27;t replace it because of the totaly destroyed screw.&lt;br /&gt;Called the company but as of now (month later) still didn&#x27;t get any response. Bad product, even worst costumer service!&lt;br /&gt;Ordered the Sonicare and kept the stickers so my son can decorate something more useful (the stickers are the only part that gets 5 stars :-(</li>
            <li> This has a pretty short life span. For the price, it&#x27;s a great brush to see if your child is interested in and will use an electric brush. I&#x27;m not excited about the waste produced with brushes that need to be thrown out- the battery and head can&#x27;t be replaced on this. If the battery had lasted longer, it would&#x27;ve been much better. I think we only used it about a month. That being said, he caught strep throat and we were told to change our toothbrushes out anyways.</li>
